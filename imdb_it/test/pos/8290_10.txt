CHIPMUNK'S ADVENTURE <br /> <br /> There are some movies I could see for life and I never get tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was a 1987 attempt to bring old favorites to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. At a time when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office, THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE stands as one of the best animated films that Disney did not produce in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and elementary, with Alvin, Simon and Theodore competing in a race around the world with the Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor and Brittany). However, since squirrels encounter exotic dangers, they are not aware of being the pawns of a large diamond robbery. <br /> <br /> CHIPMUNK'S ADVENTURE has never been and will never be a film that flies thanks to a compelling storyline. And for people who have not loved it as a child, the film will probably no longer be a pleasant, yet forgettable animated film. But for me, it will always be a little-known masterpiece. Something from the movie clicks on me in a way that few films do. <br /> <br /> Each song is fun, cheerful and harmless. Highlights include the Chipettes in a slightly bold Arabic dance to calm snakes. There is also a very sweet song in which the Chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we can see them in the main points of reference around the world. One thing about Chipmunk's characters is that, despite the potentially annoying rumor, songwriters have always managed to write songs that were eye-catching without being strident. This film is no exception ... actually it boasts one of the best soundtracks of animated films of the 80s, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Each line is nice, sincere and fun. The pieces among the bad guys and a spoiled puppy are very funny. And the shock of seeing the Chipettes almost forced to marry by an emperor child is the same. The play manages to play constantly to children so as not to lose anything, but everything remains fascinating for adults with enough nostalgia to entertain them. <br /> <br /> It is really just a fun journey that is completely humble in its ambitions. CHIPMUNK'S ADVENTURE never aims to be anything more than harmless fun. I will be the first to admit that this review is partial because I have such a nostalgic passion for THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I would never be able to give it a negative review ... but nevertheless, it fills me with such childish satisfaction as you watch it. Everyone has his favorite favorite from childhood that nobody knows, and for me it's this movie. And every movie I can watch over and over, whether it's 5, 12, 23 years old or more, is a great movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
