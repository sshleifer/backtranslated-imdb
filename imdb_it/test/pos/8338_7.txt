Charles "Chic" Sales is absolutely formidable as the only member of the Leeds family who wants to testify against a gangster has seen a policeman and an informant killed. He fought at Bull Run in the civil war and his patriotism runs high, even after his son-in-law was beaten and one of his grandchildren was kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all the other members. The fear of the death of his nephew is not an excuse, he says. He wouldn't want his nephew to live in a gangster-run country anyway. The conflict between civic duty and personal security is clearly guided in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also a leading exponent as the district lawyer who harshly leads the family's perjury threat if he does not support their identification of the killer in court. The rest of the cast, including the squalid killer, Ralph Ince, are all excellent, and the film is directed by William A. Wellman. There is also good suspense, as sales disappear just as the process is about to begin.
