This film is a great movie. The film shows so many themes in one fantastic film. The driving lessons focus on Ben (Rupert Grint), a shy 17 year old who is about to come of age. The film tells how Ben is fed up with his dominant mother and how he wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, with whom he has a very special bond. The two embark on a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what relationship he and Evie share. This is the movie you watch alone or with someone else. No matter what, you will hear all that Ben plays in the film. It is a film that warms your heart and makes you think if your driving lessons were ever so exciting or as a journey like Ben's lessons.
