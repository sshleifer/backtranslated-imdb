I knew almost nothing about this movie until I had the chance to rent it. It was a very pleasant surprise. The cast is excellent, including Matthau, who I don't normally care about. He is a credible romantic leader. Hawn is a sweet idiot and Bergman is touching himself like a woman coming out of her shell.
