I just saw the DVD and I loved it. In particular, I thought that the director and Jude and Nicole did an extraordinary job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a movie. I thought it was essential to set the tone for the rest of the film; he was able to make credible that Inman and Ada would walk / wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever really having a relationship. I thought the film handled this crucial point of the plot much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will be ready to name other film basins that are the best of this, but this is for me! Jude and Nicole had shown incredible chemistry in the few scenes they had together.
