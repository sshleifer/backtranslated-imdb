Chucky is back, but this time it's not scary (a lot) - but it's fun! <br /> <br /> When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old garbage girl, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and even turns her into a doll. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk !! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie - it's a lot of fun. It's scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
