This is a fun and intelligent movie and deserves your time. In my opinion it is much better than American Pie and other films of the same genre that seem to be put out of play all the time. I hadn't heard of this movie, so I guess he didn't get much publicity, which is a shame. He does not take himself too seriously but at the same time conveys a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important ... Unlike a film about a group of desperate guys trying to fuck for the first time and a guy sticks his d ** k in a cake, but in the end everyone sits up and complains ... One thing that struck me was the soundtrack which was really fantastic and not the usual pop American-tacky punk ... Actually they had a real punk of that day like the Ramones ... This in itself made the movie better! To be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the goodness of his play.
