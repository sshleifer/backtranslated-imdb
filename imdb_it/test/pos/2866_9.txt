This movie was awesome! I saw him on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While making the first credits, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this film. They are the ones who made that stupid Wolf Creek movie, which was totally gay! When we saw it, we groaned. We thought it would be like Wolf Creek, but we were really wrong! The film was not only better than Wolf Creek (which isn't all that difficult) it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time! They really redeemed themselves with this movie. He was bloody, intelligent and scary, which are the combinations of a fantastic horror film. Kane is as fantastic as Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble, and Luke Pegler did a good job as part of a group of thugs who cleaned an old motel. He had some rough scenes and in fact you feel sad for some of the people who die. All in all, a great horror film to watch on Friday or Saturday night with the lights off and with friends. Just don't look at it in a hotel.
