It is always interesting to catch a joke in a film that ends up being a little prophetic for an actor's future. In this case, I was intrigued by the statement by Edward G. Robinson to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the Valley", while discussing the solitary retentions for her attempt to control all the land in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck would have been the matriarch of the Barkley family in "The Big Valley". Somehow I thought it might have looked older in the previous photo; I imagine that all those bright clothes and fancy dresses have a way to bring out the youthful side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary line above, this is the assessment of Lee Wilkison of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those hold out mentioned earlier, shortly after Parrish uses his tactical knowledge soldiers to extract a certain number of Wilkison hands after ransacking his ranch and burning his house. I liked the way the film explored his character, starting with the way he tackled the master builder Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. Even the ambush set-up was a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of attacking the baddies head on, with both sides competing for the last standing man. This is why Parrish also has something to say: "Never meet the enemy on his own terms". <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" is a good title for this film, and was probably at the head of his class in the mid-1950s, although by today's standards he does not come close to blood by letting him find in a "Tombstone" or "Open Range", where the bullets hesitate a nasty ferocity. But it is shaped by excellent interpretations of the principals, with a sub-plot that explores infidelity that seems almost ironic considering that it was Stanwyck's character to cheat.
