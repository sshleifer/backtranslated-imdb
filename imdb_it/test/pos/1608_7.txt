In the film Death in Venice by Luchino Visconti, it is not only the beauty of the surrounding world that decays, but in the search for beauty itself, Gustav von Aschenbach turns into a simple shell of a man. To understand decadence, we must recognize the beauty that enchants us, is best described, and explained in a quote by Socrates found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice, "beauty alone, is beautiful and visible at the same time? L "the only aspect of the spiritual that we can perceive through our senses. Otherwise, if the divine, if reason, virtue and truth speak to us through the senses, we should not perish and become consumed by love? We see in the film that this thing it happens, the man becomes wrapped in a desire for beauty, which turns into a desire for the boy, Tadzio, even if the most balanced part of his mind tells him that the adoration of beauty can lead to sensuality and abandonment , cannot contain itself. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe it as a beautiful film, we soon see the extravagance of the living room, and we are treated to a perfect summary of the bourgeois life of the beginning of the century, all the captured perfectly by the filmmaker Pasqualino De Santis. But Visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are relegated to the past. The city we know of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff. The streets become exhausting labyrinths full of disgusting dirt and rot, the city decays in step with the protagonist. Only through flashbacks is it possible to see why this famous composer is a fragile and harmless man. The death of his daughter, and presumably his wife, along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach has in-depth conversations about the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter ego, and what Alfred says articulates the composer's doubts and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip of Alfred telling him that he is weak, alienated and devoid of feelings. In the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all. It's a memory decay, rather than the objective renderings of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are ruined memories because even Aschenbach alludes to it, he declares, "reality distracts us and degrades us;" and, following the scene in the travel agent's office, we see Aschenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them - leave Venice, but immediately after the meeting we see him sitting again with the clerk and realizes that it was all in his imagination, which for a long time uses scenes without dialogues that are framed by the poignant music of Gustav Mahler. It allows the viewer's mind to wander as we observe Aschenbach's life and respectability decay with the beauty that surrounds him. <br /> <br /> Slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by the exhaustion that mixes with a growing awareness that the city is suffocating in the dirt. The ruined city prepares the stage for the attraction of the middle-aged man to Tadzio, is the romantic nostalgia of something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, not even in the imagination. The beauty of this Polish boy lights a fire in him that, at the beginning, makes him shine, then consumes him. The film ends with von Aschenbach sitting weakly on a deck chair watching Tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black dye from his hair running down his cheek and it looks like rotten blood, it is a vision of the life moments of his life , although before his last breath. The final decay happened, everything around him the city is dirty, and with it has become what he hates. While he dies Aschenbach has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film, a man who had disturbed him. It was the search for beauty that began its decadence, in pursuit of artistic beauty that could not perceive its own disappearance, and that of the city that surrounded it; his sensuality is indulgent, while constantly kept under control by the presence of death and decay. These are the three themes that bind together The Damned and Death in Venice, beauty, death and decadence, these themes are the art of Visconti, the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this film we are treated to the deliquescence of a great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Aschenbach in the search for true and pure beauty, and it is in pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable and solitary death that observes the target of his affection. I believe that through these films Visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last. Decadence is intrinsic to the world around us and when we become distracted, it can destroy splendor. In Death in Venice, it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that everything is erased. Beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in Visconti's works, both beautiful and destructive at the same time, these are the themes that define her art.
