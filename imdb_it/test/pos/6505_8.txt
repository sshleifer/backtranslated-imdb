Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From that description of a line in the film you would have no idea how fun and educational this little movie is. It is a joyful and vibrant celebration of a fresh little-known subculture. It's full of underground hip hop music and you can see some of the best DJs (such as DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from Beastie Boys) showing off their stuff. Entering the film I was not sure that "scratching" could really be called an art form, or that the turntable could be seen as a stand-alone instrument. Scratch has completely changed my mind about these points. What these guys do with their turntables is really amazing - it's definitely a kind of art - and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be turned into an instrument that you can "play", as much as a drum or a guitar. And you can also have a lesson on the basics of DJ Q-Bert scratching (for example, how to use the fader to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after seeing Herbie Hancock perform his song "Rock It" (remember that song, don't you?) Live at the Grammy. What caught their attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and his scratch. Not only is Scratch able to scratch, but it also does some scratching thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. There are moments when the clips are quickly "rewound" and then "forwarded" several times, which mirrors (in the middle of the film) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the disc on his turntable back and forth while using his fader ( what a wicka-wicka sound "). Whether you're a hip hop fan or not, you can count on Scratch to give you a very fun night at the cinema. After seeing it, I had the itch to go buy a turntable of my own property, and I mean this as a compliment.
