Assy McGee is a show for which you must be really a certain age to appreciate. Otherwise, it is likely that you will miss the reference to the 80s detective films and simply think that it is a gag running on a traveling rectum. Do you think it's a mindless and childish poop humor? Go watch the Stallone movie 'Cobra' and see what I mean. This show actually has a very subtle humor, which says a lot, both for a show broadcast in adult costume, and for a show on a walking donkey. <br /> <br /> All the clich√©s of the standard genre have been created films like Dirt Harry and Cobra so big and ripe for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner, who is - like the gender - head down and constantly apologizing for his partner's murderous behavior. The police chief is, of course, a hard case that breathes the fire that lives to scream "I want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning!" The exaggerated, and sometimes quite meaningless, way in which the film "Renegade Cop" from the 1980s is parodied, fits the topic well. For example, while they break a bus robbery, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy: "Hey, where are you going, asshole !?" To which the title character takes the cover: "I'm going ... to shoot you." <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for all those who love action movies from the 1980s, and have seen enough to understand humor.
