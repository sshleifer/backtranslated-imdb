SPOILERS Every major regime uses the country's media for its own purposes. Both the Nazi ban on some leaflets and the Chinese televised alternative of Tianamen Square, governments have tried to influence people through different means since the beginning of time. In 1925, however, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the Russian communist government supported the creation of this film, Battleship Potempkin. An important piece of film history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> Placed aboard the Battleship Potempkin, the crew is unhappy. In poor living conditions and with larva-infested food, they are angry with their suppressors in the upper classes. But now, after the rotten food, enough is enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew members turn to their masters and fight for their freedom. <br /> <br /> As for propaganda, "Battleship Potempkin" is perfect. Presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful, communist mutiny, the film was a useful Soviet instrument. Eighty years after the release of the films, and the USSR has completely disappeared from the map. The surprising thing about this film is that while the country to which its message was destined has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. True, it is far from what we now consider "entertainment", but the film is a beautiful masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the scenes aboard the boat or the scene often discussed in the Odessa passes, everything about this movie is done perfectly. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is impeccable, even the acting, although slightly exaggerated, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to criticize the final product of this film. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this film after its release. Praising a country that has not existed for fifteen years, it is difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. As a work of art, it is magnificent. Nice from start to finish, it's far from an easy watch, but it's worth it.
