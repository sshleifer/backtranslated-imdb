I am classifying this film on a curve, in other words, it is not the greatest film ever made, but it does exactly what it was intended to do. This is an excellent T & A movie. I have no idea of ​​the T or A number seen in this film, but I saw a shot with 16 T nude at the same time, just to give you an idea. There are topless girls everywhere. There is a race scene with a wet shirt. And the climax involves a touch football game between two all-girl teams and each time one touchdown the entire opposing team loses a piece of clothing. I don't know why this has such a low score here. Perhaps the people who gave low scores thought they would see Citizen Kane. I love this movie and hope to find other similar ones. If you are looking for a good T & A campy movie, I would recommend this.
