Knute Rockne has led an extraordinary life and his story is told quite well in Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's incredible journey from the young Norwegian boy to the iconic legend of American football. Produced in 1940, the film can sometimes seem a bit dated and sometimes even hokey. And the directors are sometimes a little thick, since Rockne is portrayed in a brilliant and loving way. You might come to think that Rockne should have been nominated for sanctity, when in fact he was, in the end, just a football coach. But it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football and has had a huge impact on the lives of so many young men he trained. This film shows the great impact it has had and gives you an idea of ​​why it is so revered to this day. <br /> <br /> Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien offers an impressive performance. It is unquestionably O'Brien's film to wear and makes his film and character his own. Rockne's true life has been recognized as a great inspirational figure and O'Brien's performance will show you why. The only quibble comes at the beginning of the film when O'Brien, in his forties, plays the college student Rockne in his early twenties. All the makeup of the world would not have made it credible and the effect is rather shocking. But when the character Rockne gets old and starts his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits the part perfectly. As for the rest of the cast, a name pops up and this is, of course, that Ronald Reagan plays the young, charismatic, but ultimately disappeared soccer star George Gipp. In the grand scheme of the film it is not really a big part, with Reagan appearing for no more than 10-15 minutes. But the performance became legendary thanks to the famous "Win one for the Gipper" speech by Reagan. It's a brilliant scene, full of emotions. Reagan may not have been on the screen for a long time in this film, but it certainly had an extremely positive impact on a winning performance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has a balance between football and life in general with Rockne has great lessons for his young people in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare pleasure as the actual archive footage of the Notre Dame games of the Rockne era is scattered throughout the film. It's a rare opportunity to see how the game has evolved over the last six and more decades and the opportunity to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovations put into practice. If you are a fan of Notre Dame you will probably appreciate the fact that Notre Dame Victory March offers a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film. If you're a Notre Dame hate ... well, then you're probably not watching this movie. Knute Rockne All American is a stimulating, uplifting, exciting film. Maybe a little too sentimental, but it's not so bad. It's a very funny movie, it's worth taking the time to see it.
