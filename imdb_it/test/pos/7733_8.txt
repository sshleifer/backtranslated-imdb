I saw this film very similar to that of Skywalker02, but when I was able to see it again and with the formal film formation, psychology and life had time to really take my hand and start beating me, ... I really click with the film. I remember that pay for cable service channels sounded this almost to death, much like the poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular movies. I felt back so it wasn't worth it and the constant "airtime" (I know the cable isn't really on the air), but I was very young and the drama of the adult situation wouldn't work and shouldn't have worked. However, the recent vision of the film illuminated me in the film. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald were probably studying the script together, and I would be a little surprised if Surandon had instructed Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects, although good, do not show potential depth in this role. Surandon nailed his, as did Raul Julia. Cassavette and wife offered acceptable performances, but I will admit that sometimes first-class acting becomes mediocre. A constant ebb and flow towards acting occurs during many scenes, but overall I can understand why the story might require that the dynamics become more subtle. <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't find this film the "take me and drown me" kind, a kind of boredom party like Skywalker02 would have you believe. I think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a little more difficulty in domestic life in a strategic position, together with some film courses, perhaps this film would look different. I would say that if you feel a little melancholy and crave a simpler life, and you've had your share of marital discord between dysfunctional family units, then maybe this movie could provide more insights and entertainment than you might think. I feel it is a classic and I find it much more fun than mainstream films that should share many of the same elements, such as the Terms of Tenderness which, as far as I am concerned, could be stripped of some extraordinary interpretations of Jack Nicholson, then ceremoniously burned up when nothing is left. (How could a film like that get more attention than this.To talk about boredom.) The best thing, don't take the word or someone else's, see the movie and support our industry.
