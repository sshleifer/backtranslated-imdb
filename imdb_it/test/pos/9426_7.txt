Since others have complained about entering Sherlock Holmes in a contemporary context, I won't. Basil Rathbone could have entered into any age with that voice, that savoir faire. This is a well thought-out mystery based freely on "The Dancing Men", one of the best Conan-Doyle stories. Instead of the original plot, it makes men part of a Nazi plot. Holmes becomes a spokesman for the British war effort. His opponent is Moriarity, who seems to die often enough to rival the central figure of the Friday 13 films. He's certainly creative, but Rathbone Holmes is unperturbed. Watson is just for the ride in this. In this film he is not given much stupidity and this is a real advantage. The plot is complex enough to maintain interests. There is a concluding discourse that is almost a parody of himself. But then I cannot be critical of a time and a nation that have been subjected to great resistance. If they needed to call Holmes, so be it.
