I really didn't see it coming. Roy Andersson put me to the test, I'm the perfect sucker for a static camera (long life for King Borowczyk!) And I was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me straight in the eye. You must be a brilliant man to make self-pity fun. Andersson reminds me of the third official of Pequod in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who took his whole life to be a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing on us. And the plot of egotism in this film is really hilarious. <br /> <br /> The level of satire is at the height of the fever, you have a deluded self-critical dreamer who complains about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignores a spiritual self-reflection that cries out in agony. The depths of egotism are fathomed. I never thought it was possible to go beyond Bergman's "Silence" in this sense. However, the grotesque of self-love and self-esteem on the part of every single character in this film is staggering. We are shown an existence in which the naive and idle wanderer against a world they believe has been unfair to them, are indeed legends in their living rooms. Humans in this film make self-deception and self-illusion a great art form! <br /> <br /> Only a woman in the film seems to have some kind of understanding of what is happening. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, kneels praying for the forgiveness of all humanity, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I've ever heard. Through his prayers he reveals that what is wrong in the world must not be repaired by mere tinkering, there are not only a few faults, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be solved by immolation and the day of judgment. Watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, at midnight he stayed alive in a cold river screaming at thousands of Kyrie eleison for the sins of humanity. Another great astonishment is that it is clear that his prayers are futile, and in fact she is stopping all those who return home at closure. <br /> <br /> This is not a film for the smug, no one is spared, no idol has remained on the altar, no group of humans has surrendered to the glory of another group. There has never been a summation of our sins even more transcendent, more surprisingly beautiful. It's a movie for the end of the world, it's the big joke, the great horrible practical joke of human life! <br /> <br /> From the catalog of images it is too difficult to choose a favorite, I slapped my thigh and almost fell out of the chair at the cinema, shouting with laughter as a man tried to pull the tablecloth from under set the service. I won't ruin what happens, but the suspense builds up and something really unexpected happens. It's probably the most fun I've ever seen in a movie theater. I am quite reserved and I can't control myself: this is the measure of the greatness of this film. <br /> <br /> The filming of "You, the Living" is impeccably formalist. We are shown an artist's palette, shabby brown, yellow, gray and sky blue colors staged by the shock of bright brass textures. There is never a tone out of place, it's like an hour and a half of melting symphonic Whistlerian colors. The obsession that must have implemented this combination of colors is extraordinary. And no waste is wasted, as in all great films, there is no spare celluloid thumb. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best film I've ever seen.
