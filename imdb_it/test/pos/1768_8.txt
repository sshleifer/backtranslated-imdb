I like the good things in life as much as anyone, I suppose, but until about five years ago, the work didn't figure in my entertainment choices. Oh, I made some attempts to understand what it was; I had witnessed several television productions - in particular parts of Wagner's Ring Cycle on public television - hoping to understand the fascination of others for the art form. And I knew I liked parts of various works (I remember being surprised as a child that I actually liked the fragments of "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha" and I liked the scenes of the opera in "Moonstruck" and " Pretty Woman "), but unlike the characters in those films, they simply don't" understand ". <br /> <br /> Then in 1995 I saw a live performance of "Rigoletto" presented by the New York City Opera Company, and what a night I "understood". What a wonderful show, glorious in color and music and pure emotion! And I mean the emotion with a capital E! The key, I think, is that opera music allows artists to act excessively freely and credibly in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken. Everything depends on music, of course, and when music is magical, like in " Rigoletto ", a work can be a magnificent spectacle. /> <br /> A nice family member gave me a laserdisc copy of the TV production of the opera of 1982, and I discovered that since I can't see live performance of "Rigoletto" live, this video version it's a great replacement. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the part of the Duke; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his funny jester from court Rigoletto; and the beloved daughter of Rigoletto, Gilda, is played by Edita Gruberova, quite simple. The sets and costumes are sumptuous, and the late river commercials give the story a sense of drama that could never be matched on stage. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen "Rigoletto", or if you think you don't like or understand the work, I urge you to look for it on video tape and buy it or rent it. If you don't like it, if this production of "Rigoletto" doesn't make you appreciate the power of the art form of the work, well, forget it and move on to something else. But I suspect, if you are new to work like me, that you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
