Arriving at the end of the Universal Monsters horror film cycle and before the golden age of science fiction films, House of Dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more glitzy elements that would come to characterize the science fiction films of the next era. Lon Chaney Jr. plays Wolf Man and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, the Frankenstein monster. <br /> <br /> A mad scientist decides to "cure" both monsters of their "diseases" by means of the modern {read: mad} science. When the scientist's beautiful assistant-nurse turns out to be a hunchback at the beginning of the film, the viewer is thus warned that this film will not be typical of Universal; this film foreshadows the kind of petty exploitation that would be taken for granted in the science fiction of 1950. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind the slow pace of old movies and black and white doesn't put you off, this movie is the recommended vision. Afaik, this is not currently available on DVD, but AMC broadcasts it from time to time, so keep an eye on it, or you could always do it on your TiVo!
