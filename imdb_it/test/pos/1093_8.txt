It is by far the most definitive police film I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, direct treatment of the subject, brilliant direction and superb performance (even from those with little work to do in the film). The chemistry between Nana and Don, even if they are professional rivals, is surprising. And so the small events like an insider that don't give Imtiaz information even while being hit in the locker, but only to Nana when she's out. The change in working conditions with the change of the elderly is treated in a wonderful way. The first semester holds one completely absorbed, moving like a documentary with Nana who behaves like a mentor to Jatin explaining the complexity and the philosophy of the work. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the most brilliant films on the Indian cinema police. Definitely not to be missed.
