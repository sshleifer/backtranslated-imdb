This is a masterpiece. 'The Big Snit' is a crazy, strange, exhilarating and finally moving look at an old married couple and their quiet life, fighting to saw and rummage while a nuclear war rages outside. Everything in this great animated short film stands out as memorable: the shaking of the wife's eyes, the vacuuming binge, the husband saw the fetish (keep an eye on those backgrounds!), The very verbal cat, the insane game, the "informative" news anchor, the "beautiful" serenade of the accordion and the moving and memorable ending. I'm so happy to have found "The Big Snit", which is undoubtedly one of the greatest works ever made.
