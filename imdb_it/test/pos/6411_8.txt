In the middle of The Hole I emailed a friend of mine to summarize it. I'm not sure if the movie broke into a series of submissive gestures, I felt a little discouraged to recommend it, but then I saw the ending. It's perfect. I lived in Korea for 6 months, and this film could easily summarize the strange boredom and frustration of every Asian metropolis as it takes Taiwin here. Use the myth of Hong Kong musicals in the same way that Godard or Hartley use Western musicals, but take it to the extreme, it's the gritty world and occasionally Kafka's logic makes it even better. I really feel like the most direct comparison of The Hole is that of Hal Hartley, Surviving Desire, but he looks a little dark compared to those who are hopefully and strangely metaphorical in the end. However, this is what I wrote to Esther. I hope you also like The Hole. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> watching a move called the hole. I think Taiwan is a bit strange for China, unless it's Hong Kong. worth seeing so far. it's a boy and a girl in an apartment complex. the boy's ceiling crashes and the girl starts to get angry and well it is a strange metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure, disintegration and pain of a pretty intense crush. there is also a sort of zombie-virus subtitle and a lot of strange little scenes in which the girl plays her wishes through pretty innocent and funny doo-wop sequences from the 70s. worth a look
