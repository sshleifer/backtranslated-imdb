I saw it for the first time at the theater in 1969 when I was 9 and I immediately fell in love with it. I am sad that Sony has not seen fit to publish it on DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently got a VHS copy of this on eBay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. I am happy to report it, it continues to stand the test of time. The acting is apt, John Williams's orchestrations are lustful and Leslie Bricusse's songs memorable ("When I Am Older", "You and Me", "Fill the World With Love", "London Is London" are just a few of the And not enough to say about Peter O 'Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave and the acting of Michael Bryant Terence Rattigan deserves an A + for his update of the James Hilton story. There really is nothing he doesn't like about this film is a good choice for good humor, glad to have released the original soundtrack as a set of three CDs with many extras, and I wish Sony would hurry up and do the same with the movie.
