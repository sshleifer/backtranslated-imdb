I imagine that those who have been in a one-sided relationship of some sort will first be able to identify with the main character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still in the pink of good health, as shown by her screeching newspaper routine of waking up very early in the morning to prepare his milk delivery job, where he has to drag bottles of Megmilk into a bag on a path around his town like a clock, exchange empty bottles for full ones, and to collect payment and receipt release. And there's always that delivery stop that's right up there that needs to climb a long flight of stairs to reach customer satisfaction. <br /> <br /> It is quite strange, that there has been an arrest that a man with whom he has been in love for almost all his adolescence to adult life, and not having the product appreciated, but poured into the sink. Having gone to the same school, we see that they are not talking to each other, and in their daily lives they always seem so close physically, but yet so far away. There is no visual contact, except for superficial glances by chance, and little recognition of mutual existence. We learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all the notions of being together, in which the clear attraction between the two was hampered by the further development by the previous generation. <br /> <br /> While I thought that Minako was an interesting woman in herself, the one who kept her feelings suppressed for so long, one can only wonder what kind of damage she would do. If I read that the original Japanese title means "At some point the days when you read the books" and it is accurate, I felt that the film had a wonderful ending with that shot of its well-stocked library, probably alluding to the fact that it didn't she is alone after all, and probably had fallen back on her crutch of sorts to face the pain of being alone, and return to a lifestyle she was already used to for 50 years. Besides immersing himself in two works, he has those books that serve as a form of escape, and from time to time he recites little sweet notions to the dedication shows of songs on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did a commendable job as emotionally The strong woman resigned herself to her destiny and her decision not to love anyone else, her object of affection, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character that has more facets. Staying true to the vows of marriage, he spends a significant amount of screen time looking after his sick wife (played by Akiko Nishina) while he juggles with his social work job in the children's affairs department in the town hall. I felt that like a couple without children, work provided them with a means to take care, not for their own, but for the children of others, those in difficulty who are neglected and left to themselves. In a rare moment of anger, we see how he angrily reproaches these rebellious parents who do not appreciate and waste their children's lives. <br /> <br /> The story of Kenji Aoki offers little whims to make his characters attractive and he has successfully attempted to provide many more glimpses and dimensions, as Takanashi is a derogatory poet of Haiku despite being a member of the club Haiku, and the support of characters like the elderly couple Minagawa, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) lent some comic moments even if sad while slowly turning into senile, while his wife Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) tells and leads us through this story love of a single woman at 50. Even the performance of Akiko Nishina as a bedridden wife was simply arrested, with her character enlightened to know her husband's past, and to make unselfish and painful decisions in his sick state. <br /> <br /> It is what you can expect from a typical romantic Japanese movie, without young people, unmarried as star-cros lovers sed, but with all the other elements in place like the romantic settings, the songs of love and those sober but affectionate behaviors. I thought that the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when unrequited love was consumed, but director Akira Ogata managed to avoid the usual melodramatic moments in these stories, although the story required a clear development of the plot in the final act that you can foresee, especially if you have already passed your Romance Movie 101. <br /> <br /> Not being your story mediated by a lovely story, I thought The Milkwoman would tell a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme and, frankly, a recommended love film (even if told at a measured pace) if you are in the right mood to love, reminiscence and try to live without regrets.
