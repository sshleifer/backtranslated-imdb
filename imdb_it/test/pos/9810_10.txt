SPOILER NOTHING MA SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who feel that other viewers don't understand. But no one has ever mentioned the word "s" as far as I have seen. <br /> <br /> While I agree that the child is dead I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. He runs down the slope in an old wagon, shoots from the cliff and ... "flies away". Perhaps the whole description of the form of death is allegory or perhaps commits suicide in a wagon as expected. In both cases, "fly away" (it is not such a harsh metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I only have one thing for Tom Hanks, but I was fine with storytelling. He is also collecting $ for the World War II memorial and you must love him for that. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.
