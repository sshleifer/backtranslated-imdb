I got this movie with my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and I didn't like it at first. It is completely different from the others and is missing, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I like in all the other Austen films: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards seems to sew her fingers together was particularly upsetting. I still don't like watching the sewing scene with my fingers, but I like to hear Mrs R. say, dreamily, while she sews, "My only knowledge ... she snatched my robe." This film is now my current favorite Austen. I've seen it 7 or 8 times so far. In my opinion, acting is incredible. The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from whatever I am doing (sewing, even if not my fingers together, hopefully, or bluster or whatever) to look at the character who utters his lines . It's the turn of expression, the cast of posture, which makes words come to life - this is what makes acting good, as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Well, I look at almost every part of "Northanger Abbey" because almost all the actors play their role with such a charisma. Peter Firth is incredible as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian Fop and true male hero: you are not sure until the end whether he is behind Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of accent (Welsh?). Mr. and Mrs. Richards are fascinating: the combination of their behaviors - in particular the high voice of Mr. Richards, which provides a counterpoint to his wits and wisdom - makes them so real. Even General Tilney is fascinated by the hard-hearted father who could be a murderer. And Captain Tilney, the sneer who is enjoying himself so clearly ... and his sister and brother who shouts money whose names I can't remember at the moment, are perfectly perfect, at the same time, intelligent and harmonious. <br /> <br /> The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all Jane Austen's adaptations. I know this was one of Austen's weaknesses (well, as far as I'm concerned): even if all her novels are love stories, it's hard to think that her heroes and her heroines are really in love at the end. And if they're not really in love, then what's the point? All the other adaptations I've seen (apart from the first Olivier / Garson) have pretty cold fish kisses at the end, if they kiss for nothing. I don't really like sex in movies, but in the end it's necessary to have a sincere kiss. And the final kiss in Northanger is a dozen. <br /> <br /> The exaggerated approach to costumes, music and lighting works very well for me. And the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about gothic romanticism, high life in Bath, Cathy's normal education, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the little black page makes cartwheels. And the Marchioness, I think, was a completely appropriate and very intelligent display device. <br /> <br /> Some have argued that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - she intended to make fun of gothic romanticism, not promote it. But I don't think he meant to put "Mysteries of Udolpho", etc., below. He was only pointing out that it is necessary to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney criticizes Catherine in her mother's room. Moreover, General Tilney was a villain, even if it was prosaic. That point had to be done, surely.
