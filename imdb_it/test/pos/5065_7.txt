The reviews for RENDITION were generally not favorable, so I waited until he moved to the local discount theater to see it. The film tells the story of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an American-Egyptian scientist torn from his international flight and taken to interrogation after a strange coincidence that links him to a recent terrorist attack in a nameless North African country. Not bad as I feared, it is an interesting and stimulating voice in the thriller genre "torn from the titles". <br /> <br /> Finally, the film raises difficult questions about US methods of leveraging information from political prisoners: it is going through the previously uncontrolled line of (openly) employing torture on suspected terrorists, something our country should do? Does it provide useful information that helps to save lives? If yes, at what cost? What kind of monsters do we create when innocent people are taken prisoner and tortured? By authorizing the use of torture, what kind of monster do we become as a nation? It's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some details that make good movies great. For example, I would like to have empathy with Anwar's wife, who spends the entire movie trying to track him down, but the only identifiable feature of the personality she gave is an advanced state of pregnancy. RENDITION also seems to imply that Arab women who do not get along with the arranged marriages of their fathers only ask for trouble, and there is a poorly conceived album held by another of the main characters in the film that too conveniently spells out in great detail the information that his love interest seems to be urgent at that particular time. I laughed out loud when the time should have been full of terror. <br /> <br /> The film features a good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong (but too short) appearances by Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin, as well as the twists and turns of Omar Atwally as Anwar El -Ibrahimi and also the actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, that I would like very much to see in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five or more stories followed by RENDITION are well intertwined, until the directors insert a light but effective twist that finally alludes to the endless cycle of carnage that the violent attacks of terror generate.
