Well, I would say this is a very funny and quite touching film, despite its flaws. I didn't believe for a minute that Matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist. Furthermore, Hawn's character seemed to recover from suicidal depression rather quickly at the beginning of the film. Not to mention the whole thing seemed rather ridiculous. However, the film is successful due to a good rhythm, humor and its stars. Matthau may not be a dentist, but it was fun as usual. Bergman has brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where she and Matthau go out for a drink after work) and also a good dose of humor. I think it was his performance that made my brother see this movie after listening to a couple of scenes. Hawn's performance is noteworthy, although an Oscar may have ended up doing it a little. Basically, don't take this movie too seriously and you'll have fun.
