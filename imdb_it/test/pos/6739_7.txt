This is a fun training comedy that comes from the next, more mature period of Neil Simon's writing. Although there are a lot of jokes to be made, this is not one of those Neil Simon pieces where each character takes out one-liner jokes for 2 hours as if they were guest stars on a Bob Hope special. There are also dramatic elements (some works, some are excessive) that give a little weight to the story. <br /> <br /> The performances are good across the board, especially Blythe Danner as a mother (although she and Judith Ivey were strangely chosen WASP to play Jewish women). I've never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I'll say that it hits the right notes like the hateful, clumsy and totally horned teen-age storyteller / protagonist of the story. <br /> <br /> The film has a tone very similar to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", but the latter is much more imaginative and fun than this.
