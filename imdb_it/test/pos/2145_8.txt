I really don't know why this film received such a hostile reception when it was first released. Of course, it is too long and somewhat free in his depictions of sexuality and violence, but so are many well-regarded films. I don't really think that people who hated "Heaven's Gate" really understood it. "Door of Paradise" in its untrimmed form, very similar to "The deer hunter" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (such as immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the " Americans "" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue. Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be invigorating in contrast to the boring life that Averil leads in the epilogue. Also, since Michael Cimino took a lot of care to make the image historically accurate, it is fascinating as a document of (and perhaps accusation) American life in Old West Wyoming: dialogue is often genuinely intelligent and emotional, combined with great music and cinematography, the film works like a work really poetic art Certainly, "Heaven's Gate", with its refusal to patronize the viewer, is not for everyone's taste. However, Hollywood discovers every year a commercial collapse that is much easier to do. manage as a mind game without meaning (even when an example becomes a success) that "Gate" and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should decide for themselves. <br /> <br />
