A very sweet film about a young Chinese in love with western technology and an Englishman who tries to make his fortune by showing films in China. It's a very interesting story that is supposedly based on real events, although I assume it's more fantasy than real. It has a fabulous quality that you rarely find in real life, and it also has 8 people credited for the script, so they must have invented left and right stuff. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice film that conveys the way the magic movie was aimed at people who had never seen it before. It is not a particularly profound film, which briefly touches on the loss of tradition and the intrusion of Western culture, but above all it is only a pleasant little film. In reality it is a film that I liked very much and that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. Light as a souffl√©, but I loved every minute.
