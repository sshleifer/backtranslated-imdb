Symbolism galore, great melodies, this film has crushed the expectations of the public "soon to be no more". These monks and the naturally selected members of the group, were witnessing a thin face and yet in the face, they greet each other. Today the message sounds true, the cage from which you flee and the bridge from which you want to jump, are the disappointments of the next generation, there will always be new children on the block that will replace those that get rid of chains. The film can be frustrating at times, because the themes that film attacks are so blatantly distant from the American way of life, a person who thinks and reasons cannot help but fix his reflection in the scenes of Head and question himself not only on their personal reasons for continuing the madness of everyday American life, but the motives of those who want to continue for madness. The final scene, similar to the chivalrous audacity of Don Chisciotte's caged tiger to come out in battle, represents how most of the dreams are delirious and impossible.
