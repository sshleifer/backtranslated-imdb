It contains spoilers that I recorded some time ago when it was on PBS but I didn't have the chance to see it (probably due to prejudices about having to attend the 5-6 hours of the Masterpiece Theater, with its BBC created for the production style television (no music, all in one room, no outdoor TV sets ...)) But after seeing the movie Traffic (which I thought was good enough at the time), I couldn't help but dig the tape of Traffik to see what else they could have lingered with the extra boy 2 hours. <br /> <br />, these were my misconceptions about this TV series. It is much more engaging than traffic. The characters are better made so that their actions are more credible. And the whole sub-plot that involves Pakistan completes everyone's whole point of view throughout the supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. In Traffic, the Pakistani story was rewritten and reduced to a good cop against a bad cop plot. <br /> <br /> There have been very significant discussions and debates on alcohol and other forms of drugs, while in Traffic they have become mostly meaningless pass references. The same with social problems, which in Traffik, have been realistically expressed without appearing to be preachers. While in Traffic, the characters spilled it as a statement as in the way they do it in those created for "week of the week" films. <br /> <br /> There was no bad guy against good guy in Traffik, even the trader is portrayed as a junkie who sells to support his habit instead of the kind of "nobody jokes with me" in traffic . <br /> <br /> The only downside is that since I watched the traffic not long before watching this, it was hard not to compare scene by scene, and even though the scenes weren't the same, I knew what it would be the result. Thank God for Pakistani history, which is different enough to allow me to fully enjoy it without thinking about which scene is comparable. Although I was thrown out thinking that the drugs had been melted in the ceramic of the statues in which Helen returned to Germany (as in Traffic's plot). Thank god, Traffik was not so disgusting and far-fetched.
