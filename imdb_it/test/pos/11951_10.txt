I seem to notice that many people have never seen this film, and those who usually dismiss it as garbage ... it's really bad. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, I must admit it was almost one of those people ... thank God I'm patient, otherwise I would never have found a classic. <br /> <br /> As funny as this movie is, it is also a must for anyone who is a fan of 80s movies, or just has a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know there are a lot of people out there who will tell you that this movie is kind of a derivative of Better Off Dead ... so what if it is? Both were excellent films! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
