I saw it when it was screened for the first time and then passed away when it disappeared from the British screens. He showed a different side of ancient Australia that we need to see more. Good juxtaposition of old hand and young turk. So the realism of the hard return was fantastic. It was sadly missed. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard life and hard work. The young idealist clashes with the old practical head. Real Politicka that fights with the young avant-garde of New Labor. Add a modern political vernacular. <br /> <br /> This show was the first of its kind that I came across in what has not tried to do a tourist job in Australia. It was a nice demonstration of the realistic type of movie show <br /> <br />. Some good movies were out at that time doing a similar job. It would be nice to see more of this type of TV coming from Australia because it has been sadly missed in the last twenty years. for all that we have been fed is the slurry of soap of various quality.
