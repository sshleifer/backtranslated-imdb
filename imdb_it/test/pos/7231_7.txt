This extravagant Troma movie is actually a great movie. It is known as their epic production and better and more appreciated. Their version of Shakespeare's play is extremely entertaining with the usual dose of Troma nudity and gore. Troma has made some very good gore films, one of my favorites is "Street Trash" and, of course, the Toxic Avenger movies. I have a film by Troma, "Terror Firmer", which has the reputation of being their most glorious and meanest film. I loved "Tromeo and Juliet" so much, that I finally need to look at "Terror Firmer". This is a 2-disc version of the collector with four comments and many many features. "Tromeo and Juliet" is an absolute hoot and highly recommended.
