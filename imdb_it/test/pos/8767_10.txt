The argument is trivial, even in 1942. It is a war propaganda. The fascists are among us and are doing everything they can to sabotage the war efforts and prepare their victory and their seizure of power and establish an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock must become a real thriller. Then he invents a first sabotage that succeeds but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the first suspect and runs for sabotage. This allows him, so to speak, to visit the country and discover the difficult organization of local Nazis who have knowledge and support in benevolent society and use dissatisfied little whites to do the dirty work. The chase after the true saboteur brings our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes his senses to know that the guy is not guilty, his niece who is a star of the billboard but also a frantic and fanatical patriot who only thinks of going to the police. Then the rich breeder and his nest of conspirators. Then, on the road, a friendly and friendly truck driver, and a long circus caravan around and their dwarf, the bearded woman, the Siamese sisters and some other grotesque of that type. And he discovers the target in a Soda City, an electric dam that supplies Los Angeles and its military industry with the energy they need. Participate as a gravel in the organization in sabotaging a USS Alaska military ship when it is launched. And finally with a little inventiveness, creativity and elbow, he and the pianist's niece can clean up everything, many of them are arrested and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls from the torch of the Statue of Liberty. That won't fry on the old sparkling electric chair. But Hitchcock is not yet in the habit of having a personal cameo in his films, so don't look for him. It's well built and well executed, but it's just a propaganda film with an extra style. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
