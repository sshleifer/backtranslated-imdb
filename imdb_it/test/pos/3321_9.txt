A classic movie from the late 1950s. The super-grown headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a sense of the 50s (which I love). <br /> <br /> The appearance and atmosphere of the contemporary film "Extremely romantic" "Far from heaven" reflects exactly this type of film (and I suspect this film could be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959!), But like a movie - glorious! As a reflection of society, extremely interesting. And as a witness to how Hollywood stands out from the idealistic portrait of American sex customs, fascinating.
