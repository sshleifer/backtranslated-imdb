Yes, 2:37 is somehow a rip-off from Gus van Sants Elephant. It's about some students who are facing their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it's full of clich√©s, but it's life. There is no denying that disturbing nerds, disabled people or popular students who, despite their popularity, have problems exist in the real world. <br /> <br /> But this is not the theme of the film. This is not life in Highschool. This is not the suffering of life itself. <br /> <br /> If you look beneath the surface, under the soap-like social relationships that are shown, you will find some compelling and provocative criticisms of our society. <br /> <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand their motivations? Or are we just trying to understand, after it's already too late? And why is it always someone, didn't you ever expect it to be? <br /> <br /> This film does not answer this question, but raises it. And it does it in a very intense way. For as long as it makes you guess, whose blood could be, you see at the beginning. You are following the paths of some students, all with a more or less good reason to end their lives, only to be forced to look at the horrible act in the end. <br /> <br /> Did you know who it would be? Or were you taken by surprise, as in real life? <br /> <br /> The message is recorded by one of the surviving children at the end. We are always so fixated on our problems, we forget to see those of others. There may be someone, a colleague, a friend who doesn't want to live anymore. But, if you don't open your eyes, you'll never know until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This film offers good results. It may have some flaws, but it doesn't matter when it's over. Either you see a reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
