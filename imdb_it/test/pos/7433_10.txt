OMG!!! did you ever think they would make a movie about it ?? well i knew they would, but i didn't know when !! and now it's finally here !!! when I received yesterday via the post, I put it in my stereo (evil) that plays DVDs and I immediately had this smile huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuelle fascinating characters from the Final Fantasy game! including tifa and aeris, my favorites .... (I'm too into this) the graphics threw me out !!!! they were really fantastic. so real until the last hair !!! the plot is OK a little confused, especially since my version of the film was in Japanese, but of course - being a fan of the final fantasy for a long time - I didn't care a bit - I just read the subtitles !!! all the characters speak as they would in the game, and reno and rude are still ridiculous. even the dragon scene is evil. looks so good !!! anyway .... the graphics were, incredible .... the plot, fantastic .... and the basic idea of ​​having a ff7 movie too ....... genius !!!
