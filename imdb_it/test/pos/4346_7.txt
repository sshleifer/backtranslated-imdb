Most critics seem to have rejected this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of senseless violence. And while there is quite a bit of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not that bad, especially for fans of the series and its star. <br /> <br /> This time, the aging of Charlie Paul Kersey is left free by a police chief who desperately tries to clean up a difficult part of New York City. The unleashed vigilante moves into the heart of the band's territory, where once again he becomes an individual army in an urban war of good against evil. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that WISH 3 is a classic. Indeed, the discriminating eye has a plethora of imperfections. The characters are generally made of cardboard. The violence is exaggerated. A man well past his 60s explodes and tears dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and subsequent films like FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, it has a decidedly appeal to the crowd. Who doesn't want to see gangbangers get their due? There are also some great and one-liner moments that are so common in 80s movies. When a tenant in his apartment building sees Kersey set up an explosive trap, for example, the vigilante says with fervor that he is "thinning the herd". A single Bronson line can really do the job. <br /> <br /> So you see, the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It is not Spielberg and it is not art. Then throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun.
