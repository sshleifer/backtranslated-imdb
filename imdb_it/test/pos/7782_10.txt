very rarely it happens that I sit down to write a comment for a film .... but this movie !!!!!! oh my good god !!!!!!!! never ever there was a Hindi film better than this ...... and never ever a better film has arrived than this ...... is the king of all comedies ..... <br /> <br /> aamir khan is undoubtedly the best actor of COMIC in the Indian film industry ... even if it is fun to say it because it is a class act, not a comedian ... but what he did in this film is perhaps the most exhilarating performance of any Indian actor in a comedy outside and inside. .. <br /> <br /> salman khan has never been a good actor in my eyes .... but this film got the best out of him .... he was innocently comical ... if there ever was a Term like this .... just what the doctor ordered regarding his role in the film was ... <br /> <br /> rajkumar santoshi I don't know why, I never tried his play again . ... he directed great adventures like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and the Khakee but he failed to recreate the magic of Andaz Apna Apna .... <I don't care why this movie bombed at the box office .... even though it saddens me that a film like "hum aapke hain kaun" was the reason for its failure ...... for now I hope the voices become true ..... there will be "andaz apna apna-2" they say .... ... we as the public can only say AMEN !!!!!
