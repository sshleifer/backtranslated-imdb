In front, if you are tired, the first hour may be slow. The setting of the story has a natural and serene rhythm, without haste - giving us time to appreciate the kind of daily life and the situations in which the main characters are found. Once you reach the climate segment of the plot, the turn of events will keep you hooked: how things are going, what will happen to our precious Fanda (portrayed in silent perfection by the veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), as his wife (wonderfully played by Stella Zázvorková) will treat it, what happens to Fanda's dear friend? Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - a fellow correspondent of Brodský), and Jára the son with a selfish hidden program, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!) Vladimír Michálek sensitively directed the film with sprinkles of humor, preserving the insightful script by Jirí Hubac. Thanks to the clear subtitling, I could see that every "whining" phrase pronounces Fanda's wife, there is a hint of "attention" shown / buried between the lines - and so the judicious lady's judge observed. Fanda stands '75 going over 80 'and the affection of their enduring (engaging) marriage also manifests itself in their playful arguments. His playfulness can be contagious. <br /> <br /> This is 'Growing Old Together 101' for (at least) the 50s and the lessons learned to the sons and daughters of not taking parents for granted. It may be necessary to reconsider whether hiring "the home for the elderly" is a means to an end, so to speak. The movie is kindly shouting at us to live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: there is joy in staying and watching the roll of credits.) <br /> <br /> We are lucky to see an occasional Czech movie. The Sverák ("Kolya") father and son of 2001 "Dark Blue World" was revealing the pathos. It's nice to take the rhythm from time to time and appreciate a foreign gem - subtitles, landscapes, melodic soundtrack and an engaging human story with elegant performances. "Autumn Spring" (aka Babí Léto) is available on DVD. To enjoy!
