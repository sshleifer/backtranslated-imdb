In the Alfred Hitchcock adaptation of "Strangers On A Train" by Patricia Highsmith, Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of ​​completing two murders. Anthony, rather intrusive, suggests he could kill Haines' unfaithful wife and Haines could kill Anthony's overbearing father. The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes remain unresolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves Haines easier with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when Anthony kills Haines's wife in an amusement park and then chases Haines to keep his part of the deal. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are clear from the beginning. Haines is a professional, respectable and rather modest tennis player on his achievements, while Anthony's life goes nowhere and admits he was kicked out of three colleges for drinking and gambling. Haines has a relationship with the daughter of a senator who wants to marry. Anthony interprets this as a cynical maneuver by Haines to provide a shortcut to a career. The character differences are also visually reinforced. Anthony often lives in shady areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often seen from the most heroic perspective provided by low camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are some amazing visual sequences like: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines' wife manifested through the reflection of her glasses falling to the ground as she struggles to get rid of Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) The representation of Anthony alone, dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white building of the Jefferson Memorial. <br /> <br /> (3) The occasion when all the spectators of a tennis match move their heads in unison, following the action, while a head (Anthony's) remains chilling in a position that looks Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene in which the roundabout becomes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly. <br /> <br /> Frequent use is made of "doubles" throughout history, for example, Haines and Anthony were initially introduced as 2 p ares of feet coming out of their taxis and going to the train. As the train leaves the station, there are 2 sets of tracks each offering a choice of 2 ways to proceed. The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskeys. Hitchcock's cameo sees him fighting on board the train with a double bass. Haines feels doubly crossed when the wife denies an agreement they have for her to see a lawyer to organize a divorce. Haines's wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends. When Anthony confronts her before the murder she lights her lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses. Anthony later becomes very baffled when he meets the senator's youngest daughter whom he sees as a double for Haines's wife. Anthony also feels doubly crossed when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder. When Haines travels alone on a train to Metcalf, he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kick their feet together in the same way he and Anthony had. <br /> <br /> The action in the film proceeds at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (like the senator's younger daughter) are particularly powerful.
