Goldeneye of 007 is one of the best versions of N64 ever. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are much better and higher games. But I still love Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation from a movie second only to Star Wars adaptations. The story is perfect. It's like I'm in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. Artificial intelligence of enemies is the best part of this game. I enjoyed playing the stage where James and Natalya break away from Janus's base while Goldeneye prepares to burn him. It was very difficult to escape without issuing an alarm. Avoiding cameras and controlling your fire are important aspects of the game. <br /> <br /> It's also the hardest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the only exception. I'm still trying to beat Agent 00's difficult level, but winning the easiest levels was already a big win. I loved when Alec Trevelyan asked, "For England, James?" I replied: "No, for ME!" It happened right when I blasted him to death. Just like in the movie. I love making every goal. <br /> <br /> The multiplayer game is even better. At first I was killed every second saint. Now, I know how to win. I love to force my playmates by playing License to Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and the sound are stunning. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to this. The only thing I still wanted to hear was the theme song Goldeneye, which plays at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> After Zelda was released, I almost forgot I still have this game. It is still excellent, although it is already outdated. I hope more 007 will be produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Rareware work! Nintendo was very clever at releasing this game exclusively on the N64. Magnificent Nintendo work!
