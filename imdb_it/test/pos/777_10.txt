I didn't expect much from this movie and I was slapped. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney behave wonderfully like the main characters in this film. Any teenager can refer to parental control and the desire to come out as who you really are, which is essentially what this film is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words. Slowly but surely it comes out of its shell and becomes much less embarrassing. Every single spectator hears the highs and lows of the film and the theater is full of laughter 75% of the time. The film satisfies everyone, and I hope it can soon be released in all theaters in the United States, because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities. It's a must see!
