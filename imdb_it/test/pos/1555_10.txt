Excellent history, wonderful acting, extraordinary production values ​​and a cool and action-packed short film with a perfect turn in the end. What a nice short film! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at Vail or in Aspen at a film festival and I was impressed. Then I saw him again in another festival (where he won again) and I was even more impressed by the fact that the subtle touches become evident the second time - for a short film, this brings together a lot of clever layers in a short period. > <br /> AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and absolutely awesome for a short film - for any movie actually. It is an interesting story told very well, and every scene moves the story, which reveals that a good movie gave birth to instincts to make this film. The film looks amazing and David Morse is also amazing, with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene. Watching his character try to defeat life's curved ball is making him a great visual experience. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that when the tortures of war are in everyday titles, the boundaries between reality, good and evil can become very gray while rhetoric becomes noisy and attempts to make things in black and white. AWOL skillfully allows the public to decide for themselves what they think the message is, what is real and what is not, which adds to the mystery. <br /> <br /> Both times I've seen it, the public was WAY more in this movie than the others who play it, which is saying a lot. There are a lot of short films right now, but few offer the kind of excellence and complex topics that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the previous reviewer is out of his swing or has some personal program, because this is really a great example of an independent independent short film. I see a lot of short films, and I have to say if only ALL the short films that went around the festival were so good, then the shorts would have had heavy legs.
