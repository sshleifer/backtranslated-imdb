Suzumiya Haruhi no yûutsu (The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) could at first sight make you think that this is just another comedy / animated school drama. Well, it's not! The setting seems to be a school environment. This is a comedy, but very clever with a lot of sarcasm. And the characters have a psychological sublimity that is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of Ingmar Bergman. The episodes are transmitted, as it seems, out of order, that is, the pilot is actually episode 11. This makes it possible to present small clues to the upcoming episodes. The show is an adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular series of novels about Haruhi Suzumiya. So what about history? As in all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to alleviate her boredom by embarking on adventures. Haruhi has no interest in ordinary humans and actively seeks out aliens, time travelers and spirits (people with supernatural forces). To find this type of people, he formed a club that calls the SOS-Brigade (saves the world by overloading it with fun: the Haruhi Suzumiyas brigade). With the exception of Haruhi, the other members of the SOS brigade are Kyon. He is the true protagonist of the show. It is through his point of view that we follow the story. He just sat in class when Haruhi had the idea of ​​forming the SOS-Brigade. He's rather skeptical of most of the club's activities and tags just to make sure Haruhi doesn't go much to the extreme, and he's the only one in the class with whom Haruhi loves to talk. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is the "indispensable silent member" and is also the only remaining member of the literature club, which occupied the SOS Brigade room in search of a free club room. She doesn't care that the SOS-Brigade uses her ballroom, as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. He also participates in brigade activities. Miku Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-like mascot for anything suspicious. She often acts as a maid for the clubs. The last member is the ever-smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who seems to be the "mysterious student transferred" (in the sense that he transferred two months in the semester that Haruhi finds qualified as mysterious). <br /> <br /> Haruhi thinks that all members except Kyon are some randomly chosen people at school, but actually they have their interest in her.
