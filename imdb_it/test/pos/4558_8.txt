I saw this film and knew absolutely nothing about him and his protagonists, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I must say that this film is a classic comic. It's so stupid sometimes that it can only be fun. Farley is as brilliant as the bumbling idiot who sets out on his father's right hand (the equally excellent Spade) to find the funds to save the car business for families. Relax, put your brain on autopilot and enjoy the fun. A cast of great help includes such films as Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne's World) and Bo Derek ("10"). Highly recommended for a good laugh.
