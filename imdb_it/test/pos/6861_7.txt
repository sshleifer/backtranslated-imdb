A horror film in the end parodying but still in its play could frighten some of those who are fragile, nervous or easily disgusted when they see what's under their skin. I laughed anyway. It was easy to decipher the real killer and his acting didn't help. This has led to Powerful just looking even better. Anatomie is not a horror film for those unrelated to the genre, but the content ones should get some involuntary laugh and an interesting spike in German horror movies. 6/10
