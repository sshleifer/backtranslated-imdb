Of course I am a little biased, but for the moment it was the most accurate portrait of the Marines ever shown on the big screen. I was at Camp Pendleton doing infantry training when Webb took his crew to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. It took about two or three days as best I can remember. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and professional. <br /> <br /> During the filming of our short scene - which seemed to take forever an eighteen - Webb was very conscientious about getting things (marine things) and did a good job with one exception - that scene in which a recruit wore sunglasses. It never happens to me for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the film and I will annoy my grandchildren whenever I can make them sit for a few seconds more while I show them the Papaw when he was a young stallion and part of the greatest fighting force in the world (without bragging rights, just done). What amazed me then was how the real Marines played their roles as an actor. It was before I realized that DIs must have some acting genes to do their job. <br /> <br /> The only movie I saw since it is equal to DI is the first half of Full Metal Jacket and that part is superior only for vulgar language. When DI was performed, cursing writing on the screen was not allowed. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of vulgarity, it is still a great film to rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, Do or die
