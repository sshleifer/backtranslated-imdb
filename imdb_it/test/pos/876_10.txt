I love this movie. It's the first film Master P has ever made. It is based on the story of his life. It's low budget, but it's very good. Show how Master p grew into projects in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Not only was Master P born in this film, but he was also the writer and director of Moon Jones. The DVD also has the No Limit ice cream party on it. This film shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with things around him. He also has many The No Limit Records rosters in this film. You should buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to watch if you like rap, or it's a Master P fan. I don't want to ruin this movie for you. Go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it. You will like it.
