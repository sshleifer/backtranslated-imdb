One of the best television programs out there, if not the best. Why? Simple: he has the courage to show us real life in prison, without clich√©s and predictable twists. This is not Prison Break or any other show, in reality compared to Oz the Sopranos show seems like a children's story. Bad words, curses, blows of explicit violence and drug use, disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes ... all this and more in Oz. But this is not the best part of Oz; the characters are the strongest point of this show; they are all excellent and not annoying, although we are watching brutal criminals. The actors are excellent, my favorites are the actors who play Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher, because they are so unique and completely change their behavior. And above all ... they have no remorse for their actions. Overall ... Oz is an incredible show, the best around. Forget CSI and stupid doctor shows ... this is the deal ... OZ!
