I had a horrible day but this movie grabbed me, and I couldn't put it down until the end ... and I forgot about my horrible day. and the ending ... by the way ... where is the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> the budget is obviously extremely low ... but ... look what they did! reminds me of a representation ... basically they are working with a tent, a "rescue capsule", some guns, uniforms, camping gear and a "scanner" thing. this is for props. Perhaps this is also a good thing, forcing acting and writing to go up and take the place it deserves in the film, like work centers, instead of having an excuse to do battles in CGI (starwars) instead. <br /> <br /> The CGI is fine. It's not exactly 'seamless' ... but it continues to work. why? because there is not too much, and what is there, is not "taking over" with an army of effects that the people of the house try to cram everything they can in the attempt. pushes the imagination ... it's a relatively simple stuff, with a decent composition (especially the heavy load shot ... there's a long shot that must last at least ten seconds ... which follows the entire length of the ship ... must be a record for the production of science fiction films in the last 10 years, to have an action sequence that lasts more than 0.75 seconds, and some relationship with the story. it might seem old or not "state of the art", but it doesn't seem stupid and doesn't detract from the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, except that the characters die too quickly to know them. The captain was fantastic, but some of his scenes could have used another shot. I also confused with his character who lost his calm and trampling of a corpse, I like to think that the captains are calm and controlled ... what was happening in that scene? Did the other crew fear that losing it at that time? did you feel out of control? <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot .... mostly it's good ... why? Because he doesn't try to explain himself. It just happens. It's called "the planet", it's a mystery, understand? No one knows why there is a statue, nor do they discover it. The mysterious cult? The strange scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect to discover in less than 90 minutes? This is not war and peace. And thank god, it's not even a war of stars / treks. No midicloro, no 5 minutes of boring exhibition dialogue that has no purpose in history. The characters are blocked, and I'm only able to understand some basic things ... it's not an episode of Star Trek where they discover that it is Leonardo or Davinci a child as a space tramp. It's mysterious and I liked it. I don't know why, maybe I can identify with these guys more, since they don't know what's going on, and neither do I ... don't talk much about nonsense space or have magic boxes that tell them what's going on. <br /> <br /> Actually, I would say that one of the weakest moments is when the "traitor" turns on the crew, and tries to "explain" the reason for the planet, the cult, etc. This coincidentally has some of the weakest dialogues, imho, in the whole film, and interrupts the flow and some characters appear unnatural in that scene. <br /> <br /> OK, sometimes I felt it was a bit too mysterious, though. Like, why did the boy fry his eyes with lightning? It was strange. Simply strange The ending of the "village" ... again I would have liked to know better some of these characters. And would it have been so difficult to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end? This is not a serial show, it was a movie, and we like the closing in the movies, even if they can have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet without "flights of angels who sing to you at your rest" <br /> <br /> However. What can I say. This was worth the dollar I paid to the red box distributor at the supermarket. It was also, imho, a better piece of storytelling than parts of Starwars 1 2 or 3. As I said, it sucked me, I wanted to know what was going on, and I couldn't stop looking until the end.
