Who won the Oscar for best actress in 1933? It had to be Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrait of the most monstrous mother ever. She is truly one of the great actresses of the characters of all time. He played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and his best remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in "Gone with the Wind". <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne was the "official" star of the film, but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Center. Their first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Mrs Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is an underestimation. From her first entry - in a frantic explosion of efforts to greet her "big guy" - all the attention is on her. Even sitting around the tea table, when he forgets Hester's existence, even forgetting how he takes his tea, you know something is not right. (Hester has been living there for a while.) <br /> <br /> Frances Dee is completely sweet and just right in her role as adorable Hester. Her performance in this film, especially the scene in which she had a hysteric and the consequences show how undervalued she was as an actress. <br /> <br /> All the young actors are excellent. Eric Linden is as superb as Robert, the youngest son who realizes that his mother is horrible, but can do nothing to escape from his mother's spell. Joel McCrea, at one point says "paint roses on bathtubs - it's more your style". There is a very subtle suggestion in Robert's sexuality film. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she has tried.
