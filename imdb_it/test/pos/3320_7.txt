"The Women" by Claire Booth Luce shows the relationships with men through the point of view of a woman in a drama, (and in the 1939 film also Joan Crawford who plays a bitch: a character that could have been Amanda Farrow 20 years before), which has no male characters. Here we see the male characters and what a race they are. They use women as toys and throw them away, letting women suffer. Ironically, the women of "The Women", perhaps because they are all those we see, are shown in a light that is anything but favorable, alternatively silly and intriguing, with the only "beautiful" (Norma Shearer), who grows "claws "of the end. In "The Best of Everything" we see men for the cads they are while women are largely innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a film about women jumping from things. Diane Baker jumps from a car, (perhaps the most absurd scene in the history of cinema, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape. The women in the film jump into the workplace, seeking success and love at the same time. Women will jump into the future and leave this kind of soap opera in the next decade. But they would return in the 80s and 90s through novels by people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz, although their trash work is not as good as this. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is how it looks. I love the cinemascope films of the 50s and 60s. They look a lot nicer than children's movies challenging the pixels we have been doing since then, especially in the letterbox version that we see on TV, and the DVD, with the image so clear you can enter. The appearance of the group of young beauties is also memorable. This film probably has more beautiful women than all the others. She has a supermodel, (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen, (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America in 1954 as Rona Jaffe says in the DVD commentary, but rather Miss USA 1953, for the IMDb: but then) and a Playboy playmate, (June Blair, since January 1957). My vote goes to Suzy, one of the amazing beauties of all time. His acting here is not as horrible as people pretend: they are only reacting, like people then, to the sight of a top model, (the first one, really), who tries to act. No one seemed to care how well she did it. His role, that of an apparently worldly woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex of the group and does just fine. <br /> <br /> The most touching thing about the movie now is the age of the female leads at the moment. Hope Lange was 27 when they shot this film in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20 years old. Suzy Parker was 26 years old. Hope, who seemed to be Grace Kelly's heir, never made it big and ended up being Mrs. Muir on television and, for the IMDb, ended up living in a house with "table boxes" because she spent her money for causes in which he believed before he died at the age of 72 in 2003. This film must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory for her. Baker, always a welcome face in the TV of the '60s, (especially to Richard Kimble), still active as an actress and acting teacher, has turned 67 years old. Parker found "the best of everything" with Bradford Dillman for 40 years before he died at age 70 the same year as Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, just like their characters.
