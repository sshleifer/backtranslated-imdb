I can't praise this movie enough. He had a lot of that flickering hand-held camera in first person that I love (and a little hate, because it makes them sick), like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> It's a long film of its kind, but I didn't even notice it because the film was so interesting. Simply showing the footage of a paranormal journalist's work, the film maintains the rhythm, making it a real-time experience for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Even though I would never call this film, "the most scary horror ever made", I should say that it is definitely one of the best I've seen. The fear factor here is built from the details in the images, from the imperfections of the camera, connected events that give the film a very mysterious and disturbing tone. The horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imagination. The finish is perfect, and keep in mind that you may have nightmares later. A second view is highly recommended, though. <br /> <br /> Watch this alone in the dark, don't expect anything and you'll have fun.
