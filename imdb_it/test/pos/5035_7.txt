I took this movie on TV and watched it again. I said to myself, it's been a long time since I saw this movie, so why not. And once again this film has thrilled me. It's so easy, so watchable and so human that I don't know why someone doesn't like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every move), an angel who can hardly be linked to this word. He smokes, drinks and eats like a savage, but he has a big heart. On his way, Michael helps all the people he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) in her way of singing and finding a right man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) in developing himself as a good and respectable man. Michael even helped dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street. Travolta had a great help in other actors. Andie MacDowell is so handsome and likeable, William Hurt is great as usual, late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite actor in this film is Bob Hoskins as the tabloid owner. <br /> <br /> So we have a solid movie about people with a hot story too and attractive cast. Just don't take this movie seriously and I can guarantee you will have fun.
