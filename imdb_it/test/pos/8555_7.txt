I reached this movie on TV after 30 years or more. Several aspects of the film stood out even when they were viewed so many years after it was made. <br /> <br /> The story of the little known C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable, almost similar to a story similar to Tolstoy of a man beaten by a cosmic scheme that he cannot understand. Compare this film with contemporary works better known as Spelberg's "Schindler's List" and begin to understand that the trauma of the Second World War should be seen against the broader fabric of racism beyond Arian's simplistic Nazi notion of Jews. This film touches the Hungarians' antipathy for Romanians, Romanians don't like Russians and so on ... even touching on the questionable Jewish relations with their Romanian Christian friends, while they are under stress. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, it is difficult to see how much it has been changed by the director and the writers. For example, it is interesting to study the Romanian farmer's vision of emigrating to the United States with the intention of making money only to return to Romania and invest his earnings there. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the character of Johann Moritz was probably one of the best roles played by Anthony Quinn in the standings along with his work in "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and "Barabbas". <br /> <br /> The most beautiful and memorable sequence of the film is the final one with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. The father who carries a daughter born of the rape of his wife by the Russians is a separate story, but the director is able to show reconciliation with a simple gesture - the act of bringing the child without slipping into a melodramatic movie . <br /> <br /> Today after the death of Princess Diana we have often observed the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an accusation of the paparazzi and insensitive media (director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court scene while the cameramen prepare to jump on Moritz). <br /> <br /> The interaction between Church and State was so splendidly summarized in the laconic affirmation of the Orthodox priest: "I pray to God to guide those who have the power to use them well". <br /> <br /> Some of the short shots, like those of a secretary of a minister who scribbles while listening to a petition, have said so much in such a short time. The direction was so impressive that the editing took second place. <br /> <br /> Finally, what struck me most was the exquisite rich color texture provided by the cameraman Andreas Winding - from the brilliant credit sequences to the end. I remembered that he was the cameraman of another of my favorite French films, "Ramparts of Clay", directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. I haven't seen such use of colors for a long time except for the David Lean epic. <br /> <br /> There were flaws: I would like Virna Lisi's character to be more full of details. I never understand the character of Serge Reggiani, the only intellectual of the entire film. The train station scene at the end seems to be taken away from Sergio Leone's westerns. Finally, the film was basically built around a love story, which unfortunately takes a back seat. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film impressed me in more departments than one. The story is relevant today as it was when it was created.
