Let's not talk about the bush here, Taylor Hackford's slick film has very little to distinguish from the biopic genre besides Jamie Foxx's exceptional career performance. Do you remember the year in which they gave the Oscar of the special effects to the fake Terminator 2, unchallenged? They should do the same with the gong of this year's best actor. <br /> <br /> The story of Ray Charles is worthy of filming is not in question. In fact, the many flashbacks of his traumatic childhood are well managed and judiciously used. But for such a unique life, the film looks incredibly formidable and familiar. Following is the model of the "history of an imperfect genius" almost to the letter: hardship and exploitation, women and drugs, recordings, gang quarrels, rehabilitation, yes yes yes. And surely in his life there was more humor than what is reserved for us here? <br /> <br /> I appreciate the music of Charles but where the well-cut medinas would continue to run the story, Hackford indulges himself with almost full-length of interpretations of too many songs - in the joints of gins, in recording studios , in concert halls, in infinity. Narratively, and for non-devotees, they begin to behave like a cinematic brake. This may seem like a harsh judgment on a biographical film but with a catalog as wide as Ray's, we need a taste not of the whole dish. Otherwise, we would buy the albums. <br /> <br /> Intrigued as I was, I took a look at my watch more than once. So for all of Foxx's brilliance, maybe Ray would have been better served as an HBO two-parter?
