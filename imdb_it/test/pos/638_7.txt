If you like suspense, this film has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her misfortune and increases suspense. The appearance of Alec Guiness was nice, but it didn't really contribute to the film. I'm not sure that the part of Evan Richard as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add some humor or if he was supposed to be just a bumbling idiot. I thought photography was excellent. This added not only to the quality of the production but also to the suspense. The bathtub with the water drops in slow motion was wonderful. Even the scene where the knife falls and then passes to Andy Clarke by cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done. I would call it good general entertainment
