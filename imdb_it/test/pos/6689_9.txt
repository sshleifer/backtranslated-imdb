Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, perhaps the greatest. This in combination with another fantastic actor named Jeff Bridges, can't be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years. To begin with, the film has a brilliantly written story. It's part of what makes the movie so beautiful. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the film is acting. The Spacey-Bridge combination really works. <br /> <br /> This was already the second time I saw the movie and I'm sure it won't be the last time. "K-PAX" has it all. There are extremely fun moments, parts that resemble a real thriller and others that recall high-class drama. I think this film deserves a much higher rating and a lot more prizes. Great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
