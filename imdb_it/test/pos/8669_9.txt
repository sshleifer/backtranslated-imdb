I believe there are two corners of the story, first of all, it is the satirical vision of the world, presented in an obvious Kafkaesque way, underlining the sordid spectacle behind some of the most common but also pleasant or comfortable moments and elements, which are usually enough to keep the man functioning in society. Like: a good job, a good home, a good wife, a good car and even a good lover. In addition to this so-called common bliss, there are some who cannot help but ask themselves some more uncomfortable questions, such as where they come from, or that they may have some other form of bliss, that there may be a reason for them to be or time may be something that they have lost, or, even more sinister, time may be something that the system itself is holding back from them. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the most interesting aspect of this film, I believe, is the fact that it directly attacks this natural compulsion to dissect the world around us, questioning it with our personal judgment, and usually condemning it because it does not serve us better, because it is not tailor-made to satisfy us as a person. <br /> <br /> The symbolism behind the train crash, I believe suggests that our own will may be overwhelmed by fate or some other larger universal power, even in the face of our so-called power to decide when we want to get out. Instead, man is fired from this greater power (let's call it SYSTEM, because the authors clearly avoid calling it GOD, perhaps further emphasizing that the SYSTEM is made by MAN and therefore can be dominated by man, unlike FATE, which is a closer to religion) under his own conditions, not killing him, but showing him that there is a place for the man who asks / wants too much, perhaps suggesting that true realization does not come from the outside world, but from within, and if the outside world "decides" to give you some comfort, you should learn to accept it, without questioning the fabric of every little aspect of it. <br /> <br /> Disturbing, but it makes you re-evaluate some existential questions that have become mainstream in the last century, like what man can do in an increasingly drained world of substance, a world driven by the consumer in which the man can be exchanged without making a difference to the larger image, but only as long as it is of any use to the system.
