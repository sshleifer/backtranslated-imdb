This was the best movie I saw in the year 2000. The Cohen brothers have never let me down before, and certainly not this time either. <br /> <br /> It's one of those rare films these days - it's witty, smart and a lot of fun. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there are many things about Cohen in there - strange characters and special gadgets, well-developed storyline and magic room. But no Cohen film resembles any other Cohen film, if one neglects the general quality of these, of course. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the real main performance of this film comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is also superb. <br /> <br /> A film that is a light comedy with a musical touch that evolves its history around the rednecks and old country times, dripping with wit and intelligence. This is a very unlikely combination. But that's exactly what this image is.
