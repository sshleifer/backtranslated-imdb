This little-known comedy based on the success of Ruth Gordon is a delight. The script, based on the game, is spicy, rich and completely undated. Ditto the cast, but I must emphasize the work of the protagonist, Irene Dunne. Irene is simply superb - as usual - and illuminates the screen with all the frames she is in (and she's very much there, thank goodness). Furthermore, the director Vidor gave her some unusual close-ups that are mesmerizing. What a Girl! I don't know of other Hollywood actresses of any age who have their versatility and are so convincing in every film. Because she remains so little known is a mystery. I saw most of his films and this was a surprise, even for a fan of identity like me. Look at it, everyone!
