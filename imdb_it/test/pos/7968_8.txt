Once you sit down to watch this movie "A Cannon for Cordoba" you have the feeling that it will be fantastic. The reason? The film begins with an overwhelming soundtrack by the famous composer Elmer Bernstein who gave us memorable themes like "The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven". In fact, when you read the opening credits that represent the cast, it's none other than George Peppard as Captain Rod Douglas, you know he'll have action and more. Also, when you see actor John Russel playing General John J. Pershing, you know a heroic saga awaits you. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the United States in a border town dispute with Mexican bandits crossing the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. Among the most brazen among the rebel leaders is General Cordova ( Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces. Since the US Army cannot legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is sent on what is a suicide mission, with no orders and no help from Pershing. His mission is to recover the Cannons, destroy a rebel stronghold and bring Cordova back to life. Selecting the hardest, the hardest, the most experienced, certainly the most insolent of the men available, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the almost impregnable fortress. A dramatic action follows, as well as a lot of explosive excitement. If you ask for criticism, I would say the choice of weights. Vallone and John Larch are not very threatening. Not so with the men who line up with Peppard. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (who is superb). However, this film is recommended as a good vision. ****
