What needs to change in today's attitude towards films like Boogie Nights is the approach. The approach is terrible! Comparing it with Pulp Fiction, seeing only pornography, and all its aspects ... come on, people, there's more to this beautiful movie. And to all the skeptics, was Paul Thomas Anderson not shown to be worth repeating? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I watch American films and I still have faith in this "sector" that film production is today .. And what about There Will Be Blood? This is a film that will remain in the history of cinema, whether you like it or not! Yes you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! you don't deserve this, you don't deserve anything. So many artists today struggle to get awards and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious movies, even mainstream, because people just want to see celebrities do stupid things ... like Britney warts. <br /> <br />, this was very painful for me to say because I don't want to see it, I don't want to believe that today all that matters is the addition of numbers .. sales revenue and sales return .. I want see the magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa have brought and created through the language of cinema .. Because this is what PTA is doing ... it is creating magic !!
