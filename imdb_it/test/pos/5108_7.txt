Thirty years after the classic 1939 film won an Oscar for Robert Donat and made Greer Garson a star, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" overcame a multitude of problems before stumbling across the screen in this musical version. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn received a strong impetus for - thankfully - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. The soundtrack of Andre Previn was rejected and the one eventually used was unfortunately composed by Leslie Bricusse. The first director Herbert Ross received the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - that of a man for his wife and students - into a large budget extravaganza. That he does so well despite the many obstacles in his way is a testament to his two stars. <br /> <br /> Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a school for boys in suburban England where he himself was educated Introvert and socially inept, dedicated to his students but not able to inspire them. Before the summer holidays, a former student takes him to a music hall in London to see a show with Katharine Bridges, the young woman he hopes to marry. The post-performance meeting is inconvenient for everyone, and Chips - as is commonly known - leaves to explore some of the ancient ruins of Italy. Unexpectedly, he meets Katharine, who has booked a cruise in the Mediterranean to take the time to mourn a failed romance and reflect on the direction of his career. In the time they spend together, he discovers a kind and gentle man under the confused outside, and on his return to London he pursues him seriously. When the autumn period begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle into a life of quiet domesticity. Complications arise when aspects of the surface of Katharine's past, and again when World War II intrudes on their lives, but Chips is supported by his wife's support, and his newfound confidence makes him a favorite among students. <br /> <br /> Except for a couple of musical interludes - the delightful production number of the musical "London is London" and Katharine's declaration of love, "You and I" - most of Bricusse's songs , some of which performed in voice-over while the characters explore their emotions, are easily forgotten and in no way improve the film. Completely eliminate the score and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works quite well as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script preserves the elements of the original by expanding and updating them for a couple of decades. He has made several scenes between Chips and Katharine that beautifully outline their devotion to each other, and have infused some with courtesy of courtesy and cohort of Katharine, exaggerated actress Ursula Mossbank (delightfully played by Sian Phillips , O'Toole's wife of real life at the moment). It also captures life in a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the United States - with infallible perfection. <br /> <br /> Ross is a first-time director, who freely spreads the film with breathtaking photography moments - the sequence of the opening credits, during which the school anthem echoes in the school's vast stone corridors, perfectly defines the tone of the film. Costumes and sets are true to the period. Students, interpreted by non-professionals enrolled in the school used as Brookfield, manage their various small support roles well. <br /> <br /> The best praises are reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the main roles. O'Toole has long been a first-class dramatic actor, so his Oscar nomination here is not surprising. Clark, a veteran of about two dozen B-movies in the UK and "Finian's Rainbow" from the previous year, is as bright as the soubrette of the music hall who gives up a theatrical career in favor of life as the wife of a master of school. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to overlook how insipid most of them are, and her more than O'Toole's games in their dramatic scenes together. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us without a doubt that this is a very in love couple. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not a classic like its predecessor, but hardly the disaster that many critics described when it was released. Ignore the score, concentrate on the performances and enjoy the atmosphere that Ross has put on the screen. It's a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
