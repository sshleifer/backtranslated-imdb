When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his probation officer found him a job at a large city bank. When some of the criminals of his past find out about his position, they plan to exploit him and rob the bank. Pinky is initially horrified because he really wants to go straight, but when a turn in fate happens, Pinky begins to think that you shouldn't look into the mouth of a gift horse. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper {among others!}, this is an extremely entertaining piece that is the quintessential 70s. London and all its highly questionable fashions are lit up like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and in the clever clever Guy Elmes. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an elderly crime lord of some sort (not easy to say), then A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square might surprise you. Certainly the actors do not bring up any tree, but in reality they do not hurt the image at all, it has a quality of honest entertainment that is never less than entertainment. The soundtrack and the soundtrack are perhaps guilty of excessive excitement during the dramatic criminal moments, but it is a small complaint to let me think that this is a little-known British gem. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan takes the lead role of Pinky (obviously hoping to attract American spectators}, the beating heart of the 70s Oliver Tobias (a mass of hair) is there to keep the girls interested while the guys get the nice view of Elke Sommer and her delicious legs for the company.A pretty decent clip containing a truly rewarding ending, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square deserves much more than the paltry 5.7 rating here on IMDb, but how many people have seen it I wonder?, hmm, keep trying if the possibility, it's good stuff 7/10
