Hilary was as exceptional as Julie, and Pat was once again as magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references to the other three films! I mean, come on! First of all, where is Daniel !? Miyagi makes a brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and he should have at least made an appearance in the film. He could have helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the other hand, the music remained faithful to the film, with a little more instrumentation (Fretless Bass) to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute! It doesn't look like a Karate Kid movie unless you hear that Pan-Flute! Thanks Zamfir! Overall, however, a decent movie! We miss you Noriyuki!
