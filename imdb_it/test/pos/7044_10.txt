Meatballs make their way through conversations, like no other film. Especially during the summer. Whether it's the song on the CIT (Counselors In Training) or the cut-down or the inspiration Rudy the Rabbit or It Just Does Not Matter speech ... it opens! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where the next one would have woken up!?! Such a great seventies snapshot and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-PC is really fun, no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are the favorites, as is the hot dog race with the famous phrase "what ... no mustard?" Oh how many times I repeated that sentence and I was the only one who laughed! Thanks to writers, actors and directors! Applause, applause!
