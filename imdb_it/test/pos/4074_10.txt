I don't care what some reviews have said, this movie was fun. The thing with this movie is that you can't expect anything but being entertained. This is not an intellectual comedy, this is a smart popcorn movie. The three main members of the cast are fantastic and work very well with each other. Shatner is a star in the supporting cast as himself, a former television policeman, led by the character of Russo to instruct cops on how to be "TV cops". Those are by far the most fun scenes. If you want to have fun and sit and laugh, watch this movie.
