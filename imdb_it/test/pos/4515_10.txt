The kite runner was handsome, touching and very moving. I particularly loved the two child actors in the film and the actor who plays the father. It really made me want to go back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> Music was a wonderful part of the film's fabric. If there is a soundtrack coming out for the film, I will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It is also a visually stunning film. The cinematography was wonderful and really added to the experience. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word "saudades" is very descriptive of how I felt at the end of the film ... "is a deep feeling of desire for someone or somewhere, which is very sweet but also nuanced by an inevitable sadness "(definition given years ago by Antonio Carlos Jobim). <br /> <br /> I saw him in a small cinema here for an early screening. I'd like to see it again on a really big screen with a deceptive sound system. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for it to be officially released. I will definitely recommend the film to friends.
