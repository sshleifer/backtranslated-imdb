During the Sci-Fi TZ marathon on January 31st 1999, this episode was the last broadcast in the 20th century in my time zone (Eastern). It was the New Year, and when the clown starts to sing, "We are here because we are here, because we are here, because we are here ..." I realized that this was TZ's intelligent signal to be New Year because this melody is also the melody of Old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We will never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for the little touches: the teardrop on the ballerina, the clown's antics and the hit-yourself-in-the-head ending. This and Art Carney Santa TZ are the only ones at Christmas. <br /> <br /> My first five personal episodes, after five characters ...: 1. The hunt 2. The after hours 3. The hitchhiker 4. The lonely 5. The lost child
