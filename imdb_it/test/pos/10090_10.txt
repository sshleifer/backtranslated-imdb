typically, a film can have factors like "arouse", "feel good", "sense of purpose", "plot", etc. There is always something that can be taken away from the movies, it's just a matter of how convincing the reason is, for me owning it in my collection. "Tale of two sisters", as they call it when it was released in my country, has a tremendous feeling and a (mostly) self-explanatory storyline.I love horror movies that run around a house.The Others "," The Haunting "," The Hunting of Hell House ", this film will be another great example that I will remember: the film had an extremely rich color, in the way the house was decorated, in the clothes that the characters wore, in the light scenes of the day , in contrast to most horror films, which typically uses desaturated tones and gloomy environments (think of Honogurai mizu no soko kara, Dark Water, which is another show that I like) that gives this movie a aesthetic sense and joy when it was not in its most compelling moments, the characters are extremely credible, this can be partly attributed to the family context of this film, perhaps even domestic problems are easier for myself as the actors with whom they identify i, and the actors become their characters with exceptional finesse. the director plays with the time sequences, in order to give the audience the story in small segments, allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation, instead of presenting everything in a linear way. this is a positive aspect of this film, in my opinion, and, perhaps, it is my interpretation of this film that allows me to find it enjoyable. I would definitely watch it on DVD.
