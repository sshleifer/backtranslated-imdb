This movie was fun, if for all intents and purposes. <br /> <br /> It essentially follows the comedy brawl of two grave robbers in nineteenth-century England, who move from a conventional body to a traffic of vampires, zombies and dead Roswell aliens. (I have no idea what the Roswell alien was doing, nor the producers, I think.) <br /> <br /> But was it fun? You bet. Even Ron Perlman, who is often the kiss of Direct to DVD Death, was pretty good at it as a priest who turns out to be the head of a rival gang of wounded. <br /> <br /> A real joy to see this hilarious movie and a good example of what you can do when you don't have a bigger ego than life on both sides of the camera.
