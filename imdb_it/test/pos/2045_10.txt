I'm a fan of Geena Davis for life because of this movie. I have always loved Samuel L Jackson. And the two make a great pair on the screen. Having said that, I think "TLKG" is the best action movie I've ever seen, I forget the endings that the public now expects and that filmmakers now try (mostly failing) to incorporate into their films. <br /> <br /> 10/10
