At this time when almost everything comes to the DVD (I expect to see the My Mother the Car collection from one day to the next) this film has been unfairly overlooked. There are countless stupid comedies of the 1960s as well as many other eras that have received at least a superficial DVD treatment. This was not even published on VHS, to my knowledge, despite the talents involved (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (later known as co-author Tootsie), also Dustin Hoffman on his debut). Obviously it's a product of the sixties, but that's the rest of that era. All films reflect the tastes and habits of the times in which they are made. This was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. The film was finally released on DVD and developed a cult following. This film has many bizarre, crazy and wacky memorable moments. Of course, it is painted broadly and has silly music, but it is part of its charm. Create your own absurd universe. If those responsible for producing DVDs for Columbia Pictures' images (I think Columbia published it) take polls for new releases, this is my vote.
