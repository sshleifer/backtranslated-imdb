I am a new convert, I might as well say. I borrowed the DVDs from my local library. I've been interested in the samurai since I saw "The Last Samurai". My father told me he used to look at Shintaro as a child. He said it was pretty good. We are up to series 3. I absolutely love it. It takes a while to get used to the supernatural English voices over Japanese-speaking characters, but I really like it all the same. It is a bit strange to look at the slight pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at the characters and stick to a tree or a wall. I wasn't used to this, but I am now. But I suppose it's the technology they had in the 1960s. I noticed that Shintaro is kind, friendly, ready to help the needy, he is very humble, most of the time he doesn't have great notes (he just says he's better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It is really interesting to observe the art of the sword that Koichi Ose has. It's amazing. This series is for all those interested in samurai.
