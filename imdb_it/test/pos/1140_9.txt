This is the kind of film that might need to be seen repeatedly to capture all its beauty and intelligence {just like the 1957 Frankenstein Curse}. If you don't like strange and non-mainstream movies, avoid this masterpiece. For me, the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the videotape. The plot is a bit fantastic but it seems to become reality in our world today. For having been produced in the 1980s, this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of what the great government and its big brother, who wants to control us and monitor us, must do. <br /> <br /> There are many slow sections and the dialogue can be quite difficult to capture in many scenes {that's why I watched it 6 times now} but if you can digest it all, your time may be worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about a world in which people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They are only worried about accumulating and procreating. The hero of the film did not succumb to this disease and was not "tagged" and monitored by his older brother. His mission is to release a secret drug in the water supply that will change the way human robots think and allow individualism to once again be part of humanity. <br /> <br /> Yes, its very low budget, but for its time the effects of the computer and the sound effects are truly unique and the paintings are absolutely fascinating. If you have an open mind, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling.
