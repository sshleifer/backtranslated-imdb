After seeing a preview of this film in my local mall where there is a stand for buying foreign films, I thought it was a lot of fun. Before watching the movie I went to IMDb to see what votes and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the uproar, I watched the film and to my surprise I found it incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was great (just be careful) and the characters and their relationships within the film are amazing. I haven't seen such a good combination of characters that have been protagonists for a long time. I really felt for both characters and I felt a strong connection. By reading the previous posts on this film as it is not "epic" enough or a lack of martial arts I could not disagree more. This film is what it is, it's not Braveheart and it's not Enter the Dragon but it's still a wonderful film that does a great job combining history and action. <br /> <br /> While Sword In The Moon is not perfect (what movie is it?) it is still wonderful and moving. Just waiting for the final scene, with music and cinematography together, it's breathtaking. I just hope more people can see this movie to give the right vote.
