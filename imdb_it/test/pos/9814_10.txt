In response to "State of Confusion", dog injuries seem to disappear rather abruptly, but this may have been just a continuity error. But like children trying to build a junk plane, it's just a simple matter of imagination. These are two very young children who have an extremely active imagination and must rely on those imaginations to avoid being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that occurs in their home from their stepfather. As for his stepfather, it's very interesting that the director chose not to show his face. This makes it seem more monstrous. If you show his face, then that character becomes a person and not just this "monster" that is terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing only the conceptions of its abuse and not focusing on the abuse itself, children thus become the main focus of the film. This film has no loose ends, but it works just like a father's story for his children. It has embelleshments. This is a nice American classic.
