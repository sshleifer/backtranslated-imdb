I saw Love Life on vacation when it was filmed in a Florida film festival. It was a nice surprise to find a British film that was not derivative or instrumental. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will enchant the pants of the public prepared to sit and enjoy the delicate rhythm of the film. The transitions between the scenes distracted me a little, but overall I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the dust. One for the whole family. A pleasant change in seeing a British film for a teenage audience that is not littered with four-letter words. Try to see it.
