The clever and pungent drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and was soon on the cover of all the newspapers in America (when life imitated the film). An employee of a nuclear power plant in southern California is threatened by his superiors when he decides to make public the real story behind an accident at the plant. Apparently a problem with blocked valves, the film on a television news program shows that it was an accident that bordered on disastrous proportions - and worse still, that the security conditions were peeling off to save millions of dollars, a cover that jeopardizes the everyone's life. The film occasionally becomes too technical (especially in the second half) and could use more human interactions, however the interpretations of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (like a journalist in the right place at the right time), and Michael Douglas (as a freelance cameraman) is superb . Disposable pieces involving nuclear demonstrators are both completely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news (with its corporate structure and silly si-si-men) is vividly captured. *** 1/2 from ****
