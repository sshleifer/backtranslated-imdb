I saw this movie for the first time ever on the Sci Fi channel and I have to say ... it was just fantastic. For those of you who love "The Never Ending Story" this is one that could bring back memories of that movie. Although it is a 1996 film, it has a setting and a hazy appearance that make it seem, a fantasy. The acting was brilliant and the music was exceptional, especially the beginning of the battle song and the final song. To those of you who have yet to see it, WATCH IT! I have recommended it completely!
