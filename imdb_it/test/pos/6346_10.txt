I saw Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk and The Streets of Laredo, and now The Return to Lonesome Dove. If you are hungry more after seeing Lonesome Dove, this will fill your belly. Great cast, great story. Definitely a second close to Lonesome Dove. I will purchase this film to add to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite performance by Jon Voight. He is the Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr., who plays Isom Pickett, is not someone I have fun with, he's a nasty ass with perspective. William Peterson also does a great job. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with a performance full of anguish that reminds me of his time at NYPD Blue. My only problem with this film (and it is the collection of nits) is that I had the impression that Call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in Montana", and it is obvious that Dunnigan had already been there for a while '. A bit inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you get lost in the fantastic fairy tale. In particular, I love the apparent growth of the character of Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I've seen this movie several times and I'm ready for another sequel.
