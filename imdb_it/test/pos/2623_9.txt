Having seen only once and in the hours of dawn, I can't forget this disturbing movie. A mix of mystery, suspense and heart-rending romanticism reminds me of Vertigo. The actors, even if not so well known, are good especially Joan Hackett in one of his best performances. Believe in her, in her love, in her new quest for the freedom brought by her love, and finally in her overwhelming pain. The plot is brilliant and compelling and does not increase credibility. Management and technical things could certainly be better but do not compromise the overall effect. And he has only one message: don't let revenge blind you, you can become his last victim. A pity has not been redone, but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone.
