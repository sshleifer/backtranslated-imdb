Maybe people like to have the devil around more than God. Maybe we like that safety net of a reason; make a mistake only to blame the devil for pain and suffering in the world. There is so much adversity, which is poured into the masses, that it is difficult not to see the sadness on the faces of everything that passes. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; he knows that perhaps everything will not go well, and perhaps helping someone to leave this earth to avoid the pain that their life is waiting for them is a risk he must take for someone he loves. The credit goes to scriptwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hoge for creating lyric prose about two suburban families who have crossed paths in the good times and the bad guys. Just looking at the cast of almost all the actors on list A and B shows that the material really resonates with its audience. Emotions do not need to be worn by the sleeve to exist. Sometimes all we want is to end suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings here a sober performance that includes the interiority of the emotions of his character Leland. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man, who crosses the barriers of life, knowing what he sees and accepting the worst with the best. The film is a catharsis for the souls of those who were struck by Leland's horrendous event that killed his ex-girlfriend's brother. In the confused mind of this teenager, he comes across the accident knowing perfectly well what he was about to do, he intends to stop the pain he sees everywhere, but above all on the face of the young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately he realizes he made a mistake, that perhaps interpreting God is not a job that was put on Earth. Whether this is true or not will soon be questioned as the murder begins a chain of events, which eventually bring meaning to the lives of many people as they awaken to the tangible fragility of life. This boy has opened his eyes to pain and rebirth. <br /> <br /> With the haunting ballads sung by former Sunny Day Real Estate frontman Jeremy Enigk, the film goes through a journey of small vignettes of lives of two families in the aftermath of the tragedy. The acting is superb throughout with a special mention to a few. For someone who interprets naivety in most films, Chris Klein actually does very well with the same material here, but also with an evolution in a man of purpose. His indifference is effective when used on the right side, similar to his success in Election, and I'm interested to see if the directors will allow him to expand his talent and sink his teeth into something more substantial. Jena Malone is also effective for the same effect, interpreting the role of problematic youth as she did with Donnie Darko and Life as a House; Don Cheadle is a brave professional who gives us a different view of the compassionate therapist from what he did in Manic; and Martin Donovan is as ingenious as his grieving father who tries to keep his intelligence together and finally realizes that he must avoid his family falling apart. Also, it's nice to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When the tragedy comes, people come together to overcome everything. As Leland sharply points out at one point, you see men and women helping others and hugging each other when they see the pain and suffering that surrounds them, but after a couple of days everything returns to normal. Cheadle's character extrapolates the optimistic point of view that at least we can see the true nature of people wanting to help and be good to each other, only to be sent back with the reply, "well at least we do it during the tragedy" . Perhaps we do not want to think that we are of good character because it makes us feel that we should always be good, and that when it is bad, it must also have meaning. Being defective we allow ourselves to bounce and try again. Leland's mistake allows him to see the love he has for those around him and to open the eyes of others to wake up and not let their loved ones move away from them. It is not possible to focus on the sadness of others when they first have to deal with theirs. Hoge has created a parable for this and a really effective piece of film with the hope that many others to come.
