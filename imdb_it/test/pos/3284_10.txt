First of all, ignore the comment on how South Park should mock Republicans. Everyone is doing it now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less fun than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, this episode is simply fun. The representation of Al Gore must be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original and based on the opinions of the people of that man. I don't want to give anything, but it made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> There are also some of the best Cartman / Kyle moments ever. <br /> <br /> All in all I would say that this is one of the best episodes the show has ever had and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
