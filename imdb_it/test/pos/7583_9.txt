In the history of cinema, every great director had to create a first film. Many times seen after they have become a success, a light bulb lights up in our heads. The connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started. So it's with CAVALLI SU MARTE. It is the subtle humor that is intertwined with an apparently linear narrative that tells a great story, but that allows you to enjoy the images at the same time. In the imagination, I found great attention to detail and a production gloss that is rare in any student film. <br /> <br /> A young filmmaker always has improvements to make. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, I think that one day we will have a vision of this film as the beginning of a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie. Nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.
