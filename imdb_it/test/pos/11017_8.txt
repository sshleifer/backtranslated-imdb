Niagra Niagra was certainly not the best film I've ever seen. However, I can't describe the way the film made me feel while I watched it and how I felt when it was over and also how I feel about it now. Very few films have such an effect on me. I like them or not. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it might remind us of something or it could inspire fear or fun, etc ... This movie didn't give me the best mood. In fact, it left me somehow empty. I guess because the lives of these two people were so empty in so many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had a lot of problems to deal with and I think it was necessary to move away from what could not be a happy life. But on the way things really got worse. A constant decline from where it started. He was sad because he was so well acted and I guess we most likely saw someone in some situation that could somehow resemble the situation these people were in. They could have had a good life if they had an idea of ​​how. But it is clear that they did not know what to do. So they were mistaken for a place they had heard of. No real goal. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life that had been assigned to them. I felt sick but couldn't stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that I wouldn't like if only someone played the parts. These two did a great job to the point that you didn't see the acting. I am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it's available on DVD. You know. It made me feel a bit like Leaving Los Vegas. But again it's in a class of its own. It's not a great movie, but it's worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems, I would not suggest you look at it. It could depress you. He depressed me and I don't have the conditions that these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
