Let's start by saying that I've been a punk fan for most of my life. I have always had a certain lack of respect for the LA scene of the early 1980s, which The Decline of Western Civilization documents, with the exception of X and Black Flag, being more of New York and English punk. After seeing this movie that has completely changed. The people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic and upset kids who think they can do something other than street-Cree through their lifestyle, but it's a great show of hedonism in the best way, along with a fun and noisy rock roll . One of the best scenes, and actually the most insightful, is the interview with Claude Bessy of the Catholic Discipline, or "Kick-Boy", as was known to the readers of Slash magazine. Originally from France, he complains about punk as a dirty old French and investigates viewers about many aspects of punk, or do-it-yourself, towards music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs looks like a complete idiot most of the time, but the performance of Manimal's Germs is pretty decent, complete with a young Pat Smear. Black Flag's performance with Chavo Pederast on vocals (it was shot a couple of years before Henry Rollins joined the band) is decent, and X and FEAR give the best performances in the film. Look for interviews with young punk boys. You'll hear some of the funniest things you've ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
