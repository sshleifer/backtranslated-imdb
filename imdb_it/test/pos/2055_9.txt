There is a serious scene in this film. A scene that lets you know that his film will not attract many economic fists. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists have fallen into an ambush of automatic weapons killers. They pause and manage to get out in a barrage of shots. The main hall of the train station is now filled with the bodies of innocent people who were caught in the crossfire. Some would call it too sad and / or sad to fit them into what should be a pleasant action movie. I call it honesty. Most action movies tend to lean towards the "safe side" of showing violence and plot elements. This means mainly that, despite the meager masses, innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die. Violence is all purely the good against the bad with most of the bad guys who die. A little common sense clearly shows that this is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin showed a clue to this in his first (and sadly unique) success, Die Hard 2. The villains intentionally block a plane full of people to get their point of view. The scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people aboard, but the darkest and probably most realistic scenario was used. However, to adapt to the spirit of the first film, Die Hard 2 was mostly a "funny action movie". Here, that darker and more convincing side is pervasive. Violence is bloody. The one-liners are hilarious, but with a certain style that recalls more the natural human sarcasm than the clich√© of cinematographic jokes in the key moments of the action. The plot is also full of malicious intent compared to most action movies. The villain is not just a villain in revenge or a madman in power. It's less ridiculous, but even scarier than that. From recent films, the "Bourne" trilogy comes close to almost the less aggressive style than usual, but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before "The Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon arrived on the big screen. <Br /> <br /> Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine. And this is long before the film version of "Tomb Raider" became a hit. Also, this heroine really looks like she can take down John McClane and then take her cigarette still lit. This film marks the second role of Geena Davis's action heroine and still hasn't managed to achieve success. While Angelina Jolie stars in "Tomb Raider" years later, it marks a success. The reasons are beyond me. Completely. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is not completely obscured. There are many extravagant and spectacular scenic pieces that can only be seen in an action movie. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of pyrotechnic films, with more than one law of physics taking a convenient pause. So, here's a formula, but it's the Anti-Formula for the everyday Formula Hollywood Movie Movie. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, obscenity
