I really enjoyed this movie. Not as great as "50 First Dates", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of friends. Yes, the plot was "pretty" and maybe even incredible, but what's wrong with a good movie. Drew as Josie and his love affair with the teacher is so sweet and the wannabee baseball brother adds to the good mood of the movie. With all the junk out there, what's wrong with a good movie that the whole family can enjoy? Without being embarrassed while watching with your children! Drew is a fantastic actress who seems really not appreciated for the most part. This is definitely one of his best roles!
