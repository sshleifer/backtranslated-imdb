I remember seeing this movie in my late teens or early twenties on TV - probably HBO. I watched it with my parents, a brother and some friends. Since it was about 30 years ago, I don't remember much of the story. I remember the whole group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen. When it was over, our bellies were wounded so much by laughter. My father worked in a hospital, so it went much better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see The Party on TV lists, I try to see if this is also there. To my dismay, it never is. Even though I loved The Party, I feel this is more fun. Peter Sellers was exceptional as a dishonest hospital administrator. Because it has never been published on video is a mystery to me. It is a classic, but it seems that no one under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. I'd buy it in a second if they released it on DVD.
