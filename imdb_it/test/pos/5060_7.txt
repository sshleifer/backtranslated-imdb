An Arab American man is kidnapped from an American airport and taken to "somewhere in North Africa" ​​where he is tortured. The reason? His cell phone received a call from a well-known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid the legal means to determine if the call is a fault or just a mistake. After watching this movie, we can only pray that a terrorist does not accidentally hang a wrong number! <br /> <br /> In addition to surrender there are several related side stories. One involves the secret police chief's daughter who is torturing the suspect and her involvement with her lover who is in the night school for kamikazes. This story is too invented, but still intriguing, especially when we see that it is the result. The director uses a perfect timeline to engage the audience. <br /> <br /> The second story is the suspicious wife's attempt to find out what happened to her missing husband. She receives an old lover to help. He (an underdeveloped Saarsgard) is a senator's aide-de-camp (Alda) and soon feels cold when he realizes that his work is not worth discovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All he can do is look desperate and pregnant with a brief fit of anger. Streep is good, cold and stereotyped like the Govt. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) Officer who appears to be a Cheney clone. <br /> <br /> Even Gylenhall is wasted when a minor analyst has gone into the area where he is in the lead, even if he finally manages to do the "right thing". <br /> <br /> I found the film compelling, even if a little languid, but thought it added little to the subject. It is certainly not to be considered as definitive, and certainly has an ax to be ground. Like "The Kingdom", you scratch the surface of a very complicated topic. <br /> <br /> The film strives to give us an idea of ​​surrender, but can only end up being a "warning" on a mess one. The central point of the rendition is not "to torture" but "to suspect" the suspected terrorists, avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers. Torture, of course, can be employed, especially if surrender is out of our hands - although of course we are not without fault in this matter - but the intel that can save lives is vital in this "shadow war".
