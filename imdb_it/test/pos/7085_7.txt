"One True Thing" puts Zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to take care of his dying mother (Streep). Somber and tiring, the film studies the adult child who comes to terms with the adult vision of his parents while they are slowly revealing something less than the ideal that has grown knowing as a child. An excellent study of the characters and a production of finds with little defect, "OTT" offers three beautiful interpretations of a trio of main actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death.
