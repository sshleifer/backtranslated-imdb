This was a surprisingly good film, and an interesting idea. However, it was a bit disappointing as the "Twist" was a little too predictable and only a little too early in the film. As he watched, he started to get a little bizarre and confused to the point that the only reasonable possible result was the inevitable twist, but it certainly didn't ruin the flow of this movie. There have been superb performances, there has never been a boring boring moment, so it is absolutely worth watching this. It has always interested me to the end, and for me there aren't many films that can do it these days. I highly recommend people to watch this amazing little movie.
