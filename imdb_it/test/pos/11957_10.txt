John Cusack plays Hoops in this stupid movie that must be one of the best eighties comedies for kids. You think Demi Moore is her co-star ... If you love the eighties, grew up at that time, or I'm a distressed teenage artist getting ready to laugh. Wait until you see the cartoons ... what a revolt ...
