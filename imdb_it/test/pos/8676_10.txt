I heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie, but he described it as a mental horror. I strongly support this. <br /> <br /> It is not clear why he travels in this place, but everything is monotonous, without bright colors, without honest smiles, nothing personal. Everything is orderly and everyone seems satisfied to live this kind of life. Our "hero", although from the beginning, seems to be misplaced and feels it alone. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so important and good is the extraordinary resemblance to life in many big cities or even countries nowadays. You must work, you must not allow your colleague to know your weaknesses, show your wealth, your car, etc., and above all you miss the true love for life that children have. Of course, in this film you see neither children nor old people - they simply do not fit into a society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure this utopia doesn't come true!
