The continuation of this image will only grow over time. Better than any of the best photos named in 97 and rewards repeated views. I've seen it three times now, so I know. Anderson has been compared to some of the great American directors (Altman, Scorcese, Tarantino) and could have those influences, but it is likely that, after other films, he will be considered part of that short list. <br /> <One last note: "Amber Waves" by Julianne Moore will resonate in the memory long after other characters from the films of the 90s have faded. The best performance of the year in one of the four categories.
