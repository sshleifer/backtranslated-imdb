Passion In The Desert exemplifies the largest space. It is a visual narration, illuminated by the magnificent cinematography. The passion was shot in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. <br /> <br /> We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustin, a Napoleonic soldier, accompanies the writer and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw and paint the cultural landmarks of Egypt : its dunes, its beautiful ruins and mysterious people. <br /> <br /> But can you really "document" majestic landscapes, fragmented buildings and wild Bedouins? Can you really capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man and time? <br /> <br /> Jean and Augustin get lost in the enchanting and sparkling desert of gold, whose vastness overwhelms their senses. <br /> <br /> "You cannot get lost in Egypt! There is the Nile, and there is the sea!", says the dehydrated Augustin, and soon discovers an ancient tortuous cave that leads to a sumptuous ruin. <br /> <br /> Delirious and almost delirious, try to rest; a perplexed sound wakes him up; his eyes, his body and his emotions become hypnotically stuck in time as he stumbles into a sensual and sensory experience .... <br /> <br /> A wild and elegant female leopard stares at him, and their story of love begins. ... <br /> <br /> A daring love, a bold film.
