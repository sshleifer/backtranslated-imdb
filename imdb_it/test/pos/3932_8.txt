I saw a preview of this Tuesday evening with a group of friends and we had so much fun! After seeing peaks of surprise for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so 6/10) I liked it a lot more! As I saw in the trailer, one shot I had was believing that an entire city could be "forgotten", but this is a horror popcorn movie and so I accept it for what it is. <br /> <br /> My only major complaint I thought Paris Hilton would have waxed or would have dipped etc. and moan "it's hot" but they didn't (how could they resist ???). <br /> <br /> There is NO NUDITY from the 2 girls, even if Paris looks fantastic in her lingerie! I'm surprised they didn't put a third "victim of a hot token" in the movie for some useless nudity that's the norm for this kind of movie! I will not list any sightings of death or plot, BUT I will say that Paris and Eliza have mistreated themselves well! <br /> <br /> The characters are developed in a decent way and are quite nice (not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die) and the film has a decent pace, even if nothing happens in the first 30 minutes like most of horror movies. br /> <br /> I gave him an 8/10 as he gave me good bravado and gore and I had low expectations. If you go with some friends who like cheesy horror movies, you'll have fun. <br /> <br /> Noah
