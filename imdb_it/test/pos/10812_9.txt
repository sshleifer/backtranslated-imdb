Set in 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film portrays the struggle for power between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at his best) and Robespierre (an impressive performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton returned to Paris from his country residence where he was deposed as head of the Public Security Committee in the previous year by Robespierre. He opposes "The Reign Of Terror", which led to the execution of thousands of citizens, mainly guillotines, who are believed to be opposed to the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb his bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee fear that Danton's popularity will bring them to ruin, and will put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. This was the first French-language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was shut down by the government because of its support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His previous film "Man Of Iron" (1981) had to do with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to make comparisons between Walesa's relationship with Polish leader Jaruselski, and that between Danton and Robespierre . Danton / Walesa are the voice of the opposite reason to Robespierre / Jaruselski who continues the dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish comedy "The Danton Affair" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and at its release the film was criticized by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is focus on the meetings behind the scenes of the Committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and in the courtroom rather than on the activities on the streets of Paris.
