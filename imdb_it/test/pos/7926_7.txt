This was the first project completed by Eisenstein in over ten years. The film takes place in the 13th century during an invasion of the Germans by the Germans (I believe the Teutonic Knights). Released in 1938, it is a very loose parallel with Russia's upcoming involvement in World War II and Germany's progress in Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, the most notable of the battle towards the end of the film, and there is a shock when children are thrown into a fire pit, but it is not an easy watch. The film draws and is not as bright as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein is better in clips. Its brilliance is present, however, and is a "must see" for Eisenstein fans and film historians. Russian propaganda at its best.
