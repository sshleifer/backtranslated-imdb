Misfit recruits private Owens tests to teach the skills of master Sgt Moore (Jack Webb). No explosions or bloodshed or hip or sex soundtrack. It is set in the Parris Island S.C. training camp. of the USMC and most of the cast were real marines. Memorable one-liners abound and the "dedicated to ..." closing credit is intense. With such strong male and female characters, this film could not be realized in today's hateful world.
