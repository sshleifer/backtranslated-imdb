The reason I think this film is fabulous is that it has so many levels of emotion. From the script and the fabulous acting you can say that there is a story behind all the feelings that are there. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why they don't do others. You can feel sympathy and joy, love and sadness for all of them at once. See humanity at its best And at its worst. You can relate to the characters because, although you may never have been in their exact situations, before seeing qualities and falls in them that you see in yourself. In a sense this film makes you think, but in the end it explains and feels a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. I will say that I have NEVER ever cried so much in my life nor did I get so much out of something. I beg you to watch this movie and take it in your heart. That there is only one real thing and that is ... love.
