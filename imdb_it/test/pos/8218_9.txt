If you are reading this review, I give you a lot of credit. You care enough to actually watch this movie, that most people have forgotten and then bothered to read over the first review! So for your pleasure to read ... <br /> <br /> I suppose you already know the plot, so I won't waste time writing it. I will say that Sandra Bullock did a fantastic job with this film. He really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. I can say this because I happen to be a computer programmer. <br /> <br /> However, I thought the basic plot was very good. You can easily create sub-frames on your mainframe and turn it into a very funny movie. The premise is also frighteningly realistic as this can really happen if the right precautions are not taken. <br /> <br /> To do a long review soon ... oops! Too late! If you like Sandra Bullock to bring a role to life and you want to see a movie very well done for the time, take a look at this little gem. You will not be disappointed. :-)
