This is one of the most intriguing and cerebral films I've ever seen. The language of the script, the costumes, the scenery, the plot, the characters, etc. They are all supreme. You will not be bored. I watched intensely or even listened to this film while working so many times that I lost count. Scarlett ages gracefully, acquiring wisdom beyond her years at the end. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland where her family comes from and see the results of another civil war played there, this time between Irish and English. <br /> <br /> This film describes the double standards of men at the moment - a man is still respected if he has girlfriends and whores, but not a woman. If it is simply seen in a private place with a man, the company accuses her of impropriety. And of course Scarlett has always thought outside the box, breaking the rules when necessary to create the necessary change, help people and / or survive. Scarlett's beauty is certainly up to it. His strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow as he ages. <br /> <br /> I remember his jokes when I face too much on my plate, like "tomorrow is another day" and the way he behaved, his determination and courage, and he has learned from her experiences. This is a good movie to show your daughters how to teach a woman how important it is to have respect for yourself, and that men, especially the very beautiful ones, can have two sides and treat a woman differently, depending on how acts and respects itself. An attractive woman needs to learn what this film teaches. <br /> <br /> This film is like a therapy for me, and it's better than Gone with the Wind. The second part takes place in Ireland and anyone who is decent Irish will appreciate the scenery, the people and the character of Scarlett within her.
