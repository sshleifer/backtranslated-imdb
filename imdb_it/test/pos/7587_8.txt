Having already seen this short film on VHS tape with the Summer Stock feature, I just reviewed every Sunday on the TCM website. It marked the feature film debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and 14-year-old Judy Garland outside her two older sisters. These two boys show off their musical talents with a solo by Deanna de "The Kiss", then one by Judy from "Waltz with a Swing" before the two highlights with "Americana". The slight plot of this 11-minute film is about the possible unemployment of Edna (Durbin's real name which is the way it is addressed here), the grandfather's management job at the park due to low attendance. With the help of the two girls, you can probably guess what happens from there! The contrasts are marked not only with the musical choice of Garland and Durbin, but also with their height, balance and movement. In spite of everything, in the end they behaved rather well and it is almost surprising that MGM chose Garland while Durbin had already been hired at Universal, as this short film was made, but was briefly granted for her feature film debut (Three Smart Girls ) in the early years prepare the phases. Judy herself would make her first feature film (Pigskin Parade) at 20th Century-Fox while MGM was deciding which movie she would play next. It would be Broadway Melody of 1938 in which she was playing the number of the series "Dear Mr. Gable". But back to this short, Every Sunday offers a warm and wonderful cross-section of two-star singers at the beginning of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them ...
