Hurray for Korean cinema! Last year I saw "Chungyang" and "Nowhere to hide", now I have reached the directorial debut of Hur Jin-ho "Christmas in August". The variety of themes and the level of achievement speak highly of a mature national cinema for discovery. The main themes of this film are death and love. The graceful and considerate way Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) faces his imminent death and the sublimation of his desires towards Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) for his true love. I was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, protecting Darim from unnecessary pain without refusing it. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of film is based on the skill of the actors. Han and Shim excel, both being quite expressive but naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, relatives, friends and clients of Jung Won, are quickly outlined to enrich the story without detracting from its main objective. LIVING is loving, but everything must pass. Pain subsides. Life goes on.
