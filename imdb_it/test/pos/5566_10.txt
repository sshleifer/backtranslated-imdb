This series is very undervalued. Like many others, I came across Farscape after the series was canceled. Bought Season 1 and was surprised to find a cleverly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, spirit and, of course, sci-fi. Soon after we got 10 to be the first series or a movie to satisfy us as our hero - and every alien he comes in contact with - you speak English! Okay, some others have touched on the problem, but Farscape has done the best. The point is that the writers pay close attention to the details to make the show as credible as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced and fun series like Farscape don't get enough visibility and recognition to stay in production. While we enjoy the four seasons and, fortunately, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
