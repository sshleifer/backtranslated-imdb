It might interest people to know that this film was made without resorting to the same Phoolan Devi and, when he finally saw some parts of it, he was so furious that he announced that the film would not be shown in India or that it would be covered with petrol she set fire to herself. I don't know if it was shown or not, but since she was standing as an emerging politician, I doubt it. Since then, I have seen a report that has been banned from the post and accused of further crimes since its Dacoit days, and has therefore hidden itself secretly. <br /> <br /> Apart from his concerns, this is an excellent film, made even more extraordinary by his brutally brutal approach; none of the pink melodramas could be expected from a typical Indian film. It should be emphasized that concerns about the way in which the messages of the film are really feminist and the like are essentially irrelevant: it is a true story. His fears are, apparently, not with what is represented, but with the way the film portrays it.
