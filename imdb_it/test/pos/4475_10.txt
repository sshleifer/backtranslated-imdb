What an incredible story and what a great movie! Hat starts for Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so easily yet so powerfully. I observed him spellbound, almost holding his breath as the story unfolded towards his inexorable end. The execution of this film was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us to understand the strange Platonic bond, absolute so possessive between two creatures that do not want to be part of the other's world. Both are capable of affection, but ironically, it is the most "evolved" one who becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the freedom of the other. It is one of the most fascinating and intriguing aspects of the many forms of love, and an incredible study of how human love can sometimes be overwhelming and destructive. <br /> <br /> Only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality.
