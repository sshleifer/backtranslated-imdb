In a nutshell, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes broke off. First: The part where he was set up to wash the bathroom, but he ended up drinking the water from the toilet while he imagined it was the director giving him a golden shower !!! (I laughed so much!) <br /> <br /> Second: The part where he tried to prove himself worthy of a swimming school instructor. He looked like a professional who dived, but as expected, he couldn't swim (at least ^^). However the fun part of this was when he finally reached the end and said "how it was" or something like that. It was so hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this animated series, I highly recommend it. One of the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> Definitely the most fun!
