Many animation enthusiasts consider Wladyslaw Starewicz the great forgotten genius of a special branch of art, the animation of puppets, which he invented almost by himself. . . and, as it happened, almost by accident. As a young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than in cinema, but his failed attempt to film two beetles led to an unexpected turn in the film when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them by a frame at once. This discovery led to the production of the classic short film by Starewicz THE THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, which he made in Russia in 1912, at a time when cinematographic animation of all genres was still in its infancy. <br /> <br /> the turmoil of the Russian Revolution caused Starewicz to move to Paris, where one of his first productions - by coincidence? - it was a dark political satire variously known as "Frogland" or "The frogs who wanted a king". A variety of black comedy can be found in almost all of Starewicz's films, but here it is indeed very obscure, aimed more at adults who can appreciate the satirical aspects of children, who are most likely to find the shocking climax. (I am middle-aged and found it quite upsetting, myself.) And indeed, the imprints of the film destined for English-speaking viewers of the 1920s were equipped with playing cards full of word games and jokes to help soften the sharp burning of the final. <br /> <br /> Our story is set in a swamp, the Commonwealth of Frogland, where citizens are not happy with their government and hold a special session to see what they can do to improve things. They decide to implore Jupiter for a king. The crowds are impressively animated in this opening sequence - it wouldn't have been easy to make so many frog puppets seem alive simultaneously - while Jupiter, for its part, is depicted as a funny white-bearded boy in the clouds that looks like as if he'd rather take a nap. When Jupiter sends them a god similar to a tree that looks at them impassively, frogs decide that this is not an improvement and require a different king. Irritated, Jupiter sends them a stork. <br /> <br /> Happy of this new formidable king who dominates above them, the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. The mayor comes forward to hand over the Commonwealth key while newsreel cameras record the event. To everyone's horror, the stork promptly eats the mayor and then goes on a rampage, swallowing the citizens at random. A title reads dry: "The news on the appetite of the king spread throughout the kingdom". When the frogs now terrified once again plead with Jupiter for help, he loses his temper and takes a shower at the community with lightning. The moral of our story, pronounced by an unfortunate frog just before being eaten, is "Leave it well enough." <br /> <br /> Considering the period in which this surprising little film was made, and considering the fact that it was created by a Russian emigrant at the height of the civil war of the besieged country, it would be easy to see it as a parable of those events. Starewicz may or may not have had in mind the tumult of Russia when he created "Frogland", but whatever prompted his choice of material, the film presents itself as a warning of universal application. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s, or any other country of any era that lowers its guard and is overwhelmed by tyranny. It is a fascinating film, even fascinating in its macabre way, but its message is not a joke.
