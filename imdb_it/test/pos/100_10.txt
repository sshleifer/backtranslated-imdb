The best short I have ever seen. Some commentators suggest that it may have been lengthened, due to the density of intuition it offers. There is irony in that comment and little merit. The acting is all up to Noonan and brings his ungrateful character perfectly. I would have preferred the narrator to be less "recognizable", but the gravity given is perfect. This is an abbreviation for people who read, for those whose "bar" is high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge defenders and bitter beauty defenders. A beautiful short film. FWIW: I liked the reference to Picasso, since I once believed that Picasso was just another art prostitute with little talent; as, I presume, most people - until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12 years old. Picasso was a more refined designer and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists can ever become in a lifetime. I immediately understood why he had to make the art for which he had become famous.
