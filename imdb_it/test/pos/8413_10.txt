Following directly from the last episode of the previous series Yes Minister. <br /> <br /> Jim Hacker is now at 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Great Britain, instead of a Cabinet Minister and a member of the government, he is now head of His Majesty's government. <br /> <br /> All this after some intriguing maneuvers by Sir Humphrey Appleby after the previous Prime Minister resigned at the end of Yes Minister. <br /> <br /> Sir Humphrey Appleby is now head of the Civil Service. <br /> <br /> I thought this series was better than the first series, or even if it didn't last as long as the first series unfortunately.
