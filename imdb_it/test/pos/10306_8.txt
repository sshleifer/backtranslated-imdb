I agree with Andy, this is a good movie. Kevin McKidd's character is believable throughout the film. We are forced to hate him and, ultimately, sympathize with him. Paula Sage, who plays Roberta, also puts in a good performance. It is stimulating and emotional without excessive excessive production. We thank the director Alison Peebles and the writer Andrea Gibb for this. A very useful vision. The rhythm of the film is right, arousing the slightest interest in the topic you are writing in, rather than bombarding you with facts in a documentary style. Beautiful little soundtrack to accompany the film, again used sparingly, so as not to distract you from the plot. Recommended.
