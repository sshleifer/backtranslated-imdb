From the offset, I knew it would be a fantastic film, the rhythm, the cinematography, the indigenous personalities of the Dallas area, the diversification of the characters, not to mention the director Oliver Stone and, of course, Eric Bogasian ... The film begins on Friday (suggestively occult in the first place) and starts with a radio station in Dallas that hosts their number one talk show, The Barry Champlain Show (based on talk radio presenter Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric Bogasian) is the host of radio and abrasive talk shows and his work is such that it is mandatory to pontificate all the sensationalist nuances of the radio audience that feeds on his show ... He tries to commiserate with a group of social deviants left alone, vulnerable , obscene telephone operators who have the masochistic desire to be publicly denigrated, Barry Champlain is effective in coping with this precarious genus, degrading them socially rather than simply submerging them making them to the mere warning ... New techno logies have a stigmatic purpose for the Dallas radio audience, and the basic concepts take on a secondary role in perversion, they speak of "Baseball Scores, Orgasms and People's Pets !!" <br /> <br /> The whole thing is a cacophony of drugs - it has induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia !! This high-profile cannon fodder is something Barry Champlain thrives on !!! The twisted pathos, the unbalanced tendencies that emerge from the nonsense and the tricks of pornography and the afflictions of the global pop culture serve as volatile ammunition for the battlefield of Barry Champlain !! <br /> <br /> The setting of this film is perfect due to the fact that there is a drop of two thousand feet in terms of ideology .. In the center of Dallas there is an overpowering sense of cosmopolitan awareness, in which 20 miles away reside in a significant chapter of the Ku Klux Klan !! ... The game is based in Denver, this is where the real story takes place, other small theatrical performances depict the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the film takes place, I thought it was an excellent choice !! ... This film illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous misconceptualisation of the Jewish people in America, for which they control the banks, their program is different from all the others and their intellectual literature leads to perversion !! These preconceived notions combine the general dilemma of Barry Champlain !!! Barry Champlain's personal downfall is that he is quick-tempered and unresponsive to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate downfall, this is what makes the film so believable !! <br /> <br /> The characters in the film were well played, Dan, the tailor created for middle man hatchet man (played by Alec Baldwin) who constantly monitored every movement of Barry Champlain !! .. Laura, his girlfriend, even his producer, will constantly hear that Barry is someone who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, is the recipient of Barry's anguish and selfishness, but he cannot give up his feelings for Barry, regardless of the personal destruction path he ends up using !! The Dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially out-of-place retro-bates who are dejectedly amused by their own shortcomings !!! ... In part, all hang-ups including Barry Champlain's hang-ups are what he does in Barry Champlain! ! His audience observes depravity, urges improvement and eventually becomes Barry Champlain's pet project for prescribed sinners !! The conflicts of social culture become the ruin of Barry Champlain !! <br /> <br /> This movie is superb !! In my opinion the best image of Oliver Stone, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers. This statement in itself tells you how great a movie is, Talk Radio is ... Eric Bogosian's consulting and acting and co-production story is simply compelling !! The shots of the camera, the dialogues, the disquieting characters of the characters, all first-rate ... The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the film is exceptional !! Dallas has the questionable distinction of being considered a mega metropolis ... So now, just like Los Angeles and New York, there are cases of baby cracks too numerous to count, low-cost residential neighborhoods from hell and budget cuts that mean that there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by next year !!!! ... Dallas states that it is a status of a large metropolitan area in the precarious way in which human depravity prevails !! The city has its radio listeners who gave a pejorative inspiration to the wonder of air wave communication at the national level !! These are the culprits in the movie !! The disgusting derelict tabloids who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity have morally erased "The last neighborhood in America"
