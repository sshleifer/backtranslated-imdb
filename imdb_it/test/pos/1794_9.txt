In Fassbinder's previous films, his ideas sometimes surpassed his ability to perform them. He has always been a great writer, but it took him some time to focus on his work with the camera and storytelling. <br /> <br /> The four-season merchant is one of Fassbinder's first films to make great use of color, from bright green pears in the merchant's cart to bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder film ? Who would have thought). His work with the camera was coming there too, but it was still quite minimalist. Occasional zooms sometimes seem a little awkward and unnatural, but then again, Fassbinder was still emerging from his purely avant-garde phase. This could be due to the fact that Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but rather a slightly lower Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> However, this is Fassbinder, and here you find your solution. Broken dreams shown so vividly and smoothly to alienate the public and push them into a depressed stupor. Just what the doctor ordered. An early classic that shows a remarkable progression compared to its first films released only 2 years before.
