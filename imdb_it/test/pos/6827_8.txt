Jack and Kate first meet the doctor Daniel Farady and then the psychics Miles Straume and show that they did not come to the island with the intention of saving the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis and Ben Linus shoot them. Meanwhile, Jack's group finds pilot Frank Lapidus, who has landed the helicopter with minor damage that can be repaired. Jack forces Miles to say the real intention they came to the island for. <br /> <br /> The second episode of the fourth season returns to the island, with four new characters, stops the confused "flash-forward" and it seems that finally it will be the beginning of the explanations that I (and most fans and viewers) we expect to receive in "Lost". Because the government's interest in Ben Linus and the way it is informed by the boat are some of the questions I expect to see in future episodes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
