The film deals with universal themes, without mentioning any specific country as a context: it could happen anywhere - and it has, in essence, if it does not form. Those who are concerned about the issues of the first amendment, censorship, and others - but do not want to get bored with the lessons - need art like this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire. <br /> <br /> Rickman is certainly an actor of undervalued character; he shines in this film, showing several acting talents that you absolutely have to see (I have yet to see him give a bad performance, even if in films that are not too big). Stowe offers perhaps his best performance (and proves he has one of Hollywood's most striking eyes) - in two words: amazing, convincing. <br /> <br /> The set adapts perfectly to the situation, in function and mood. Changing the sound increases to the appropriate effect. The total contrast transmitted through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device - and the welcome and relief only for most of the necessary place in history. The script is narrow and essential, with an engaging, dramatic but realistic dialogue (ie, how it could be and should be). Perhaps the most surprising aspect to address is the fact that 1) this is the first time the director comes out; and 2) is the writer. In one sentence: a tour de force - with three recommendations: seeing it, owning a copy, seeing it repeatedly to probe all its secrets and grasping all its genius.
