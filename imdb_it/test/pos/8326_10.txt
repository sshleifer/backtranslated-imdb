When Jurassic Park was released for the first time, it was revolutionary in the film and in special effects. For the first time ever people go on a dinosaur film and are convinced that they were watching the real dinosaurs brought to life. However, some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the real creatures could have been (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.) some were altered to fit the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) and the film took place in the present on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. Walking with dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their true habitats all those millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great. Now we can see places like a sad Triassic desert, a whole herd of Diplodocus, an Icthyosaur give birth, a MASSIVE sea monster, a view of pterosaurs, dinosaurs thrive at the South Pole, two Torosaurus locking horns, T.Rex roaring at the camera and at the impact of the comet who wrote their fate. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim. But the series also reveals the other creatures with whom they shared the world, two episodes mainly focused on two different types of animals, the flying Pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived under the waves. The settings and landscapes are spectacular and seem even more unique when a CG Dino enters the screen. And as for CGI and animatronics, CGI dinosaur movements seem totally and completely natural, the coloring is bright and vivid and the crew members took precautions to ensure that CG animals interact with their environments in any way a real creature by splashing in water, brushing away bushes, lifting dust and throwing shadows on the ground. Indeed the CG is not perfect with some short examples where the animals seem too computerized but the rest of the time seems breathtaking. In some cases the puppet theater is scarce, but its moments in particular the scene with the Cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's narrative is quite good and provides us with both vital and dramatic information. But of course the real pleasure is to see a living dinosaur doing what they did all those years ago and also to see some really nice moments with Cynodont puppies (mammals / reptiles hybrid), Sauropodlets (baby Diplodocus) and T.Rex chicks ( Yes, even T .Rex can be nice) and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and even more so then. All this adds up to a prehistoric nature masterpiece that lets you see a real dinosaur and take your breath away, all from the safety of your living room. If you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, extraordinary images or just to have a really good vision and have fun, then Walking With Dinosaurs is definitely for you. Easily recommended
