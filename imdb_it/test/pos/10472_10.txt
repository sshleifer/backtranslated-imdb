Yes, you can consider the Feast of Babette as a kind of slap on Puritan Christianity, but it is much more than that. The superficial story of how a gifted Parisian cook escapes from Paris after one of his revolutions by the middle classes and finds himself on the ground in Jutland, northern Denmark, is simply the fat that allows the deepest story to develop. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people who for centuries have been guided by fatuous, vain, greedy and arrogant politicians who kill beauty for profit, something politics always does , step National Endowment for the Arts, which simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is on her last legs as she arrives in the small village where two virginal sisters reside who see their growing flock of devotees to their dead pastor father. They live with cod and black bread jelly. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple devout people that God is in pleasure and sensuality, as well as in behavioral and mental purity. It also shows how that mental purity can lead to the control of strangeness, something that we all know these days of neo-authoritarians in the government that would limit our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state, or as they would say, 'humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette prepares a French dinner to celebrate the 100th birthday of the deceased reverend. The daughters and their flock think it is the devil coming between them and swearing not to notice the food or drink. <br /> <br /> It is at this point, in the preparation of the meal, paid by Babette's winnings in a French lottery, which I begin to cry. It is an audacity produced in comparison to the everyday vulgarity and lies that flood our consciousness from morning to night through the media and the power merchants who maneuver to gain advantages over all of us out here in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple refinement of Babette's art spits in front of all the pretentiousness shown in our modern society, and it hurts to see it interpreted so exquisitely in this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> It is, along with Fanny och Alexander (Bergman), my absolute favorite film, yet I can only watch it once in a while because, like a rare bottle of wine served with Blinis and fresh oysters, it is something that should not be overcrowded. <br /> <br /> A great, big movie that should be in every movie lover's library.
