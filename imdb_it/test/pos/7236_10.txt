Tromeo and Juliet (1996) is another jewel in the film archives of Troma Studios. Such as The Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Class of Nuke 'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. this film is a Troma classic. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet by taking a medieval tragedy and reinventing it as a modern punk street drama. If you saw or read the game before anything changed, except that it was "tromatised". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his distorted vision to the script and makes it a very funny movie. The actors handle the script very well. I was surprised by the way they performed the dialogue, much better than some high-budget Hollywood actors who use a monstrous budget and expensive series. I really enjoyed this movie. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions. I'd rather watch one of his films and have fun rather than watch a boring expensive movie with spoiled paid actors, limping scripts, lazy directors and those horrible C.G.I. special effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like funny movies with special cheese effects, top acting and inspired directing, then this movie is just for you!
