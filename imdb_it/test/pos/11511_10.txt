First of all: if you like watching movies I advise you NOT to watch this. Why? Later on you will not appreciate any other film more easily ... <br /> <br /> Actually I don't want to arouse excessive expectations, but it is almost scary how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of Einar Gudmundsson is. When in most films there is at least one aspect that spoils everything, like good actors but horrible dialogues or a beautiful scenario but a low budget cinematography ?? in "Angels of the Universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence, in reality everything is simply fantastic, even (and no less important) the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur RÃ³s. <br /> <br /> In this story about Pall, a schizophrenic student after being downloaded by his girlfriend, especially the dialogues (and monologues) deserve some attention: along with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot goes from depressing and fatalistic to the complete opposite of the comic and completely absurd. Moreover, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such poetic beauty that the film almost moves into a surreal sphere and is saved in the real world only by its incredibly authentic actors. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments was already referring to another point: this film is not a trivial entertainment to relax in the evening, although among the various comic reliefs there is largely a disturbance, in part cynical and bitter, and above all sad. a modern poem about a life of madness with all its emptiness, anger and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: when did you see the movie ?? look at it again. There are some great metaphors and visual allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and link them with the moral of the story. "And of course: read the book, it contains a lot of smaller funny stories in between and it also makes you understand some things in the film a little better.
