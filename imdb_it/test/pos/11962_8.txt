Thus began "One Crazy Summer", the evil twin of "Better off dead ..". How can a movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by David Lee Roth? <br /> <br /> This film is a total explosion. Pairing again with John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix has great and fun results. Hyperactive Bobcat grateful to everyone's nerves, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the son of a deranged army with pacifist tendencies, and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) Like the love interest of, again, chronically depressed Cusack. <br /> <br /> The story is, well, quite simple. There are laughs, but both Savage films Steve Holland have a certain quality for them ... they are fun, but they are also sweet. The scene where Curtis finds a doll crackling on the target's beach, and starts meditating on how a little girl won't be able to sleep was dumb, funny and moving. The animation used throughout is rather surreal. "The Boat" is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and Odie plush). Overall, a funny movie, although not as good as "Better dead ..."
