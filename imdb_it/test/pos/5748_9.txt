This film was fantastic. I was in tears at the end of the film. Okay, I know acting has sucked but it's not what was important. The message came through loud and clear about God's love for us and Jesus' sacrifice. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, whether it was Pete's anger at the sneers of the blonde girl or the questioning boy . But he also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were fantastic and the actors were very hot and that caught my eye. But what I liked most about this film was the clear message of the Gospel. The mother and pastor supported Ben on his new journey with Christ and sought to be a divine example to others. Nicky D has shown that it doesn't matter if the whole world has to offer, without Christ, it doesn't matter. Nina showed how a wrong but good person can easily miss the mark. I loved this movie and I think it will bring many teenagers to Christ.
