"Rattlesnake! Attention!" "Is it a bra you wear or do you expect a murder attempt?" "Spaz, what are you a homo or what ?!" "Ok, good job, feed Fink, he's our hot man" "You know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union, East Germany and the West and the most recent Olympic power, Trinidad -Tobago." "Oh Spaz, old master of makeup!" "What, no mustard ?!" "Oh my God, his nose bleeds." "It will get even bigger now" "Our round table ... Henry Kissinger will appear, Yassir Arafat will leave, he will spend a weekend with the children just for rap with them." <br /> <br /> These and many other big lines make Meatballs a successful comedy. Only in Caddyshack is Bill Murray more fun. He probably abused half the lines. The high school actors seemed to enjoy the same movie with him. <br /> <br /> Fun movie to watch at any time of year, not just in summer.
