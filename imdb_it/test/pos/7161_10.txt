I just returned from the GLBT Film Festival at the AMC Loews 34th in New York. A friend told me about this movie. The public response was very positive! Many good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization. Top notch in every area. A film that makes you think, and then realizes how lucky we would be if we could go back in time and live without shame or guilt. I imagine that this will come closer, if you don't win, to the prize of the favorite public! What was most surprising was the fact that the film seems to start as a satire and then slowly intertwines in a genuine comment on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the group itself that has begun to satirize. There is no petty humor at the expense of a group, just a slow awareness that we would all be better off if we returned to the sweet innocence with which we all started.
