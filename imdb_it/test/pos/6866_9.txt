This film will send you chills down your spine, even if you don't understand German. I saw it for the first time in my German high school class and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 more times since * it was only a couple of years ago * and it's nice to watch a movie night. Plastic-coated bodies are mostly real, used by Body Worlds. This film was an out-lash for this. A German Dr. * nicknamed Dr. Death * has begun to laminate human bodies for visualization and now Body Worlds is a touring affair right now in Chicago IL. Many people opposed this and so a great German horror film was made. I personally love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who loves thriller thriller movies.
