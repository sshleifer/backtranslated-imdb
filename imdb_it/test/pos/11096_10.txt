THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a superb example of anti-80s movies. While many other films of the decade generally lacked substance, this film is pure substance. There is nothing elegant, fake or superfluous. It boasts two superb performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as longtime friends respectively Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of actors from the early 80s, all looking for much bigger and better things (all 3 protagonists of TAPS). While the popularity of Penn and Cruise has grown, Hutton has been largely forgotten, and it's a shame. In fact, Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for the supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this film is even more exceptional. <br /> <br /> Hutton really captures the post-Vietnam war rebellion in his character Chris Boyce. Student of the failed seminary school, Chris has a love-hate relationship with his father, well played by the great lead actor Pat Hingle. The scene in which Chris mentions the poetry that his father thought he had long forgotten is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> Chris gets a job at the Defense Department and uses his hatred of the US government and his foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans for old projects to the Soviets. Make his friend Daulton, a hyper-drugged auto-server, the courier of the microfilm project plans. While Chris is doing it based on his beliefs, Daulton is doing it strictly for the money. The Soviet connection is very well interpreted by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a really extravagant chemistry and it's kind of a fun series of exchanges between them. But, make no mistake, this movie is everything but that. It is a serious study of pessimism, malaise, paranoia and distrust. <br /> <br /> Once again, the protagonists make this film. Hutton offers a subtly brilliant performance like Chris, a rather intelligent young man who had so much potential. Penn, as usual, has a formidable characterization like Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before thinking, and most of the time he doesn't think at all. The end of this fact-based film is very sad at different levels. A really powerful character study.
