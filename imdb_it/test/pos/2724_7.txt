15 Park Avenue in Aparna Sen is a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A young delirious girl, inclined to imagine things and hear the voices, possibly out of pure boredom, is considered schizophrenic by her educated father and elderly stepsister trained in control. Controlled, compassionate and treated as an invalid (even if for love and affection), it has the ghost of a chance to develop as a normal person. When a boy offers to marry her, his father and his stepsister passionately try to convince him to take a step in that direction. A traumatic experience, caused mainly by his protected existence, eventually takes her beyond the line of no return, and lives full time in her delirious world. <br /> <br /> The family and the society that surround it are intolerant to its disappointments and want to suppress them with medicines, electroshock therapy, anything, even if they have all the disappointments of one type or another. <br /> <br /> His mother does not see the irony in allowing a phantom-buster to treat her of disappointments. His half-sister is a professor of physics, teaching quantum mechanics, a subject in which a stream of experts accepts multi-parallel universes and many other dimensions in space compared to the 3 we see. A friend tells with admiration an experience with a saintly person who claims to hear hallucinatory voices. Far away, George W. Bush has real or false disappointments about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, and he is allowed to invade Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some viewers have already pointed out, Aparna Sen has avoided attacking the mother of all illusions - general religions, which is a sin. <br /> <br /> In other words, the accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believe. It has been like this since the beginning, and many more powerful people than Mithali in the film, including Bruno and Galileo, have suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> The controversial and difficult final of the film was necessary to show that it is a film about the nature of reality, and not about the case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All the casts have given great results, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma have excelled. Aparna Sen has produced an exceptional philosophical film.
