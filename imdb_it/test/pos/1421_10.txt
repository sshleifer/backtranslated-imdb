ATTENTION: MAY contain some minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say anything negative about this movie, except for one thing. <br /> <br /> DON'T GET TO SEE IT MUCH MORE !! !! Then again, maybe it's because you have to be at home in the morning or at 3 am to catch the Fox Movie channel. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because this is another jewel lost in time, Clifton Webb takes his acid and patented Contegno which he perfected as Lynn Belvedere ("Sitting Pretty" and sequel), and transforms 'Nature Boy' . <br /> <br /> Actually, that's it. <br /> <br /> Webb plays Robert Jordan as a guest of a Sunday children's educational program that is losing audience share, and the network tells him he has to do something about it, or. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married guest has no children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But when these things happen, the local church pastor needs a leader for a rebel Boy Scouts troop, and he finds a volunteer victim ... ahhhh 'VOLUNTARY' ... in the host, so Jordan takes the position. <Br /> <br /> Problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> WRONG !!! Being a film there are other problems. <br /> <br /> For example, it turns out that one of the Scouts is the son of his boss at the television station, which causes a small friction; especially since the child is overweight, has asthma and an attitude. <br /> <br /> And it's the most reasonable. <br /> <br /> Also, there's this scout puppy, Mike (George Winslow) who wants to hang around, being the "stray puppy" type. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the reason is that he has no people of his own, but is cared for by a relative who does not have much time for him. <br /> <br /> These are things like this that make his job harder than expected. <br /> <br /> All in all, Webb becomes more understanding towards children, and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson, and eventually even adopts Mike. <br /> <br /> Still a great movie after all these years.
