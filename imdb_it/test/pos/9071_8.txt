Very suspenseful and surprisingly clever film about five medical students preparing to plan and then being revived to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond. Joel Schumacher directs with a certain skill - creating very disturbing and particularly beautiful scenes. The visions of death are not what viewers could expect, nor what awaits us when we go, thanks to screenwriter Peter Filardi who really did an exceptional job with this story. While the creativity of history is impressive, the story has many holes, particularly in the logical department and in the credibility factors. Despite everything Flatliners is an effective film because of the script, the direction that is sometimes very surreal and the acting that unites four gifted actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors acts and reacts very well to each other. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as head of the group - the one who comes up with the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He also manages to play a man - a young man - with a harmful and destructive secret of his past. Kevin Bacon is the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as a voice of reason and human fears. Platt has some really good lines and plays paranoia well. Yes, even Julia Roberts is here and very good. actors do better if they play one another and make us believe they are such good friends. I was duly impressed by many Flatliner, but more than anything else the story struck me most. The scene with that dog that zigzagged in the street only one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the "flashback" scenes.
