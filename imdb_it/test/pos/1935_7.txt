This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's first films and certainly has an unconventional theme. He is making money by dancing with men in a ballroom. She really doesn't like work, but it's a life. Her boyfriend looks like a good boy, but she is also persecuted by the rich Ricardo Cortez. Well, after getting married, it turns out that her "good boy" is a weasel thief and womanizer and the rich Cortez turns out to be a boy. At the end of the film, Barbara simply had enough, as every SANE woman would have walked by this horrid marriage. <br /> <br /> In the 1920s and early 1930s, Hollywood did pretty much whatever it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that surprised many today - such as nudity, adultery and the bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE is not a clear example of this morality, it has a theme that would never have been allowed after the tempered production code was created and applied starting in 1934. Somehow the Code was fantastic - after all the parents did not have to worry about what their children saw in the movies (such as nudity in BEN HUR, 1925). However, he also tended to disinfect some films too well - and it is not possible that this particular film was made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce - a serious no-no 1934 and thereafter. This is really a pity, because I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was a bad argument to discuss, especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a walking thief. Even so, letting the film end in divorce and marrying a man who had been divorced twice might not have been the case. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is interesting and inspiring. Furthermore, it was well structured and suited to its relatively short execution time. Take a look at this. <br /> <br /> FYI - Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortez was NOT actually Hispanic, but changed his name due to possible bias because he was Jewish. He was an excellent man of his time, but today he is almost forgotten.
