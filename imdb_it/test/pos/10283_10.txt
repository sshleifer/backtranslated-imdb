The Appartement is, I think, a very purposeful Hitchcockian film. The plot was full of symbolisms (ie white and red roses) and twists that were wrapped in an orderly way. The look was very Parisian and brought you closer to the story. I saw it in London and I am very sorry that it is not published in videos in the United States
