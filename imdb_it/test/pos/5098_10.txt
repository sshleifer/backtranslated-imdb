I love this movie because every single element is nothing less than excellent. I will quickly complain about some of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great performances as he becomes the definitive Mr. Chips. Petula Clark has a beautiful voice and is as perfect as Katharine. The director was able to bring the story to the screen in a new and original way. Combine it with cinematography, editing, writing, etc. Fantastic and creative and you have a film that shows the quality of its production. I can't praise the well-planned camera well enough, which makes us go back and forth, zooming in and out, giving us the best visions and letting the locations become part of the scene. The last song by Petula Clark "YOU AND I" is composed of 3 long well composed tracks, and in this 2 second take time, I can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to get the long ones perfect scenes. The music is great and the songs move the story exactly as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how could anyone not like it? This is a very romantic story between two people approaching middle age who are each other, bringing out the best in each other and lasting until the end of their lives. Excellent production values, acting, camera work and music make this film worth seeing.
