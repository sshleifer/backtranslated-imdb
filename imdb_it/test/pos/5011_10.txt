I saw the movie at the Nashville film festival on May 1, 2003! It was amazing! All the things I had read about Stuey were portrayed incredibly well by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (incredible work as Stuey) and everyone else involved in this. I'm glad he (Vidmer) didn't follow the "Leaving Las Vegas" routine with Stuey's bad habits, but instead put his life, his family and his gift in it. Tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his ability in the script. A big "thumb up" on this!
