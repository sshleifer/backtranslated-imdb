The third and final film of Female Prisoner Scorpion directed by Shunya Ito. The star of the series, Meiko Kaji, will complete the series in the fourth episode, Grudge Song, directed by the good Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The Female Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion is one of my favorites of all time. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. It's generally considered the best in the series, and I could agree, I think, if it gets a better DVD version (the original, by Immagine, is very poor). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as FP701. It is much slower, much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and wickedness, but there is more attention on history and characters. Sasori (Kaji) eludes the detectives in the first scene (he is handcuffed to one and extinguishes his arm and runs away with it, which must be seen to believe it!) And ties up with a freelance prostitute, Yuki. Yuki is annoyed by a local prostitution club, which includes a stupid-looking lady with a cage full of domestic crows. What really surprised me is how sad the film is. Yuki's story, which has never been resolved, is heartbreaking. The images are amazing and Ito's direction is masterful. Too bad he never went anywhere after leaving the FP701 series. This is a fantastic movie.
