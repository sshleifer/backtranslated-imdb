Set in the 1970s in Los Angeles, Christopher Boyce has just left seminary school and returned home when his father found him a job where he checks intelligence documents. His old friend Daulton Lee is a drug dealer, and is caught up in a set-up and has to choose between becoming a narc or a long time in prison. When up on bail, jump and head to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret documents to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, due to the shame he feels for US government control over weaker countries. But over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger than originally planned. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger has made films such as "Midnight Cowboy", "Marathon Man" "," Sunday Bloody Sunday "and" Day of The Locust ". While" The hawk and the puppet of snow "cannot be kept so high, there is no doubt that this sad espionage drama (inspired by a real accident) is a portrait of an unjustly neglected character. All about it, it's a rather subdued affair, without quality of greatness The real driving force behind the film must be the incredibly versatile performances of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, like the two young and ambitious guys Chris and Daulton, and Penn is particularly good at his restless intensity, which works well compared to the superbly cool and collected by Hutton, what begins is easy, we gradually see that the situation crumbles, as the two amateurs really find themselves out of their reach. and symbolic (predatory behavior) focuses mainly on the relationship of the couple and that of their reasoning for their actions, which eventually shows us the gnarly developments that led to their fall. The plan opens up like a wound to never heal properly, due to his dependence on Daulton, who really does get him off the rails and lets Chris take it all back. The harsh political aspect is there, but focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to get his point of view. Both don't mix and the results show. The suspense is justified through its stimulating script of pot and the interactions between the characters, therefore that of any visual expedient. The action is very small, but there is still a style induced by pressure in the reassuring and realistically dark and gritty direction of Schlesinger. The pace is mostly well-managed, although some sequences seem to bask too long, but still grips you as you play on your authentically paranoid tone to slowly build up to a second explosive end. Adeptly enriched in technical production is an aerodynamic soundtrack and professionally moving cinematography. The supporting cast is exceptional with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look for Michael Ironside in a small part as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> A mostly exceptional espionage film, which largely benefits from talented lead performances and not playing the usual stakes. It is more an emotional ride, then complex of twists. Recommended.
