"Talk Radio" is my favorite movie of Oliver Stone, although he has made many great ones, including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "Talk Radio", a cinematic expansion of Eric Bogosian's drama based on a real-life tale of a guest on the Dallas talk show. Working with cinematographer Robert Richardson, Stone transforms what could have been a well-defined exercise into a visually appealing ideological battle that presents a radio station like a war arena. Bogosian is devastating as an open air torturer by Barry Champlain and conveys the conflictual and destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-hatred. Alec Baldwin, like his male boss Alpha, strikes the perfect note as a man maddened by a boy whose monstrosity helped feed. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of her vicious personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialogue with sweet poison and sharp ambiguity. John C. McGinley, as filmmaker / technical producer Stu, has a hilarious and sharp performance, as does the great Michael Wincott. The film is an impeccable and underrated masterpiece of superb writing, fantastic acting and a brutal and uncompromising direction. The soundtrack by Stewart Copeland is also brilliant.
