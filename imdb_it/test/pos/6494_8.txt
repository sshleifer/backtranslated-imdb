Thank God not all the Dutch are so ruthless. I think Jason is judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father. Maybe he's not as good as some of those actors, but it's not as bad as suggested. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie a few years ago, and actually loved it. I knew Jason from other movies and, of course, Robin from Sherwood. But I have to say that I really liked his acting of this movie. It was really nice! <br /> <br /> During the movie, I actually forgot that he was the son of. Sean .. who? <br /> <br /> And if you're a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. I am sure you will like it!
