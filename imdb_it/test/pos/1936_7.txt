This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Office of Hays is fun, not great but fun. <br /> <br /> Based on a song by Rogers & Hart that was a huge success at the time, the story revolves around the dancer Barbara Stanwyck, who is a friend of rich businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently beautiful), but whose heart belongs to his neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley marry, but keep a secret, while she drives away Cortez, who continues to give hope. Help her husband find a job in Cortez's company, but marital happiness soon becomes harsh as Owsley develops a taste for high life and hangs out with a college boyfriend and plays in a high-post bridge (Yup! I know, it's rather funny .. ..). In the end he stole $ 5,000 from Cortez and is about to die when his devoted wife goes to Cortez ... and I won't reveal anything else, even if the ending was definitely a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of his first roles he is quite accomplished. Owsley is the weak point; it's unattractive and snerveling, while Cortez is extraordinarily sweet and sexy, while his performance is serious but irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Although apparently a drama, it is full of laughter, many unnoticed as some elements of this film have aged very badly. But there are many good witty jokes; at one point Stanwyck tells Cortez: "My brain is in my feet, while yours are in ...." This is damn suggestive for 1931! There are a lot of obscene and suggestive stuff in this movie, in the last days before the Code was blocked and whitened all over. An ancient amusement, a good memory of how far we have not arrived in 70 years .... this story could be easily modified to adapt to 2003, but it could maintain the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.
