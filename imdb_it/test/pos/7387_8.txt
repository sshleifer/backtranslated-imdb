If the ending wasn't so extraordinarily unexpected, I don't think I can evaluate this movie so well. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of interaction of the uncomfortable, distressing character, "the falling wedding". That kind of thing is not my kind of drama, so the rhythm seemed to drag me for me. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the main characters are difficult to relate to and therefore they worry a lot - the husband (Alan Rickman) is rather harsh and irritable and his wife (Polly Walker) is detached and a bit haughty. The acting was fine (Norman Reedus was very tempting), but the characters themselves were perhaps a bit TOO realistically imperfect (for me). <br /> <br /> The setting was beautiful and appropriately isolated and a bit spooky. The cinematography had something that seemed a little old-fashioned to me in some way. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so brilliant that every awkward scene, awkward conversation and inexplicable behavior is absolutely worth it. I imagined every typical twist but the one that was occurred. <br /> <br /> The ending certainly makes this film worth seeing. Intrigue and drama, not so much.
