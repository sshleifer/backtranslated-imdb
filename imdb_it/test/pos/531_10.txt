I just came back from seeing this fantastic movie !! I can relate so much ... It reminded me that when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from one place to another and my mother acted like Adele August! The boys might not like this movie because they bring tears to your eyes. One of the best real movies I've ever seen !! and the rules of Natalie Portman !! 10/10
