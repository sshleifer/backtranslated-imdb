I fear I disagree with Mr. Radcliffe, for although he is right in saying that this is not a comedy, he has many other merits. The plot is a bit crazy in some parts, but I think everything fits well, creating a satisfying and fun movie. The last scene was quite abysmal compared to the rest of the film, but the real ending of the plot some scenes previously is very interesting, showing what someone will do in stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie for fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you are a fan of gangster movies, until you expect to expect something as profound as Goodfellas, you should still find it enjoyable .
