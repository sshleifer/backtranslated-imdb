A group of friends collapses in the middle of nowhere (one has a flat tire, the other Jeep mysteriously does not start). One of them takes the tire to a shabby service station and this is the last to see it. When the remaining four go in search of their friend, they meet the friendly Mr. Slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and shelter from the heat in his equally crumbling eremitical house, which seems to be occupied by very looking mannequins realistic. He goes with the only guy in the group to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls at home. Before leaving, he warns them not to leave and to go up to the house behind his shack; warns them about "Davy", his brother who is lurking and that's not all. Certainly, one of them decides to venture in search of a working phone and can no longer be seen. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The dummies ?? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requisites (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity that has the upper hand on people and never works!), But it stands out from the rest of the genre of the 70s in its final touch. I began to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a terrifying, disturbing, exaggerated performance) at one point in the film, and one almost sees the character of Molly doing the same. This is a gem if you can find it; When I was younger I removed it from the cable and, walking into a used video store, I noticed a VHS copy that was absolutely too expensive, but it was worth it. Even Tanya Roberts fans will not be disappointed. The best part of the film for me was the soup scene (and cracker !!) <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and is still hard to explain.
