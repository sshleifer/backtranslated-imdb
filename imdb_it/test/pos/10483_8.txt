Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this magnificently measured study of a small Danish community towards the end of the last century. Two beautiful and talented sisters from the musical point of view renounce their happiness and marriage prospects to look at their old father. One day, a French woman, Babette, comes to work for them. After a few years she won the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who accepted her. His solution is to prepare a delicious and sumptuous party, which changes the lives of all the guests. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, which is reflected in the changing language of dialogue from Danish to French, and in particular between the dutiful sobriety of northern Protestant Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic south. It also concerns human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. A deeply uplifting film.
