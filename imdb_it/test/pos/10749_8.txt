This production was quite a surprise for me. I love the dark movies of the 1930s, but I wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by chance, you are not convinced in the first half, stay there for the final. Of course, you must consider the obvious racism as purely current. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think THE CAT'S PAW is not yet available on video / DVD. Watch your PBS listings!
