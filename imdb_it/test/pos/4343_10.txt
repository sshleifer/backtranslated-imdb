This classic has so many great one-liners and unintentionally funny scenes that I don't even know where to start. If you want advice on appointments, it's here. Ignore the person you want completely, and then cast classic lines like "Chicken's good ... I like Chicken" and before you know it, you'll have a one-nighter in a basement (it's a basement by NICE) with a woman who he is 35 years younger than you. Bronson does all this in this movie. Buy a car without a good reason just to be able to murder two gang members ... paying with "CASH" ...... chunnng .... Buy an ice cream, simply because "this is America, it's not "t it", and ends up wasting someone called "the reducer - he laughs when he runs" just because he stole his camera. He needs to order a special one just to get this insinuated creep. It is cleaned up just to be able to eat a really stinky meal (stuffed cabbage) in a mousetrap with a couple of elderly people who like to wear heavy clothes at 90 degrees. He always seems to find a crow's bar when he needs it (and it's the same!) And last but not least, he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal in case he needs to blow his brother away greater than Ri chie Cunningham, Chuck, who is out of his mind now and desperately needs a makeover. Anyway, all this will make sense once you've seen this classic ... all I can say is have fun! "I owed you that one DUDE"
