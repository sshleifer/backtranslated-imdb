Fred Carpenter has screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College and, to judge by his enthusiastic response, has a lot to be happy about. A well made Indy, well taught, impressive for its appearance and budget. This film has it all: a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go until its surprise ending. This viewer didn't see it coming! Excellent performance throughout. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were particularly well placed in the leads, offering excellent performances. And my congratulations to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives so engaging and interesting to watch like any other in a film. I really enjoyed this movie. He confirmed my belief that some of the best works in films will come from independents, and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
