Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, is it? Barnens ö, written almost as "booné aww" is the title of that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked many people, including myself. <br /> <br /> Children's Island is the title and what isolates it. In the book, Raine, the main character has the Guiness World Record Book as his Bible. And he is thrilled to break new records alone. Particularly the youngest person underwater for three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is, like most Swedish films and books of the time, profound, knowingly provocative and awe-inspiring. Bergman was starting his last film and Cries and Whispers had just come out. expectations for each Swedish film were quite high. They taught us that that great theater, great actors, superb writers and gifted directors have made a real perfection team in cinema. <br /> <br /> That said, Barnens Ö is a story of discovery. It is also a story of alienation: cities are alienating and living in one of them makes us alien to most of its inhabitants. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our destiny. It is a film of overwhelming hope and despair. Of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and isolation from a world that could not care less ... <br /> <br /> This approach, in itself, is a rather difficult way to weave a convincing narrative. Here, the masterful guide by Kay Pollak on Ola Olsson's PC Jersilds screenplay transforms it not only into a possibility, but into one of those cinema masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I might disagree with someone who said that this job was all but forgotten. It is not. Even as I write this in 2009, discussions about the history of P C Jersild are conducted around the world, and the film was shown in many film schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> Why? To put it philosophically on all this would be difficult and many have already done it in an academic way through writing and lessons. The reason why Barnens Ö was and is a special story is the feeling of intimacy that one feels from the beginning when one discovers that everything is told through the eyes of a small child. And that's where this ends too. Maybe it's a clinical vision, as someone else pointed out. But deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is profound: until we have pubic hair, we can still live another day like an angel. Next, we will become what Raine reflects as the colophon of his experiences: "Men are Pigs". Find his fears when he is fearless. Find love when the world is crumbling around him. He discovers a reason not to behave like grown-ups because he refrains from committing crimes. He let go of his inner purity and trust in others without reservation, only to learn how rotten a man's soul can be. <br /> <br /> Where love is expected, find hatred. Where compassion is needed, find suspicions and cold hearts. It is a film of metaphors. A film to think and ask questions that are difficult to ask but more difficult to answer. <br /> <br /> In the end, the satisfaction of seeing such an extraordinary work (which really raised the stakes for any other Swedish film after) is a journey of joy and hope. Be aware that it is a film full of the dark side of our nature. But alas, a film of hope and profound joy. Reine will still be an island in Stockholm, but there is great hope of living fully today, even when we have discovered our first signs of sexual maturity.
