We are obliged by procedures to report minor events such as paper cuts. Any problem identified as a potential concern for nuclear, radiological or industrial safety is immediately reported in the corrective action process. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that nuclear facilities in the United States operate with confidence in the front of their mind.
