I remember years ago that BBC1 showed this film in a very subtle form. I tracked the video a couple of years ago and saw it again. The film, although slow and a little strange (mountain men seem very strange), the atmosphere was strangely effective. It's one of my favorite slasher movies and I have no idea where a full version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the United States where it was accidentally included in a horror compilation!). It is a pity that we cannot get this film as it was meant to be seen. The wrong turn (the recent film produced by Stan Winston) owes a lot to Just Before Dawn. One of the best slasher movies of the 80s and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
