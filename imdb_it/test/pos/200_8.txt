I had long wanted to see this romantic drama (with the setting of World War II) and, now that I have, all I can say is that it is a true masterpiece of Russian cinema! <br /> <br /> Soviet films are known for their overzealous propaganda approach, but, fortunately, this lacks such emphasis - with a firm interest in the central tragic story between a promising artist and a lively girl, condemned by the outbreak of war for which voluntarily volunteers but from which it will never return. The girl (an extraordinary performance by Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin and, when he does not receive the word from his boyfriend, he gives it to the latter and marries him. He, however, is an aspiring bitter concert pianist for the war who has limited his chances of success and, knowing also that the girl is still devoted to the soldier, begins to neglect her. Finally, the word reaches the girl of the death of his beloved but, at the end of the film, he has learned to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with his memories of him. <br /> <br /> The film features some incredible photographic works that make extremely judicious use of screen space and, frequently using tracking, slanting shots and low or low angle shots, make the emotional drama very powerful which is developing. The individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the breathtaking scene, frantically modified and accelerated to the boot, in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the premature death of the young man in an unfortunate incident on the front, undoubtedly one of the best of his kind I have ever seen (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life that is coming out of his body, while he imagines the day of marriage will never have it!). Remarkable, however, is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that was irretrievably devastated during an air raid; as is his final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - which takes place during a subsequent aerial bombardment and making a particularly effective use of a series of floating curtains! <br /> <br /> Disappointingly, the R1 DVD of this exceptional movie is a bone-free affair (the RusCiCo edition includes some supplements but, being an export, it tends to be very expensive and difficult to track down!); Criterion published it in conjunction with another Russian classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959), which my friend at the local DVD outlet told me is coming ... <br /> <br /> only other film I saw from this director the arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969, though through the much shorter American version!), an international star-studded production based on real events; Given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I regret having lost it on his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year: in addition to receiving a theatrical series of a week, was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature film "Making Of" !!
