I honestly can't believe this film is no longer voted. Claude Chabrol could be described as a Frenchman Alfred Hitchcock, and while this film is only the second of those I've seen (the first is Le Boucher), I can already see that this guy is something special only about the strength of these two films. The film is a French-Canadian co-production and takes place in Canada. The cast is made up of British and Canadian stars and high-quality performances bode well for the rest of the film; most of which is also of high quality. The film is a mystery of murder and begins when a girl covered in blood is taken to a police station. After being interrogated by Inspector Carella, it appears that the young woman, Patricia and her sister Muriel were attacked by a man who killed her sister and just allowed Patricia to escape. However, as investigations continue, Patricia returns to the station to provide new evidence, which reveals a much more shocking identity for the killer. <br /> <br /> The performances in this film are excellent. Donald Sutherland is submissive as usual, but he fits the role he gave here very well and I would not hesitate to name his performance in Blood Relatives as one of his best results. The film also shows the support shifts of British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings, who both give good turns; In particular, he is able to show how good an actor can be and highlights the shame of having wasted himself in Halloween movies. The unknown Aude Landry also offers a great performance in his role as Patricia. The film is very mysterious for the first time and really holds the passionate audience. When Inspector Carella discovers Muriel's diary, the film becomes a drama in which the girl's latest actions are shown; and even if this part of the film is not as good as the previous one, it is still interesting and eventually leads to a major breakthrough! Overall, Blood Relatives is a fantastic film that really deserves to be seen better. Le Boucher is a more well-known effort from Chabrol, but for my money this is at least as good! Highly recommended vision.
