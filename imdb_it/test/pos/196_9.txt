The consequences of the Second World War almost led to the death of Soviet cinema. In the early 1950s, film production almost stopped (only nine films were published in 1951) and the work of all the directors was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the filmmakers gained greater artistic freedom with their paintings, although many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic attitude towards the war that had prevailed in previous years. It was only in 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely considered the first post-Stalinist Soviet masterpiece, "Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes are Flying", one of the finest depictions of war I I've seen from any country or time period. Not only was the film praised for its artistic splendor in the Soviet Union, but soon international recognition would follow, and Kalatozov's film was honored with the Palme d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> < br /> 'The Cranes are Flying "is both an invigorating visual feast and a bold and humanistic portrait of war. Unlike many Soviet-era war movies, he was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional hero of the time than war, and more concerned about futility, brutality and, indeed, the inevitability of conflict Love, as a cinematographic concept, is too often idealized as a notion that somehow conquers everyone and bears infinite difficulties, yet reality is substantially less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), separated from the advent of World War II (widely known in the Soviet Union as Gran de Patriotic War, 1941-1945), they commit themselves to marry after the war but the tragedy denies the couple their desire. Driven by treachery for the incessant torment and uncertainty of waiting, Veronika agreed to marry Boris's cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a handsome but unworthy young man. The film could end with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic parade that flies the flag, but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist, who wanders without a soul through the celebrating crowd. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps the most notable feature of "The Cranes are Flying" is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic manual cinematography, which realistically and confusingly captures the chaos and confusion of war, not necessarily in the hail of gunshots and the cries of dying comrades {in fact, only one of the sequences of the film joins Boris on the eastern front}, but from the point of view of the family and friends who have remained behind. In a particularly striking, often quoted shot, the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The freehand video camera follows the girl from a bus, pushes the crowd next to her - capturing momentary fragments of loved ones who greet their children and husbands - before unexpectedly reaching over the crowd while Veronika disappears into the dust of a squadron passing of army tanks, a breathtaking movement that offers breadth and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired his filming as a military operator during the war, and obviously fell in love with the possibilities of storytelling by hand: "The camera," he once declared, "can express what the actor is unable to to portray: his inner sensations: the cameraman must act with the actors ".
