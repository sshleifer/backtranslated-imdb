I saw it on the release of Accent Underground with the short films. I found the film initially boring and old-fashioned and turned it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed, and I'm not kidding. I had a nightmare about this movie by half and time to fall asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, turned on the TV, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done Alex Frayne sir, you managed to put your film into this old, cynical head of spectators, and that's what it does. So 10 out of 10 for you. <br /> <br /> I can't say I love this movie of yours, but it has had a lasting impact despite its flaws and small budget, etc.
