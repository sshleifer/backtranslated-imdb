This brilliant and innovative comedy contains many priceless moments and a great sense of rhythm, even if too long. Chaplin's satire with several classic scenes, has the dual role of Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel, an offensive portrait of Hitler. Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitler tyrant and happens to bizarre events. Fun and extraordinary actors from all the castings, like the co-stars Jack Oakie in the role of Napolini (Mussolini-like), Henry Daniel in the role of Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert in the role of Herring (Goering). Chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss. This wonderful film contains numerous funny scenes, the most amusing are the following: 1) The one in which during the First World War the soldier-barber together with a co-pilot is flying on an airplane without conscious 2) Dictator Adenoid Hynkel making speeches exaggerated including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel plays with a huge ball of the world 4) The Jewish barber who is shaving a man who adapts to Brahms 5's Hungarian Dance 5) when Hynkel and Napolini try to keep the body higher than others in the barber chair; among them. <br /> <br /> Hitler banned the film show from the Germans because of his satire from him, and put him on his death list after his proposal to conquer America. The film co-stars with Paulette Goddard, third of his four wives, they married in 1936, although no announcement of the marriage was made later, once he finished The Great Dictator. The image was published in 1940, when Chaplin survived a moral scandal over a paternity suit the House of Non-American Activities was the signal to the United States that he refused to return from Britain and fled to Switzerland.
