I'm sick of series with young and clueless people, who constantly talk about their "problems", self-centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular, Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills, etc.). "Hack" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different storyline, believable people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good stories. I love!! I hope "Hack" will go on for a long time, because it's a great television series for adults, for a change.
