If you've never been "Flavored", this is the Troma movie to see first. The extraordinary acting, the supercharged soundtrack and the "bust-a-gut" humor blend perfectly with the exclusive Troma storytelling and special effects brand. Despite having moved away from a word by word that tells of Romeo and Juliet, the fact that he remains in the iambic pentameter gives you the strange feeling that he is closer to Shakespeare than that exaggerated music video with DiCaprio and Danes. I imagined I had seen the last Shakespearean comedy when the Moonlighting cast reviewed The Taming of the Shrew, but nothing comes close to Tromeo and Juliet. I highly recommend the DVD version, which contains a second audio track with director Lloyd Kaufman which is just as fun as the main track.
