An excellent thriller of all times. Vijay Anand excels as director and editor. The interpretations of Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be a resource for the film, whose screenplay has been elaborated to the last detail. Cinematography adds to the mystery, charm and other needs of history as it evolves. And to top it all off, Sachin Dev Burman's music is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by Kishore Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, again to reaffirm the unique personality of Burman Dada as a first-rate composer with a style all his own.
