When we stop to remember the frequent team demonstrations of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, "The Died With Their Boots On" (1941) it is very likely that the film will remember better. It is the great saga of General Custer (Flynn) - told from the moment he enters the West Point military academy and falls for the lustful Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), during his tenure during the American civil war, and finally with his death to Little Big Horn. The director, Raoul Walsh, mounts his historical epic on the highly questionable laurels of historical texts, rewritten by writers Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until the truth and fiction are distorted. Thus, the battle against the mad Horse leader (Anthony Quinn) is interpreted as an erroneous agreement between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation that wants to reclaim the land that Custer gave the Indians through the systematic genocide Nation the first peoples <br /> <br /> Flynn, who skillfully plays Custer as a part of Arnold Schwartzenegger in two parts Albert Schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. It literally exudes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of its faithful heroine. Resident Warner, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet players distribute wonderful cameos that seem to have much more depth and character than what is actually written in the material for them. <br /> <br /> Overall, therefore, despite its multifaceted rendering of the story In favor of a good romantic yarn, "I died with their boots" is a great fodder for a Saturday matinee or Sunday night that makes the hole of one's love. Warner's DVD is very nice. Although the grain of the film is often obvious, the grayscale has been very well rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. Some fading is evident during scene transitions. The audio has been cleaned up very well and is presented at an adequate listening level.
