It's a very big film (documentary) about Istanbul and its people and it's music of all kinds. The director's editing and success are truly impressive. I've been interested in Faith Akin since I saw "Gegen die Wand" ("Head-On") ("Duvara KarsÄ±") and I greatly admired his work but this was the most touching for me so I'm here to write this It's not just about Turks or something, it's a good biography of a city and how music remains alive in it, we can say. There are many people's points of view and so very different ideas about life and love. I liked it a lot and I believe that anyone and anyone should see it, NOT ONLY, but above all those still related to Turkey ...
