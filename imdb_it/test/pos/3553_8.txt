Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa was stolen once and had been missing for almost two years. In 1911, La Gioconda by Leonardo da Vinci (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken by the Louvre by a petty thief (and former employee of the Louvre) who presumably tried to return the most famous work of art in the world to his native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) The Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the last day of 1913, remaining there since then except for occasional loans. When "Arsène Lupine" was published in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), many viewers would remember that crime of 1911, and their knowledge would have lent a certain plausibility to this film. "Arsène Lupine" is quite fun, with the usual high standards of MGM production and the usual energetically efficient direction of Jack Conway. This film does not fail to please; what is missing is plausibility. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is the main criminal of the title: he specializes in perpetrating "impossible" crimes, which makes it even more difficult announcing them in advance ... but obviously he always commits the crime and deceives the gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine has a weakness for elaborate disguises, which allows Barrymore (an American A grade ham) to indulge his weakness for antics. John's older brother, Lionel Barrymore, is Guerchard, Javert's Surete detective who has sworn to capture Lupine. <br /> <br /> Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was full of populist political activities; on screen, she was the most impressive in working class roles that adapted to her political beliefs (like her beautiful performance in "Our Daily Bread"). In "Arséne Lupine", Morley's naturally dark hair is bleached with a horrible blonde tone, and is all grown up in elegant clothes that make her seem uncomfortable rather than sexy. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COMING. In the end, Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He splits the painting from its frame, rolls up the canvas and then contracts it in a basket of flowers. We see John Barrymore casually brandishing a piece of rolled-up cloth that is supposedly the greatest work of art in all of human history. I had to laugh at the error of the filmmakers. In real life (but not in this film), da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a poplar wood board, so a thief would have difficulty rolling it! Eventually, Guerchard captures Lupine and drags him out to Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is pure delight, as their sincere mutual affection spills over into their characters' dialogue. I would have found this scene implausible with two other actors. As it stands, I can't imagine anyone except the Barrymore brothers who play these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but barely. <br /> <br /> Don't look for a good story here, but "Arsène Lupine" is a delightful example of creating old-fashioned movies. I will evaluate this film of 8 points out of 10.
