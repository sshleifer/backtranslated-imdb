I saw this movie when it came out. I thought that average movie. Now I understand that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and an excellent soundtrack. I've seen my share of rock films, but even if this is far from the spinal cord (which I didn't like)> This film takes us into the life of a 80s rocker who doesn't want to be anything else. This is none other than our inner child who wants to grow up and be a * ROCK STAR * Yes, I said it. Everyone wants to grow and be on the spot of light (Weather said or not). This film puts you at the center of emotions and you can almost feel the emotion of Izzy. I have to admit that the acting was less important, but the music and the story were enough to keep you involved, until the end credits ended. It is worth looking at especially if you are a fan of your powerful hair.
