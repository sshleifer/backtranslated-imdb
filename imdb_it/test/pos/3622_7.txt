Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated the directors over the years, and the "Puckoon" of 2002 unfortunately is no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partition of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community (the "Puckoon" of the title). Due to a colossal mistake, half of the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the bathrooms at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence that blocks their path. Drinkers flock like sardines in a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead person must have a passport in his name before the villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him. <br /> <br /> "Puckoon" is a sort of Irish "Under Milk Wood" with comic characters and surreal events galore. The main character, Dan Milligan (renamed 'Madigan' in the film) is subtly played by Sean Hughes and has conversations with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). The film also features Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from "Robin's Nest"), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. Interviewed for "Making of" Puckoon The documentary, writer / director Terence Ryan expressed admiration for the book. Show on screen. But, alas, like the unlucky movie of "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy", a good book is not necessarily a good movie. The problem with "Puckoon" is that, like other Milligan books, they simply don't work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> You can't compare the film to the wrecks like "Sex Lives Of The Potato Men", "Fat Slags" and "Lesbian Vampire Killers', but then it's not even as good as it should have been. last half an hour involves a lot of runs by the police, the British army, some locals who have hidden explosives in a coffin, and it's really boring to sit in. Ryan's decision to stick to the book is main reason for his inability to work as a movie. <br /> <br /> The other problem is the total absence of charm. 'Waking Ned' had this in spade, while the television series 'Father Ted' was far more fun. Spike lived long enough to watch the movie, and apparently liked it. His daughter, Jane, has a cameo as a bride from Madigan. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me was the quote at the beginning: "I don't mind dying!", Spike said: "I don't do anything else" I want to be there when it happened is! ".
