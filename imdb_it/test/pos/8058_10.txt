During the preface by Clete Roberts, I was starting to think it was an Ed Wood production, however, what comes out here is something hard enough to hit. The history of crime and corruption in a southern city is told using a cast from Hollywood's Poverty Row, which makes the film even more realistic. There are no fists pulled here, and sometimes the film recalls "The Well" (1951). The black and white texture offers a quality similar to a newsreel. For some, younger audiences will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project" but this is based on REAL events!
