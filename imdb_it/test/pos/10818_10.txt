I saw Bon voyage 2 days ago and found an excellent production. The film should entertain, and it does! Emulates the style of American comedies of the 1930s, but Von is more refined. Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. The plot is simple. The film begins with people involved in many situations that, apparently, should have nothing to do with each other. It's very funny how these situations are connected during the movie. It's nice to see a French movie with this kind of sense of humor. I find it, mainly, a film in which love is the main theme. Peter Coyote as a German spy in France proves once again to be an excellent actor.
