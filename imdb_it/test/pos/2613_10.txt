He's an ass cop, happy, alcoholic! I saw the first and second episode. The artwork and animation fit very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character is an armed pistol, a badge he wears, a pair of butt cheeks, which shoot anyone who thinks he is offensive or "guilty". So far, the episodes have had simple and follow-up plots that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, plays is the replica that makes the A.A. antics and random "I've got a hunch" leads. The Assy lines are very funny and clever, here's one example: "I have a bullet and it has your email address, don't let me hit" * bang * "it seems that your mailbox has just taken new mail." box of thoughts at Assy Mcgee's office is so far, coherent and at the right time. As for the sound, it's perfect, the sound effects and vocal work are 9/10. Assy sounds like Sylvester Stallone was all busted, Don Sanchez, the Mayor, the Chief of Police, everyone has rumors that "Fit" there are very good. I recommend it to anyone who wants to catch some laughter before going to bed, since the air is made during the adult swim on Sunday evening. Very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10/10
