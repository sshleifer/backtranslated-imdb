I read the last comment made on this film and I have to completely and totally disagree with it. <br /> <br /> You see, I am of Portuguese nationality and although this film may say little to someone from Boston, it certainly says something to both the Portuguese and the Brazilians, as well as to immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why, could you ask yourself? Well, first of all, this film is about two brother nations: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence at the beginning of the nineteenth century (from the hands of the heir to the Portuguese throne) and since then relations have improved considerably. <br /> <br /> However, as significant as it may be, there is still a lot of prejudice. Due to the economic climate in Brazil during the 1990s, immigration to Portugal has grown massively. You see, Portugal is not just a country that shares a language, a culture and beliefs similar to Brazil, but is also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Some people were therefore forced to make the decision to cross the Atlantic and look for a better life and Portugal was the first logical place to try to immigrate. <br /> <br /> As still happens with many immigrants, they were paid on average below the minimum wage and were treated as "dirt" - only in this case, because the language is similar, have they been constantly made aware of their immigrant status. <br /> <br /> Another curious thing about this film is the idea that it conveys how a man so experienced in the history of his country has still tried to make quick money by exporting coveted national resources. They are exactly the people who keep Brazil in a constant state of arrested development, as the country is well endowed with natural resources and could easily scale the economic ladder if given a fair opportunity. <br /> <br /> a sense, this shows how colonialism still exists - Pablo representing the exploited people, Igor the man whose status as "noble" (or at least rich or "wealthy") is assured by power foreign colonialist who in turn is represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other Salles films you will recognize it as a recurring topic: the struggle against an oppressive power. I do not intend to teach or be condescending to teach anyone the story, but I thought that this film was, symbolically speaking, very powerful. I'm not saying that there was no room for improvement (as always there is) but I think the last comment written about it is not only narrow-minded, but undoubtedly ignorant. <br /> <br /> One last thing to say about this, I have to assume you saw this movie through the eyes of an "American film observer". No damage intended by this observation, but I want to say that "foreign" films cannot all concern "wonderful landscapes" - Art deals with the problems of its time. You wouldn't expect Otto Dix, for example, to paint all the enchanting places of Bayern and the Black Forest ... Why should you expect a director to focus exclusively on the scenario when he thinks there are more relevant issues to deal with? <br /> <br /> Simply put, don't judge films lightly and with only two or three criteria in the field. This film is very interesting, its photography is quite good and also the idea that black and white coloring transmits goes hand in hand with what it is dealing with. I think the image is deliberately grainy ... like reality, isn't it? :) <br /> <br /> Watch it and reach your conclusions ...
