the first Child's Play was a small original and effective horror film. as expected however, the 2 horrible sequels seemed to write the end of this franchise. <br /> <br /> well, when I heard they were doing the 4th called "bride of chucky" I just looked up and mumbled "... when they'll never learn". <br /> <br /> but when I learned that they had gotten a great director, Ronny Yu and a solemn cast including the awe-inspiring fear of Jennifer Tilly, my interest in this came up again. <br /> <br /> this film is extremely well done. he has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematography and the sensational Jennifer Tilly who engages his most impressive things during the first semester. (I must add that she is also a fantastic actress). <br /> <br /> keeps the tongue firm in the mouth without turning towards the territory. the doll effects are fantastic and the verbal interaction between them is priceless. it's more of a horror / comedy than a direct horror, but humor is well accepted and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I have already heard that they are planning a Chucky son. if they can match the quality of this film, then perhaps this franchise will have made a legitimate return. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.5
