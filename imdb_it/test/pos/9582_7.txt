Long before Terri Schiavo brought the question of life from "vegetable" to public viewing, "One day in the death of Joe Egg" treated him. Alan Bates plays Bri, a teacher whose daughter is almost completely sulky. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) try all sorts of obscure humor to try and get on with their lives, but they can't escape facts. At some point, they even consider euthanasia. The question that surrounds them and their friends is: what will ever become of this situation? <br /> <br /> With this film, Alan Bates continued his series of really good films, preceded by "Zorba the Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Pignolo". We can safely say that we will miss him very much.
