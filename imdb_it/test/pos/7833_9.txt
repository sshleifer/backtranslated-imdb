The slogan on the box greets, "100 PASSENGER PASSENGERS ... 3,000 VIPERS COME!" You almost have to admit that degree of "no chance what the hell we will ever carry on with this promise" bullshit. I could more fully admire the matter of The Asylum if they made films that, well, you know, were good or at least worth it. Haha, and that's what I like about these movies. I'm trash. You put them in a bathroom and then you empty. It's worth the price if you're a fan of cheese movies. It could become a cult classic among many fans. The gore scenes are effective, there's not much I can say, it's a Z movie that parodies the new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, hell, it might be better that way who knows!
