I was stunned by this movie. Later, I didn't even want to see any films for a long time - any other film would be so unsatisfactory by comparison. <br /> <br /> For many, it could be the worst of Antonioni - very slow, without a catchy conventional narrative line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions - and Wenders' worst - long-winded and confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short, distinct episodes linked by the typical stream of consciousness of Wenders' meandering hero, so it does not produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema. <br /> <br /> But for the fans, the worst is the best and the bumpy plot is tracing a single poetic image that extends through the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse among their segments that seeks the heart of things. <br /> <br />
