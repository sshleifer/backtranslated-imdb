This was a great film in every sense. Address the issue of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviation from the norm. He criticizes many Indian customs that many find oppressive - such as the organization of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the evaluation of women in terms of child-bearing skills, binding concepts of duty and so on. At the center of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond the limits of society that the two protagonists find themselves. The film is well acted and genuine, completely credible from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood films. The main defects of the film, as I have seen, were the first, that the two lovers seem to be attracted to each other not necessarily from a natural mutual affinity as much as from the fact that they are stuck in marriages without life and without passion and without rewards. This may play a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people blocked in the same situation do not "become homosexual". It seems from the beginning of the film that the two characters are rather heterosexual - when Radha makes his scene at the end of the film with Aashok, he makes it clear that "without desire he was dead", and the implication is that if he wanted it, he would could satisfy her completely, and even when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband didn't seem to like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals - they can seek comfort in others in the same position, but in the film it is not at all clear that they are lesbians from the beginning - on the contrary. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be straight or homosexual. In the case of women in the film, they both had insensitive shots for their husbands. . . if not, would they naturally find the need to express their desire in a relationship that they would not otherwise have considered? The film ignores it. The other flaw is the naming of the characters. . . the names Sita and Radha seem deliberately invented to scandalize and outrage (imagine a film in America that describes a gay relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another named "Paul"!) using names associated with various Hindu scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand alone and does not need these devices in my opinion. In any case, the defects are not very far from the power of the film. It's really a very moving and powerful story - the images and characters will stay with you long after they leave the theater.
