It is a completely successful example of a biopic from the 1950s. He has the brave and handsome young hero - well, he's not so young on the screen anymore; superb direction, if unlikely, of Billy Wilder; a moving musical score completely orchestrated with edifying scales and, when required, celestial strings by Franz Waxman; strong support players; a compelling story; splendid photograph of Robert Burks preferred by Hitchcock; and a story about a singular historical event. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Jimmy Stewart as Charles Lindbergh trying to sleep in a Long Island hotel before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, from New York to Paris. And he can't sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight is full of flashbacks about Lindbergh's personal history and the purchase and construction of his high-wing monoplane, The Spirit of St. Louis. St. Louis, Missouri, is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight. (Even in 1927, the money spoke). However, the film had HAD to have several flashbacks and Stewart's narrative. What is the alternative. Looking at the units? Thirty-three hours of watching Jimmy Stewart sitting silently at the controls of his noisy airplane as days and nights come and go? I found the script and directed it awesome for their time. Unpleasant things are obviously left out, so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary public can handle. <br /> <br /> My bet is that the howling crowd surrounding Lindbergh at Le Bourget tore up the souvenir plane. And of course nothing on the pilot's safety valve, though it would have added more opportunities for humor. Some of today's viewers will find some trivial incidents if they think too much about them. Aloft, Stewart chats with a nice fly who hitchhikes who, in his quietly worried way, wakes him by landing on his cheek at a critical moment. Later, the St. Christopher Medal which Father Hussman gave him struck the glass crystal of one of the instruments delicately just as Stewart was desperately trying to land. The atheist Stewart is saved twice - once on the fly and once by God. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't matter. It's an awesome movie. That landing at Le Bourget, with an exhausted Stewart behind the joystick, confused by the floodlights, sweaty with fear and collapsed with fatigue, is really convincing. "I'm going to rip this plane," he says to himself, and we can believe him. <br /> <br /> Flying a light aircraft is not like driving a car at all. There is no road that curves smoothly to tell you where to go, no lane to give directions. You are busy every second. It is necessary to look at the instruments, check each wing tip to see that they touch the horizon, ditto the nose of the airplane, and constantly look up, down and to the side for the traffic, even if the latter would not have been a big problem for Lindbergh. It was all alone on the ocean. <br /> <br /> Why? In one of the film's craziest moments, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, two barnstorms of the 1920s gypsies, are lying next to their planes in a Midwestern camp. "What is it? What makes us love flying so much?", Asks Hamilton. (No reply). Later, his lenders try to convince him to leave the flight. Five other aviators have already died trying it. "But don't you understand? It must be done," says a passionate Stewart. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not much of an answer. Why does it have to be done now, and why from Lindbergh? Why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates, is partly in our glands. The pilots are a placid and confident lot, given to occasional excitements of excitement. Their main problem could be the dependence on an internal adrenaline rush. Just kidding. Some of my best friends are the pilots. Anyway, Lindbergh had to be a nice guy. He deserved to be treated like a hero. Not only for the flight itself, but also for its later demeanor - quiet, modest, a family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler, since he has more than compensated by testing the Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the Navy on how to modify airplanes and get the best performance from them. <br /> <br /> See if you have the chance. If nothing else, it is a history lesson told with visual splendor.
