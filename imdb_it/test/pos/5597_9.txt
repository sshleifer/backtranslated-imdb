This film is probably the best of Hal Hartley. The subject, of unusual originality, is treated (as usual with Hal Hartley) with great humor. This feature is by no means the only quality of this film: the composition of the picky frame (everything is parallel, down to the smallest details), camera angles, lighting, giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images (Jesus going down not to be filmed in a conventional way), the false "poser" action, are qualities that make this rereading of the Bible, performed in the form of apocalyptic, essential delirium.
