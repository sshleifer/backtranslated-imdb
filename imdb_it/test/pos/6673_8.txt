If you like movies that make you think, this is absolutely one of the best. I've always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made high quality films. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley has brilliantly directed K-PAX. The film tears in the feelings and in the philosophy of the mind and the world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both offer excellent acting skills. He caught me, I didn't look away from the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you're hoping for a science fiction movie with special effects, this is not for you. The story is dragged a bit, which can be a bit boring, but it also works as a way to build the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie, I did it ..
