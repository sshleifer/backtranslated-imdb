I can't imagine why it hasn't been theatrically projected yet. He has an exceptional ensemble cast, with Sutherland, Lane, and in particular Chris Evans doing a spectacular job. Wake up, exec of the studio! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the experiences of the author / writer, growing up as the "poor boy" in an extremely wealthy community, where the class is everything, and makes the difference in every aspect of life, from the clothing to justice. <br /> <br /> During the film's questions and answers, the author was asked about his experiences, and in particular what we don't know about the ultra-rich. He said they are not stupid, they are very intelligent (as opposed to how they can interpret themselves), they have plans, and they are a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is extremely current.
