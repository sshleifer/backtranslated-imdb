The Western can be divided into many subgenres. One of the largest divisions is that between Western Town and Western Westerns. Most westerns are a mix of both, but at one end of the spectrum there are images like High Noon and Rio Bravo that take place almost entirely in one settlement, rarely venturing into nature. At the other end there is one like Wagon Master, where there is barely a farm in sight between the wild lands. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford normally prospered on the western "piece of both", turning the interiors with an emphasis on being small and confined, and thus countering this with the open exteriors, which appeared both exciting and dangerous . Wagon Master has a typical screenplay by Frank Nugent, with some interactions between old experts and young greens, but still presents Ford with new challenges. In this image, the dangers do not derive from the hardness of the landscape, they come from within the group in the form of the Cleggs. Furthermore, the absence of real interior scenes means that the exterior could lose its impact over time. <br /> <br /> However, Ford was a true master when it came to manipulating space. Shoot scenes from the field or wagons so that the frame is surrounded and we get the same sense of fence that we would do in a real interior. Moreover, compared to its other Westerners, in reality it does not open too much space, having the trail of the wagon that makes its way through canyons and passes rather than crossing the deserted and deserted plains. One of the few moments when the landscape opens up is when the Indians are sighted and there is the possibility of a threat from the outside. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master presents some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief, and some great contributions from the eccentric cast. Harry Carey Jr. was turning into a good actor like his pa, and this is one of his best youthful roles. Joanne Dru was disappointed in She Wore at Yellow Ribbon, but she appears more comfortable as a character with a bit of sass, and is actually quite good here. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in the film directed by John Ford Grapes of Wrath a decade earlier, appears here with the sole function of performing in a gag in which she plays a weak old horn. And yet, with her timing and movement, she makes the piece work. Francis Ford, in one of the many dumb drunk roles he portrayed in his little brother's pictures, is at his best cheeky. <br /> <br /> And now we come to lead the man Ben Johnson. Although he was not at all a bad actor, he would never have become a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his uncompromising ease and casual style, he was one of the most genuinely "Western" players around. And this brings me to my last point. This was apparently a Ford favorite, although it seemed quite modest. Wagon Master does not have a grandiose theme or dramatic intensity, it is simply the genre that expresses itself. I think this is what Ford loved. It's a photo for Ben Johnsons and Harry Carey Jrs, not for John Waynes or Henry Fondas. Small in size but worthy of its category.
