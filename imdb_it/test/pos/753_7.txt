Nurse Charlotte Beale (the beautiful Rosie Holotik) arrived at the clinic of Dr. Stephens for the crazy people prepared for a new job. What he does not expect is to find another alleged doctor in his position after Stephens was attacked by the manic "freak" judge Oliver W Cameron (.. in a running gag, every time he faces a situation outside of his control, retires to repeat his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) who is not sure if Beale is suitable for their establishment. After a long discussion of the position (which is rather an embarrassing scene when the two debates about whether Beale sent Stephens a letter getting a clinic job with Masters often reminds her that she is no longer in charge), Masters agrees to leave them I work in the nursing position, but the good doctor may not be what he seems ... <br /> <br /> The assortment of crazy people includes Sam (Bill McGee) a simple-minded child-man who was the last victim by Stephens lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren), a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she rolls on the heel of Masters like a puppy, Danny (Jessie Kirby) an annoying annoyance that often tries to steal the fake Harriet's child (Camilla Carr), Allyson (Betty Chandler) a sexy nymphomaniac who just wants to be loved and jumps to any man she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) the typical case of a soldier who did not escape the madness of war. /> <br /> The film shows the unorthodox methods of the Masters of managing the clinic by allowing patients to roam free with the doors of all rooms without closures that they question ... and, not to say, the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around even though he simply cuts Dr. Stephens with an ax. And what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ha ha .. <br /> <br /> The Tacky 70 drive-in garbage is a lot of fun if you're in a distorted brand of cinema. I am attracted to bizarre gestures on mental discards due to their unpredictable nature ... you never know what the hell could happen, especially in this case where you can wander often without supervision. Some consider the low budget a liability, but in the case of this film, I think it improves the experience. With cheap photography and low production values ​​(fired from peanuts in a dilapidated house somewhere awful) it seems more disturbing and I felt like a voyeur peering into madness through a camera lens on the outside.
