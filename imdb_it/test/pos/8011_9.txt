I saw this show until my puberty, but I still found a way to reflect many situations that worry us when we are teenagers, even if it was a family-oriented show. Until the mid-1990s he focused more on young adults and their situations. <br /> <br /> That's why I loved "Step by Step". I mean, it offered situations for all ages and, unlike many shows of its kind, offered expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; this was not an extremely fun show, no, but it had some situations that you could feel connected to but more fun. <br /> <br /> There was an extremely good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy has swayed! Sommers was tender and actually funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (she loved her legs) and witty. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his character Cody. He was the man back in the day! Oh, the memories. Nowadays, this show has not been able to adapt properly to the new generations and this is why it should be kept in the vault of memories. It's all, just memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you Step By Step for making my puberty more fun.
