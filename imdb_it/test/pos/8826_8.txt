Whenever the alleged explorers and us, the public, are ready to take a first look at one of the wonderful new worlds, for some unthinkable reason, the directors have decided to distract with an "emergency" or a false alarm or a little of artificial suspense drama. <br /> <br /> So instead of quietly enjoying the surface of Io, or standing over Saturn's rings or concentrating on the magic of flying from a comet or asteroid, we are distracted by worrying about wellness and survival of the characters. Big disappointment !!!! <br /> <br /> Filmmakers seem to be unsure of what they want. A documentary about the natural wonders of our solar system, or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the object. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hi. If I wanted suspense and tension, I would watch a real narrative science fiction film. <br /> <br /> Of course it's a docu-drama. But the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission) should be secondary to the topic). Wait. Yes, the risks of such a mission are an important part of the topic - since it is essentially a film about the space mission, not just the solar system. But he was exaggerated and distracted by the discovery of new worlds that we had to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feeling to the human elements of a space mission, the quarrels, the tensions, the burden of responsibility, the almost fatal errors, the sacrifices, etc. . Moreover it would fit very well in the hard-sci-fi subgenre - in reality it would be one of the best, because here science was almost strictly adhered to. <br /> <br /> But the distractions were horrible. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I failed to show the effects of being in space for several years on the astronauts AFTER landing on Earth. Even no
