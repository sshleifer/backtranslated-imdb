I read the book written by Bill Carter on which this film is based many years ago. The book is certainly stronger than the film. It provides more details than what a film can provide, the end result is that I thought the film looked a little rough on a handful of elements. All in all, however, and given the limits of the medium, the film provides a completely entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 1990s to host "The Tonight Show" after Johnny Carson's retirement. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly the performance. I can't think of more difficult performances for an actor than to play a character that is still alive and known and on TV on a regular basis. John Michael Higgins nailed Letterman's part perfectly. Looking at it actually was like watching Letterman. Daniel Roebuck bravely tried to be Jay Leno, but somehow he didn't do it effectively. His whole "look" seemed fake, and he didn't look natural in the role. In a less central role, Rich Little not surprisingly nailed Carson's voice, although the appearance was a bit off. In the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably Leno's agent, Helen Kushnick. In the film, Kathy Bates was perfect in the role, although not entirely out of control like Carter's portrait of the woman in writing. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a light and fun vision. The topic is not particularly important in the general scheme of things, but it is fun to look behind the scenes at a memorable moment in the entertainment industry. 7/10
