A lot of scenes and dialogues are silly, but when you add everything, that is Machine's daily cycle from the depressing walkup to the depressing bar, to the depressing burlesque room, to the depressing poker games full of smoke and back home, it makes sense strange that someone, somewhere, is trying to give a true representation of the life of the drug addict around 1955. Whether it is Sinatra, who obviously would have clashed with this type of character who grew up in Hoboken and worked in numerous bands, or Preminger , which uses the subtitling of Frankie-Zosch to pass the addict's internal worldview beyond the Hays Code cage, get a good song to accompany On the Waterfront, which was shot almost exactly at the same time. A kind of fake-realist work that lets you realistically wonder how profound the drug culture is in American life.
