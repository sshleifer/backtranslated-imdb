The Hardware Wars hysterics is finally released on DVD. HW has earned its niche among the classic parody and is not just a ridiculous short twentieth minute, but a base in low-budget film production classes, which is where most of the cult's cult status derives and resides . With the DVD, not only will we have the chance to revisit the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, and others) that Ernie F. made in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material showing Fosselius's wit . Antique Sideshow is a lifeless parody that is a lot of fun but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. The director's commentary is also hysterical, as is the Creature Feature which parodies a film on the talk-show circuit and which is actually based on bringing HW to the talk show circuit, even if the public access circuit. I would like to see Ernie, Michael Wiese and the troupe take on other exaggerated and overbudgeting contemporary goals at parody - like almost all movies that Hollywood churn out for $ 100 million nowadays - not so smart movies like Spider Man or Men In Black (actually it parodies itself!) but any number of exaggerated, overhyped, overwrought and overpriced features. <br /> <br />
