Being both a fan of Dario Argento and a fan of Phantom of the Opera, I was dying to see his first version of the story, before the so bad "Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera". The film is simply fantastic, even the plot, which here is one of Argento's best in a coherent story. The way he turns a classic love story into a creepy creepy is simply fantastic. The film looks really nightmarish, which helps keep you on the edge of your seat. The colors have never been better in a Argento film after the incredible "Suspiria". The murders are smart and bloody, all made in the style of the Silver brand. The thing with the eyes in this film is just disturbing, and made much better than in Fulci's splatter. The acting is so-so, but once you've seen the movie, you understand the motivations of the characters better and get used to it. My two biggest complaints about it is the use of rock music. I think it was a brilliant idea to combine beautiful fragments of work with heavy metal, but it's not done very well here. The ending is VERY disappointing, which is the worst thing about the movie, which seems to echo Silver's previous "Phenomena", but done terribly, it didn't really need to end up that way. The same thing happened in the film by the director of "The Exorcist". I wanted them to keep the original ending. But it's still a fantastic movie and a must see, if only for Daria Nicolodi's memorable sequence of murders.
