"Rabbit Seasoning" by Chuck Jones, the second in the much-loved hunting trilogy, is often considered the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose from this trio of fantastic cartoons, I should admit that "Rabbit Seasoning" is the finest script. Here, the emphasis is on language while Bugs and Daffy go through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abate and Costello's "Who's on next" routine. A long-time Daffy fan, I have always been delighted with the hunting trilogy because Daffy is constantly getting all the best jokes (the famous "Pronoun problem" is one of the all-time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs plays the role of the cool manipulator while Elmer, as always, is the deceived greed. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so funny is that Daffy and Elmer pose such a small threat to Bugs that after all it's just a bounce and some easy laughs. Elmer falls into every trap that is set for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes out of the worst, shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in increasingly ridiculous positions. Everything is based on the inevitable climate statement "Sei spregevole". As an intricate example of Chuck Jones's impeccable timing as it happens to you, 'Rabbit Seasoning' is a true classic.
