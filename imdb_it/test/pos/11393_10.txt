Everything you need to know about late seventies and early eighties pornography is all wrapped up in BOOGIE NIGHTS by Paul Thomas Anderson. Although the film is completely made up, it is actually based on the story of John Holmes' kingpin porn. <br /> <br /> In southern California in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) works as a waiter in a nightclub. One of the regulars is pornographer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his starlets, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is fine ... a little ... gifted. <br /> <br /> So Eddie stars in Jack's films under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler". Become a "big" porn star (no pun) and seem to be above everything. Then came the 80s when the video replaces the film and Jack's porn empire begins to collapse, along with Dirk Diggler and all the others working in the field. <br /> <br /> BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well-made drama. There is a bit of violence, but P.T. Anderson makes it more stylized. And it's a scathing approach to the degradation of pornography, especially when VHS has become the standard medium for making porn. <br /> <br /> Many bizarre and unique characters are introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as someone working on films whose wife continues to have sex with everyone. I particularly liked the role of Don Cheadle as Buck, the stereo salesman. The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds. A classic from the 90s!
