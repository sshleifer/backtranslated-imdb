We will never see this film broadcast by HBO in the near future, if at all. If someone somehow meets him in a video store, just take it before someone else does, because I doubt it will ever be re-released again. <br /> <br /> An incredible and timely film about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993 and how government agencies tasked with identifying and preventing terrorists from doing damage and harm to American citizens and American property is completely dropped on the job and unknowingly allowed it to happen. <br /> <br /> Bone chilling because we all know now that the terrorists who had been arrested at the end of the film would not be the end of our nightmare that re-emerged on September 11th 2001. <br /> <br / > The film brought to light everything that went wrong in 1992-93, which enabled the first WTC tragedy to be realized. It took another eight years to realize that we would have to learn from that first WTC attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and much more devastating assault on the World Trade Center. I found this film more difficult to watch after the events of September 11th and the video of the September 11th attacks. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this film is not to watch it alone. The same ending is so powerful and prophetic that it would leave you in a state of shock knowing what we know today and perhaps needing to have someone with you, but not watching the movie, to call a doctor.
