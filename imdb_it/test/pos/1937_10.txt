This is a forgotten classic of a movie, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton for "Gummo". Gummo is good, River's Edge is much, much better. It is no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor who walks on earth. No, in fact, he is a horrendous actor. But, he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire of Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. It is perfect as a kind of good-natured teenager but very apathetic and confused. Then there is Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this film is the best of his career. It's as phenomenal as the drugged out junkie character. Then there's Dennis Hopper, who is also perfect. This film is simply fantastic, and if you haven't seen it, run away and watch it today. It's brilliant. One of the best portraits of modern America I've seen.
