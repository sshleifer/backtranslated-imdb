I was very moved by the gentle power of this film and the mood it created. I think he should have earned a lot more credit than he did. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been named, but I think all the performances were exceptional, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange interpreted the deep affinity and conflict of the sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I didn't read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very interesting. I will certainly never look at the game the same way again!
