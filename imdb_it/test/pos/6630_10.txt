This is a heartbreaking film and moves relentlessly. Yet it is absolutely unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on the civil experience, the loss of humanity that ordinary people suffer during the war. The two young married musicians undergo a slow and violent process of degradation at the hands of both sides of a civil war. Absolutely stripped of sentimentality, the film offers a bleak view of the modern world, and I think it is particularly recognizable to many Europeans. With courageous and intense performances by Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (similarly). For my money, the most indelible film Bergman has ever created.
