Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated psychiatric hospital to become a full-time nurse. He confronts a heterogeneous group of madmen and a seemingly crazier supervisor. Is Dr. Masters all that seems to be? <br /> <br /> NOT LOOKING IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low-budget films of the genre and because people always put it down is beyond me. The acting is excellent, my favorite performance is by Betty Chandler in the role of Allyson, the nymphomaniac. Shivers just jump off the screen. You probably won't have to say "It's just a movie, it's just a movie", it's not that scary, but any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre should like it, which I do. It is very difficult to make a disturbing film with a low budget and few really succeed. AX is another economic film that is underestimated. Perhaps people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any film that has no excellent effects and / or is not considered a classic has no chance with the public. But I think that after people see this film, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this film is a classic that stands out among the rest.
