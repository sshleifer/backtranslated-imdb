The Jungle is more an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only sci-fi part is the Woolly Mammoth living today. <br /> <br /> Elephants are attacking villages in a part of India and these attacks are also killing people. An expedition is sent to investigate and one of its members, an American hunter, blames these elephants who are frightened by the Mammoths Woolly, who are supposed to be extinct. Nobody believes it at the beginning, but they do it when the mammoths appear at the end. An earthquake ends them. <br /> <br /> The Jungle was filmed in India and has many beautiful landscapes and good Indian music, including some songs that keep the film in motion. Mammoths are actually true elephants with fur and long tusks attached. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Cat-Women of the Moon). /> <br /> La Jungle deserves to be seen, only for the scenery and the music. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
