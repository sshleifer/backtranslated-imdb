What a surprise. A basic script from the classic comedy "The Mad Professor" just meaner. The sympathetic Tim Thomerson (who steals the show in the role of Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is definitely exhilarating as Dr. Jekyll and Hyde's crazed sex. <br /> <br /> The only scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) captures Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: <br /> <br /> "How dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter. <br /> <br /> Jekyll replies, "but sir, I go ahead with the operation." <br /> <br /> Lanyon replies, "oh, well in that case it was * * your brain out !!! "
