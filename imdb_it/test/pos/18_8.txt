"The Dresser" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. The film is full of spirit and spirit, mostly provided by the "energetic" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Even if his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the protagonist (Albert Finney) who assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is. <br /> <br /> The gritty style of Peter Yates, who worked so well in "Bullitt", is once again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and consistency. This is much appreciated in a story that could easily become boring. In the end, "The Dresser" will bore many stupid people, but it will really be a joy for those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
