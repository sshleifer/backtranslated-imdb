Cat in the Brain by Lucio Fulci is an inventive and somewhat egocentric tale of a decent director in madness. The director in question is Fulci himself, who plays in the film. Fulci has become known to horror fans all over the world as "the godfather of blood", and for good reason, given that it has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome movies that have ever graced the big screen; from the violence of the eyeball in films like "Zombi 2", to a man murdered to death with chains in "The Beyond", until the gore-filled party known as "The New York Ripper"; if you want cold blood (and let's face it, who doesn't), Fulci is your man. However, all this to get cheetahs like you and me put his tribute on Fulci's mental state, and he is rapidly digging into madness, determined by what he filmed. Even Fulci's problems do not end in his mental state, since his psychiatrist who went to see his problem took the trouble to take the murder as a hobby, using Fulci's films as plans for the murders! <br /> <br /> I must say that the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious. There is a particular scene that involves a prostitute, and is suitable only for being mocked, both for acting and for her stupidity. Fulci takes on the main role of the film (obviously). He is not an actor, and he shows it, but his performance is actually the best in the film. It is also safe to say that overall, acting is bad for an Italian horror film. Of course, no one goes into an Italian horror film that expects good acting, so it's a little forgivable, but I think Fulci may have taken better. Even bad duplication does not help exactly. However, something that helps is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by a lot of cold blood, and it is extreme to say the least! People cut their heads, a woman is killed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, here we REALLY see it), people are torn to pieces, fed to pigs and there is a myriad of melee weapons more beautiful than cinema : the chainsaw on display, which delighted me without end. The amount of blood is enormously exaggerated for a long time, which gives the film something "braggart", but Cat in the Brain is obviously a tongue in a cheek film anyway. <br /> <br /> it would be difficult to make a film about you and not be seen as a bit big, and Fulci does indeed come across an important role in this film. His name is often mentioned, and he is on screen almost all the time; it's not very different from "New Nightmare" in the ego's mail, but it's obvious that he had fun doing it, and I was the first to enjoy watching it, so we can forgive him a little selfishness. The film's finale disappoints him - I saw him arrive a mile away, but then I didn't seriously think that the film would take that road, but I was wrong; he did it, unfortunately. The finish left me cold, and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the last two minutes. However, despite the end and the terrible acting, Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will satisfy Fulci fans, and is therefore recommended.
