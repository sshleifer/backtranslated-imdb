As you can see, I loved the book so much that I use the title for my pseudonym and I was over 15 years old. (Okay, so it had to be written phonetically to fit the character limit of the name for the BBS at that time, but what could I do?) If anyone finds this movie, I'd absolutely like to see it! Janet McTeer is fantastic in everything I've seen of her. I think he would have made a big Prue. It also presents the first Clive Owen - of Chancer premiere (a great series itself). What's not to love? I hope the powers are wise and make it available soon on DVD! With some of the real dredgers that highlight, the time has come for well-executed productions to do so also on the market.
