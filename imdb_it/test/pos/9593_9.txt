I think this TV movie was broadcast for the first time in the same week that Manchester Utd played in the Champions League final (1999), they handled many football related articles that week and this was an extraordinary event. <br /> <br /> He played on all the clich√©s that are baked every season during the FA Cup, ie losers losers, lucky suits / mascots, the name on the cup etc. And it turned out to be incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that it has never been repeated before other great footballing occasions, even now that the World Cup has just begun. <br /> <br /> Some previous non-football fan posts have said they still love it, but a football fan will find it fun.
