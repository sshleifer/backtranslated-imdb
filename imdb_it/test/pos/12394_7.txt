Hot and cold breath on Carn√©. It can really be a puzzle for me. I think maybe his inspiration left him a little earlier than it was for other directors of his generation. Certainly a man who had reached maturity in the 1930s with the Popular Front seems uncomfortable in the France of the fifties, with his unbridled commercialism and heavy American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars and shows. The party scenes go on much longer than they should, like he's trying to buy time to make the anemic scenario work. The character of Roland Lesaffre - he plays Pascale Petit's older brother - seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-fashioned ideas are still valid. <br /> <br /> At two hours, this image is too long. However, I would like to commend Pascale Petit for his gaming performance; she was a natural woman who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot for the supremacy of sexpots, but somehow lost her way. Even Andrea Parisy is excellent as the girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her legitimate (yes, they still thought that in the fifties). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who can convincingly interpret an anarchist: he is magnificent here saving a cat from death, then observing that he can't stand cats. Jacques Charrier only reminds me of how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant grin and those empty eyes.
