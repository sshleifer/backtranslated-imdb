Seriously any movie with John Malkovich is usually very good. And this includes Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice), and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> Clint is getting old now, but thanks to him he is also a fantastic director (We are used to Wolfgang's "water films" like Das Boot, Poseidon and Perfect Storm - this was very different but just as sublimely direct. <br /> <br /> The murderer's premise is as serious as it gets, the film is well structured, part of the violence is a bit ... But quite recommended (but not for children).
