This is one of the best films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading a cast of stars from a small town and a love letter. First of all, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this movie and doesn't want to move to this place is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is extraordinary as a leading actress who captures the emotional role of the roller coaster. Tom Everett Scott is fascinating as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the ever-delightful Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Even Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore order are both fantastic. Although it was unsuccessful, the film is fantastic as it is both short, sweet and very romantic. 10/10
