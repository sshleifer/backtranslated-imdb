This film won a special prize at Cannes for her acting and it's not hard to see why. (Some spoilers - but for the finale, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - In Moscow on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany in World War II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have spit when he learns that he joined the army. Boris leaves the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is hit but his final fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark, Boris' cousin, rapes Veronika who feels obliged to marry him. Degraded and humiliated by the vile Mark, Veronika clings to the hope that one day Boris will return. Superb photographic work and wonderful scenery by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in filmmaking, another film by Kalatozov, I AM CUBA, has at least two splendid pieces - one of them is a long rundown that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, rises two stories to a cigar factory, follows the window and follows the procession along a long and long road, all without a cut.) The superb acting, particularly that of Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (like Boris's uncle) is made even more touching by the simple underestimation. A devastatingly romantic film with a breathtaking performance by Samoilova. (This film is often linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
