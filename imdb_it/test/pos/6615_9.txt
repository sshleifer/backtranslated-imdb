this is one of the greatest documentaries I've ever seen with "Dark Days". I skated for maybe an hour my whole life, and I still love this movie. Peralta and her excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly, contributing in part with some incredible archival footage. Tony Alva is one of the most interesting people in existence. I love those knee-high sports socks, you rock Tony! <br /> <br /> Not only is this film a feast for the eyes, but the soundtrack must be one of the best in history, if you like 70s rock. Buy the DVD, you won't regret it.
