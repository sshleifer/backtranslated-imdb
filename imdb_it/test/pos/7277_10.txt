This psychological mystery / thriller is one of the best I've ever seen. All the actors give a wonderful performance, in particular Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who initially changed from the nervous little star through the strange events of which she is a part for the beautiful star. You learn a lot about the reality within people's emotions in this film, and a lot about the business of cinema itself. The film in film situations at the beginning and through the game that is played by the "acting coach" is fascinating. Even Mark Snow's music is probably the best score I've ever heard. You won't forget this movie!
