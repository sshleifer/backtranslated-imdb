Where the Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his talent for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons got up by making a huge puzzle available with an 8 hour limit. <br /> <br /> With a cast of award-winning actors Ron Howard does a good job in directing a story that is easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code has launched you so many corners in so little time that a short break in the bathroom would leave you a bit confused when you return. I didn't think it was with Angels and Demons, the plot was direct and the action kept the level of interest reached high. <br /> <br /> Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the film. His portrait of the elite, but misunderstood, degree of the Catholic Church has been very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing the parts immediately after the introduction. There is not a great deal of time for Tom Hanks as the film focuses more on the story than on the character development and this was good for me as I had more than one introduction to the first film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I found the character of Ayelet Zurer, Vittoria Vetra, a femme assistant not needed in the search, since her lines were a bit limited and seemed an afterthought. It plays a key role at the beginning of things but soon fades into the background of being the "familiar" of Langdon rather than a necessary partner. <br /> <br /> The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church has wronged in the past (there have been several) has sought revenge in a very artistic way. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are destined to be executed at specific times until an ultimate goal for the church itself occurs. Dr. Robert Landon is involved to help decipher the clues and collaborate with the beautiful Victoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed the death of a colleague at the hands of the church's enemy. <br /> <br /> The music remains relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could talk about these humble things, but what makes Angels and Demons fully functional is its conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazing endings I've ever seen in a movie and I was impressed by my numbness when it hit me. Like everyone else, I appreciate a great wrap-up and this film wraps it tight enough and drops a nice bow on it. Needless to say, I left the theater happy with the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and you are not sure that this film offends your Catholic principles. I can say that, where the DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady group covered with sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is represented as a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even some who have infiltrated their modern ranks.
