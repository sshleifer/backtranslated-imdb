I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and I almost expected it to be released. The fact that it was shot with a digital video camera has certainly inhibited its success, but, as I understand it, it was never the director's intention to make LOOK LIKE FILM appear in the first place, it was more about the story of the characters and of their relationships. Isn't that what movies should be !? But he had a quality in the plot of his visual aspect that suggests that May Thomas is something we should pay attention to. For filmmakers and independent producers who are talented and have no money and guidance, you can learn a lot by watching this film, technically everything is successful, the use of light, music, etc., far surpasses that of any other film digital that I've ever seen and therefore deserves a lot of praise. The performances of the actors are credible to a point, if not slightly below, I felt that there was much more there, more in depth, in particular from the male protagonist John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really bothers me, as a director myself, is that the film is in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins if it were in color? Do we have anything else to learn in the progression of digital technology? Or is this the future of wonderful and accessible film production?
