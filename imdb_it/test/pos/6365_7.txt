A lot of people don't think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This film demonstrates the opposite. Aykroyd is brilliant in delivering his lines in this play. The only major problem is that you spend too much time near the end jumping back and forth from Aykroyd's character and the doctor who is chasing him to prove that he is a cheat. The doctor goes crazy like Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What About Bob?" The scenes in which the doctor is desperately trying to get back to Los Angeles are stupid, unbelievable and not very funny. Other than this aspect of the film is really fun, especially in the first half.
