When I saw LAUREN BACALL doing CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I never imagined that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN play the role of Bacall on the screen. But here Ingrid really lets herself go to the hair for some good comic moments while the nurse pretended to be the wife of WALTER MATTHAU, so she could continue with the scam she told GOLDIE HAWN. <br /> <br /> It is a story played for laughter from beginning to end, stuff of good humor that never runs out of dry humor and intelligence throughout the execution time. There are a lot of jokes or jokes that are far above the usual comedy stuff that you hear on TV - the lines sound real because they blend so well with the characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> daffy girl who contemplates (at the beginning) to commit suicide due to her unhappy relationship with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (returning from her days as a TV star "Laugh In") plays a stupid blond role to perfection . It's easy to see why he won the Oscar for the supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Ingrid is surprisingly attractive in a rare comedy, although there are times when she seems a bit too matronly for the part. In any case, it is a surprising choice to play the nurse who makes an act of freezing in the office, but is considerably warmer. <br /> <br /> Like Goldie's neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz behaves admirably, and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays the kind of character that became his marketing title in all those roles of Neil Simon he had - an amiable cad who gets caught in his mess when he tells lie after lie. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of comedy that makes the ribs beat that will make you laugh out loud in some of Abe Burrows' fun lines and IAL Diamond managed to scrape together, based on a French farce.
