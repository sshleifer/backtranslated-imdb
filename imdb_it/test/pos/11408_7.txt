A hundred miles away from a grizzly murder scene in the small American town, Jill Johnson (Belle) sets up a baby-sitting night. With sleeping children and a beautiful home to relax in, she closes the door and raises the alarm. But when a series of disturbing phone calls from a stranger says he "controls the children", Jill panics. Fear of terror when having calls traced. And what the police find turns the perfect babysitting job into a 16-year-old's worst nightmare. There are no other main actors in this film. Camilla Belle is the main star with a pretty face. The day she arrives as a babysitter, she really has no idea what the hell you're really looking forward to. <br /> <br /> If I were in a house like the one in which Jill was present, I would explore everything around her. The refrigerator would be the first person I would look at, but I'm a boy and I'm not a babysitter. But what I found funny was the size of the house. I was thinking, would the film have been the same if the house wasn't that big? Anyone could get lost in that huge house, but this film needed a huge house. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle has a cute face, a perfect smile but it's like a movie like this, the lead actress needs someone with experience I found Camilla not so good. I don't know, maybe he thought this could be his decisive role. I like her, she's a pretty girl, but someone who has a role in this movie has to be someone different, like taking it. <br /> <br /> This film was not scary. I also found this film more like a "chick flick". I think the only reason he was released during the SuperBowl Weekend is that the guys are at home watching the game and the girls go out to see this. It also looks like a kind of movie where girls will have more fun than boys. But I liked this movie, but as it is. Girls like and are afraid or scream. This was just a pretty decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror movies that never happened. This was at his same level. So I liked this movie. I give him a 7/10.
