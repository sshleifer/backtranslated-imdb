It seems that M.Hazanavicius is back! The man behind "the American class" returns with a truly amusing and intelligent sequel to those obsolete OSS-117s ... While filmmakers tend to "surrealize" sequels of old classics (remember the avengers, urk), Hazanavicius has chosen to work on a really cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of low-budget French 007, and decides to do it in an old-fashioned way ... Photography, body attitudes, fighting choreography and l 'FX, everything is like a tribute to the way the films were made in the 50s. And it works, since the tone and the lines of the film are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly embodies this stupid and arrogant-macho-selfish French spy, lost in a country that understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority. Yes, that's right, just as the West uses to consider its colonies in those days (and, oh no, I won't say that it has something to do with what happens in the same area today ... ha ha) ... It just looks like a non-frozen Lino Ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role. The other cast members also adapt perfectly, with all that one can dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independentists and former Nazis. And of course, women, as there must be "femmes fatales" in any good spy-movie ... The plot is good (maybe not brilliant but really enough ...), which takes place between real historical facts, and there he remembers in a funny way how France (and the others) treated his colonies in those days. It all began in 1955 with a British spy disappearing as he traced a Russian cargo full of weapons to Suez. Then France sends her best friend, Agent OSS-117, to find out what happened to both the expedition and the agent ... The fact is that this agent is as stupid as it can be, and slips through history without not even understand it, solving it in a very clouseau-esquire way. I have to say that I had a bad feeling for the film, as the publicity around it was quite terrifying, and since French humor tends to be rather populist and flat (forget about les bronz√©s 3 or camping ...) but I was really surprised, and in the right way! I highly recommend it, whether you want a good parody of James Bond movies (much more fun than DEBS, for example, but less skirts) or you're a fan of that genuine and outspoken way of movies that they shot in the 5Os. Yes, he is intelligent and (really!) Funny, you have the point once again, Mr Hazanavicius!
