You think the police are always right. <br /> <br /> You believe that "eyewitnesses" are always right. <br /> <br /> You believe that prosecutors will not bring a case to court if the lazy police failed to perform 98% of a basic investigation. <br /> <br /> Do you believe that a city in the United States can have "few bad apples" in the police force, but that the "good cops" quickly suffocate those who are systematically engaged in evil for evil on the to be born. <br /> <br /> You believe that the possibility of a former football linesman being instilled as a detective only because his father is the county sheriff, and he is allowed to beat "confessions" of randomly selected teenagers without absolutely fear of negative consequences for themselves, could happen in America in the 1930s, but not today. <br /> <br /> You believe that a judge will NOT send a case to the jury if someone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by caught by the police because it was hot, and they didn't want to work that day . <br /> <br /> You believe that all innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are "exceptions to the rule", and an injustice like this could NEVER involve your family member, someone in the middle class, or someone like You. <br /> <br /> You think you know every terrible, indisputable, 100% proven outrage of the last 10 years in America - yet you haven't seen this movie.
