I saw this mini-movie when it first aired, and I loved it! It's fun to see how far people will go for money. It's also fun to see how much a guy can be "torn". "Mounted" enough to kill. I think the cast was great, especially the character Kristin. Without his fluid and deceptive manner of speaking, the film would not have been the same. I never use it to watch the United States, but now it's one of my stations. <br /> <br />
