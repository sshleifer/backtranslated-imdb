So it's not an epic, but for people who experience something like this <br /> <br /> (brother suicide) could be an interesting way of therapy. An imaginative narrative and a bit of acting make good time elapsed <br /> <br />. For some reason, it was not taken into consideration by the public, <br /> <br /> something I believe is the result of the main theme. Why did you commit suicide? Clearly, this is certainly not something that US movie buffs flock to, had it been a European production that would probably have reached its audience in a much bigger way <br /> <br /> <br /> . However, it is a film that, although the realism is contaminated by a sparkling romanticized light, offers the viewer a full-of-heart impression <br /> <br />.
