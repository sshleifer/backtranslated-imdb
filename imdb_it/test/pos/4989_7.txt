Too much added with too much of a great western written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers against the Indians. This script takes him away only to fill this mini series with a lot of hot fuzzy relationships that were actually secondary to the main storyline. It ends with a totally incredible and detached ending not written in the book that makes you doubt how we should be transported to Lonesome Dove. <br /> <br /> The main characters of the series were actually very well expressed, the shooting locations were excellent, but this mini series should have remained faithful to what is a great book.
