NORTHFORK is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. For this reason only the film truly deserves its time. Bare, broad plains and gullies in eastern Montana are captured in the muted, dull earth tones of autumn or early spring. The giant gray Fort Peck Dam is the protagonist of the film. The film comments subtly and not so subtly about a dozen Western Landscape numbers. Dialogue can sometimes be useful, but the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film. The 1950s period works so well here and it's done so well. I think the passing years will be kind to this film.
