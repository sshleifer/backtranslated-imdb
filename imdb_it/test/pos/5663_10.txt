I think it's incredibly difficult to write any kind of real-scale review to Giorgino, simply because it's one of those spectator films, complex, poetic and philosophical that wear the brain if, while you are watching them, you are trying to amuse their shell and get to their core simultaneously, yet there are many things that are certain and beyond all doubt for every man of art (which, I hope, they are). The first thing: it is a certain masterpiece, even of that kind of art that remains for a long time; the second: it is one of those rare "obscure" films in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much sadder than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. As for the core of the film, someone called him Kafkian, although I disagree because in reality it is far beyond the misanthropic logic of Kafka and much more similar to Edgar Poe's parables: dark and scary but through those that touch the most delicate strings of our souls. In reality, from the poetic point of view (which is much more important than narration), Giorgino is a story about eternal peace and love that can only be achieved through the eternal childhood of the soul. Those who have such souls are usually labeled crazy by our society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue lost by all others when they become "grown up": the virtue of God's love. In fact, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "Be like children" (Mt 18: 3) is the true hidden scroll, although the film never treats any kind of morality and focuses only on Christian philosophy, daring to suppose, the true God is beyond beyond all human morality. Yet I think Boutonnat is too hard to portray people "grown up" as a kind of demons trying to steal childhood to rare surviving souls, but it's his point of view and he has the right to think so. While watching Giorgino don't try to look for some hidden symbols (even if there are some), look for the thoughts expressed through the characters and their behavior, and learn from them. Furthermore, I cannot mention that the film looks surprisingly through excellent photography, especially through the rational use of color filters, incredibly appropriate editing, the wonderful acting of the entire cast and, of course, thanks to the atmospheric beauty of the winter mountains that I recalled the Brueghel "Hunters in the snow". Also, quite interestingly, the scene with the Death in the shape of an old woman with blackened eyes sunk on a cart immediately reminded me of Pesta (Peste) from the series of drawings by the Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen, who described how a black plague is sweeping via the population of a small town in the mountain valley. Is it a coincidence?
