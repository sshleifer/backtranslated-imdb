Hunt for Justice speaks of the staging of Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. While he was a little too clinical in the presentation, the topic could be very depressing very quickly. A Canadian judge, Louise Arbor, becomes the chief prosecutor of war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the United Nations in Yugoslavia. He fights everyone to extract the evidence that sent Milosevic to trial. Not a bad docu-drama with directing and production of class A. The "proofs" were disturbing for the fact-cutting discussion, fortunately they weren't too detailed and there were no real images of the tortured.
