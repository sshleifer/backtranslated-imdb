Shame is a high point in a master's career. Ingmar Bergman, penetrating, an existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland that deals with surviving a long war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow offer painfully detailed performances in this sober and bare drama. The intensity of the film is based on Bergman who keeps our attention on the minute and intimate relationships of his two characters - both established musicians - trapped in a landscape that they have stopped understanding. We see the way in which the external pressures of war complicate and erode their relationship. Both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to betray their sense of ethics. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematographic medium by showing us an interview filmed with the character of Ullman that has been reworked and distorted for political effect on one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene. <br /> <br />
