This is truly an Australian cult classic. If you are one of the lucky ones to have seen it, then you are very lucky. It was released in most countries, but not in Australia for some reason. I have a copy on DVD from the UK. Not a big transfer, but I bought it, previously seen at a film festival. The direction is apt and the rock performances! This is film from dark movies, but often, in very funny parts. I urge you to watch this film, there is a coldness in this that is not seen in 99% of the typical Australian fare. The script is very well done and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes, you can't choose how bad it is. Excellent work by the four protagonists, in particular Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When all has been said and done: Great work on display!
