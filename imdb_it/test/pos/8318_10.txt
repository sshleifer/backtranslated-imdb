Walking With Dinosaurs is an incredible documentary, both for the Ignorant of Dinosaurs and for Dinosaur-Lovers (like me). I admit, I was very young when I saw it on Discovery, but I was immediately obsessed with it. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes, ranging from the late Triassic when the dinosaurs first evolved towards the late Cretaceous, at the end of the reign of the dinosaurs. When I first saw this film, it was like I went back in time. The majesty of Diplodocus, the adventures of Opthalmosaurus and the thoughtful mother version of T-Rex amazed my whole family and me. It's a fantastic film, and I think the BBC has managed to do just what they set out to do. Amazing work!
