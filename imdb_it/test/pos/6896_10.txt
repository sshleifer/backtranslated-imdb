This movie was a lot of fun with just a little cool. These are two tomb robbers who are going on as usual when they discover that there is a different clientele that can serve. This changes the direction of the corpses they collect. The film is told by the younger of the two while he is explaining the deal to a priest before he is sent to be beheaded. His companion had already been beheaded. The priest is required to take down the last confession and take the form of a story. There is a bit of animation where you give a touch of Tales From the Crypt. In the story we meet another group of tomb robbers that everyone fears, but at some point, the younger of the two is offered a job for execution, so this calms down some animosities between the groups. When a woman joins the two men, she goes beyond her borders and gets them into trouble with the feared grave robbers. The story leads to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man he is confessing and the man who has already lost his head.
