... the last time I laughed so much. It is a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson who managed to create a comic character with different levels and a clearly defined personality - almost never saying a word. The entire success of the program is based on Atkinson's shoulders, but he takes it with ease. Despite the fact that the show lasted only one season, anyone who is even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the social "rubber-tard", so great is the talent and effort put on stage. Sometimes exasperating, sometimes lovable, Mr Bean is an innocent, unlucky guy who also appears to be the evil embodied. The splendor of this character cannot be expressed in words, you have to see it alone. <br /> <br /> The show becomes almost too depressing, sometimes, as in the notorious New Year's sketch, or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant, offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself, and getting an interest he doesn't like. However, there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods with which Bean gets himself out of trouble, such as when he has this pole in many clever ways, or when he turns into a swimsuit without taking the his pants first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you are obliged to throw laughter as you watch. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to emphasize that although "Bean" is classified as a children's program, it is equally enjoyable for all adults with a sense of humor. Because the more "adult" lines will go above the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) is fun regardless of age, "Bean" is the truest definition of a show for families. This is rightly a classic and always illuminates me by day.
