I have just returned from Santa Fe. NM. I visited the Loretto chapel. While looking around this building, which was bought by a private owner, I relived the film version of the staircase. It is an overwhelming mystique that occupies this building. It is about what can happen if you really have faith. The library has a narrative on the subject, which is the story of the scale. I read the narrative in its entirety. I was absorbed by the atmosphere that surrounded people. It was as if we were totally closed in a time distortion, all with the same thoughts and awe. When we left, the silence was overwhelming. Everyone should visit the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. NM.
