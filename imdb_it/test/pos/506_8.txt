Blade is a dark, gloomy, but significant vampire film and is one of the best. A little cool, but nothing really bad. Wesley's twists have played an important role in eliminating vampires. I don't really like buffy, because this is also tame, but Blade offers a decent storyline and it's the kind of movie you'd probably like to see on a dark and stormy night ... that's the best way to see! <br /> <br /> 87%
