This was an excellent PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, the WWE filled so many matches, some of the games were useless. I'm not going to go through every game on the card because it would take forever to do. <br /> <br /> However the most important highlights include the HUGE pop for Demolition that wins the tag team belts of Haku and Andre the Giant, The first mixed tag match with Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri against Dusty Rhodes the late Sapphire and the first clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some games were a complete waste of time. As The Bolsheviks vs. The Hart Foundation was only about 40 seconds, Koko B Ware against Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman against Akeem was too short. <br /> <br /> Mr Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs Jake 'the snake "Roberts was really very good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
