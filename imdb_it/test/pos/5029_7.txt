As a previous reviewer said, Travolta stole every scene he was in. Do you recognize the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, all grown up and still a bit shabby, but still nice, oh yes! <br /> <br /> William Hurt and Bob Hoskins were disappointing, perhaps because their characters were poorly written, or simply didn't care. I kept seeing one of the Baldwins (I never remember which one) in the Hurt role so Hurt's incredible talents weren't wasted. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is a treasure, but not very credible; partly writing. The development of the characters was not a big thing in this film. Just watch it for Travolta, sit back and have fun.
