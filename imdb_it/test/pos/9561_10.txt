This film was even better than "Waiting for Guffman". The great strength of these two films lies in the brilliant character played by the small company hosted by the second and second Levy. If one finds this film boring or useless, God will help them, they simply did not understand it. It's a mockumentary, something that Guest and Levy have a genius. At the end of the film, where the landlord's southern lover, Guest southern, tells us that to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on a "caboose", or when he tells us that ventriloquism is a ancient art and we see a hieroglyph <br /> <br /> of an ancient Egyptian holding a tiny Egyptian hand, I realized that these are moments like this that make life worth living. Thank you Mr.Guest and Mr.Levy, and God bless you.
