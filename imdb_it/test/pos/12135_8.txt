So you think you've seen all the Mafia movies ever made! Here is one that no one has ever heard of. It's a low budget, fast B-movie shot in the Jersey marshes. For us fans of porn movies, he had a bit of everything - sex, violence, profanity and wise guys who behaved like "gafone". While violence dominated the film, I found myself laughing at some familiar scenes I saw on The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for a 1977 version of the "Badabing Girls" at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> All our favorite mobster stereotypes have been published here. And, as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was superb, playing the classic wise character as we've seen him do so many times over the years. This was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. Pisces fans should go to the video store to take a look at this movie. You have to look carefully because it goes by different names. My copy called it "The Family Enforcer". Here it is known as "The Death Collector". But whatever name goes down, it should be called - A winner.
