I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew he would have had a cult following, but I had also seen many of the director's later works that, while delightfully bloody, were also quite inconsistent. NON TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear plot and a mystery that made me guess almost to the end. And after all was said and done, it was a truly disturbing and creepy experience. An important warning: I would have preferred to listen to the original soundtrack and read the English subtitles than the irregular dubbing found here.
