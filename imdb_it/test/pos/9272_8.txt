Remember Greg the rabbit? It was this show that started on the Independent Film Channel, but became a full-fledged Fox sitcom. My cousin and I thought it was rather amusing, beyond the precocious idea of ​​puppets taking TV-PG material. The puppets they kill are in a similar universe, where puppets live in the same world as people and, like us, take on a job and a life of their own. Let's just say that if you can't handle it, don't worry about watching PWK, since this show is a profile of 4 puppets that fall from the graces of society through drug abuse, hedonism and violent crimes just to end up half away. There is a lot of violence, sex and swear words (so it will never reach US TV). As if the sociopathic puppets weren't enough, the fact that this happens in Canada makes it even more disturbing (apart from the government pays for it), and I think any American TV viewer would require more insane cable TV power like this. I don't know where you can find it in the United States, besides the extra satellite TV, but I suggest you try it. Really fun stuff. (Airs on Comedy Network in Canada)
