In addition to having minor defects, this film is a masterpiece, and certainly the best war movie I've ever seen. Not the mention is one of the best films I've seen in all genres. I could have written it for No Man's Land before, but now I think this is better. It is VERY sad at the end, and I almost cried after the two shocking scenes that arrived 5 minutes near the final of the film. <br /> <br /> Karel's performance as a protagonist is fascinating, although he should be a newbie considering his age. This movie makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least brings you closer), and makes you hate any kind of war and politics. The flashbacks to the prison hospital make the film even more delicious. <br /> <br /> A small flaw in the film are the non-British accents of the alleged British people. Most of the English on the screen were actually British, but what about those who should be British and speak with a foreign accent? This really didn't fit this adorable movie. But it's pretty much the only flaw I've noticed. The effects could even be a little better but then again, we remember all the films of a particular land that have extraordinary effects and absolutely nothing else. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it. If you want to travel to Czechoslovakia in the 1940s and want to witness virtually an enormous amount of emotion at the same time, this film is for you. If you don't want to do it, this movie will make you want to do it.
