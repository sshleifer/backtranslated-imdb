Many people remember the Waco deadlock a long time ago. What many people have probably rooted in their minds is the "cult leader" David Koresh and the images of the compound burning on the ground after a long stall. Many people believe that Koresh was a kind of madman who thought he was God. He was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the collapse and death of his followers. Furthermore, many people hear the cult commit mass suicide when the FBI stormed the Mount Carmel Center and when the building was burning. Most people believe that the cult is at fault for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people feel that the cult has been brainwashed by Koresh and followed by everything he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, due to obvious evidence after the nightmare was over, and this unique documentary proves it practically !! <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced exams to the situation that has occurred. It is much more thorough and very detailed than anything else most people have received in the mainstream media. In the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that the ATF, the FBI and the upper levels of the US government were those who were unjust, cruel and deceptive, and not David Koresh and his followers. What Korseh and Davidians were doing was only protecting their constitutional rights, and the highest powers completely violated and violated these rights. AFT had no reason to attack the complex; it was the AFT that fired first and fired from helicopters from above at unarmed men, women and children !! What is even more shocking are the actions of the FBI when they entered Mount Carmel. Watch it for yourself and you will develop a new perspective on the US government. There is an infrared camera that clearly shows that the FBI was shooting with machine guns against men, women and children on fire overall. It will boil your blood. It will really make you angry. It will make you think about what kind of people run this country. Finally, it will make you wonder about what you are told about the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is terrifying and I highly recommend it if you can find it. This documentary does not need to be purchased; can be watched for free on google videos!
