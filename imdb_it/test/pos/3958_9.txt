Films belonging to the "film noir" genre usually contain similar elements: a "deus ex machina" twist that leads the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic punk, lots of money , much brutality and usually an epilogue in the desert. Think "High Sierra" or "White Heat". <br /> <br /> There's a lot of hard-boiled noir noir out there. But when the film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the ruined train of human lives. <br /> <br /> It is the latter tradition to which "Blind Spot" belongs. The film follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (played superbly with depth, grace, emotional integrity and true complaint of James Franco, who throws himself completely into this role) who fell in love with the crude streetkid, Darcy. <Br /> <br /> From the beginning, you know this will be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danny to his home. But the house is empty and for sale, and an absurd check for thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny is robbed of his clothes and possessions, but uses the check to track down the suicidal April - Darcy's other lover. When they reach Darcy's real home, they find Wayne - a thug looking for Darcy for the money he stole. Together, the three manage to locate Darcy in a dusty and run-down motel in the desert. But this is only the beginning of the story, as plastic explosives, drugs, firearms, a creepy funeral home, bisexual murderers and a lonely semi-finished desert house lead events to an explosive head in an alley outside a store of Los Angeles tattoos. <br /> <br /> This film contains some of the best film noir I've seen in years. In one scene, Danny runs on foot across the desert to the semi-finished desert house where he believes Darcy may have been taken by the mobs that night. A very long shot with intense light effects shows Danny - arms and legs shaking, palpable fear imprinted on his face (visible even at this distance), a cloud of dust that drags behind him as the wind lashes in his direction - running through the desert flats towards the house. The loneliness, the desperation, the despair that Danny feels are upset. There are many such scenes in this film, wonderfully made by the expert Maximo Munzi. This is a winning material at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Even the assembly is simply stunning. The film contains small moments in which the characters acquire knowledge of themselves or their situation. Pieces of time, in which memory and feeling return flooded. In these moments, fast image editing flashes on the screen. This is a superb montage of director and screenwriter Stephan Woloszczuk. In a first montage, Danny describes the wonderful feelings he has now that Darcy has entered his life. Quick images of Danny's diary flash on the screen: the words "4 life", "lucky" and "safe" momentarily stop, while a page on the page of words, the content of a human heart, crosses the screen - out of focus, too much quick to read. It's like the flow of emotions that Danny experiences himself. <br /> <br /> The flow of images reveals something else about this film: how beautiful the production design of Nathaniel Waters is. Darcy's gabled house is the perfect combination of high-tech and slob (a tribute to the attention of decorator Kimberly Foster). The beautiful scene of the desert house is simply disturbing. The ruined motel where Darcy is hiding can be found in any small abandoned town in America. The creepy (and incredibly bright) funeral home where the plot takes on a horrible turn mixes rawness with the cloak of death looming over the entire film. (Too bad the light director of the film is not accredited). This film has a superb production design, one that enhances every single frame and the performance of each actor. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this film that makes you take yourself and hold on: acting. James Franco is an exceptional actor. Even in "Spider-Man" - where he has been given practically nothing to do - Franco has shown he understands human emotions like no other actor of his generation. He is not a boy who is wandering around for his good looks like Brad Pitt. Franco interprets a profound emotion with all his strength. His performances contain pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home, where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. The minor actors could not complete the complete emotional collapse of a human being. Franco does it. <br /> <br /> Shawn Montgomery, in his first film, simply amazes you with his suicidal April performance. Deeply in love with Darcy, who suffers from a severe depression after having buried his unborn child alone (after the fetus spontaneously aborted) in a box of perfumes in the woods, his life of luxury and perfection is now a slaughter: April is one of the best - characters drawn on the film I've ever seen. While the relationship between Danny and Darcy is slowly mocked during the film, the nervous breakdown of April is revealed only to the public. Neither Danny nor Wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being. April's desperation, when she realizes that Danny is also Darcy's lover, is acute and powerful, even if she is cut short by the character's total inability to feel emotions for a long time. Montgomery brings a pathos to April that makes your heart beat. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason gets the hardest job in the film: having to do something human and real with the thug, Wayne. At first, Wayne is simply one of many violent drug dealers / obsessed gunslingers who appear in any number of films (from "Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason does very well with what he gave, but he can't understand where you feel much for Wayne. It is difficult to say if this is the problem of Gleason or that of the material. There is a moment when Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, even though neither Danny nor April knows it) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional bond between the two men - where you only know that Wayne is going to become homophobic Danny's ass. But the explosion never comes. (Thank God! Trite died from film noir.) Once the revelation about the brothers reaches the end of the film, the audience is stunned enough to understand the depth of love and compassion that Wayne has felt for Darcy - so profound that Wayne accepted Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But all this happens off the screen. Gleason never had the chance to play Wayne's feelings. It must have been very frustrating for the performer. <br /> <br /> The story is rather inventive, although the smuggling device seen at the end of the film may remind viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Bond). A traditional voice-over narrative (which shows that Franco is a great vocal talent as a physical actor) provides a terrifying atmosphere, although it tends to flow into schmaltz a few times towards the end of the film (providing some involuntary laughter). Terrifying venues play key roles in the film. Congratulations on the position explorer for finding such stunning buildings! The end of the film struck me a bit hastily; not pat, but a little too hard for my film noir. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the public hate or love "Blind Spot". The modern cinema audience, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often has little appreciation for the subtleties of the film noir. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who don't see despair, emotional collapse, hopelessness or depression as ridiculous. Bring them to a small theater, where they can admire the spectacle of watching the film, but where their vision will not be ruined by a crowd of people who will not recognize the good film noir. Take some popcorn (believe me, they'll be so absorbed that you don't finish it), take them a soda and let them overwhelm you. Go to a bright and cheerful place later, to wash away the filth and horrible from your soul. Because this film is so beautiful to make you feel, you will need that restoration.
