I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all the good things I read about it. I was certainly impressed, and I couldn't agree more with all the reviews I read. The second reason is because I know these guys. I don't know Mark like Mike. Not much has changed since the years we met. I know him as the "reaper" of a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way it is in this movie is 100% Mike. Once he gave me a table he made. He was small, about 15 "tall, Metallica said about it, the strange thing was that he only had two legs, sometimes it's the thought that counts, and Mike always thought of others first.
