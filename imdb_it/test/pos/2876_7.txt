A dangerous psychopathic murderer Jacob Goodnight is holed up in the Blackwell Hotel, abandoned and rotting, alone with his nightmares until eight teenage delinquents show up for public service together with the policeman who injured Jacob four years ago. When one of them is kidnapped by the murderer and his uncertain fate, the remaining little criminals must fight for their lives ... "See No Evil" was directed by porn director Gregory Dark and sees WWE superstar Kane as a psychopathic reproach. The supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here, but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans. Overall, I liked this movie and you should do it too, if you like unscrupulous slash movies. Sure, it's a clich√©, but who cares. out of 10.
