I still can't describe what to feel when I received this from the fnac website. Such a rare film, so little talked about and known, is hard to find, even for fans, but the contrast between past and present is devastating: now I keep a DVD of the film, with the best possible quality. As I did at Atlantis, the other rare Besson film I bought on the internet, I saw it at home, with all the lights on my DVD and TV off, and I marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect. Evilly, I always looked for a kind of disappointment when I saw a Luc Besson film I had never seen before. But it never arrived. This film was no exception. From the beginning, I realized that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to become big in the future. And so it happened. This has won numerous awards (including the highest award at a film festival in my country, which makes me proud) and shows that this film is preparing many bigger things. This could be the most original post-war film I've ever seen, beating Mad Max in originality and artistic sensibility. There is no problem with this film: its cinematography is brilliant, as are the performances of the actors. I am also proud to say that I finally saw all the films of my favorite director, and I have almost all copies (Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy the DVD). This film is above all a work of style and dedication, which explains why Luc Besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent use of music (I also marveled at Eric Serra's first feature film) and the promise of great results. Gaumont was right to bet on his boy-genius, the man who would later change the face of the relationship between France and Europe between the films and their audience. We hope that Besson will start working on a new direction project. I will be the first to exult. Until then, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn a lesson about how good movies are made with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the film, which, with its black and white cinematography, suggests an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust. This film works with the pure magic of films: showing in images what we cannot explain in words. And I am with all the people who have written comments on this film and I liked it: good choice! A big hug to all those who see it and feel that some of their lives have been changed.
