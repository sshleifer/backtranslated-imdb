No, I didn't see the original series and I won't compare the two if I had one. This series is shot in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, in British Columbia. The series is well written in a different story each week. Some are small out there, but most of the time it's the quality of the plot. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves of a lizard reptile species. It is strange how lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens as V, but in any case he has three days to program a man who is completely brainwashed into serving alien species on earth. The stories are usually a little off but very fun to watch.
