This film by Friðrik Þór, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. He has great Sigurrós music and good acting. Show how madness can be sad like a disease. There are many good jokes but the humor is dark. If this is not a problem, you should see this movie. Note however this is not a comedy but a drama.
