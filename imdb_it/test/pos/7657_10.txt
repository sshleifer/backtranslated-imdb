This is not "direct cinéma", in reality it is its opposite. Second episode of the gypsy trilogy of Gatlif, the French work produced by Michèle Ray-Gavras, is a cinematic masterpiece, not a pure documentary, no fiction. Instead, Gatlif has chosen different locations of the route from India to Spain, wherever the Roma people have a strong presence, and with the help of artistic directors has staged several musical numbers that tell us how they live, sing, dance, fight the gypsies and I survived. The film could have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the Roma tribe is of Indian origin, mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the Jews (so, in a sense, not it is surprising that they were persecuted by the Nazis). But above all anthropological arguments, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful songs and dances.
