"In the Mood for Love", a tempting allegory of solitude and desire. Here is a movie without sex, or even kiss - and it is undoubtedly one of the sexiest and certainly the most provocative and psychological novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of two people who coincidentally live in the same apartment and are a door to each other. The film, like and unlike "Random Hearts", talks about how two people meet because of their two lovers' affair. Only once they receive this news, they take the time to think about the consequences of a relationship, and the feelings of each other for having just left - and if the two people are willing enough to fall in love. <Br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is the way in which the director Wong Kar-Wai presents the way in which each character has to do with loneliness. With the character of Maggie Cheung, he will show her, in a repeated montage: leave work, go home, watch his neighbors gamble, go to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop, and come across his attractive age same, played by Tony Leung. This is an intelligent technique, if not subtle and wise to present solitude. Because it is when you are alone, when you find yourself falling into a cycle. This film worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.
