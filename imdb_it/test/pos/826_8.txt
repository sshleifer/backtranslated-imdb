Like Steven Seagal, I too am a big Van Damme fan and have followed most of his films since the beginning of his acting career. <br /> <br /> In this film Van Damme takes on the role of Jack Robideaux who is a policeman who has just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of the Border Patrol. Driven by memories of his past, it is up to Jack to put an end to a group of former Navy Seals from illegal drug smuggling in the United States that killed his daughter. <br /> <br /> Overall I found this film to be very good, Van Damme has been in great shape for 48 years and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the film also throws a couple of twists to make you guess. Unfortunately Van Damme does not have the same intensity as 10 years ago, apart from The Shepherd: Border Control is the third solid film that Van Damme has made by opening the door to a larger project. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to a Van Damme fan or a fan of action movies in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie, not as good as Until Death but better than the Hard Corps. Make sure you try this, you won't be disappointed.
