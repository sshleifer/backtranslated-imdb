An exhilarating thing that I will say without exaggeration, I am not the biggest fan of Seisun Suzuki. I actually saw a good number of his works (thanks to a retrospective that the film festival had) and I found his films just a little too inspired by Yakuza for my taste. So, I went to Princess Raccoon wary of what I was about to see. Boy! I was thrown out! 'Raccoon' is Suzuki's attempt at a musical, using elements of Japanese opera mixed with many modern elements (both Audial and Visual), Raccoon is a pleasure from beginning to end. The lead actor, Joe Ogdari, proves to be one of Japan's hottest actors these days in this role. I must admit that the young Japanese actors still have roles that take place in feudal Japan, dressing in full-effect samurai clothes. The story itself becomes a bit confusing, if you don't follow it very closely, but even if you don't, prepare for the treasures of Princess Raccoon.
