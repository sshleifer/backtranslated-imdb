In a word ... magical. AND SO incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, you just want his characters to succeed, whatever he does. And he plays Hari Om impeccably - from his absolutely perfect "Bollywood e-shtyle" to his awkward and shy way with a first kiss. He is a really gifted actor and I would not hesitate to see him in anything, because he gives life to everything and gives him a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely gorgeous. It took me a while to warm it up - perhaps because it plays the role of an ignorant tourist but fascinated so well. Her transition really became her and she adapted very well to her role. Even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, even if you never really like the scum she plays, Jean-Marie Lamour stages a perfect cad. The script, so real. I found myself repeating my friend repeatedly over the course of the film to say "that's exactly what happens in India! They nailed it!" Very real, very raw. VERY sweet and sour, but surely leave the theater satisfied. Nitin Sawhney's music is wonderful and fits perfectly with ever-changing moods. But Vijay Raaz ... I find myself constantly coming back to him - because that's what makes this film. He's the hero, the most fascinating and disarming rickshaw pilot you've ever met: it's magical. An adorable, true, sweet, incredibly talented actor who can't wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or elsewhere!
