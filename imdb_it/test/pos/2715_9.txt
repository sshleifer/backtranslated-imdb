Comeundone, I love you! I couldn't get to a better conclusion than the one you made on this movie and it's ending. My family hasn't seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I looked at it myself and found that it struck me a lot. Although the film is long, I remained tied to the plot and amazed by the ending. Initially I thought it was strange how it had vanished, but at some level it makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> But as he told me, this film has no sense of reality. Instead, challenge the viewer and the viewer to think hard about what the word "normal" means. It also gives you the insight to think personally about what the ending means, I can say that I loved how it ended and I am happy for Mithi.
