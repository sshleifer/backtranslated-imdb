Seven months after the revealing vision of Faces, I finally found a rentable DVD copy of Cassavetes' first feature. Filmed in Manhattan and in his ad hoc set acting workshop, Shadows was the culmination of months of improvisational rehearsals, in which actors (mostly amateurs) developed mutual bonds, invented their characters and polished their techniques to give their filmed performances are the right level of spontaneous familiarity. This intimate approach led to an incredibly bold work in Faces, for example, Seymour Cassel with her hands down Lynn Carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdose, just as the actors' total conviction gives up honestly bland moments like Lelia and Tony's post-coital evaluation of their relationship and Ben's repulsion at the touch of a black woman as a manifestation of her racial confusion and self-contempt. Homemade production in the best sense, dubbing and out-of-sync sound recording, granular cinematography and close-up camera settings, create an immersive atmosphere that fits perfectly with the nuanced vision of Cassavetes' human relations as it perpetuates work in course, marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and melancholy attempts at communication and understanding. The largely improvised jazz score of Charles Mingus is an ideal complement to the vision of the film of living at the moment, a mantra with which Cassavetes has worked and apparently lived.
