At first I didn't like the way the director went from the past (gulliver's travels) to the present (gulliver in the asylum). But it's really the best way to film the story even if you're used to it. Danson is exceptional as a title character and the edward fox is a wonderful villain. The worst part is mary steenburgen as Gulliver's wife. It has never been beautiful in Hollywood and in this film they make it look sloppy for some reason. I'll never understand why filmmakers make a bad woman when she adds nothing to the story! Besides, you want to strangle her for being so damn stupid in believing the lies that the bad Bates keeps telling her. Even his son can see through the bastard. Still a good show and I consider it B +.
