The End of the periphery, which should interest both citizens and mass consumers, is likely to become a state of cultural reform. The film uses super-cynical analyzes of authors, politicians and social philosophers on the paradox created by living in a suburban style - mainly in the post-war era. <br /> <br /> What we have created in America is a place with "none of the amenities of country life, and none of the comforts of urban city life". This is the recipe that is planned for the suburbs, and the film focus is on the unique idea of ​​"Oil". Basically, in the most general sense, that the world is approaching or the peak of oil production, and when we realize it in full, the main lifestyle changes will be effective, whether from our best interest or violently forced by a quality of life even the inhabitants of the slums of Calcutta could not describe us. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the end of Suburbia will attract the spectator to the intestine level, creating a sickening sensation. This is bound to happen. It is a bleak perspective on our intrinsic way of life. The ambivalence lies in particular in the critical analysis of each respective viewer of the film. I foresee many unprepared spectators who slander the film as smug liberal propaganda - like a film by Michale Moore. What they fail to consider is that a reaction like this is all too normal when such a message strikes so incredibly hard at the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses. <br /> <br /> This is the truth, and as a student studying urban planning, I can tell you that it is better to be prepared now, because the slightest possibility that we have to maintain the quality of life in this sewer being exhausted tampered resources is fading faster than a race of people affected by the black plague.
