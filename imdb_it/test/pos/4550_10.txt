I've seen this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life and it never gets old. For all the derogatory comments and insults (mainly from David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a huge heart. And that's what makes this movie fun after all these years. <br /> <br /> Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), master car parts salesman, and has ridden on all of life. But after his death he dies on his wedding day, Tommy discovers that the company is in debt, and is about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a huge auto parts company. So to save the company, Tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Along with the ride, though not by choice, Richard Hayden (David Spade) is a former classmate of Tommy who was Big Tom's right hand man. <br /> <br /> The film runs on the chemistry between the two SNL stars (and real life's best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy to feed the world. He's the big, stupid boy against the smart kid. It works, and some of their scenes are incredibly fun. Farley and Spade are actually also decent dramatic actors. Although the film is primarily a comedy, it has a fair amount of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are just as good there as when they make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more. I read his biography ("The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts", for anyone he cares about), and understand who Chris was in real life made this film more special to me. Chris Farley was a really good person who fought and eventually failed to win his dependencies. Although this was the first film in which he played an important role, it is his best film. He really showed who he was, and how much talent he had. Knowing Chris's story adds another layer to this film, though it doesn't make it any less fun. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade are paired with a good screen cast. Rob Lowe is properly slimmed down as Tommy's "new brother", and Bo Derek is as solid as his stepmother. Brian Dennehy is as big as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they are father to son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, even though he's smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd offers one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the harsh truth behind advertising. Julie Warner is also as good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the great directors of the comedy. It keeps the pace fast and energetic, but above all, knows how to make comedy fun. He doesn't joke about the jokes, and understands that funny actors know what they're doing and lets them do it. But Segal goes further. It gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that pulls the strings of the heart (sincerely) and tickles the funnybone. <br /> <br /> Critics dislike "Tommy Boy". Let them be ashamed. A film doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversive intellectual to be funny (God forbid that Farley and Spade were forced to do silent comedy at "The Office"). This is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.
