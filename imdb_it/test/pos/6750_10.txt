I think this film was made as good as it could have been. With only 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000 - I'm surprised it wasn't worse. If you don't care about the CG or special effects, this movie is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Ok, the film is not done well (I'm sure it could have been but, try to do better in just 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is pretty exciting. <br /> <br /> Don't trust me when I say this movie is good, because I also find the 1933 King Kong well. <br /> <br /> I must confess that I didn't even see the complete movie ... I could have gone ahead a few minutes here and there ...
