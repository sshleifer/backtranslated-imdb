The quintessence "let's get ready for the summer movie". It's stupid, stupid and maybe a little dated, but my kids just saw it and laughed as hard as I did when I first saw it. In the style of all the films "boys against the establishment", so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and fun. And no, it's not Bill Murray to his Bill Murrayest, but he's starting to stretch in what was his first starring role. Strange, though, to see how few of the "young young faces" in this film have continued to do much more.
