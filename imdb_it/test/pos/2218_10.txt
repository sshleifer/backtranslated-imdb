He had the pleasure of seeing a new independent film called "Half Empty". I usually go to the local cinema with my husband and I feel like I'm being held captive by the last Sequel, or Prequel that Hollywood throws at us. This was DIFFERENT and surprisingly ?? MUCH more fun than anything Hollywood spends millions on advertising. When my husband and I go to the cinema, are we going to be entertained ?? and "Half Empty" did just that and the film did it intelligently which made me feel like my trip to the cinema was worth it. It's a fun, humane and surprising musical story that sometimes cleverly entertains in its simplicity. I particularly enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. That particular scene reminded me of a scene in "Phantom of the Opera" when 4 of the not only artists, that is, sang against each other in a friendly reply. I'm not a film expert, but this film was more enjoyable than any other studio film I've seen lately. It's silly, fun, funny and fun. Completely enjoyable ?? which is what I expect from the movies, but they rarely offer "Half Empty".
