It's a sad state of corporate Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking streets you've seen in the cinema since day one. I had practically no idea how this film would end, because it went to the left when I expected it to go right, when I was expecting a zagato, etc. This could easily be untangled in a generic suspense, or depressing drama of white garbage, but it remained a path of its own until the end. It's a sad story, though. Not for what happens to Alice, but for the sad world that surrounds her and leads her along this road. <br /> <br /> The plot has a decent dignity of form that is usually reserved for the theater, but the rhythm could use a bit of tightening. However, it is a very beautiful film, and for some reason I suspect that the sour grapes of those who scored this low.
