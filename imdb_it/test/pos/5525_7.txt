The title does not refer to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic book players. Two come: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as they drive to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple that goes together to share the expenses, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as sheriff and owner of a hotel in a small Nevada town. No attempt is made to create a coherent narrative, it is a collection of comic pieces put together. The whole first couple wants to spend time together, but the characters of Burns and Allen are not married, so men go to bed together, like women do. There's a bit of plot: a bad $ 50k plant in the Pinky (Ruggles) suitcase is taking you out of town, but since the expedition is led by Gracie, the loot can't be found. The villain shows up in Nevada and Fields accidentally catches him. A lot of nice things, the confused expression of Ruggles, the crazy talk of Gracie, and Fields playing pool with a corkscrew and fluttery, craven, double-take backside when threatened, and his wonderfully distinctive way of lingering words. And trying to remember the name "Gracie", he tells Skipworth, "Hmm, start with a K ... McGonigle." She replies, "Oh no, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm. Wangahanky!" "No, no, no, no no. Oh, Gracie." "You are right."
