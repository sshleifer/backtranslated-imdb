Not having seen this movie for some time, we caught it not long ago in the beautiful DVD Criterion transferred. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that owes much to other films, because it continues to remind us of "Rififi", "The Asphalt Jungle", among others, because everyone has to do with capers that are at the center of the film and they reproduce in great detail. Unfortunately, we know that old adage that crime does not pay, and from the beginning, these men involved are doomed from the start. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melville was a director of few words. He did not fill his photos with much dialogue, as is the case here. However, not to be "talkers", they had their own style as shown by "Le Dolous", "Le Samurai" and his masterpiece "Bob le flambeur", among others. Mr. Melville had a sense of style expressed in everything he did. In this film, working with his director of photography, Henri Decae, he takes us on a tour of the streets of Paris that shows the vibrant city especially at night and the dark winter in France. The soundtrack is by Eric Demarsan who emphasizes a jazz music that accompanies most of the action. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows Alain Delon, like Corey, at the center of the action, he is still the intelligent inspector Mattei who is the real hero of the film. As interpreted by the great Bourvil, he is a man who shows a lot of patience because he understood from the beginning how to capture Vogel, and in the process he is involved in investigating the jewelery shot in which he knows the escaped man is following a large frame behind it. Bourvil gives a tremendously satisfactory performance given that Mattei shows equal parts of determination and tenderness, as in the case of the three cats he loves. <br /> <br /> Alain Delon has always responded with interesting interpretations of his appearances in the images of Mellville. Here is Corey, the man who was first seen getting out of prison and promising himself that he won't come back, but he can't pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery. His association with Vogel and Jansen pays off in the way they get the job, but it will also prove to be a mistake in how they will not be able to dispose of the loot as the fence they are based on has a change of heart. <br /> <br /> Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are seen respectively as Vogel and Jansen. They were excellent actors who blend well into the action of the film. Both actors were in the best moment when they played the roles in the film and show it. Mr. Montand has the most complex character to interpret as we witness it in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons in his head. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Mellville has achieved wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film, although it seems a little longer, but still manages to show his style in one of the director's most memorable images .
