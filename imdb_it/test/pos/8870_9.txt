I don't understand that this film has an average average rating!? <br /> <br /> I really liked it, I stayed up early in the morning to watch it on late night TV <br /> <br /> there are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. Danny DeVito has interpreted a jewel, a real undertaking considering that he was also directing. His trampled character, sometimes ridiculous, was brilliantly written and was surreal in an absolutely believable way. There are people like that, Owen was on the line without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal's comic style and timing were PERFECT for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and captivating and what's more ... you could understand his feelings. To really feel like you know a character is difficult to reach from the writers' point of view, finding the right actor to make it happen is an art in itself and both have been reached here three times. <br /> <br /> Third, who else could have played Momma? There is no one who can interpret this part so well. There is a style different from any other, something you love to watch, I found myself waiting for her to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was ugly, oh no, but because Momma's character was, again, like this on the line without crossing it which was excellent to watch. <br /> <br /> And what's more? A happy ending with new friendships found, nobody gets hurt and everyone gets what they want in life ... WITHOUT a big piece of cheese tied to the end. <br /> <br /> Brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great movie.
