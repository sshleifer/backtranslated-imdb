Is Thursday an original film? Hell no, but it's a lot of fun! I just discovered this buried in the movie channels one night and it was a fun movie. I was expecting a lot, but what I got was some interesting scenes (I really liked the first one seen at the minimarket), some funny stories told by the characters and a bit of action launched in the mix. Some good performances by young actors, Paulina Porizkova, were good and I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart (who continued to amaze me further in Yours Friends and Neighbors and in Erin Brokovich). So if you want 90 minutes of easy fun, go ahead and check Thursday.
