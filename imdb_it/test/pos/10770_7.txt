Mas Oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century. He rejected the "training" of the karate clubs of the time focusing on an intense form of training without restraints. He eventually built his system into a huge commercial empire with hundreds of schools around the world, without compromising his teachings. The tests in Kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically difficult tests a martial arts school requires. A non-physical difficulty faced by Oyama was the prejudice due to his Korean ancestors and he spent time demonstrating that loyalty was towards Japan and Japanese Karate. This series of films was part of this effort even though anyone who had the chance to meet Oyama (I did) would never have questioned his loyalty to Japan. In this series, the most famous student of Oyama, Sonny Chiba, is called to portray his master. <br /> <br /> Oyama comes from the countryside where he trained alone. Challenge and do a brief job of the established karate schools you meet. Disgusted by the state of karate, Oyama returns to his solitary training. Eventually he takes a student, falls in love and gets involved in gangsters who are allied with established karate schools. In the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a crazy bull. How much of the film is true is questionable. <br /> <br /> It is true that Oyama can kill a bull with his bare hands. He has been asked to repeat this feat numerous times. There are filmed instances of Oyama that actually do it, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be related while Oyama had been going on for years. Sonny Chiba portrays his teacher with conviction and karate is quite good. Chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner but, at this point in time, he was certainly above average. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is good, much better than most martial art films in the theater department. I've always wondered why it's not known anymore. Perhaps the very realistic representations of martial arts. People look tired and hurt unlike 99% of the action movie in which the hero is an unlimited source of energy and each shot instantly sends an opponent to death. Chiba looks so exhausted at some point that it hurts to look. Perhaps the spectators do not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for martial artists.
