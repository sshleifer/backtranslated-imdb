Despite its very low budget, "Sorte Nula" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I must say that it is a well-deserved success. What I like most about "Sorte Nula" is the intricate detail that Fernando Fragata has done to interest you in what is happening and what will happen next. It's very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple thriller like a love story. What is even more fun and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation, none of them know the whole story and are left to their own beliefs making "Sorte Nula" a cut above the rest. This is definitely not a movie that you want to go out for a bathroom in which you will undoubtedly miss something important. I feel that one of the main attributes of the film should be the environment it establishes. It's scary but fun at the same time. I read somewhere someone quoting this movie saying "... it was like watching Hitchcock ..." and I couldn't agree more !! I love movies like this, where you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING to fully understand what's going on. 9/10
