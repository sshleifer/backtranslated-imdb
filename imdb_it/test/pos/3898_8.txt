"A Slight Case of Murder" is an excellent TV movie, which is certainly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is a great film critic who accidentally kills his lover, and then has to try to hide the crime. While this may seem obscure, the film is actually quite light and fun, with many memorable phrases ("Acting is harder than I thought - have you ever seen the BODY BODY? I think I should apologize to Bill Hurt" and my favorite "For the next week, answer these two questions about the film noir, what do these people do during the day? and why does it always rain?" The film has a strong supporting cast including Macy's wife, Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell and Adam Arkin, must see for Macy's fans!
