H. Clouzot had difficulty working in France after making "Le Corbeau" in 1943, produced by the German company and subsequently judged by the French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to direct a thriller "Quai des Orfevres" in which he plays an ambiguous police inspector who investigates a murder that happened at the Music Hall in Paris. Without the slightest knowledge, the seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous accompanying pianist Maurice, who is madly in love with her (Bertrand Blier, director's father Bertrand Blier), tries to cover (without mutual knowledge ) What do they think their involvement in the murder is? Join the tough policeman (Louis Jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. Jouvet practically stole the film with a cinematic and sentimental marvelously at the same time. "His character, his eagle profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", a witty and suggestive observation of human weaknesses was a great return from H.G. Cluozot, the handsome director, "French Hitchcock".
