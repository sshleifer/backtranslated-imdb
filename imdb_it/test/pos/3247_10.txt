Before starting my review, here is a brief Australian jargon lesson that could help you see the movie and understand some of the other reviews from Australia and abroad. <br /> <br /> In the Australian jargon "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word about ass-revealing underwear), "stubbies" are a brand of Australian shorts, a "stubby" is a small bottle of small beer, and a "purse" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you love black comedies on small criminals then you will love this movie, unfortunately many people on IMDB with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humor have reviewed this film which unfortunately makes this film more mediocre than that which is. A lot of reviewers have also compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, while it's the same genre, is a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have also shot this film for using the dead brother of Heath Ledger's characters to open and guide the narrative of this film, without watching the movie enough to understand that his brother was killed by the same villain who wants to kill Heath's character, this is explained in the middle of the film but not clearly enough for most to understand. <br /> <br /> This film is also reminiscent of the Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs as it is the Director / Writer debut feature and, for a first feature film, also applies to these two films, in effect, as Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs I consider this film as a 10/10 for a director / screenwriter debut, unfortunately unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan fails to meet the expectations in his later films like Ned Kelly. br /> <br /> This movie is one that you shoot uld definitely add to your DVD collection and is one that can hold many views quite easily.
