I saw the 1973 film Lost Horizons and read many reviews for this film. I agree that the move had many opportunities for improvement, but unlike all those looking for the perfect movie with perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a little different and this movie gave it to me . I watched this film not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little joy, a bit of liberation from my everyday life, and this is what I got. You can be critical of chanting and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to the movies. I'm looking for a little release from my daily life, a little time when I can sit down and imagine a better life, where people love another and help another. It's a pity we can't enjoy a movie for what it tells us and stop choosing it as an English teacher who reads a fifth grade essay. This can be very simplistic, but in reality, it wouldn't be nice.
