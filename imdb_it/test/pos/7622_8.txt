This movie is pretty good. It seems that they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex as an inflated balloon, just like Godzilla, only perhaps in those 60-70 days, the scientist doesn't have enough information. on all types of dinosaurs. Back in those days, the scientist continues to make dinosaurs, so I imagine that this film was based on a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the 60s and 70s. There is also a part where a giant rock, shot by someone at the Tyrannosaurus Rex, damages the Tyrannosaurus Rex and has been eliminated for a while. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex is back to looking for food. There's also something wrong with the film, like a gun, like a gun can kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex, when it could be stronger than 1,000-5,000 compared to us. If this film will do a remake, I suggest making it more beautiful and excited, because watching an old movie seems to have a remake of it, if lucky.
