First, let me say that although I generally appreciate Mike Judge's work, I was simply lukewarm in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead. In general I prefer a smarter comedy, and here lies the irony towards the Democracy. <br /> <br /> In a future world in which the embodiment of Beavis and Butthead's visions, the lowest instincts and intellectual abilities are the structure of a chaotic Semi-Blade Runner society, untidy, semi-crazy of Max, where the imagination of every guy in a trailer truck becomes reality, a man with average intelligence is threatened and accused of talking about gays, and the mentality of the crowd takes over. And this world is also incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's obvious that the executives of Carl's Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers will be upset by the convoluted values ​​given to their products in the year 2505. <br /> <br /> There have been some opportunities lost with the film, and the relationship between time travelers - the other being an average intelligence woman who is worried about her boyfriend's (pimp) retribution - could have been stronger; the chemistry is there. And there don't seem to be too many women in the future. <br /> <br /> He left me with a smile on his face, but the experience is a little better than the memories. So, it's my kind of popcorn movie, and it's going to be fun to revisit on video. Recommended! FYI stands for credits for an extra scene.
