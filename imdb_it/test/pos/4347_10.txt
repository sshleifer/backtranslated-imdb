Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best film in the series and my favorite movie of all time. This film is not taken seriously, because the filmmakers knew that all the social comments that were needed were put into the first movie. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 has been unfairly criticized as "junk" and "a tired voice in a consummate series". These statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement, but it was not. If you take it for what it is, DW3 is just fun, a wild action game, with Charlie making punks on the street what we all wish we could do. The action is relentless, the atmosphere is fantastic and the film has just come out of the best Bronson film ever made. It can be said that the Cannon group that stole a penny spent a lot of money on it. It is believed that Bronson thought this film was too violent, and for this reason Winner did not direct any of the following voices. I can understand his concern, but as always with sequels, you have to push the envelope further to pass a previous entry. In any case, this film was not more violent than any other film made during this period. What makes DW3 the best in the series and my absolute favorite film (not the best, just my favorite), is the action, the presence of Charlie, the memorable villains, and it's the ability to pick up the spectators on the wagon. The first film could be the most technically well done, but this is the most fun. For once, Charlie actually has some clever lines (though he doesn't say much) and a half-interesting story, photography, action and direction to support it. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than this. Yes, he is an exploiter, perhaps he promotes stereotypes, and maybe it's the same story as before, but Bronson's films always and always will try to defend the common man and give the public what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates its audience, my answer is that movies don't manipulate us, fans are responsible. We ask Bronson to wipe away deserving scum and, in turn, Winner and Co. deliver the goods. And for those of you who still want to put it down, remember a few things. DW3 was the number one movie in America when it came out and was among the favorites of millions of people on video and on television because they realize that not all films must be epic, they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You can't improve.
