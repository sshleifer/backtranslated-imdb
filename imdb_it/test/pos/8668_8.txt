At first glance The Bothersome Man looks like many other movies / books in one. Kafka's The Trial, Melville's Bartleby, Reginald Perrin's The Fall and Rise and Groundhog Day immediately come to mind. A man, Andreas, arrives in a city without a name where he is immediately assigned a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. However, there is a grip: his colleagues are all friendly, insipid and completely devoid of character, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation: the interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people jump from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow, or spend their days reading furniture catalogs and eating food that tastes of nothing. <br /> <br /> Andreas quickly realizes his situation and spends the rest of the film trying to escape, in various ways. Suicide turns out not to be an option, and when she finds a new girl she is just as lacking in feelings as the old one - there's a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in and all she can say is, ' I'm not sorry'. <br /> <br /> In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man has to say has already been said before, and after about 45 minutes you start to feel that you are actually experiencing a certain sense of deja vu. Yet his point is what is probably worth repeating, over and over again: an unexamined life is a life that is not worth living. In addition, it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls. More than one character reminded me of the people I met, especially his furniture-obsessed girlfriend, and if at the end of the film the filmmakers ran out of ideas, maybe that's the point: there will be no end unless you don't may find other people who share your sense of alienation.
