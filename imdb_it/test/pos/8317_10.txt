(r # 88) Brilliant and very entertaining show with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles must see it. The CGI integrates perfectly with the environment and it is simply fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as on the Discovery Channel. This show was a stroke of genius and blows his followers "Walking with beasts" and "The future is wild" out of the water. <br /> <br /> The biggest episode was certainly the last, in which we got to watch the last days of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the meteor blast that became their fate. This stuff is almost too great for television. What about a theatrical version? I would pay anything to see these dinosaurs in the cinema. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, this is for you. Dinosaurs have never been fresher.
