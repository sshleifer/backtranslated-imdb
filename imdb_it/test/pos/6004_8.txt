Despite its many flaws, the 1995 version of Hallmark's Gulliver's Travels is still the best adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical classic - largely because it includes not only ALL of Gulliver's many travels but also includes satire that is often overlooked. Unfortunately the twin problems of the highly episodic structure of the book and a television budget (even if quite generous) remain. The book is a somewhat inconclusive collection of stories from travelers that simply pass from one surreal landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees Gulliver return to England clearly profoundly traumatized and trying to prove his way out of the asylum where his wife's rival for affections made him commit. Scenes in England mirror and comment on journeys simultaneously, elements that occasionally flow into the real world. The trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more like a distraction, constantly moving away from history just as it starts to get interesting. The scenes of Lilliput suffer worse here, with the feeling that the domestic scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the most expensive setpieces - this must be the only version in which we don't see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind him. <br /> <br /> However, once Gulliver makes his escape, the tone becomes more coherent when he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the Brobdingnag utopians, a guest of the sages of Laputa's floating island that are so immersed in science that they no longer have common sense, the host / prisoner of a historian who relies on history directly from the source, offered immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding a world to which he wants to belong if only he could convince the sublime Houynhnhms speaking horses that he is not an un-civilized Yahoo, every new destination convinces him of what is an absurd and petty human species. For the most part it is a set of trips that is more obscure than expected, with the only curiosity, common sense and disappointment of Gulliver that prevent him from falling into irreparable irreverence - and this too is compensated by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if it is to tell the truth, it could have made him really crazy. It is in these last scenes that Gulliver of Ted Danson really shines, never more than in an extraordinary speech where he transforms his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race. <br /> <br /> Being made for television, the Yahoos are a little less literally scatological here than on the page, but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than one might expect without a real dumbing down. The star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well used (though in some cases briefly) - Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them. It is hard to imagine that the next version of Jack Black is approaching an equally impressive fraction.
