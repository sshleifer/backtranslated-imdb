"Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his TV show. In his show he talks about all kinds of things, but his main goal is the political issues he is highly esteemed for. One day in his show, a fan of the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should stand for the President of the United States. After the episode was broadcast, millions of people poured onto the web to create various petitions and express their opinions on why Dobbs would become a great candidate for the President for the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for president and low and sees the elections win. Everything seems to go as planned until a woman with the name of Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) shows up and starts some controversy about her position. Out of this comes a fun but serious political thriller ?? <br /> <br /> Anyone walking in this movie expecting to see a mindless comedy will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are marketing films when I see how to deceive their marketing campaigns. "Man of the Year" is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything, from the poster, to the trailer, to online advertising, makes this movie look like a comedy. Honestly, I must say that about 1/3 of the film is fun, while the rest plays like a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think. In a way, I wonder if the marketing was done on purpose because this film deals with rather serious issues between its comic routine. <br /> <br /> But just think of marketing, let yourself go to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I really liked "Man of the Year" although I expected to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things I will give to this film is that the film does a decent job moving from comedy to drama, even if at first it seems a bit awkward. I really think that, after understanding that the film will be more of a political thriller than a comedy, you feel at ease. Some do not do it because they are led to believe that they are seeing a play and do not understand what this film is trying to say at the end, but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this movie. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" talks about many things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs says, he is saying things that need to be said and it is not candy that covers them. I also think that the whole political subplot, while most critics say it probably hurt the movie because of misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computerizing the vote has been launched in recent years and with all the problems that computers have faced in this film it could certainly be realistic. Even the control that large companies have over the vote is addressed. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think all the people involved have done a good job. Robin Williams had the chance to be fun but serious at the same time playing Tom Dobbs. Some say Williams has surpassed his welcome as a comedian, but I still personally think it's funny and that he is also a good serious actor. This is probably one of the few occasions when we can see it going back and forth from serious to funny and I think it works well. Also it's nice to see Lewis Black's co-star in a decent film. Once again I like Black when he appears on "The Daily Show" and gets up anyway most of the movies he has been in have been horrible. This was a good film for him because I think his political opinions fit in with the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a nice addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and finally Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do a great job as always with this role given to them. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us films like "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog". Levinson does a great job writing the film and directing it. As I said, I know that many critics did not like the whole political aspect of the film, but I thought it would fit perfectly. It was good to see a mainstream film that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a good job with this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, don't get into this movie expecting to see the movie the commercials are selling you. He has laughter but at the same time he plays more like a political drama. It's not as stupid or foolish as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this film was not a typical Hollywood movie. He tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film didn't really mitigate any of the problems faced, nor did it have a typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to define the ending right from the start, but surprisingly it didn't end as I thought and made me happy. It is a film that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later I will allow you to think and ask me what will happen next. I think it's a good movie that will be damaged by its bad marketing.
