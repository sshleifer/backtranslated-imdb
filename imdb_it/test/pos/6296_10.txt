Conrad Phillips is the protagonist of the action adventure series of the 1950s - William Tell. Set in the 14th century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland, William Tell is a reluctant freedom fighter, fighting heroically against tyranny and the oppression of invading forces. William Tell is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips plays the main character in a fantastic way. It is possible that Pascal Bugnion would have been more successful in the role, but was not available at the time of shooting. The classic action show consists of a series of 39 episodes. The episodes are in black and white, but this does not detract from the fun in any way.
