Although at times I was the only one in the cinema to laugh, this is the main pleasure I took from the splendid "Thirst" shot - laughter. Although at times it seemed that the film had an identity crisis and did not know if it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humor shone at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> It naturally helps that the acting level of all concerned was wonderful, and that I was a little obsessed with the bad, sometimes wicked, extraordinarily elegant woman, no matter how stained with blood malevolent has become. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews that suggested that this film was too long. I didn't think so. In fact the last scenes, moving and hilarious (I mean, brown shoes ...) in turn, were among the best in the film.
