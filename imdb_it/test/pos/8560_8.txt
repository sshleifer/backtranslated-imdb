Naturally, entering it, one would expect it to be a typical, stupid T & A movie, and it is. But he really has quite well thought out humorous moments. Given the era in which it was created and the obvious aspect of exploitation, it is still one of the best B comedies of the time. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, you will clearly see the inspiration for many of the "Revenge of The Nerds" scenes and numerous other films of the same genre. Most of the acting is horrible, and WAY exaggerated, but that's exactly what I expect in a film like this. What he lacks in terms of acting ability, is more than compensated with his field value and complete contempt for anything of merit. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie, is that there was obviously some money gone inside. Movies like this made today don't have the same style. If you can turn off your brain and give a sense of humor for an hour and a half, you'll like this movie. I challenge anyone not to find at least SOMETHING in this movie they think is fun, if not hilarious.
