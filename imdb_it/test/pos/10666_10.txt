Much has been said a lot about this film and its fundamental importance in shaping the language of the film. If you are interested in the history of cinema, to really understand the innovations that Eisenstein offers the medium you could try to see Potemkin next to almost all the films made before (those of D.W. Griffith offer a good contrast). It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only theoretician of editing and that the principles of editing editing would probably have been discovered at another time. However, even today, few directors have tackled the ability with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about this kind of thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. You should see it, buy it and have it tattooed on your chest.
