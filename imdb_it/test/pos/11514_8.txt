As far as I know, this was my first experience with Icelandic films. It's a real relief to see something different from your normal Hollywood movie. Too bad that films like this have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope that people will look at this by chance, recommendation or other ... <br /> <br /> Because it's really worth it. I left the cinema very sad. I could not get the tragic fate of the characters out of my head. And it struck me even more when I thought about the complexity of the film. Not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comedy implications and an excellent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, look at it! It's really inspiring and made me think a lot. <br /> <br />
