"One Crazy Summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just when one crazy scene is over, another one emerges. It never makes you rest. Only one thing after another. The soundtrack is fantastic. The songs are the right ones for the scenes. <br /> <br /> It is also a clean film. Not very dirty. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it has the story of the kids you wouldn't trust with your lunch money, take up a challenge and win over people with more resources. Who would like to see it if they fail? There is a serious side, in the sense that parents and children do not live the dreams of others. One should always have an open mind and weigh all the options. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer", parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
