I did it too. When I saw the band for the first time, I immediately dismissed them without even listening to music. Then one day, out of pure curiosity, I bought the CD and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. hold on to your children at lunch, this will not be nice! the video was excellent - a great opportunity to listen to music, see some of the promotional videos and meet the band ... although I * still * don't know how they can stand wearing those masks all the time! a must for all fans of the band, and fans of alternative music in general
