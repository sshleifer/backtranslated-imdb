This is a remake of the classic 80s anime, and that's even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss all came back like the Saber Knights in their tough clothes fighting the boom robots. The animation is sharp, the characters are well developed and the action oscillates. Priss is a singer in her normal work, so the series also features some wonderful songs. There is a good deal of violence, but most are against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too bold. DVDs also have many extras, including comments, which really improve your understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must for any anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
