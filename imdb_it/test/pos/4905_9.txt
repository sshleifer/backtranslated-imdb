"Four Daughters" begins as another clone of the "Little Women" melodrama. A single father with four daughters eligible for musical talent has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courtship rituals. What makes the film spin is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star, some critics say the first anti-hero long before James Dean loved the big screen. From the moment when the dark figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears at the door of Ann Lemp (Priscilla Lane) who squirts his self-pity and his philosophy condemned for the rest of the cast, "Four Daughters" becomes much more than a simple touch chick. <br /> <br /> Although Garfield is the main reason to watch "Four Daughters", there are other flashes of brilliance to be enjoyed. The Hungarian director Michael Curtiz, later responsible for gems like "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce", identifies some images with his camera (aided by the director of photography "Rebel Without A Cause") that attacks viewers, for example the jarring gate that Ann's first suitor, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), fluctuates about so allegromente becomes the symbol of changes in mood and affection by those who use it. <br /> <br /> That Garfield offers the standout performance is obvious, but the rest of the cast keeps it as long as possible. The underrated Jeffrey Lynn plays his role to perfection, like the neglected suitor whose love for his beloved Ann never wavers even when he is with another man. Claude Rains, a bit battered as the father of the four young women of mature age, offers a refined representation of a set about a head of a family who gets lost in the fray. The three Lane Sisters, already famous for their musical skills, turn into established actresses, interpreting their parts well. A host of secondary actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make everything credible. <br /> <br /> The way opposites attract is part of the action to touch the viewer's imagination quickly. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are down and out. He always looks on the bright side and, like many caught in the pincers of the Great Depression in those days, he saw prosperity around the corner. Mickey recites a whole list of bad things that happened to him looking for company in his misery on the part of Ann, which Ann refuses to do. Mickey expects to come out with lightning striking him as he goes around his waist. Mickey has a meager talent as a composer; Ann has talent to sell as a singer and musician. Ann is great for beauty; Mickey Mouse is big on personality in a distorted sense of a way. And the differences go on and on. As all this is reconciled, in the end, it is an important part of the film, not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Watch "Four Daughters" for John Garfield, the debut of a recitative debut on the big screen. The only time he was better came seven years later, when he again hypnotized the film-goers with one of the greatest performances of all time, like Frank Chambers in "The Postman Always Rings Twice", in front of the equally charismatic Lana Turner. But also look at "Four daughters" to capture important elements that could be missing if too much concentration is put on the star of the show.
