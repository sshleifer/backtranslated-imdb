I haven't read the Anne Rice novel about which this movie was based, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting the QUEEN OF DAMAGES and it's probably better for your health. It is not that this film is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and it definitely carries the active part of your brain more than this movie. You can count the number of pages of Anne Rice that I read on one side, but after watching this movie and interview with a vampire, I have the feeling that she is writing really good novels. The plots for both films show a whole sea of ​​stories of deep and intertwined vampires. <br /> <br /> However, the narrative voice of Stuart Townsend becomes much more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampiric narrative ever did, and it can be said that the limited production resources of QUEEN OF DAMAGE do not give enough meat to the plot of Anne Rice. While the interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN is based on low-budget special effects that really try to be taken seriously. It can be seen that the original novel had potential as a film and that the production team focused its attention on the wrong places. The costumes and the rock and roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and a stranger soundtrack. <br /> <br /> However, I will give credit where the credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed made me fall in love with my illness as Butthead. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a fantastic Goth-rock zoom and a splicing montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the direction degenerates quickly. It is as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and money to do justice to an Anne Rice novel. What results there are some scenes of mediocre vampires and a lot of special cheese effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do justice to the genre just when John Carpenter's counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is the pale blue make-up? Scene after scene, I shook my head remembering the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when the budget was kept to a minimum. <br /> <br /> There are qualities of redemption that save this film from being junk. Props on Aaliyah and his soul can rest forever in peace. She could have become a famous actress, if her life hadn't been taken from us so prematurely, because she gave this film a decent performance with a lot of beautiful belly dances. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It wasn't too long. Anne Rice's novel could easily have been a three-hour film if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola put his hands on it. There are some twists and turns here and there in the plot. But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll in addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there. The director of this film has continued to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini-series if it tells you anything. <br /> <br /> JY <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
