... "Inglorious", as our local theater has decided to show the title on its pavilion, minus the second word. It is a formidable cinema. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to recommend this film to everyone except those who are overly picky. Let them never know what's missing. <br /> <br /> I hesitated to give him ten stars because of my experience with Tarantino's previous films. In any case, save "Reservoir Dogs", they are improved with additional surveillance. <br /> <br /> So even though I gave him ten stars, I did it reluctantly. Don't leave me "up" to go to. <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is the Nazi that we all imagined the worst of being. He is cultured, sophisticated, gentle and sadistic, the kind of man who can threaten a glass of milk and who abruptly extinguishes his cigarette in a strudel, crushing it in whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim. <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino's films, you just need to have a sense of dialogue, color and rhythm. The colors are as bright as necessary and, when necessary, even brighter. On the French farm of the opening scene, they are mute and dark, but excessively. A shining sun shines outside, but in the only room of the house, everything is immersed in darkness and black. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant environment for an interrogation of Waltz, as the "Jewish Hunter" of the SS, which rocks his French peasant guest in the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsessive lines of friendship and understanding. <br /> <br /> A second German sadist, well played by August Diehl, later plays the role of an important actor in the final twist. The Nazi from Diehl, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz ... almost. <br /> <br /> Film lessons will study a lot from this film. They should look affectionately at the superb rhythm. Tarantino knows how long to take out a scene, create suspense in the way of Hitchcock, then just to the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution. <br /> <br /> For the color, look for a final blow to a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish owner stages a surprise for the leaders of the Nazi leadership. <br /> <br /> We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, waiting for the hated German dignitaries who will come for a cinematic preview of the last masterpiece of the film Deutsch, a piece of propaganda about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments. <br /> <br /> Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the marvelous theater, his red lips and low dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of his designs on his guests. It's a single shot that would be worth for an entire movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are many other images of this type, many other scenes of dialogue and suspense. <br /> <br /> In short, watch it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.
