In a sport that rewards extravagance and the treasure of its characters, one of the greatest of them in the 1930s was the Dizzy Dean pitcher. He was such a colorful personality that he was probably elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame based on this, as opposed to his pitching stats. After all, part of Dean's story is his end of his career. <br /> <br /> In the pride of St. Louis Dan Dailey succeeds in successfully capturing the character of Dizzy Dean, at least the Dean I remember. I'm not old enough to remember it while singing, but I do remember that he played Baseball Game of the Week during the 1960s. This is also part of Dean's story, being a pioneer radio station and later on television. Now that the announcers are in the Hall of Fame, there's no doubt that Dizzy belongs to us. <br /> <br /> Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of sharecropper children who had very little schooling, but an incredible talent for throwing a baseball at blinding speed. In fact he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who was also a good pitcher. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna plays Paul in this film and is one of his first film roles. Paul Dean in real life was a quiet retired type, whose career was also interrupted by injuries. This is why Crenna is not given much to work with. During Dean's heyday, sports journalists tried to hang Daffy's nickname on Paul, but they never wanted to. <br /> <br /> Joanne Dru, taking a break from playing, Western girls in checkered dresses and corsets are top notch like the wise, patient and understanding Patricia Nash who met and married Dizzy while playing for Houston in the Texas League. <br /> <br /> In 1937 All Star Dizzys left for the National League. In front of Cleveland's Earl Averill, Dean was hit in the foot by a scream in line. Refusing to listen to medical advice, Dean started playing too early. He had broken a big toe and put too much strain on his arm. He was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept is part of the story. <br /> <br /> If you had a career of ten to fifteen years, who knows what pitching stats you might have rolled up. Dean was the last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain (who was a sort of character himself) did it in 1968, it hasn't been done since. Dean went on broadcasting and while he wasn't the first former player to go to the broadcast booth, his colorful descriptions of the game made him an instant hit. He started broadcasting for the other team in St. Louis, the Browns and the Browns were a rather miserable team with little to cheer up. Dean has become an attraction to be there. <br /> <br /> Of course part of Dean's story is the problem he had due to his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself in the air. This is part of the story in which I will not enter, but in the film it is managed with tact and humility and your eyes could get wet if you tend to be sentimental. <br /> <br /> A nice baseball movie, a true tribute to an American success story.
