A gritty Australian film, with all the elements for success. Two Hands represents the ability of Australian filmmakers and actors to produce high quality popular material. The film has a new perspective and uniquely incorporates drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this film extremely enjoyable on so many different levels, but I can also appreciate that it might not be everyone's "cup of tea". The film bears distinct Australian humor, as it portrays the evil underworld of Sydney, and explores the lives of a young man (Ledger) and young woman (Byrne), overwhelmed at the local crime scene. <br /> <br /> Two Hands addresses the issue of good and evil, both at an interpersonal and personal level, and analyzes the issue of consequences for "our" actions. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is captivating and the dialogue humorous. With Bryan Brown playing Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy, facing him on screen in the most bizarre situations - this Australian film is certainly not lacking in acting talent. <br /> <br /> This subtle action / comedy has become somewhat of a cult favorite, and also one of mine.
