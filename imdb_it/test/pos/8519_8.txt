"Never Say Never Again" by director Irvin Kershner "Empire Strikes Back", a remake of the 1965 James Bond film "Thunderball", does not exceed the original by Terence Young, but this non-Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli it's good to look if you call yourself a 007 fan. However, despite the lack of smart gadgets and the lack of a vibrant soundtrack, "Never Say Never Again" is considered an above-average and suspenseful doomsday thriller with top performances by an experienced cast, including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The film is full of surprises in abundance from the sequence of titles of the invigorating title during its generally exciting but long 134 minutes. Unlike the franchise saga of James Bond with their breathtaking show moments, "Never Say Never Again" provides some of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. In fact, the film presents only three gadgets: an explosive ballpoint pen, a wristwatch with a laser and a rigged motorcycle. Apart from the delightful opening theme by Lani Hall, Michel Legrand's "Ice Station Zebra" soundtrack for orchestra leaves something to be desired. Legrand does not replicate any of those captivating jazz signals that have made John Barry's music for the ordinary Bond franchise so memorable. All in all, "Never Say Never Again" seems to fit more closely with the first two Bond films? "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" ?? and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" in terms of its lowest "Never Say Never Again", presents Sean Connery's James Bond as an old 007 who saw his day and was taken off the active service to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was one year older than the Connery and Moore's Bond films treated as 007 as an active and young boy. Sean Connery appears to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a series of changes take place in the script by Lorenzo Semple that emphasizes the age of Bond. Initially, Connery had lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece, but the wisest and most merciful minds prevailed and Connery sported a hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit and looks better than he did twelve years ago when he rushed to "Diamonds Are Forever" at the last minute to replace John Gavin. Connery had worked on another film and gained weight for the role he had failed to remove in time for "Diamonds Are Forever". At 52, Connery still has a youthful vigor despite the constructive claims of the script. <br /> <br /> The action takes place with 007 alone, trying to save a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. He sends several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only to have her knife her in the side when she is not looking. It seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by M (Edward Fox of "Day of the Jackal") to test Bond's ability. The new M does not share the use of its field agent predecessor. M decides that Bond needs to clean up his system of all "free radicals" and that 007 has been brought to Shrublands. While in the country clinic, Bond notices a suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and is noted by observing them. The nurse is none other than the SPECTER killer Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera of "Dr. Moreau's Island") and is in charge of ensuring that no one sees the USAF officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy of "Superman 3"). Petachi is part of a SPECTER plan of billionaire Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer of "Out of Africa") to obscure world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The wicked implant a double eye on Captain Petachi who has access to highly sophisticated computers and can order weaponry. After stealing weapons for SPECTER, Fatima Blush takes him off the road by throwing his domestic snake on his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows it up. In fact, the first part of "Never Say Never Again", apart from the SPECTER planning conference, belongs to Fatima while she supervises Petachi's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite With an explosive device. <br /> <br /> In the end, Bond meets the beautiful blond Domino (Kim Basinger of "Mother Lode") and sneaks into the Largo charity banquet in a Monte Carlo casino where the two confront each other in an elaborate video game called 'Domination' to see who will rule the world. Bond surpasses him and Largo hates him doubly because 007 is his only rival to Domino and a thorn in his side that not even Fatima seems able to remove. Bond and Fatima make it after a motorcycle chase when it returns the favor and makes it explode. Their previous meeting in the Bahamas when they attacked a device to attract a shark after him is rather lame. As in the original "Thunderball", the wicked recover the nuclear warheads diverted into the sea, but only the warheads themselves. <br /> <br /> Bond flies to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic contact, Nigel Small-Fawcett (not less than Rowan Atkinson of "Mr. Bean" fame, who is worried that Bond will kill someone and ruin paradise of the island. Of course, Nigel Small-Fawcett is the comedic source of inspiration for the film. The CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey of "Guns of the Magnificent Seven") to support Bond This is the first time that an African American plays Leiter Bond meets his share of problems, involving Domino's rescue from Arab slavers, while Leiter and he save the world. "Never Say Never Again" is a very respectable James Bond thriller with many touches, but never generates an air of danger that the James Bond films have: "Never Say Never Again" looks like a decent Masterpiece Theater take on 007.
