I read all the novels by Jane Austen until the end of each year since I was 9 and received the Modern Library edition of her works collected as a birthday present. <br /> <br /> I loved this film for its love story and for the music, which remained, obsessed, in my head. Of course it was an interpretation, not an Emma or Sense and Sensitivity, but something very different and something that Catherine would have loved. And oh be loved by this passionate Henry! This was the imagination of Henry of Catherine, and it is the romantic heroine that he read in his novels, and that was promised to us by the Jane Austen practice that tells us from the beginning that the unlikely Catherine will indeed be one. I wonder if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. Perhaps she too could imagine such a Henry. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the film in many years, at least for a decade. But, I've always longed for it.
