I had never heard of this film when a good friend recommended it. I trust this friend's taste, so I bought the DVD. My wife and I sat and watched him without knowing what it was. I thought it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I highly recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people will see the gross humor and aura of stupidity and will find Idiocracy one of the stupidest movies they have ever seen. What these people do not seem to understand is that gross humor is there, not to entertain the public, but to show what attracts the morons in the future. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is well interpreted as an "average Joe". He is mainly there to be a weakness for the stinging commentary on the society that develops in this film. Many of the funniest pieces are in the background, so it's worth seeing several times. What makes the film even more fun and scary is that I see elements of it in everyday life, in the people I meet or in the media. Then, I go back and review the Idiocracy, and I realize how beautiful it is. <br /> <br /> The few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club. I will see an advertisement for some product with some innovative ingredients, and I will turn to my wife saying "He has electrolytes!" You know exactly what I'm saying.
