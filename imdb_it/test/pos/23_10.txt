Anyone who appreciates acting and dialogues will love this movie. Taken from Harald by Ronald 'Taking Sides', it is fun <br /> <br /> and is finally coming up with an analysis of a relationship between two very "relevant" types. Albert Finney is as sublime as the despot actor <br /> <br /> Shakespearean who barely notices the world war around him, so intent is on the crumbling fate of his theater <br /> <br /> company and the his psychological and emotional collapse. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is as unmatched as Norman, the 'Dresser' of the title, <br /> <br /> whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless. <br /> <br /> Really worth seeing.
