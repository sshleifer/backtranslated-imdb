This film is excellent (I saw the French version). There are many subplots (which usually take away from everything), but they unfold and contribute to the main theme of the "discovery of the true self". In reality, the entire film (in addition to its background) is the journey to discover the self (or someone else's). Is the king really a "good peacenik monarch" trying to wage a "war to end all wars" or is he just a restless and bloodthirsty thug? Is he a real king after all? Is the queen mother attendant just a warm lustful puppet, driven by a career and without a backbone, or rather a high-pitched thinker, a bold individual? Will the lady / concubine understand who the king really is? What's between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret that everyone knows but won't tell? What is the real reason why the killer left his "job"? Subplot (something I'm not particularly fond of) are managed well and keep one until the end. The scenes are well done and CGI fits perfectly, without exaggerating. The suspense is properly maintained and the actors are up to the task. There is a lot of smiles damaged by the brain, but that's how they were supposed to behave at the king's court (as the lady / concubine complains). Realistic movie with no superhero moments. This Chinese movie really puts the giants of the Hollywood cartoon (the Gladiator, etc.) to shame.
