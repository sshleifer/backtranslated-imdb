I'm not sure I've ever seen a black comedy from Denamark, but it's actually pretty good. Humor is appropriately low-key and unmoved to go with some of the macabre activities. Svend and Bjarne are tired of working for their boss, because he always puts them down (in fact he mentions that they weren't bright enough to decompress before peeing at some point). They do what they have to do to start up their own butcher and when a worker is accidentally stuck in the refrigerator during the night while staring at a light, they come across something that makes their butcher much more popular than their old boss. In fact, he is the one who sold their first "fillets", and it's partly his fault, since he served them at a Rotary dinner at his home and the guests were thrilled and showed up at Svend and Bjarnes the next day. Bjarne is a little horrified by what Svend did, but he doesn't stop there. Svend has grown above his grim existence to be someone of some popularity who is new to him and doesn't want to let him go, so the freezer continues to fill up with all kinds of knowledge (and, at some point, "a small swedish from the park "). The suspicions arise, however, because the former chief Holger thinks something is wrong. Bjarne is also persecuted by his twin brother Eigil, who lived in a hospital for years in a coma and Bjarne wanted to pull the plug to get the inheritance money to help open the store. When Eigil was removed from the respirator, he was brought back to life, to the great horror of Bjarne. And Bjarne also has a love interest in Astrid, who works in the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-adapted individuals and therefore things start to lose control. The impassive humor really makes this, and although this isn't exactly laughing at sound material, it's certainly fun. It's a bit creepy, though considering the pieces of meat and body parts casually around, especially since these two take everything so practical. If you're a fan of black comedies this is recommended, I enjoyed myself very well. 8 out of 10.
