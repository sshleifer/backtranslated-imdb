... And there were several. <br /> <br /> I don't like this comic as much as many others, partly because it was made in its time. I much prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs which are some fifteen years earlier. Many people will like this, especially people who always find violence funny, cartoon or not. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is fairly well known for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes hunting, Daffy leads him to Bugs and Daffy ends up shooting instead. Pretty clever and very funny jokes (some don't improve the episode), bad shots and animations that are slightly mediocre are also included. The plot is mainly oriented by beats - each bar keeps the episode in progress. This way of doing the plot is not entirely unusual in Looney Tunes (obviously if you are a Looney Tunes bofin or an anxious like me, then you will know it already). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I said about it, enjoy "Rabbit Seasoning"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half out of ten.
