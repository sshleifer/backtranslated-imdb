I saw this film for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of dance, acting, dialogue, plot, script and the whole atmosphere created by this movie. I would highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray offers an absolutely wonderful and first-class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. He has a natural ability and talent to dance and is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what's wonderful about Baby is that she has such wonderful depth and dimension to her character. This is not simply a film about dance, but the writers also gave us the chance to see Baby face the various emotions and sensations he is experiencing during the film and to allow us to understand how his interaction with others in the field changes his life. Gray plays his character with such realism and intensity that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as he experiences everything he does in this movie. <br /> <br /> Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and really succeeds in making his character become alive. He gives his character a complete personality, a strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Gray is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this film <br /> <br /> Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role as Penny and her portrait of the test she experiences is really powerful and contributes to a frightening dimension of the film. The other support cast members Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here - they also offer wonderful and imaginative shows that give this film an extra dimension of acting and high quality credibility that is wonderful to experience. The dance is magnificent and first class by all those involved. <br /> <br /> The script and the interaction between all the main characters is intriguing and involves the viewer in a powerful way. The plot, although extremely predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this film successful. <br /> <br /> Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this film creates a truly magical atmosphere and a very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes. <br /> <br /> `Dirty Dancing 'is a truly powerful, magnificent and very attractive film that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. I highly recommend it
