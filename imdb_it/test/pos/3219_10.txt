i love this show! it's unbelievable ... I can never miss an episode, even if I've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts ...... I love Gilmore's girls! I got all my friends to watch it. their parents also watch it now. I watch it every day and I usually watch it more than once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. my friends say I talk and I act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it's a great show for kids because they actually learn to watch it. my vocabulary has expanded from observing the Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis bled el are perfect for the Lorelei and Rory parts. I think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris has left Lorelei and Rory too many times. and he broke Lorelei's heart too many times.
