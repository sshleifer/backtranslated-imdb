in his descriptions of CAA, platinum dinners in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown that he never took and free trips to Nicaragua, financed by images of Columbia. <br /> <br /> Seems narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (perhaps because of his unusual personality) ropes to the public, laughs at himself (perhaps because he didn't take the oh-so-serious Hollywood thing seriously) he takes care of us. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not just about "The Killing Fields", or "Swimming in Cambodia"; it's more like a pastiche of events, as you see them. Some of the lines are classic, like when Gray meets the esteemed talents of CAA. The conference table is ... "full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an Oregon lake ... there are no drugs now in Hollywood." <br /> <br /> This was before the tragedy occurred. Many of us will miss his off-balance humor. 9/10.
