Came from Outer Space II is a very nice film that has a good cast that includes Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, Iilana B'tiste, Jerry Giles and Howard Morris! The acting of all these actors is very good. Kerwin and Norris are really excellent in this film. I thought they behaved well. The thrill is really good and partly surprising. The film is shot very well. The music is fantastic of Shirley Walker. The film is quite interesting and the film really makes you go on until the end. This is a very good and exciting film. If you like Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, the rest of the cast in the film, Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films action so I highly recommend you see this movie today! <br /> <br /> NOTE from the movie Nuttball: <br /> <br /> I noticed that this is the second film in which Dean Norris and Mickey Jones were together in a movie. The other is the classic violent epic Total Recall!
