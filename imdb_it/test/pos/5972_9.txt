Fantastic Russian film of World War II. Like most Russian WWII movies, The Ascent is incredibly heartbreaking. It is also dense in its symbolism. The story follows two partisans, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who go on a mission to find food. During their journey they are spotted by German soldiers wounding Sotnikov. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, which leads to problems for the two partisans and for everyone they will meet later. The film's greatest achievement is its vivid sense of place. Russia is frozen and snowy, and it's hard not to feel that the cold is going straight to your own bones. Shepitko keeps his shot close to the characters, examining each crag of their faces. Probably not the choice, but the film is framed in 1.33: 1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. While the whole film is a good result, I felt that the first half was stronger than the second. My main complaint about the film is that it develops into a very subtle Christian allegory at its peak. I simply don't think that symbolism adds much to the process, especially when I was already intrigued by the debate between the two partisans. It's not quite right. I was evaluating the pros and cons of their arguments. I started to lean towards the point of view of a certain character, and then the director opens up and tells me that he is Judas! Despite some heaviness, this is still a must-see.
