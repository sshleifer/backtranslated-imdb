I didn't expect much from this story about a kid whose term was stolen and turned into a movie script ... who then goes to Hollywood to get even .. but .. hey .. it's still a funny movie. Frankie Muniz of "Malcom in the Middle" has a reputation as a child and is quite good and even Amanda Bynes as her friend is very good. The film works as an advertisement for the Universal Studios theme park and it's really a silly kid movie .. but I liked it anyway. GRADE: B-
