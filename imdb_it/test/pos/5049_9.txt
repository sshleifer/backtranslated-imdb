To qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary, not many old people I know go around pretending to be famous masters, blind, etc., Nor have I ever been old. Those minor problems in between, the relationships between the characters of this film and the emotions expressed in it were completely realistic and genuine. In fact, even though we are not yet 30, I could see many features of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. For those who do not die young (there is a nice phrase in the film about this, when the two best friends talk about dying young, and one of them says - and I'm paraphrasing, we lost our chance - we will just have to turn it off), we will all be where these characters are one day. I know that many viewers would prefer to be dragged * away from reality instead of being * confronted * with it, but they too could enjoy the sweet memory of our mortality - and the importance of living life to the full - that this film is.
