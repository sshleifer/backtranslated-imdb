I saw Dark Harbor at the 1998 Seattle Film Festival. Shot in an autumnal Maine setting, this film boasts an excellent cast and a plot that makes you guess everywhere. Sometimes mysterious, sometimes funny, I have to say that he stayed with me for days after seeing him. Rickman and Walker are as wonderful as frozen mates and Reedus is someone you will hear more about, I'm sure. The opening blow of a deserted winding road in a rainstorm at dusk (and the score that accompanied it) set the tone so well - simply fantastic. Bel, good work by a new-ish director / screenwriter and his talented crew.
