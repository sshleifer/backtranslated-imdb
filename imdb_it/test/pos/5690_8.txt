As a child I loved the song "Never smile at a crocodile", and if I was in this state of affairs, which is actually inspired by real events. Smiling would be the last thing on my mind. From the opening set, I've never been as entrenched, taken and finally exhausted as I was when I watched this Australian-Australian limited-budget horror film, about three people in the Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very conniving croc waiting in the water below them. What really brought the film to life was how realistic it was to convey the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the public. The semi-documentary camera works with a disturbing and disturbing background and authentic performances take you out of your comfort zone. What we get is a patient survival story rather than a bloody all-out creature. Think of "Open Water (2003)", where his budget and moderation made sure he would remain low profile, but this minimal barrier has improved the experience. <br /> <br /> The slow texture could be black and white, but it never seemed to become disposable or succumb to formal patterns. Well, not largely, and the connection between the characters was emotionally engaging even with a naked and direct script. Although you can say "less is more", with the actions and expressions that illuminate the persistent thoughts that plague their minds. The test is absolutely terrifying, because the threat is very much alive and never seems to come off. This is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline, and where it lasts (even when it was buried) to the end. <br /> <br /> Writers / directors Andrew Traucki and the economic director of David Nerlich alienate and elegantly connect the viewer with his tense and heartbreaking psychological traits. In some places the notch rises, with suspense induced by pressure and surprising images. The way the night sequence is performed is immensely chilling and pulsating. The menacing crocodile manipulator toys with its fresh flesh in a distressingly suspicious approach. Certainly some moments seemed unlikely, but it never gets in the way and never interferes. Sound FX is the key and sometimes the lack of anything eats you. The Rafeal May soundtrack is unpretentious and does not enter much into the mix, but when it does it builds an organic sound quality. John Biggins' cinematography is beautifully designed and quickly aggressive when the mood changes. He was always on the move and claustrophobic, but none of these jerky movements. The editing was abruptly managed, and the effects were professionally adapted with the superb combing of footage of live crocodiles. <br /> <br /> Something like this production should also rely on its cast to sell to the story in a credible way and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and above all Maeve Dermody are convincing. A lot of responsibility falls on Dermody, and she strongly offers an inspired turn. Now this article could make some comparison with another killer crocodile film "Rogue (2007)", but the two could not be different in what they want to be and how they end up. If I had to choose, however, I am leaning more towards this output because of its pure involvement in taking a shot. <br /> <br /> A considerable effort on all fronts, with all those involved in showing the potential to really look for.
