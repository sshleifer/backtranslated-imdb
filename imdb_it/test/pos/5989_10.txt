I love foreign films and this is among the best. I tend not to see it as a comedy as it is listed and I find a comment on how we see others around us. Firmine, the protagonist of the film is not considered as a servant in a large company and people say and do things around her all the time that otherwise they would not say in front of others. <br /> <br /> This leaves you with an infinity of information that can make or break the mere mortal. :) This actress is as wonderful as this character and it's a poignant story. There is a background story and almost many stories in the history of this film. I just hope that if someone decided to make an American / English version of this film it would not be the vein of Three Men and a Baby that would surely do a bad service to this FILM, a must see .....
