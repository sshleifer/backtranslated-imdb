This cartoon documents the second meeting between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (1949). <br /> <br /> If measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not be among the first 5 or 6 of the year 1952. Regardless, this is a very funny short film. The coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and gets tired completely. The ingenious "Latin" scientific names of the characters are very original and were first imitated in other unrelated cartoons. The coyote collapses and shows a wonderful expression of - I don't know - the right. These expressions of Jonesesque make this cartoon provide something more than its share of laughter in seven minutes. Then he has an idea, and another laughable expression is worn. The joker jokes are all hilarious and mask the fact that it is really bad to inflict such pain on a poor, impotent GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows it, but who cares? <br /> <br /> Even the old rocket is present. Coyote binds to a rocket, which should produce enough energy for him to reach Roadrunner and grab it. Instead, the rocket fires into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: eat from Joe. This classic gag is born from this cartoon; although obvious, it still makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is really hunting through the well. The two wear helmet lights, and we see the tunnel through which the two are going, with only the lights visible. Here, the comedy reaches a peak. A sequence not to be missed, perhaps even the best sequence in the early days of Roadrunner. The final touch is given by the writing of Michael Maltese, while the light of the Coyote turns off and unconsciously lights up a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a group of cactus jump and spells out the letters "YIPE!" after the explosion. These little things make you laugh for just seven minutes, and as soon as the fun starts it's all over. Rocket skates are another good idea, as is the free water drink and the anvil on the narrow rope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). Giving the results of those far away would be useless. The free drink turns out to be a problem for Wile E. at the end of the penultimate sequence: rocket skates. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is full of beautiful animations, except for the characters. Although they are very well animated, the two characters are very primitive; which could be a euphemism. Although it may seem strange at first, the humor of the sequences that ensues makes you forget. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage Jones, look at this. If you love Roadrunner, get this on video. Excellent entertainment (grade: 8/10).
