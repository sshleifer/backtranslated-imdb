I just watched the closing film of the Austin Film Festival. Upon entering, he had seen some fragments of their act at Alamo Drafthouse, and thought the trailer was fun, but I didn't expect such an epic theme and the use of tarot cards is ingenious in the title sequence. Pay attention to the Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins cameos and the same dark lord (who has a fetish for KG). So much exaggerated fun and the songs are so catchy. Car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will gain cult status right away and win some new Tenacious D fans, just like me. I hope this goes well in the cinemas. "Follow me, we are the shadows"
