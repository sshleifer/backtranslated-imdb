The sexy killer Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) still wants a life of marital happiness with the ex-boyfriend, the mad assassin Charles "Chucky" Lee Ray. After getting his hands on the Good Guy maimed doll that last hosted his spirit, and doing repair work, he leads a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the poor Tiff, the revived maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she traps him in a cage, with a wedding doll for company. In the end, a rather angry Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) escapes his boundaries, glares Tiffany in the bathroom and traps his soul in his "bride" as punishment. <br /> <br /> Realizing that they are both now in the same situation, the plastic pair puts aside their differences and decides to head to Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can get their hands on the magic amulet they can transfer their spirits in human guests. The flogger Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his tasty girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) in taking them to their destination, the psychopaths launch themselves into a murderous fury, with their unconscious companions who blame it. <br /> <br /> Although the idea that a children's doll is possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical, it was not until the fourth Child's Play series that the producers fully embraced the pure madness of the premise, opting for games much more for laughter than for fright (although there is still a lot of OTT splatter to entertain hunting dogs). <br /> <br /> The talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees the proceedings, cleverly translating the witty language - playful code into a slick and completely enjoyable cinematic run. In the same way, the excellent cast manages the field material perfectly, with Stabile and Heigl making a nice couple, but by smoking the hot Tilly who steals the show like a blonde, shapely, sullen, Tiffany, the temptress in mini-skirt in PVC. Kevin Yagher's expressive doll effects also contribute to making the film such a success. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is unlikely that this film will find many fans among "serious" horror fans, but those who love the weird mindless popcorn entertainment spot, full of twisted, black humor, scenes of Crazy deaths and magnificent necklines should have an explosion.
