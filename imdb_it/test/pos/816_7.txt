The working girl Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly), who neglects her working many hours in his garage to save money for their marriage. After getting up on her birthday, Kitty goes on a two-date / dark date, where she meets the heir to department store Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). He falls in love, but abandons him when his protests of love seem to cover the desire that she is his lover rather than his wife. The faithful Bill gathers around her to comfort her, and eventually surrenders to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement, pressed in part by Bill's support for his family after he lost his job. When Bob returns, however, convinced that he wants marriage after all, will Kitty follow his heart or his conscience? <br /> <br /> This film was much better than I expected. In the beginning, Bill's character presents himself as the type of a strong type of Irish comedian that Jack Carson has played so often. But Kelly (and the script) infuse the character with true compassion and love, and Bill turns out to be the best person in the whole group. The spectators may find themselves cheering him on against the merciless Hartwell! The tone of the film falters, however, between light romanticism and a much darker side, especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrible accident at Bill's garage. <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by the reliable Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother, a deadly but not wholly hateful Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters as Kitty's father grandfather-well-dirty.
