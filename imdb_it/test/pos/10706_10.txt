Sparkling documentary on how a small group of young idealists used music, art and dance to unify and heal the community of Vigario Geral, one of the most violent degraded neighborhoods in Rio ("favela" means neighborhood in Portuguese), offering its youth they are a positive alternative to the lethal world of drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> In their film debut, Zimbalist and Mochary have made a film that leaves you breathless because it works on so many different levels. As a social document, it provides the facts we need to know in order to have a context to understand the meaning of the particular story told here. The story itself is well developed, with a strong narrative arc, and, for greater measure, it is crossed by a profound suspense. There is a fascinating and charismatic central protagonist, Anderson Sa: he is an experienced natural leader, articulate, courageous, spiritually evolved, a talented performer, a visionary who makes his speech. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of music and dancing to entertain. Are there talking heads? mainly Sa and his closest partner, Jose Junior - but they are presented with imaginative cinematic. The montage mixes well films of different themes, punctuated only occasionally by some texts still full of facts. The rhythm is as lively as the music. Much is achieved in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Grupo Afro Reggae, the neighborhood's social club that Anderson, Junior and some others formed in 1993, distributes music and dance as weapons to go against drug lords and duplicate police. They teach percussion skills to any child who wants to enter a class, along with dance, martial arts, a community newspaper. The only requirement for children to belong is not smoking, not drinking, no drugs. There is a subtle and soft spiritual fabric that runs through the movement, freely inspired by the Hindu god Shiva, the destroyer of old habits. Jeff Zimbalist, who was also director of photography and editor, is a student of modern culture and media at Brown University. He burned his ribs for documentary editing for PBS and others, and taught cinema at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary, like Andrew Jarecki ("Capturing the Friedmans") did a few years ago, recently came to film from the business world. <br /> <br /> Zimbalist and Mochary won the prize for best new directors together in 2005 The TribBeCa Film Festival and "Favela Rising" were awarded as the best film of the year for the awards given by the International Association of Documentaries in 2005. I could go on for the pages of Afro Reggae, Sa and this film. A better way for you is to simply go and see it! My vote: A 10/10
