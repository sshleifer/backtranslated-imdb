I'm impressed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her superb skill as an action star! This film is driven by its wonderful acting and its extraordinary capacity for action. I'm a fan of science fiction, but I have to say that this film outperforms most of the sci-fi films in its cinematography and it's mostly the use of an actress whose presence surpasses the storyline that's fine but isn't new. Although it seems that this film was made for television, in my opinion it is better than many films of this type produced in the theater.
