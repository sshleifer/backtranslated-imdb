"Miss Cast Away" is a funny nonsense, which dispenses with a serious plot or character development to make as many gags as possible. Better enjoyable with a large audience open to such entertainment and, perhaps, drank a few drinks. Most of the jokes are based on current events, so in the coming years this film could become a time capsule of references to pop culture of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The conversion from 30i to 24p of the movie creates a jerky appearance in some parts, in particular the aerial opening shots. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Michael Jackson is indeed a strange event without a sequencer. But I, for example, find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson showed a useful interest in one of his protégés even after he (the director) moved on to the preteens' stage. <br /> <br /> the effects work is not as bad as a review suggests. Most were made by a single-member crew in a short space of time composed by animator William Sutton, whose name appears to have been omitted from IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill the gaps in this film. I hope it's finally been paid!
