I saw this film for the first time in 1994 or 1995 during my first year of high school when I was alive. After seeing it for the first time, I thought it was wonderful. Of course, it may not have lasted longer, but it is as accurate as I can think (regardless of what anyone else thinks). Cynthia Gibb was very good at portraying Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was as good as Richard. Louise Fletcher (Yes, who played Nurse Ratched in the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975) was fine, but I found her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's mother) a bit of control freak. I'm an EXTREMELY HUGE carpenters fan and I think Karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. It really saddens me that she left and left this land too soon, but thanks to the endless popularity of her music and her angelic voice, music will live. Anyway, back on the track in this movie, it's really a mystery to me and maybe to other people (fans and non Carpenters fans) about what caused Karen to end up with this problem. Was the media responsible or was it only Karen's decision? I didn't think it was his decision. It could have been the media of an article that was printed about her somewhere in the 70s, when their hit "Close to You" came out (from what was shown in the film). There are also other moments in the film. Richard's fight with drugs and Karen's brief marriage. I did not hear of his loss in February 1983, since I was not yet watching the news; I discovered it years later. I don't know if there will be another film on the Carpenters or Karen made in the future, but until then, this film will be fine. I'll say it anyway: if Karen ignored the false details of that article or any future article that could have been published with similar content calling it "chubby" (which must have been rather an insult), she would still be here on this earth today. I know she's in heaven and probably entertains everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen !!
