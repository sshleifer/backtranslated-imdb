I rented this movie with very low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This film is extremely good stuff. And one would never imagine that it was a low budget. <br /> <br /> EIGHTEEN, directed by "Richard Bell", revolves around an eighteen-year-old named Pip, played by the superb "Paul Anthony" who leaves his home due to the circumstances surrounding the way his brother major is dead. He is overwhelmed by the guilt for this event and falls into the hard life of a teenager on the run on drugs and alcohol. On his eighteenth birthday, his father tracks down Pip and gives him a tape left for him by his grandfather, whose birthday he was supposed to listen to. <br /> <br /> The way the whole movie is told is with two simultaneous stories taking place at the same time. Pip's current life and his grandfather's past life during the Second World War of which Pip listens to the recording. <br /> <br /> The three outstanding performances of this film are those of "Paul Anthony" as Pip and "Brenden Fletcher" plays Jason, the 18-year-old young WW11 soldier, his grandfather. In addition, the role of the wounded doctor of the WW11 "Macauley" starring "Mark Hildreth". All put in good performances. <br /> <br /> A couple of worries and scenes that did not perform well with me ... the priest, Father Chris played by "Alan Cumming" who is gay and in broad daylight you pick up the locals who know the whole neighborhood, and then we have the local store attendant named Jeff, a sweet played by the attractive 'David Beaszely' who just wants being loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted by the unprejudiced and obnoxious street trafficker, Clerk, who sleeps with almost anyone and in all likelihood is a toxic time bomb. Besides all this, he is not a very nice person. it didn't seem real. <br /> <br /> The parts I like the more flashbacks of the war are more important. They were so well acted and very touching. There is a scene at the end where the only soldier is dying and the other soldier, "Jason" is there for him to comfort himself and show him love while he is seriously injured and dying. This is such a wonderful and touching scene that it left me in tears. Well acted. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is a love, a redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive.
