Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It is indifferent ... that's where it's waiting for you to faint." Those words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best synthesis of the nature of the ocean I've ever heard muttering. His furies are unlimited, not least his, his loneliness. These words come from the hypnotizing and heartbreaking documentary of Deep Water. It's the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who participated in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the world. If you don't know his story, it might be better to stop reading now. Do not read this or any other information on Crowhurst or the race. Find the movie and watch it. <br /> <br /> After the first solitary circumnavigation of the ocean in 1967, adventurers and adventurer observers began looking for the next one-up. This time the journey should be made without landing or stopping along the way. Fallen in difficult times, Crowhurst saw the race as a great opportunity to get his family back on their feet. He had experienced financial hardships as a child and wanted to participate in such a life. So he started looking for sponsors, and soon he also did Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. The two men wrote the potential cash cow and gave Crowhurst a boat, on the condition that, had he been forced to retire, he would have been forced to pay the costs. His boat, however, was in serious need of repairs, and he feared he would not be ready in time for the final departure day. However, have you been informed by your sponsor that you simply have to go? after all, they put on the dough and waited for it many times. <br /> <br /> The details of the story are infamous: Crowhurst's boat started to get water, and its progress slowed down to the surface. Faced with the decision to try to bypass the Horn of Africa (certain death in such a boat) or to go back (financial devastation and indigence), he sought a third option. He chose to hide, alone on his yacht, waiting for other competitors to turn Cape Horn to South America. From there it would have rejoined the race. He reported false positions and recorded breaking speed. He then broke off all communication for fear that his position would be given away. He also had to painstakingly build fake diary books for every day of a journey he had not undertaken. In the end the loneliness, the guilt and the knowledge that probably he would have been caught weighed too much on Crowhurst. His latest log entries make a Kurtz's reflections completely healthy. Only a few weeks from home, he turned his boat away from home, and is said to have jumped overboard soon after. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's odyssey is fascinating and its end is heartbreaking, but it inevitably strikes. Our dreams are so often transformed into fears, and the consequences of our actions often leave us with so few options for a happy ending. It is the story of a descent into madness, teased by the infinite abyss of cruel seas. The directors do a great job telling this story. It is combined with the chilling audio and video recordings made by Crowhurst and the narratives of his increasingly maddening log notes. The story begins slowly and can distract some viewers, but the prizes of the story are entirely useful as it progresses. <br /> <br /> There are also questions about some of the other competitors, such as the French Bernard Moitessier, who was at par to win the speed race, only to pull out and start a second trip around the world. Also in the film is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the competition. He donated his cash prize to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> Reading the Crowhurst saga briefly simply does not do justice. It's interesting, of course, but a quick search ignores the emotions and quirks presented here. The last moments of Deep Water really have a broken heart, they listen to the thoughts of his widowed family and the adoration and understanding of his friends. This is a fascinating story, and it is the one that brings the documentary to such great channels.
