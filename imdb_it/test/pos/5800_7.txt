The Captain and Tennille have released a great package of 3 DVDs with minimal changes. Unlike most variety versions, these shows have not been torn to pieces. Music and dance numbers are included with the sketches just as they were when they were first broadcast. I suspect that some musical numbers on the DVD may have changed in shows where they were not originally displayed, but were unable to verify this suspicion. I noticed some inconsistencies between what is present on the DVD and the program information I found on the network. I have not been able to verify if the information on the network is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been modified in the shows on the DVD. Whatever the truth, I really appreciate the efforts made by the production company. I would like every published variety to publish the same respect for the format. I would say that about half of the shows are included. I believe they have encountered rights issues in shows that have not been included. We hope that these problems can be solved and that a Volume 2 can be released in the future. There are some individual music videos together with a dance performance among the extras. I recommend this DVD to any C & T fan.
