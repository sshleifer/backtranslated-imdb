This two-character drama is extremely well acted and has a valid message and some REALLY shocking moments (shocking not because they are graphic, but because you're not prepared for them when they come). But in the end it becomes oppressive, just as it did a sort of "A Pure Formality". Still, Alan Rickman was supposed to get an Oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt. (** 1/2)
