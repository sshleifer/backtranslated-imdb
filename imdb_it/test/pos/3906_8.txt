I remember seeing this movie when it came out as a t.v. film of the week in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Even though I haven't seen this movie in over 30 years, I remember how scary it was ... the corpse of the sister in the basement, the storm raging outside, the terrifying house with no electricity and a killer still in the premises . <br /> <br /> They simply don't make TV movies like this anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I liked not only "Betwitched", but also many of her post-enchanted roles, like this one and "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" from 1975. <br /> <br /> I really wish someone would come out with a DVD that has many of the 70's of the tv movie of the week on a DVD. Wouldn't it be great to watch "When Michael calls", "Bad Ronald", "Don't be afraid of the dark", "Crowhaven Farm", etc., All on one DVD? I know there is a market for a DVD like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 60s and 70s. Perhaps, if we are lucky, one day someone will offer us a DVD with a great selection of t.v. movies like this.
