This is one of the best sequels out there and even a good movie even though there were mistakes, but I still enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not only fighting one or two robbers, but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has many beautiful action scenes and I enjoyed every single second. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page to provide the music, with the producers that Golan and Globus are still doing there and Charles Bronson is still acting well for Paul Kersey. This film also made it seem like Michael was trying to finish the Death Wish series and I can't blame him and I love the gun that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the great films of 1985 and cannot be better than this. <br /> <br /> I give this 9/10
