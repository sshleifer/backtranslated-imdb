I'm not from the United States. I come from central Europe and I think the show is extraordinarily good. It can be easily compared with married with children. My title says it's not a show for the conservative public. I mean, I'm not so liberal, but there may be a slight difference between European conservatism and our cons. However, the show is starting to be very popular in our area and it is very bad that it only contains two seasons. The last episode opens many continuous and amusing moments. However, I and many people would be happy if this continued to play. The last thing that excites me about this is a very good moral education packed into humorous scenes. I mean, I've seen many comedies that have more than two and even more minutes of sad, very sad scenes that absolutely don't fit the comedy. The war does not contain something similar and is meant to laugh. It is like The Simpsons and married ones who also do not have sad or even not funny moments. I apologize for my bad knowledge of English, but I still hope you will understand what I mean.
