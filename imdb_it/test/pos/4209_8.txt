A nice movie. John Garfield's character is a distant relative of Jean Valjean of "Les Miserables" while detective Rains remembers Javert of Victor Hugo, the ruthless arm of the law. <br /> <br /> As in many film noir, the city symbolizes evil while the country and nature represent the sanctuary, redemption and a second chance for those whose lives seem destined to fail. But even in daylight, the danger can appear suddenly, as evidenced by the excellent tank scene. John Garfield - an actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, should be rediscovered: I have never been disappointed in any of his films except for his support in "gentleman's agreement" but it was not his fault - he offers a sensitive performance and sincere with him as soon as he is unjustly accused (the first sequence shows a rather rude hypocritical person, but all his proofs redeem him and how we feel for him during the last scenes with detective Rains.Colored colors (grandmother and children) add a lot of joie de vivre that is necessary Humor is also present in the game of striped poker while Dead End's brats flood a rich child. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
