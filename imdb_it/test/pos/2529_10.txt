Films about government failure and adult egoism. Extraordinary impossibility of facing life and the means to which children go to try to reach life. Only live. Staying alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to see it because we are seeing the truth and we are afraid to see it. Seeing a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our lives and we also complain about what we don't have when it's so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the film, are desensitized. They are more than desensitized by their surroundings. They see sex as an act, as if they were watching a television program. When the only guy is with the prostitute, Pixote is sitting on the bed watching with a blank look, without any feeling. He wants to be a kid and have a family, but the prostitute doesn't even have compassion and pushes him away. A "human" film, with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, scared, cruel world. It reminds us that life is not right, but you can still have a human connection.
