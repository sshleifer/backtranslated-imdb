This is not your story of the mill police in which the characters were only secondary to gun battles and car chases. The episodes, until now, are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something with a lot of Rambo-style cop history, you won't find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave a 9. I would like this series to last a long time. Morse is excellent!
