I came across this movie by accident. I mean, how else could I find out? It was not advertised at all by the studios, nor have I even heard of her leaving my normally connected friends. After throwing my money away in so many bad movies this year, I wish I had seen it in the cinema rather than on the DVD. Mike Judge is the master of the disguise of delightfully intelligent humor in a package of eyebrows. Just look at "King of the Hill" for a while ... it's a seemingly redneck humor, but it's a very subtle blow to rednecks while being very likable at the same time. I read the slogan for this film, and immediately ordered it on the internet. I don't really understand where these bad reviews come from, except maybe from Carl's Jr. This movie is not only hilarious, but it's also balanced. Moments of lightness are interspersed with hilarious gags and blows to our current superstar / corporate culture. Sure, there's a bit of humor, but it's just there to laugh derisively. The premise is only semi-plausible, but since when did it matter? I do not see people who despise "Futurama" because the premise is very similar. Watch this movie. If you don't laugh, then something is really wrong with you. Maybe your father works for Gatorade or something, and he was really offended by the movie. Maybe you're an idiot. Probably the latter.
