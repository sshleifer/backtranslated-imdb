Haines is excellent as the cheeky cadet who thinks that West Point will really be something now that he has arrived. Haines shows his easy and funny comic character as he takes West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And incredibly moving after the character of Haines goes too far and is almost avoided by his fellow cadets. The new Haines, full of humility, receives a minute of suspension to play the soccer game against the Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. MGM's fantastic, exciting entertainment in this Haines film, shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell also marks as the skinny follower. The handsome-but-goony character would be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in the following decades, another interpretation of the beautiful ladies played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is a winner!
