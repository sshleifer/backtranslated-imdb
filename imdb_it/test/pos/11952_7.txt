This is from much of the same creative team as "Better Off Dead", but it's not as good as that teen comedy. It's a lot of fun, but it's everywhere and not really that fun. Curtis Armstrong is used with less effect (he was incredibly funny in "Better off Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is hilarious, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (only with the best hair here.) Overall it's fun, and as a person from Cape Cod, very effectively captures the feeling of a Cape Cod 80s summer. For some reason, this movie seems more "mainstream" than "Better off Dead". There is not enough absurdity on the left field here if you are a fan of John Cusack and Savage Steve Holland is definitely recommended.
