This is probably one of my favorites so far, although I have the first one and I've seen Curse, Legacy and vs Demonic Toys. The only best of this is PM vs. DT. The curse is the worst of the series, compared to the first and therefore to its legacy. I recommend people to see this and against DT. Those who say this stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it's a sweet movie. This is a classic film, even the little ones can look and not have the same fear when they look at others. Well, this is my review, you can call me Gipdac, (it's easy to know where it comes from: the 101 Dalmatians series, you can see it on Toon Disney at 4:00 AM). Oh and don't laugh, I'm a boy, you'll see more of my reviews in good time. If you want to know why I look at it? I'm 12 years old! A tip: make a mental meal, arrrrroooooooooo! I also agree with you motter-1, but because people love others because they are more exciting than horror and because puppets are made to look scarier. Also, you can call me Gipdac.
