The further adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle resume almost without interruption from where we left The Egg and I. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new team of writers and directors is presented. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures by Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses, the attention from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma who beat Birdie Hicks for the first prize at the fair for his quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I. The quilt contest cash prize was to be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this film Tom returns home as a graduate. <br /> <br /> There are two intertwined weaves in this film. One is the comedy of the simple mountain family that moves into a modern avant-garde house. The other is a game of light morality about how the environment affects children as they grow up. <br /> <br /> Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free bag of tobacco to enter a contest and ended up winning a house. His disappointment for not finding the free tobacco bag rang to laugh a little. When Pa plays with dynamite he is totally unaware of the explosion. Kilbride never retreated into the scene as debris from the explosion fell around him. He played the part perfectly. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with Percy Kilbride's impassive delivery. Kilbride brought this comic device to a high level of perfection. <br /> <br /> But (Marjorie Main) and Pa move into the new house with modern comforts that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help them. But it adapts much faster than Pa. Included with modern comforts is a television, a very new object for the home in 1949. Mobile walls, hidden beds and plumbing are used as comic props, but the focus is on to Ma and Pa, never the props themselves. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a journalist who believes that hygiene and the environment are essential for children to achieve success as adults. Tom is a brilliant and self-taught man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This topic is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes, but left to subside. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise extravagant film. <br /> <br /> Seeing the Kettles moving from their old home to moving into a new home would be almost a disaster if it weren't for the characters who stay true to themselves. But it was practical, just as it had been in The Egg and me. Pa was the fish out of water that offered the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house, but the actual position of a comfortable bed would never have made him worry.
