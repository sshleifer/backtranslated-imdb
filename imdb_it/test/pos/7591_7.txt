Canthony is right in saying that this short film is just an excuse to listen to a very young Judy Garland (fourteen year old!) Who sings with a slightly larger Deanna Durbin (one year old). But I disagree with everything he said, including the execution time - which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (a single reeler). <br /> <br /> The song is not the best, of course; but it's fun and it's definitely worth seeing the ten minutes on Turner. The duet with Durbin is quite interesting: two contrasting styles that are intertwined quite well. <br /> <br /> The short is just a throwaway, but it's nowhere near as bad as the other reviewer did. Honestly, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Dafydd ab Hugh
