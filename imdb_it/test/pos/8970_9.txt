Here is a film that is almost all good, with good performances by everyone, and three excellent performances by Hanks, Seymour Hoffman, and a beautiful review by Julia Roberts that made me bewitched by the first seconds, these are the performances that brings skyrocketing and keep it there for the duration. <br /> <br /> Besides one or two minor problems with the script, the only thing that lets this film fall is the technical direction, there are too many bad cuts (fudged continuity) and a camera number "cheat" that simply doesn't work. This is surprising for a film of this stature, and is a little annoying to watch, but it does not destroy an otherwise well-made film.
