A very bizarre way of bringing William Shakespeare's tragic love story to the screen. <br /> <br /> The Que family and the Capulet family have long-term hatred with one another that often results in violence. Hatred has something to do with a movie company and the fact that everyone is pretty crazy. In the midst of all this madness there are Tromeo and Juliet, the most famous lovers of the "cross star" of literature who fall in love at first sight and problems arise when they realize the family to which the other belongs. <br /> <br /> The film follows the basic plot of the original game very well and the key scenes also use the original or close to the original lines. But the infamous Troma mistreatment pervades the film from beginning to end. This is a film that is not for everyone's taste, but is still rather inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly amusing death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many versions modified and classified differently. Each contains violence, profanity, drug use and sex, all with a great deal of oddity.
