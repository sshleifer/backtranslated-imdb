For many, the successful series was ten years of black humor full of affectionate parodies of classic films and an exhilarating assortment of over a hundred characters with instantly recognizable slogans. Few shows survived the transition from radio to TV to the theatrical performance in the cinema, but The League of Gentlemen reached him with adequate disagreement. <br /> <br /> Talented writers / artists had initially imagined a medieval adventure in the style of Monty Python, but as soon as writing began, they soon realized that the characters they lived with had become very real and deserved better . With that, the people of Royston Vasey realize that their very existence is threatened as the writers decide to ignore the fictitious city and instead work in a brawl of the seventeenth century. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Michael Sheen playing a very invisible league member Jeremy Dyson, The League plays rather unpredictable caricatures of their real-life personae as well as the familiar faces of Tubbs ("I did some fish brown "), a nightmare that induces the sexual predator Herr Lipp, the butcher Hilary Briss and an unlikely hero - irate businessman Geoff Tibbs. New faces appear when the third reality appears, this is where we are treated to fascinating and amusing cameos of veteran actors and popular TV stars. For many this will be really fun 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalpse will not please everyone. Working on this level of post-modernism has been done a few times before and it may seem all too familiar to the public who grew up on teenage successes infused with irony, initiated by characters like Wes Craven who have a new nightmare. It also takes a lot of trust in an audience to keep up with a high-concept story, so there are moments of exposure and dialogue that only serve to confirm what most people already know. Comedy as a genre is formidable, but it is now unheard of for an English film not to fall back on the huge back catalog of TV stars to fill a short amount of time on the screen. It's also hard to believe that the creators ever wanted to kill their offspring, which is perhaps why some of the role reversals haven't always hit the mark. Would Hilary Briss have wanted to try to save Royston Vasey in the series? <br /> <br /> However, while the show's deliciously dark vein has almost completely disappeared, it is probably more accessible. Much will be said about character development and efforts to humanize characters from the likes of previously beaten incarnations like Herr Lipp. It is here that an impossible level of depth can be found together with a harsh strip of biting satire and put down putanti. The feeling is there with a lump in the throat, but not covered in sugar enough to intrude on the action. The music is good, the performances are exemplary and the animation is wonderfully perfect; a nice return to work by Terry Gilliam and Ray Harryhausen. In short, there is much pleasure in the Apocalypse. Like so many TV movies for transfers, it would not have been easy to find the boundary between the preaching to the converted and the introduction of the uninitiated to the smooth and distinct voice of the League. But no matter what your preference, this last trip to the city that "You'll Never Never" is strangely full of hope and in the end very, very touching.
