This review contains some small but significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I just finished watching my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was FANTASTIC! This may seem trivial, but several times during the film I forgot that it was not true XD The acting is convincing, even if the acting of Masafumi Kobayashi (interpreting himself, I think ...) sometimes seems a bit strange. Marika Matsumoto (Takashi Shimizu's Yuka in Rinne) seems to have changed credibility levels throughout the film: sometimes it is REALLY good, then a moment later it is really vulgar (especially at the end of exorcism and subsequent re-possession. < br /> <br /> A character who was ridiculous at the beginning was Mr. Hori, a man covered with tin foil who believed that "ectoplasmic worms" came to eat everyone, providing unintentional comic relief in the beginning (behaving like the stereotypical victim of an alien abduction) but close In the end there are really gruesome scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot was very interesting and really made me think about how it all came together. they are not really explained (like a mass suicide in a park in Tokyo and where the reincarnate Kagutaba-boy comes from, but everything else went well and the ending has GOT being one of the most disturbing, if not the scariest, sequences , that I ever had the pleasure of witnessing. <br /> All in all, Noroi is a real fu A way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD offers exceptional images and sounds (in particular English subtitles - free Engrish!) for a great experience J-Horror. I highly recommend taking it.
