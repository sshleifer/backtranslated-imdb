The whole civilized world now knows that this is where Emil Sitka says his immortal "Keep your hands, you lovebirds". But Shemp Howard, a music professor, steals the show. Watch him watch over Dee Green while breaking the "Voices of Spring". He looks at Shemp as he shaves in front of a mirror hanging from the ceiling with a rope. Watch him being hit by Christine McIntyre. Watch it, and you'll laugh and learn. Even Moe is not tiring. Watch him try to get a woman to sit on a bear trap. Larry, as usual, is the Zen master of reaction. All in all, one of the best Stooge shorts. You will not find a weak moment.
