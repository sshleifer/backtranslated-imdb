"Western Union" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this is that it is not available on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost since it has now appeared on Region 2 in England. This - being somehow a blessing - is not only incongruous, but totally ironic when we consider that a film that describes the foundation and establishment of such a unique American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a version of the Region 1. It begs for beliefs! It just doesn't make sense! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox in 1941 "Western Union" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second time that the great German director committed himself to directing a western! He had done a great job the year before with "The Return Of Frank James" by Fox and he would have only had another western in 1952 with the beautiful "Rancho Notorious". Lang was not Ford or Hawks but with "Western Union" he turned into a nice solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in the first three years of Technicolor by Edward Cronjager boasted a good cast directed by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female protagonist is played by Virginia Gilmore who has very little to do in the photo. An actress who has never done anything about her career. His presence here is purely aesthetic. <br /> <br /> It is curious that Robert Young has top marks on Scott! It is clearly Scott's photo from the beginning when we see it for the first time in the extraordinary opening scene of the film, chased by a group of people across the plains. Young doesn't have much to do during the film and looks out of place in a western. It just seems stupid to go up against Barton McLane in a shootout! An actor who never really stood out - except perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a series of romantic comedies forgotten in the Forties and Fifties, culminating with his greatest success when he was "for seven years" Marcus Welby MD "in the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" tells about the cable connection of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by the Western Union boss, Dean Jagger, to protect the line from looting Sioux and also to face McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their devious ends. Robert Young is the young back east engineer who joins the company and confronts Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. A bit of comic relief is provided by - and irritatingly some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine presents himself in a meager role as a company doctor. <br /> <br /> Overall, although a good western, even if on Region 2, but in a sparkling good quality that fans will be happy about. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those boring images. Note: interestingly, the associate producer of "Western Union" was Harry Joe Brown, who later with Randolph Scott created a partnership that would produce some of Scott's best westerns in the fifties.
