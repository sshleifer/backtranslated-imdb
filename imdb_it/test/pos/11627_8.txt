I have to keep Barney punching my head every day; Well ... I guess there are reasons. First of all, I am convinced that our children are not stupid, they are just children, but they know (my 1 and a half year old son "selects" what to see) what is beautiful or disgusting. Have you seen the news? Do you think your children should KNOW reality as it is? Maybe or maybe not; we (the adults) have responsibility for what we want for our children and what to teach them. A movie of drug dealers? news on the massacres in the Middle East? Of course, children must know that there is a real life, but ... they are children; let's give them some pity. What do you want for them? If you want to have children trained in weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, impose on them Lethal Weapon, Kill Bill, the anime of any manga, tell them that Santa is a depraved person who enters directly through the chimney to violate them. I want illusions for my son (don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Barney and Friends is the best, in fact the show has a lot of flaws, I read other comments and I agree with most); perhaps happiness is made up of dreams or illusions. At least, I want to teach him to grow up WITHOUT FEAR BUT CAUTION, who learns to think and believe that not everything is serial killer or hijackers, which are reasons why it's worth growing. This, at least, can be a little happy with his own dreams. So, parents, don't underestimate your children; they know what they want.
