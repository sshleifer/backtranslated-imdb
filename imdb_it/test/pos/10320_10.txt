Almost certainly the best Three Stooges shortened to Shemp, 'Brideless Groom' is as good as all the best short films of the trio with Curly. Stooge's memorable moments abound. The opening with "Professor" Shemp who gives voice lessons to Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), a housewife, without talent and lasciviousness, wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting against her advances, is an excellent example of Shemp Howard at its best. Many considered him the most naturally funny of the Stooges. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him get fucked to find a wife (and demand $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he's cut off his head when his mirror flips backwards. Staring at the mirror, she cries with relief, "THERE ARE and she is as pretty as a picture!" "Yes," Moe replies quickly, trying to cover his pants, "with an APE!" <br /> <br /> The best scene (and maybe even the best of Shemp with the trio) comes when he calls an attractive young Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). Exchanging him for "long-lost Cousin Basil", she suffocates him with kisses and hugs (also leading to a funny idea between Moe and Larry in the room), not giving him the opportunity to explain his true identity. Suddenly the true cousin Basil calls and she goes mad, repeatedly beating him and accusing him of taking advantage of "a poor defenseless and defenseless woman!" The last line is delivered while she hits him in the jaw (with a real punch, according to Shemp and crew members), making him fall through the door and entering the lobby with a perfectly executed gag. "What happened, boy?" Moe asks. "Can I help him if I'm not Cousin Basil?" Hemp asks before fainting. <br /> <br /> Other classic pieces include Moe and Shemp that tangle in a phone booth, trying to find a lost coin, Larry is slapped because of Shemp's bad appearance (his face pressed against the phone glass), and the big girl fights in the peace justice apartment. The great Emil Sitka delivers his classic line (engraved on his headstone), "Keep your hands, you love birds" over and over again when his apartment is swept away. <br /> <br /> I prescribe "Brideless Groom" as a medicine for anyone who thinks that the Stooges' glory years are over when Curly is gone. True, Shep did not have ALL the great short films with Curly's group, but this was due to a growing lack of support from Columbia and its (and other) advanced ages. When Shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with, they were still at the top of their game.
