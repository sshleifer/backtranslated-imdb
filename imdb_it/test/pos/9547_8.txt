What could ever happen in a boring Texan city in the summer? Well, a group of teenagers find out that some things can and do happen. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing but el chupacabra, and the film, unlike the name would suggest, is not a remake or a double of American Werewolf movies, but something of completely different. <br /> <br /> Overall, for a low budget film of course, it's not bad! Some intelligent machine work, traditional appearances and fairly decent blood effects, and for once non-omniscient people who can and do make mistakes, such as shooting a colleague who thinks he is the big bad beast, and are baffled by things that could not know . <br /> <br /> Sit down to this aspect of a successful million dollar production, and after a while you will turn it off in disgust. Sit down to this aspect of some entertainment and a relatively simple story, and it's pretty good! Overall I get an 8/10 on my part to be creative, have OK acting, and pull off a good job for this film's budget.
