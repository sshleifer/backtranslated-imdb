This movie is fantastic. Best acting I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor, and obviously Hilmir Snær and Bjorn jörundur. Great music and sound. A cold hard reality about a struggle of a man who has many problems and people in his life. Black humor blends with the great acting and style of this European art film, it works, it joins the best Icelandic film ever made. I tell you "See this movie, you won't regret it." I gave him 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic film in your life ... See this
