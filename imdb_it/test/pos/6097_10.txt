This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's about true love and friendship. About turning your life around and doing something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen could play the same role he had in so many other films, but recently we saw him in other roles that he also did. But then, if he plays the same role he played in other films ?? it's perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen also does a great job. These two criminal "criminals" are the best friends ever. They share everything and do everything for each other, regardless of the costs. When they find out that Peter's daughter is being abused, they put everything on hold (things that can't be put on hold unless other criminal acts are to be performed) and take her to a better place. Do the best they can ?? these two men are not minds but they have their heart in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are also my Biggest Heroes ??
