As a book fan, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining faithful to the starting materials and showing an honest respect for literary work. The intrigues translate well into the film by virtue of Ron Howard's excellent eye for detail and devotion to the sound of authenticity. <br /> <br /> I like Hanks like Robert Langdon. His interpretation is genuine and earthly, with only the smallest Kip glow that we all knew and loved, again in "the day". He is a good dramatic actor and, while I miss his comic efforts, I like his more serious interpretations. <br /> <br /> The argument is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican never seems to learn their lesson. As with the aforementioned film, the Holy See issued a fierce rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film, which obviously generated millions of ticket sales. <br /> <br /> Although the story of "God Particle" was dramatically played, and the science was written by this science fiction piece, the fiction that remained, was fun and extremely well done And, the truth is known, people who have not read the book will not notice any missing or minor elements of the story, as the screen version brings the main story by itself. <br /> <br />, it is not necessary to have seen the first episode of this franchise, in order to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, even if this does not diminish the effectiveness, nor does it interfere with the continuity or flow of this second work. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's good for viewing on a Friday / Saturday night, although the execution might be a little tough for the little ones. <br /> <br /> Rates a 8.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
