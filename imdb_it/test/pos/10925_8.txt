I just saw this movie and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama of two brothers in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for those with a closed mind, to see this. I learned to love the short film genre after seeing a couple, because they have to impress you so quickly, and I must say that this is definitely their brand. He described some things, which I never really thought of like that, incest for one. I have to admit that I didn't care too much for the ending. Only once would I like to see a gay-themed movie without wanting to kill myself after the guards. They almost always seem to end in tragedy. But the way they were supposed to be together was "nice", even though he was in death. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight stars, and I also recommend it to everyone, because I think he gives an 'inside-look' in the world, that this movie lets you in. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening, have fun.
