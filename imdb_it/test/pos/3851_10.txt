OMG!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so incredible ...... I loved him as a child and still love him as an adult. It's my favorite Disney movie of the allllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it for a ton ..... It's so buonoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. My favorite part is the number of songs and dances with all the strays and Thomas O'Malley. The writers / producers / directors have completely nailed this ... yes, they nailed it to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
