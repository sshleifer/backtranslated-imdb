The "Beep Beep" by Chuck Jones (so called despite the Road Runner clearly says "Meep Meep") is the second in the exceptionally popular Road Runner series and is a huge improvement over its predecessor, the fast fast and historically important but lackluster furry-ous'. Although it has several predictable quickfire gags, "Beep Beep" also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious and longer sequences. The main of these is a fantastic, extended pursuit through an old mine where we see the Coyote and the Road Runner represented by two small lights. There is also a much more fun gag involving some rocket skates. "Beep Beep" also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does it look more beautiful than its scrignulous 'Fast and Furry-ous' prototype, but it also attracts the public in the cartoon more with a greater amount of glances at the camera to indicate the brilliance of its idea or its fear of imminent pain. Although it is a bit slow going (too many persistent blueprint shots hinder the pace in some of the first gags), once "Beep Beep" arrives at the mine sequence it is clear that Jones was starting to get real handling on these characters and the greatest possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better cartoons than Road Runner compared to "Beep Beep", but there is a real feeling of triumph on this cartoon, as if it were a confirmation that there was a series to milk out of this scenario.
