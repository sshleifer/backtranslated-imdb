A political satire of a comedian (Williams) that after dissuading political campaigns and presidents is forced to run. But surprisingly we win and make fun of the office. "Man of the Year" is not the funniest film or the best, but in small doses it works. Williams once again paired with Levinson after a hit with "Good Morning, Vietnam". The two seem to have great chemistry and work with each other. I'm not comparing them with Scorsese and DeNiro but you can get the image. Although I wouldn't say enough about running out there and seeing the movie in theaters, I would recommend renting it. This film is a comedy but also has a great satire, please if you like movies like "Scary Movie 4" this is not for you, take your brain with you to see it. - ***
