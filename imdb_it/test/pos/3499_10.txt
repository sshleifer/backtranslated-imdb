Being American, I have never been exposed to this character, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare to I did not find enjoyment in the idiotic humor unreasonable in American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar kind of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. They almost never laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has some fun parts for me, but this movie was fun from beginning to end. My only disappointment was when it was over. In fact, I'll buy it on DVD when I find it.
