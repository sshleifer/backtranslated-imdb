I've never seen a movie like that, or so funny. I laughed at my damn ass and watched it repeatedly. In fact I'm looking now. CKY's Chad is also hot. Anyway, if you never liked it, blow it up your ass, you don't taste it. The film involves Ry (Ryan Dunn) who has just broken up with his girlfriend who turns to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) for help in finding out exactly what he did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn), and with the help of Raab (Chris Raab / Raab Himself) they do just that. <br /> <br /> The fender scene and the Cactus scene at the Record Bin were hilarious.
