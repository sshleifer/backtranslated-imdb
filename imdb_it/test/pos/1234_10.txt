Heya Denver fans! Animation is a cartoon classic and also one of my favorites (and yes, it was also broadcast in Europe. Including my small central European country, Slovenia! = :) Oh, how I miss cartoons of the 80s !! Honestly, they were much better than today's children's shows. More imaginative, creative, full of fun with good costumes, more substance, great plot and excellent character voices. Today's computer animated shows don't have all these features. So, all of you, who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the kids of today's generation see the entertainment that these cartoons brought us, please register on the posted side and sign a petition for a replica 80s best cartoons! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com / 1 / we-want-an-80s-child-cartoon-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lejla
