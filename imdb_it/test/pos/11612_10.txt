When you've waited years to see a movie you've heard about the vine, are your expectations obviously high? f ** k yeah! But when this child came down from my door, I didn't know what visual effects would have enriched my TV and deformed my fragile mind. First of all Karim Hussein is a movie fan like all of us grown up with a diet of Silver / Fulci / lynch etc ..... and it shows in this film, but in a good way. Although I didn't really know what the hell was going on at my first watch of this gem, I was simply amazed by the images, the lighting and, of course, the performances of everyone involved. Karim must have really believed that he was going to push the boundaries in making movies (he trusts me that he does) and that he would have a hard job convincing the actors to do the same ........ <br /> <br /> So what can I tell you about "subconscious cruelty"? Well, without ruining it .... it is a profound intuition of the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness that penetrates into madness ..... a truly unforgettable experience ..... .. <br /> <br / > keep an eye on Karim Hussein, he can only go on to better things ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the complete integral print of subconscious cruelty on a double DVD disc from the Infliction movies that are loaded with extras ..... please note that there is a censored version of Hong Kong that avoids this version.
