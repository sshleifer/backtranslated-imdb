Although not quite as good as A Murder is announced, which was not only delicious but almost passed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know what, it's a huge improvement in Geraldine McEwan's version. Now I am not proud of having spoken ill of Geraldine McEwan's adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well but were ruined by either a poor script, a confusing final solution or both. Geraldine McEwan's version suffered from a tiring pace, and both of the above problems, and I would consider the second worst of the ITV adaptations, the worst is Sittaford Mystery, which also for its merits proved to be boring and confusing. This adaptation of the Nemesis book is a huge improvement, not only does it respect the book, despite some freedoms, but it solves the problems of the ITV version in practice. Although the added character of Lionel is rather irritating, more related to the way it was written than it was recited, and to one or two moments of slow rhythm, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed, with beautiful photographs and period details, and the music as always is excellent. The performances are wonderful this time, and make the most of a well-made script, with genial Joan Hickson like Miss Marple, and solid performed by Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is exceptional though in a chilling and moving performance like Clothilde. Overall, it's worth looking at, better than the recent version in almost all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
