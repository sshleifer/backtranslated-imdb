David Tennant and Sarah Parish's brilliant acting made me cry because many scenes were so familiar to me. My husband suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1977 and required an important operation that involved lifting the brain and filling the loss. Like Tricia, I was naive enough to expect that he would return to his former self. After more than 25 years of love and care for him, he abandoned me without warning to go live with a woman he barely knew. So he made a petition and I'm now going through a divorce. I hope the program helped people understand how to deal with a brain injury.
