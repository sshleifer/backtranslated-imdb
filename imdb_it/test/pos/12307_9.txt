I saw this movie at NFT in London, where it was shown as part of BFI's John Huston season. I wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little. In fact the rest of the film has continued to give away little! No real plot, no action, no suspense, very little drama and, except for a short section at the end, no scenario. <br /> <br /> The result of the lack of all these features was, however, a wonderful film. I don't really understand why, but I think its minimized nature has made the film almost perfect. The acting, the script and, above all, the casting were all aimed at and I don't remember walking away from such a beautiful cinema, but I still can't understand why. I only know that I will receive the DVD (this is one of those films that, I am sure, will be as good on the small screen as the cinematic experience, provided you can find a quiet place to watch it!) And I'll watch it again soon . I will also be interested in finding out what my family and friends think about it. I am sure that it will not be everyone's choice, but I am convinced that a large number will agree with my opinion. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
