I don't pretend to be a huge Asterix fan, having only seen another film adaptation and read only two of the comics, but this was a superb film, the same one. I only saw the English version and found the perfect voices for the characters: Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix in particular. The story itself was both interesting and really funny (especially the contradictory names end - all viking names end in "af", while all the Gallic names, of course, end in "ix"), with a little romance launched in that (I though) has improved the story, even though it has burdened the overall production with useless clichés. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: the Viking chief, Timandahaf, is tired of raiding villages and then finding them drained. Then, consult his "wise man", Cryptograf, whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs, and Cryptograf tells him that "fear lends the wings of the villagers". Taking this literally, Timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly, and sets off on an expedition to retrieve the "Champion of Fear", an expedition that naturally leads him to the Gallic village where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The two are currently very frustrated: the cowardly pacifist grandson of Chief Vitalstatistix, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them so that they can train him to become a man, and the boy is making little or no progress . When Justforkix inadvertently confesses to being "scared of everything" in the presence of the mysterious Viking Olaf, he is believed to be the "Champion of Fear" and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to go to the rescue of Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son home. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a great movie with few flaws in addition to clichés and sometimes faulty dialog boxes. I loved it, despite the fact that it wasn't true for the comic.
