Who would have thought that a non-disabled actor could behave as realistically and immensely powerful as a disabled person in a movie? Probably someone. But nobody, really nobody, could ever compare their expectations with the incredibly emotional and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film. Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy and, as he showed us from the beginning, he has enormous problems communicating. So it's really a lifeline when comrade Rory (James McAvoy), who can speak normally, understands it. Thus began a friendship based primarily on communication (ironically). <br /> <br /> In a hilarious scene, they manage to move from home to their home. After Rory was repulsed, Michael kindly presented a question to move to his home. Rory, who already had a bad name with the "judges", had to be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But problems soon arise. They begin impatiently to persecute a girl they met in a pub some time ago, wanting their assistant to do the little things that matter. At first it is reluctant; she doesn't know these men, but they seem to be harmless; so it strikes another friendship, but not necessarily a good one ... <br /> <br /> Besides being moving, however, this film really does rely on actors. But this is not a bad thing. For a non-disabled actor, see Rory, even if he can communicate properly, frustrated by the way he is completely dependent on other people and doesn't have a real life. But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. He behaves with such emotion, desire for adaptation and sadness / happiness, that he sees him really conquering the whole film. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Overall: 5 out of 5
