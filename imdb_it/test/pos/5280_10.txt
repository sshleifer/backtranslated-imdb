Obviously, Ponyo can be seen as not another amazing animation film that a studio could simply survive. It is far from it, and can easily be described as a captivating, beautiful cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki actually has another masterpiece. Now, for many, this has been considered the last of his successes in cinema, due to the fact that part of his "strangeness factor" is not present. This is true - the morals and insights that are not so obvious in his previous films are far ahead in this picture. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or understand. His idea, I believe, was to make a film for children that was suitable for both adults and their children, and that was not too complicated. He realized this perfectly, and besides he didn't lose any substance along the way, which is why he gets a 10. <br /> <br /> Besides that, the film itself is so exciting right from the start, and the way it is presented is so beautiful, it has left me speechless at times because I remembered how they were all hand-drawn by Miyazaki himself. I haven't been so enlightened and happy after seeing a movie since I saw Once (another movie not to be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even the music was pure perfection. The only negative thing I have to say about this was his English dubbing. Don't get me wrong, they were good too, but I had seen Ponyo about 2 weeks before it came out nationally, and I believed that, in some parts, I wanted to keep some of the Japanese dialogues (but not everyone, however, liked the "English way" ). All in all, everyone should see Ponyo; it's absolutely flawless and in another film production league. Finally, and don't hold back on this, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ponyo got a Best Film nomination, as there are now 10 films that can be nominated for this. It's so beautiful.
