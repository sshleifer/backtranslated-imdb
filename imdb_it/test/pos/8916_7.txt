If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this is not it. If you are looking for a comic masterpiece, it is not so. If you are looking for something hardcore, this is not it. <br /> <br /> Having said that if you are looking for an example of the fine art of European erotic comedy from the mid-70s this is it. <br /> <br /> I see many people complaining about the quality, please understand that it was done in 1974. Yes, women do not adapt to the modern ideal of attractiveness. They are not ugly women at all but they do not have the same looks that are idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, dubbing is not great but they speak German and anyone who speaks German will understand that it is rather difficult to dub a word with 12 syllables. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the DVD before the last one, the release is marketed with 2 covers from the 80s and 90s from adult stars. The film is an R movie so those who complain about the hardcore should have understood it, the film was modified from the original, but it was also edited before its run in the drive-ins at the end of the 70s. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time as a young man and, judging by some comments, there are many in the same boat who saw Cinemax. Many people get angry when later in life they are not up to their previous memories. It is understandable if we consider the rudeness and nakedness packaged in today's eroticism. <br /> <br /> If you compare 2069 with a modern soft-core erotic comedy, you may be disappointed. The film, however extravagant, is actually rather fluid and the lines, although generally innovative and double meanings, continue to hold and can still provoke a laugh. If you compare it to a hardcore movie, you will be further disappointed, compared to today you see very little. <br /> <br /> It is still one of the best examples together with Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella by European Erotic / Comic Cinema of the 70s.
