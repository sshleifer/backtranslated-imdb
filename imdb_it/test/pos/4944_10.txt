Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time. And SCIII is my favorite of the series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. Much bigger improvement than the choppy polygons in Soul Edge / Soul Blade. The characters have facial expressions, the hair is moved by the breeze and they also blink. Soul Calibur has always been known for its interesting plots and characters and SCIII is no exception. Each character has his or her background story that is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. It's pretty, it's fun and has a strong feminine character. Yes, I know she's dressed in pink and has a boyfriend (who ends up saving BTW), but there seems to be something more to her. Xianghua, like all other characters, has flaws and positive aspects of their personalities, so no character is perfect, not even good guys. <br /> <br /> The music is beautifully composed for a series of fighting games. It doesn't sound kitchy (the Vampire series), nor does it sound like the soundtrack of an old porn movie (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their themes and many of the themes are made to match the culture of that certain part of the world. I don't think there's a song in this soundtrack that I don't like. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this game is creating your own anime character (Create a Soul). If you want, you can make it cute or sexy or even ugly. However, if you've found a customization of the character you like, remember to take notes, otherwise you won't remember how you created that character. I found myself very dependent on CaS. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think Soul Calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time. It has everything I asked for. What more could I want?
