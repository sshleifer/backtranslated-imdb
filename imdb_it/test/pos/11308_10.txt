This parody is made intelligently: from the songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose Yourself, Like a Prayer is now Party in my Pants and Vogue is now Vague) to the false interviews of the show's cast, this film is hilarious. Remember that Madonna said she didn't know about the rainy season in Asia? In this, she does not know about the volcano season. It is a precious jewel. They have a lot of money for that parody, and they pay. Highly recommended!!!
