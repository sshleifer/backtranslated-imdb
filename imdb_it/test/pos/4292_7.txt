An old man is cycling along a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, hits him to death and continues to drive. The rest of the film is dedicated to discovering who hit him, why he was hit and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is really an English movie. I'm not saying that "surprise" car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, an industrious and respectable citizen with a "stiff-to-mouth" attitude towards the tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive and more prone to drama. <br /> <br /> The man who actually inspires life in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire William Bule, played by a deliciously diabolical Rupert Everett (most of the American public will eternally remember him as the gay friend of Julia Roberts who completely stole every scene in My Best Friend's Wedding). In Separate Lies, Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but it's an absolute explosion on the screen. "No, isn't the title of a movie so exciting (Separate Lies? How did they end up with that lame and forgettable title? Did they not just have a marketing team? Were they just trying to get people to see this movie?) beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.
