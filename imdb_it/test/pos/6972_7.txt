Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a Long Island housewife who escapes her marriage when she finds out she is pregnant. He plans to drive to the heart of America and start over again. Along the way he picks up a hitchhiker (James Caan) who calls himself "Killer". He soon discovers that the good-natured "Killer" is actually damaged by the brain and, taking him in his arms, has unknowingly taken on an enormous responsibility. The two reach Nebraska, where Sara finds Killer a helping hand on a roadside reptile farm. This is where Sara meets Gordon, a local policeman, and soon things go terribly wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated from the choices they make or the limits imposed on them by others. Even with such a low budget and a very free attitude, the film is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these well-defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex and divergent role and there are moments of an acting that inspires awe. One of my favorites is when she is on the phone calling her home from her worried husband the first time. It is a scene so tense at both ends, and in every small gesture and inflection of a word, so much is spoken of about it with so little. Then comes the "Killer" character played by James Caan. This character is unlike any other I've ever seen acting, and he performs wonderfully. It is one of his best performances as he is very sober and moving. <br /> <br /> The way Coppola develops characters using flash short films, like dreams, is very intelligent, adding a fragmented vision to all this. Rapid graphical and autonomous flashbacks contrast well with longer shots in some crucial scenes. Furthermore, as this film was shot throughout the eastern United States, it offers an interesting and authentic look to America in the late 1960s. I haven't seen many other films with the protagonist Knight, I'm just familiar with her most recent work on television, usually playing an annoying mother-in-law or an old black-haired lady. It was nice to see her so young, beautiful and so wonderfully thin in this movie. It's also a shame that James Caan has become a "tough guy" for the rest of his career, because this film has shown he is capable of much more.
