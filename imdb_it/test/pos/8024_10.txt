<br /> <br /> When I heard about it for the first time in 1997, for a coffee with friends, I decided to check it out. The only problem was that it was on a small screen in one of my local cinemas. <br /> <br /> This did not stop the pleasure of seeing a simply fantastic film, with a first-rate cast in Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie kept me in my place. <br /> <br /> I simply found no flaws in this great film, I give my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. I'm very proud to have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I don't distribute it lightly).
