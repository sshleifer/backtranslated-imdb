This film was overshadowed by "The Jackal" (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), which was released the same year. After seeing both films, I can honestly say this is the top movie. <br /> <br /> Granted, the production value of "The Jackal" was very good, it probably had a substantially larger budget. However, "The Assignment" is well written and has a fascinating history. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two ways. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay have done a great job in creating a deep and multi-level relationship between the title character and his family. I particularly liked the ending. <br /> <br /> I remembered the character of Jack Ryan in the Tom Clancy films. Both are Navy officers thrown into incredibly dangerous roles while working secretly on behalf of national security. Yet both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heroes who manage to be both virile and kind. They have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is how the opinions of everyone who posted this film (including me) can be much more positive than the warm reception the film received. This is a film that has enough complexity and subtlety that remains convincing after multiple views. If you are a fan of spy genre films, I recommend "The Assignment" with enthusiasm.
