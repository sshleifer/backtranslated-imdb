During World War II, there were a billion-dollar movie created by Hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to look similar. However, OVER 21 is unique in so many ways, as it shows a side of the war that you won't see in other movies, which makes it worth seeing, even if you've seen millions of other movies! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the male role, but the real star of the film is Irene Dunne - which seems incredible for a 47-year-old woman (yes, I checked - she was really so old she made the film) . In OVER 21, the couple plays with husband and wife. He enlisted in the army, much to the dismay of his father (Charles Coburn) and owner of the newspaper in which Knox is employed, and most of the film takes place when he is in the school of the candidate officers. The film shows little of Knox in the school, but instead focuses on Dunne while living in the nearby spartan houses for the bride and groom. During this time, she (as the British say) maintains a "stiff upper lip" and makes the best of it - even if she is not a housewife but a famous professional writer. From time to time she gets very short visits to her husband, but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the coburn mongrel at bay. In the end, he decides to stop the annoying Coburn from phoning incessantly (he ALWAYS complains that his newspaper won't survive without his son) pretending to be Knox - writing wonderful editorials that everyone thinks they wrote. <br /> <br /> Even if there is nothing shaking in this film, it is a very interesting life move. Furthermore, the acting is very good. Interestingly, this film is a fictional reworking of the experience of Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, Garson Kanin (also a famous screenwriter and director). When Kanin joined the army during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and acted in the drama that became this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, I noticed that some of the reviewers really enjoyed the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it. Although it was very beautiful, it was also very sad, since all these hopes for a better world after the war were short-lived.
