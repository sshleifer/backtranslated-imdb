This wonderful short will hit home with all those who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was fashionable or fashionable, just to receive something that would have marked you for life with your peers and was told by your mom or dad (or both) that doesn't matter, since you seriously started thinking about joining a witness protection program to avoid ridicule. For those inhabitants of the United States who don't have the horror of not following hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan who gets a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan with a Red Sox jersey. It's not nice For our European friends, think of two great football teams (soccer to us) rivals and imagine a fan of one who gets a shirt on the other. Ouch !!! NFB of C surpassed themselves here! <br /> <br /> Une hommage du Maurice "Rocket" Richard, merchandise, M. Richard.
