Yes, it seems, and for the most part it sounds like a "special after-school", for a slightly more adult audience, maybe a teenage audience is fine. But add Bill Murray (who has already shown a dramatic talent and the usual comic talent), a supporting cast and an unexpected sweetness in growing up, and in remembering those great, or not so great days at the summer camp, and you get a moving one, fun, sleeper hit. <br /> <br /> It gets a little too smokey for its own good, but this is also one of its talents. When you listen to the title "Meatballs" and see the poster, you expect adolescent sexual enjoyment, but what you get is a feeling, sometimes sexy, in those formative years of the summer camp. The sentimentality and remembrances of the simplest times remind me of "A Christmas Story", which I also love. The memories of the summer camp have never been so well declared. The only movie I've seen is approaching, it's "Indian Summer", which I like almost as much as "Meatballs", and even Matt Craven. We hope you complete the trilogy. Maybe he could come back for "Return of the Meatballs", and bring back some dignity to the franchise (Meatballs from 2 to 4 without any resemblance to the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" is easily on my I 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty). It's a wonderful little film, which always makes me smile.
