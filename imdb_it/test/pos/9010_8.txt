I love this show. It's very funny and cool. Kuzco is such a fun and interesting character, I love it. It's the thing that makes this show what it is, even though Kronk and Yzma are so funny and fascinating. All of this the show is fantastic for me, because it always manages to make me laugh, no matter if it's just an episode once. It's so fun and all the characters are so adorable and cool, it makes the show worth seeing, unlike some shit on the Disney channel. Check out this show the next time it's up, if you've seen the movie, and even if you haven't seen the movie, you'll find it very funny anyway, so go ahead.
