It is not an easy film to love at first with both unlikely protagonists, but fortunately the heart and soul of the film is the moving performance by Paula Sage that takes the film into unexplored waters and transcends the rather strange plot. This gives the film a feeling of true truth and makes you think you've seen something special. (7/10)
