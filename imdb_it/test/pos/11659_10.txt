I really enjoyed this movie. He challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a real piece of art in my book. The acting was unsurpassed. I would never watch this movie with anyone I couldn't cry with, I don't think I can cry anymore for any film, maybe because it makes me look alone, I don't know. It is a must see.
