John Cassavette has decided as his first film, obviously as a shot on a shoestring in New York, for not even having a script with dialogues, and offers a 1959 equivalent of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm - all actors know what to do and what to say and also have the right look in their eyes when they talk. In other words, it is one of the most realistic looks of the beat generation, softly jazzed up in the score and telling a story of racial tensions. A group of black brothers is the central point, with one who tries to do better concerts than the normal strip club, and has a sister, much more than fair-skinned, who intertwines with a white man in a relationship, which shatters both sides. However, the film is not exclusively about this; Cassavettes likes his characters to roam the city of New York (which not many films did in 1959/1960) and his narrative style is similar to that of the improvised jazz artists of the day. Dated, of course, but it's worth taking a look at cinema fans; Martin Scorsese called it one of his heaviest influences.
