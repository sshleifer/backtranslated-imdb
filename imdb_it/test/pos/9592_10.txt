To anyone interested, I managed to get this on DVD from Ebay (I haven't received it yet - overnight). <br /> <br /> I tried desperately to get this even if it is a quality VHS put on a DVD I don't mind. So anyone interested can contact me and maybe I can help you. <br /> <br /> To be honest it's ridiculous that I had to wait almost 7 years to see it again, but it will be worth a boy it. <br /> <br /> All my colleagues at work are eager to see it too. <br /> <br /> In any case I will publish later regarding quality. <br /> <br /> Just do a search on Ebay if you want guys. is there to buy
