This film is very silly and very funny. You can never criticize it for taking yourself seriously. If you have listened to their previous album or seen their HBO videos from the album, you can imagine the good time rocking, gaping, this movie that tells the tale of how the Tenacious D group was formed. /> <br /> Full of cameo, not only does it provide a fictional story by Tenacious D but it is also a feeling of musical history. Humor is reminiscent of Something About Mary, in the sense that they often "go to places where you thought you didn't want it", but lack the scatological mood of South Park. This film contains no nudity, except for the mooning.
