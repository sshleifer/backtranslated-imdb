Danging Errol Flynn brings his usual talent for drama in this historically imperfect but fun movie from the life of George Armstrong Custer. The brave, jovial Flynn raises Custer from his days at West Point as a reckless, stubborn cadet, through the Civil War years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the unparalleled Indian fighter whose dazzle at Little Big Horn is excused as a sacrifice by Custer of his command as a means to denounce the corruption of government officials and mail traders as well as a protest against the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, co-star of Flynn in many other films, marks the role of the devout and adoring Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn plays the role of the ferocious leader Sioux Crazy Horse. The film's battle scenes are excellent. The battles of the Civil War are brief and are shown as several cartoons in which Custer, apparently supported only by a handful of soldiers, pounds the Confederate army into submission. Custer's last battle against the Indians is a grandiose spectacle, a wild clash between red and white men, without a fourth given in a savage mix of military strength between certain fighters. The great director, the cinematography, the casting and the wonderful music of Max Steiner make this film a Hollywood classic.
