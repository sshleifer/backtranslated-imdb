This is an incredible dramatic and powerful piece that hits you. I discovered that the film was fantastic and became familiar with the two main characters of the disability, this was represented in a great performance by both Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based on a true story, I feel that the story was trying to give the public a message that, as a whole, the public should respect and prove for the needs of disabled people and that they should have the same chance as every other human. Overall, this film struck me in my soul and I too felt touched by the actors and the director who sent us creativity. The whole image is that some actors carry the game beyond their character and show only a part of the character that is credible for the public, but I believe that these two certainly have made great use of talent to represent a masterpiece of drama . Definitely not to be missed!
