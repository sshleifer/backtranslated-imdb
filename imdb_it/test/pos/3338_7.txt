George Sanders who plays the Saint for the penultimate time does a good job with a good script, with the usual good RKO. It's a non-Charteris story, full of murders and pure fun. <br /> <br /> Thread 1: In New York, police inspector Fernack, Templar's friend is stuck in a corruption scandal and fell from grace. London to try to make things right. Nice and simple so far - but are there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another story about a woman who takes revenge on the people who murdered her brother, Wendy Barrie, is right to bump into some bad men and make the Saint fall in love with her. Including a villain who was under their direct protection and in Fernack's basement - there is a gruesome blow from him (dead and staring) and they in a car when they are bringing him back where they took him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have assumed that he was a homosexual in this - the dressing gown testifies at the beginning, and the subsequent catchy comment by ST who was thinking of keeping him as a pet - and he did it for "Palm Springs" too! Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual, but this time with a deflated attitude so beaten that what he really needed was a good Templar slap to animate him. <br /> <br /> The Office of The Hays has also done in a way of image on the right, all the wires are tied without spongy bits. It's worth looking for all of us who love this kind of thing, but if Val Kilmer's version is your meter then don't worry.
