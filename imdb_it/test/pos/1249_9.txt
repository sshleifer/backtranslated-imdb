Imagine having the opportunity to see you again as a child. Now think about what would happen if you had the chance to talk to your younger self, or even change it. Do you want to try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in light of your future experience? Or maybe the meeting would change the perception of life and reality of your old self? <br /> <br /> Walt Disney's The Kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting Bruce Willis in "an older self" in a collision course with "the younger self" Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat ") fame"). The result is a sometimes fun, sometimes touching encounter that makes you think about your past, present and future ?? and I really think it's never too late to change course.
