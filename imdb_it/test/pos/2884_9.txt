In dramatizing Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, watch the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in the same period, but they were certainly very different men and writers. This story actually deals with a theme similar to "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" by Stevenson, but notes that Wilde chose to treat his story as a fantasy, while RLS took the scientific path. Both protagonists are men in which good wars with evil, with evil in the end. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC film also take a different path than the 1945 movie. John Gielgud says the same caustic and cynical lines as George Sanders, in his role that projected Wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. You will suspect that Sanders really believed what he was saying, but Gielgud might say what he expects from him rather than what he sincerely believes. Even Peter Firth shows the two sides of his character in a sober way, but then we don't see many of his adventures as Hurd Hatfield had the chance to show. <br /> <br /> It is very good production, with the dramatization reflecting the essential elements of the novel, if not all its ramifications.
