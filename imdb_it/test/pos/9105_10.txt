I was lucky enough to win free passes for the POD preview. Let me just tell you, from the previews I was excited to see it! The film absolutely shaken! What I really liked was that JB was in his element. With other films like "School of Rock", he makes namby pamby music for children and families, but this music is obviously all his own. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister to see him, and we laughed almost all the time. There are a couple of places where I wonder what the hell they were thinking, because some elements are a little bumpy, but for the most part it was great. A lot of times it doesn't look like a low budget movie, so that's an advantage. <br /> <br /> What surprised me most was Dave Grohl as Satan. It's fucking fun! You honestly wouldn't know to see the movie that is him. <br /> <br /> I say that if you are a fan of rock and you are in JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, go see the movie. Get ready for MANY references to drugs, MANY words in four letters and a few stones to destroy!
