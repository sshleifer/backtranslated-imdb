I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Wife and husband Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly play the role of Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through writing and the decision to publish "Origin of species". Their consideration of the ramifications that can have for their family and for the future of the human race is transmitted in such a way as to suspect that only a couple outside the field can get. Jon Amiel (who gave a heart felt introduction) and John Collee do a great job giving life to the biography of Randal Keynes. They have created very touching and human moments, a great cinematography and scenography and a generous help of irony on the still evolving theory of evolution. <br /> <br /> The surprise star is Martha West who plays Annie Darwin, the character around which most of the story develops. Play the early girl in a t-shirt. If this performance is something to do its star should be on the rise. <br /> <br /> All in all a great film, and although it is a period drama, the problems that drive it are still very much alive today.
