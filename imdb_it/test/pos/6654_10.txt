"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" That's how. There have been a few film versions of a famous novel that did more justice to their material source of Anthony Minghella's film on Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain. If you have read the book, you will be able to hear most of the soul of the main scenes recreated with trepidation. Personally I cried numerous times while reading the novel and I spent most of the evening watching the film through tears. <br /> <br /> Surprising goal, nice words, great acting and great music. In the DVD interview accompanying the film, Minghella talks about the multiple layers of history. Everyone works. One of the best films I've seen is an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.
