I imagine that if they weren't brothers this movie will become very common. how long have they managed to maintain this? if we were part, what should they do? so natural feelings, words so simple and sterile.But I almost cried last night blood relationship brotherhood love knot film.In another word, the older brother is very cute.if they are not brothers, they will not have so many prohibited factors, from family, society, friends, even their hearts right at the beginning. The older brother is doubtful whether it came out at the beginning or not. Maybe his little brother is so long with his brother and he can't even get any applause from his father, this made him very upset and even sad, maybe this is an explosive key that makes him feel that there was nobody in the world who loved him except his beloved brother. and I mean, this is a human-natural feeling, there is nothing to be ashamed of, you could fall in love with your mother, brother, sister. Only a fragile heart in search of a backbone to rely on
