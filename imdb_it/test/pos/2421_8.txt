Growing up as a child of movies, one of the trilogies that I will not soon forget is that of the Karate Kid. You can put Ralph / Daniel down whatever you want, but it's the message behind the movies that is important, that it's important to be respectful to all the big and small creatures, but defend yourself when the weather requires it. Returning to the film at hand, it's pretty funny because, I saw Boys Do not Cry and I was really impressed by Hillary Swank's performance, and flipping through the sea of ​​channels the other night, I came across showing this movie and not I realized at the time of my first viewing of this film that it was in it. The story centers on Julie, just like Daniel, not knowing where to adapt or even wanting to fit in and the main teacher gets involved to help her straighten and guide her. I really liked this addition to the series as it gave a feminine side to the story and yes, even some clothes that Hillary kept me, let's say stimulated. <br /> <br /> Total 3.5 out of 5
