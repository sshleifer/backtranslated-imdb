I hope the writer, director, editor and composer (and let's not forget the producer) read this ... because their work was truly incredible in this film. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this film. I'm just a normal guy who's been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and I've seen it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this film is moving. Every scene is classic. The acting is real. The film is honest. You can relate to these characters as people, not as actors. <br /> <br /> This story follows three distinct killers at different stages of their lives. The plot is carefully thought out and each sub-plot is intertwined and intertwined, culminating in a message that lets us reflect on the values ​​of right and wrong that each of us brings inside. <br /> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller (as a 12 year old boy) offer absolutely amazing and real performances. I've seen this movie about 8 or more times and I'm still so absorbed in their performances that I forget I'm watching a movie. It's so beautiful. Great job to everyone who has worked on this. Good job. <br /> <br /> The music is also perfectly matched and disturbing. With the cast chosen, the carefully planned retouching and rhythm, the mood and tone, and even the topic, the director made some of the best decisions for a film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film is real. He is honest. It is a true cinematic experience that I will never forget. You may not be interested in the topic, but it's something you can't ignore. Ultimately, these are people who are people ... and everyone can identify with this. I recommend this film to drama, suspense and horror fans over almost any other film.
