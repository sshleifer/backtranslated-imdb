Darr is a brilliant film ... It's one of my favorite movies ... SRK did an amazing job in the movie .... <br /> <br /> this role could not be played by anyone else because this kind of role only fits SRK ... <br /> <br /> SRK plays a mental villain in the film .. <br /> <br /> The performance of SRK in this film is the best performance ever in boll. .. <br /> <br /> SRK deserves an honor and an encouraging appeal for its fantastic performance ... <br /> <br /> Juhi also offers an excellent performance .. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol seemed strong and physically fit in the film ..
