I just saw the movie tonight and found it fantastic. It has no special effects that make you crazy, and it is not violent or bloody, neither terrorists nor aliens, but it is brilliant. It's simply cute, sweet and has taken me to a completely different time, a much simpler time, when people could take their time to walk down the street and look at the ocean. I think it was nice and I recommend it first. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the film. Everyone has a right to their opinion, but I think everyone should watch it, especially when they are feeling down, or when they want to share something nice with their friends.
