This is a movie that will leave you thinking, is he or not? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, they give space to the public to think of it and interpret it by the signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I think it's very solid. <br /> <br /> First, here is the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy train station. After trying to help a robber woman, he was arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell's hospital (Jeff Bridges). Prot speaks freely about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to report on Earth. Of course, it is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low-security department. He makes friends with other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them he can bring someone back with him. Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot's madness and as the plot progresses, it is increasingly difficult to prove that Prot is wrong. <br /> <br /> In the end, Dr. Powell discovers that Prot is Robert Porter, an intelligent man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico when his wife and daughter were killed. Prot says he plans to leave for K-Pax at a specific time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. Time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and never found again. <br /> <br /> On my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot's. In one of Prot's previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, learning about his father's constellations. Prot and Robert have become best friends. After the death of his family and Robert killing the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax right now, but rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes the thought of Robert, taking his body so to speak. Shortly thereafter, Prot (who still lives Robert's body) arrives in New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27th, he takes Bess with him, but he has to leave Robert's body behind him. So now we have Robert's catatonic. <br /> <br /> Explanations or clues: <br /> <br /> PROTEST THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND THE SCALE: as Prot says, every child knows his system. Only a few people on Earth had an idea of ​​the system and Prot added their knowledge. Robert Porter, although intelligent and knows his constellations, was not an astrophysicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: True. Prot could have left the institute at any time, but he didn't choose him either. Prot's last words for Dr. Powell are, "Now that you've found Robert, take care of him." Prot had probably stayed there to secure a place for Robert when he left. <br /> <br /> SUPER-HUMAN SKILLS: It was a proven fact that Prot had significantly greater sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provided his usual K-Pax reason, but no earthly reason was given. It has also been said that Prot was given an extremely high dose of medicines with no effect. <br /> <br /> HELPING PATIENTS: In the movie, see Prot helping other patients (or patients discussing Prot's suggestions) in a sane world. While the psychologist is opposed to the help of Prot, the dott. Powell speaks at the end of the film about the new lives that patients are leading. <br /> <br /> THE SCRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's house in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprayer with the death of his family? Are you trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have another point of view. It is assumed that Porter committed suicide in a river. In fact, Prot (under hypnosis) is very worried about Robert. I believe that Prot associates danger with water, not with the sprinkler. He's trying to protect the girl from the watery death, as Robert did. <br /> <br /> HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell believes that under hypnosis he can discover the true identity of Prot, but while Prot provides a lot of information, he never gives up his character Prot and claims K-Pax's homeland. <br /> <br /> THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera turn off for no apparent reason? <br /> <br /> MYSTERIOUS MISSINGS: first, Prot disappeared for a few days on its journey north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand staff better. Of course, the most significant death is Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does it disappear at the same time, but the only remaining clue is its winning essay. <br /> <br /> This is just my humble theory. You can finish whatever you want. You can take the theory of dr. Powell, that Prot was just a character taken by Robert Porter to defend himself mentally from reality, but that would have left too many holes in the plot.
