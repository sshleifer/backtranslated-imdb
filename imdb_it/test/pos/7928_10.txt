(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the 13th century. The opening blow shows the relics of the last invasion: moldy uniforms, human skulls and a horse skeleton. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) expelled the Swedish army and impressed the Mongol ruler so much that he proposed to promote him to the rank of captain. But Nevsky replies: "Die in your homeland but don't leave it". He plans to fish, build ships and trade. But he warns of a more dangerous enemy: closer, worse and without the possibility of buying himself: Germany. Their goal is Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and children. Marauding occupation forces distribute the loot. Rich merchants want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalists), but the "common people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander as their leader. Pskov is burned to the ground. The Teutonic knights feel invincible and have a smirk for Russian women who testify helplessly as their fathers and sons are slaughtered. Children are thrown into the fire while the church's high dignitaries watch and remain idle. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: rich and tired Gavrilo and tall and cheerful Vasili. She promises to marry the bravest. Vasili calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack but to strike immediately. Women also wear chain armor ... The invaders want to "get the Russian bear", but Nevsky's stratagem is proof: Lake Peipus is his war zone: his men know the territory but the Germans, who are heavier, will break through the ice ... <br /> <br /> Open your eyes and watch the most impressive battle scenes ever shot. It is not just the multitude of extras (who I was, I believe, pressed into this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein's masterly management of such a large number of individuals: it moves the divisions like pieces on a chessboard and almost every shot remembers the composition a painting by Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses in fantastic dresses). Russia in the winter seems intimidating in itself, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is conciliatory. Piles of corpses are bathed in cosmic light under an infinite horizon. At nightfall, Olga and other women search the survivors with torches. A devoted hawk sits on the corpse of his master while a crow waits for the right moment to catch the eyes of the deceased. Directed by Eisenstein and the soundtrack by Prokofiev make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "Rolls Royce" among propaganda films. The Nevsky is, of course, the alter ego of Stalin, and the Russians are tall, handsome, heroic and have a perfect hairstyle. The Germans are wild bearded and look like members of the Ku-Klux-Klan. The actor who plays Vasili gives a performance of a four-man character: first hesitant lover, then heroic, young and comedian. Cherkasov's main task is to appear heroic. In the end, Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: forgive the "little soldiers" and binge the knights for the soap. Only a bearded assassin and a traitor ecclesiastic are handed over to the crowd. He does not forget one last warning: he who comes with the sword will die because of the sword ... He kept his promise. 10/10
