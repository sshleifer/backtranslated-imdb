I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what made me sit in front of the television, tuned to HBO, and watch this engaging biographical film. What I remember was realizing that it was a (a bit) true story, of someone who actually lived. I remember the music, great songs I still love today (I can't believe that Gary Busey sang his songs so well - What a stud!) Then, the end has come. Is dead. He has gone mad. I could not believe. I had no warnings, no previous knowledge like most of these films. He taught me a hard lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules that most films teach us. I just watched the movie again tonight and was again engaged again ... and a little saddened. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I'll admit some prejudice.
