Boogie Nights was undoubtedly the best film of 1997. I could see this movie again and again and again and again I love it. I am in no hurry to look again at that overwhelmed / epic Titanic disaster. The fact that Boogie Nights has not even received a nomination for the best film only goes to show how predictable and petty the Academy is. Only The Sweet Hereafter by Atom Egoyan and the contact of Robert Zemeckis came close to being great like Boogie Nights. No other director in the last few years has come even remotely to make a film as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction - until now. Paul Thomas Anderson has risen to the challenge and succeeded. Just like Tarantino kicked John Travolta's career, P.T. Anderson gave Burt Reynolds the kick his career needs. Boogie Nights will also no doubt be the stars of Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. Overall, a wonderful movie. The best from Pulp Fiction. Perhaps even better
