What can I say?? This film has it all ... Romance, ruptures, rich children, punks and preparations. This is my favorite movie of all time that I can play line by line .... I remember when he came out, I was 14 and I couldn't go in ... so I finally got to see him on the cable ... I was hooked! I wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl .. (Hey, I even remember Moon Zappa's song, right?) I've been trying in vain for years to get the soundtrack ever produced ... now you can find it on the rhino records ... .
