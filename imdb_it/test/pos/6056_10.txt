Well, as you can see, I arrived at this party quite late, but I have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. I found this site by accident, when I was looking for more Marine Corps movies. So, I'd like to start by telling you that I played Marine Boot in the movie, Pvt. Labarsky, and was stationed at MCRDep, then in San Diego. Jack Webb and his crew selected 15 permanent employees, some of whom had speakers and 15 other marines who had just completed Boot Camp. This constituted the Platoon and the Marines who portrayed the various "DIs". For the best of my memory, The Capt. And Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) was not in the Marines. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA, taking up the section of the film with which we were involved, and then completed the other shots after our departure. <br /> <br /> walking here, let me clarify some of what has been questioned in the previous entries as best I can. "Cuff Daddy" was commenting on our Platoon's ability to shout "Yes Sir" without moving and etc., Yes, we did the scream for Sound Guys, and it was during the shooting of the scene. How do you remember your fellow Marines, when the DI or who has ever started to ask a question and before completing it, you have already taken your breath of air, allowing you to scream out the right answer. This is how it was done. <br /> <br /> "74 Sooner" commented that he was walking in the same building in Paris, however, as I said before, all the scenes were shot in Studio City, California. They were built with photos taken of the island of Paris and by on-site trips and maritime consultants of the island of Paris. Sorry, you were in real buildings, not in sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" brought many positive points, but, regarding the incident with the platoon on the Isle of Paris, at the time when all of that jack Webb said "The film was born because of of the incident, and the Marine Corps did not want to release anything that could impact the members of the family of the dead Marines that night, even though the Marine Corps would provide Marines and the necessary assistance for a film that responds to the public because a DI Marine does what he does ". <br /> <br /> As I said some of you, even at the time when we were filming the scenes I was surprised this dialogue was cleaned up a lot and obviously this is not how it goes in real life. In the 1950s, this was how it had to be done. <br /> <br /> A story I would like to convey concerns the interaction that occurred between us Marines and the Movie Crew and between the Movie Crew and Jack Webb. From the beginning, the Marines traditionally replied "Yes, Lord" to anyone who moved. Entering the second week it has become increasingly common to hear "Yes Sir" coming from all directions. On stage someone would have shouted a request for something to do with lighting and from nowhere on a catwalk above the set would emerge a reply from "Yes Sir". "All of this during one of our informal meetings," said Jack Webb. "If I knew I had a lot of respect from this crew, I would have brought you guys years ago." There was a Lt. raised from San Diego to play the DI's role of the other platoon and the one with whom he fought Jack Webb, but during a shootout he was about to take the number 32, and yet Webb tried to work it through like he wanted to do it and showed no lack of patience with him. The next day they used the consultant from the island of Paris who was a DI Sgt. From the island of Paris and it worked well. <br /> <br /> At the time I was a bit of a cameraman and I got to know the Still Camera Man to get a pointer from him and as it turned out he would give me more shots and part of the 35mm film of the shoot daily that would not be used. I cut and slipped those strips of film out of them. After the film was released on VHS tape (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.) My kids and grandchildren have a lot of fun trying to figure out who can be on the screen several times.
