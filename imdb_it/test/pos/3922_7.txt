Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and her friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel for another city to watch an important game. They decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey the next day. However, Wade's car fan belt breaks and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a nearby town, where there is a wax house. When they arrive at the scene, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two deranged former Siamese brothers have turned people into wax statues. <br /> <br /> I liked this "House of Wax", indeed it's worth the youth horror movie. The plot follows the standards of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other slash films, and is well made, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the scenes of death are incredible. Even if the film isn't good, it's worth watching the sexy and delightful Paris Hilton. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("The house of wax")
