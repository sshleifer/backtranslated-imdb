A good evil film with "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet" tastes and, perhaps, even "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> The evil Count Von Bruno receives an English gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt. Elga, the beautiful simple and well-intentioned woman who was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle. The counting of the missing eyes indicates a terrible past. English is not what the count thinks and for him it is a terrible thing. There is also the terrible hunchback, the crocodiles and even the side aspect of some instruments of torture. <br /> <br /> Boris Karlloff, here in a supporting role, makes a strong, but rather rigid presence. The other actors (and the direction) are the symbol of an era, the strong representations of black and white films. From the beginning there is no doubt about who the evil is, who is the good. Even traitors and stents can be identified in some way easily.
