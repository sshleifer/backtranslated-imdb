OK, yes it's ugly, yes it's its complete down, yes, it does dobbin the mule looks like an Oscar winner but look how I did it I was 13, the special effects were practically non existent in 90% of the movies, back in good Ole days when movies needed a plot. OK, so the storyline is a bit dubious too ... but wow I got into this movie as a kid in the 80s. mischievous rock, bad special effects, but airplanes and aerial combat had a vision of the soundtrack ... see also the worst things have a silver coating .. all in all if you want a bad movie to show a twelve year old who hates the effects of the computer (if there is such a film) this is the ideal choice
