I really enjoyed this movie. I really like movies where girls kick ass, so this movie already had my hopes for discreet entertainment. My hopes were fulfilled and it exceeded less than 20 minutes in the film. The action, humor and wit contained in this film made him easily one of my favorite movies of all time. He had Sam Jackson and his undeniable on-screen presence, Geena Davis, like I had never seen her before, asking for your respect and making her flat, even if you don't want to give it. <br /> <br /> Geena plays Samantha Caine, an amnesia who desperately tries to remember something from her past, but realizing quickly, the more she discovers that the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until Samantha is so more Charly is all that remains. But now, Charly and Sam, two completely different women, can exist in the same body? We have characters that come and go from the movie that feed every side of Sam / Charly, like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Even Craig is as irresistible as Timothy, the sexy villain without conscience. <br /> <br /> This film was perfectly cast and played perfectly, over the top and wonderfully funny. Watch the impossible and clap when it does. THEREFORE it is worth your time. Look at it, you won't regret it.
