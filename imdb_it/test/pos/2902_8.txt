I saw this film in 1954 with a double bill with "Valley of the Kings". These films have helped inspire a permanent interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, "The Egyptian" suffers from a flat dialogue and some awkward touches, but it is a glorious film to watch - the kind of thing that Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do - - and has a nice story ... not just the usual boy-meets-girl-story or revenge-is-mine story. It is a pity that the 20th does not republish the restored copies of this on the big screen.
