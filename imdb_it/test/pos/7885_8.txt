Contemporary New Yorkers to this film will remember how reflective his era is and how much the cast and crew captured America, the city of New York at the time. <br /> <br /> Norman Wexler's script outlines the different worlds in the various live in subgroups and the direction of Avildsen brings out phenomenal performances. Peter Boyle's prodigious talent is on display like never before or after. He is clearly the best character that the ever-likable Dennis Patrick has ever made. <br /> <br /> What I will always remember about JOE is the feeling of having been in a state of virtual shock coming out of the theater. Knowing that what the screen portrayed was boiling beneath the surface in the neighborhoods of the five boroughs of New York City. <br /> <br /> This film must be remembered.
