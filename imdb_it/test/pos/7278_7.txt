After reading the terrible reviews of this film, including the comments that are said to have been cited by Colin, I hardly bothered adding this film to my Firth Film collection, however being the Firth Fan I am, the intrigue has got the better of me! <br /> <br /> To my surprise I really enjoyed the film. He had suspense, drama and intrigue and scenes from V.sexy Colin. The plot made me guess right down to the end credits and I felt that once Jennifer Rubens' opening scene was over, the actress played her role convincingly. Colin was brilliant as always and it's nice to see him play a "dark side" character, a "shiver down my spine" and after looking at him I can't wait to see Colins's recent "Trauma" movie out on DVD. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe it wasn't a film that was "in the face" so to speak and you couldn't "fall asleep on the plot", especially towards the end because there was a lot, but it was what I was liked, the acting was subtle, fortunately not exaggerated (like many suspense thrillers), this made the film even more chilling to watch. One could not guess which character of Colins (Ross Talbert), or what Jennifer Rubens would do (Jamie Harris), and there were some surprises in store, I sat on the edge of my seat in everything, with a pillow on hand !! <br /> <br /> Personally I am very happy to have seen "Playmaker" and I will definitely rewind and watch again. I think any Firth Fan would benefit from watching this movie if they didn't like the plot, so look at Colin ;-))
