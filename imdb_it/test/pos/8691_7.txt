Why was Jessie Matthews, one of Britains best music stars, in this film between her glittering "The Good Companions" and the classic "Evergreen" is a good question? When I first saw it I was really disappointed. I wanted to see her sing and dance - she was announced as "Millie - the girl of the uninterrupted variety" but there was more stop than variety. <br /> <br /> Now I see it as a good little drama. <br /> <br /> It is a bus accident and the stories that lead to it of people on the bus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jessie Matthews, who is as big as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays his girlfriend (yes, that's right). Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood to star in the films of Lassie and also with Natalie Wood on "Miracle on 34th Street", plays a grumpy businessman. Gordon Harker is his very annoying partner. <br /> <br /> Emlyn Williams - who wrote "Night Must Fall" was the black mail villain and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and appeared in "David Copperfield" and "The Devil Doll" is the young man in trouble. Sonnie Hale, who was married to Jessie Matthews, was currently the bus director.
