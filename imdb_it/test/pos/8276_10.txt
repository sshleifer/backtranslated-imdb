I was - unlike most reviewers - not born in the 80s. I was born May 14, 1994. Despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80s. When other children had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES etc. Now, this film holds a special place in my heart even though I'm only 15 at the time of writing this review. I, because of my 80s style, watched many TV shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and also one of the biggest. <br /> <br /> begins in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the adoptive father of the Chipmunk, is in a rush to get to the airport while he is on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks helps him pack. While talking, Alvin expresses his willingness to come with Dave and see the world (although, technically, Dave will only go to Europe, so to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as "The World") . David is leaving the Chipmunks in Miss Miller's care, much to the boys' displeasure. Soon Dave went to the airport and the Chipmunks stayed home with Miss Miller. Later, in a local Caf√© the Chipmunks are playing "Around the World in 30 days" against the Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game in Brittany after seeing his hot-air balloon eaten by a crocodile, Alvin argues with Brittany about who would really win a race all over the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien listen to their arguments and, needing a safe way to transport their diamonds around the world, decide to trick children into delivering them to them. They prepare a race all over the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) in drop offs all over the world and receive a doll in the likeness of the opposing team (secretly filled with payment for diamonds) to "clarify that they were there". The winning team will then receive a reward of $ 100,000. They do it because they believe that Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been at his heels a few times) would never suspect them because they are just children (however, it seems to be redundant, because in their travels, children do it. I don't have to pass any check of security and I am never even in discussion about dolls, I suspect that even Klaus and Claudia didn't bring the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I don't see any reason why someone wouldn't like it. It features great animation and high-level dubbing, not to mention Kick-ass music (Pardon my french: P). My favorite song is without a doubt "The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll" An incredible rock song that can't be overcome. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other noteworthy songs include "Get Lucky" (kind of children's movie eh?) And "My Mother", plus "Wooly Bully" and "Off off to see the world". Not to mention the main theme of the film was heard during the opening titles of the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with "My mother" still makes me shed a tear. In relation to the song "Getting Lucky", I didn't initially think about it, but when I grew up and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of Chipettes' panties. This is particularly evident in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are chased by the men of the Arab Prince, when Eleanor leans on the side of the basket of the balloon and her skirt completely touches gravity. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it is one of those inexplicable things like why no one in the world seems to worry that there are 4 foot tall Chipmunks walking and talking with incredibly acute voices and treating them just like they would any child human. Anyway, a little after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go and look for the Chipmunks and go home. The direction of Janice Karman perfects this film while she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone else. They also make the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross makes the voices for Alvin and Simon (besides Dave) and Janice for the voices of All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters who are voiced by female vocal actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The Voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this film. She plays the part of the Arab prince, a very small but important role. The ending is obviously happy. The Crooks have been captured, the ends loose and the film ends when the children, Dave and Miss Miller drive into the sunset, Alvin complains that he didn't get his $ 100,000 reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he shouts '' ALVIN! '' And the screen fades to black <br /> <br /> Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this film useful, and if you haven't seen this movie, give it a watch, it's worth it. This nostalgic 1980s classic gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /> "'Headin' for the top, you don't know! we never stop believing now "
