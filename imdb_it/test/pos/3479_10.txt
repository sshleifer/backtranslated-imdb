This film was fantastic, it was extremely fun and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have made a great film that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson have made this film brilliant. Their acting was excellent, there was a real feeling between them that really made you believe that they were the characters they played. Romola Garai is incredibly beautiful and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically challenged people and their assistants is well placed, and you begin to really grow to know and experience the characters while the film goes on, it was above all shocking in the end. I would recommend this film to all those who love a film that is truly heartfelt, warning the most sensitive spectator to make sure they have the fabrics you will need. <br /> <br /> Still a fantastic movie !!
