My kids loved this movie. we looked at it every time we got it. A funny movie was fun. we looked at it as a family and we all had fun. it was a movie that you could watch without points of discomfort that you should explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they loved seeing it again. even after all these years they remember him. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very pretty girl. all my boys had a crush on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger and that's why we watched this movie to begin with. (as you can tell I am wandering a little to fill the lines LOL). but seriously it's a fun movie and worth watching. Disney, please give us a DVD or play!
