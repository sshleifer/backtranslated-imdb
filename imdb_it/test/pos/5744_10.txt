Well, here we are, you've probably read in previous reviews about this film that is horrible, misinterpreted, avoided at all costs. Well I suppose somehow this is true, it is fair to say that you cannot write a spoiler in this comment because there is no plot to ruin. However, there is a fine line between the simple horrible and utterly hilarious and believe me this film is the second. The acting is so bad, the plot so non-existent and the ending so completely baffling that it will make you laugh all the time. There are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level. Don't expect an Oscar, but believe me for the small price you pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
