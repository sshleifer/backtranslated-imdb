A wonderful Christmas story on the moving subject of "Susie Homemaker finds her inner Amazon". No, I'm serious! Geena Davis's amnesia begins to improve when she is hit in the head. From this familiar beginning, we move in an unexpected direction. Good pace, good action, funny story, lots of explosions and chaos.
