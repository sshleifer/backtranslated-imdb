I can't even imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. He literally cried with laughter several times ("Do I trust you slept well?" "Actually, we had a bit of a hard night." "Ah, the dangers of adultery."). <br /> <br /> it must be admitted that the finish is a bit flat, but it still has its moments (the obvious fake spasm of Booger Ball flew into the ocean, "beach house paradise"). <br /> personally, I think this is the funniest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
