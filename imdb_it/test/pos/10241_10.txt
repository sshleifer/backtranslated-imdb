This film was very well written and it was a lot of fun. There was also a great acting. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as it always does) If you are looking for an eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of the list. There is a mixture of comedy, drama and action. You can literally hear what the actors feel in the points. I was very impressed with this film. The special effects have been well done. The whole film was very convincing. This film is one of my favorites. What happens is that North America could be torn apart and Jack and his team must try to stop an eruption by destroying North America. It was a very interesting and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know you will too.
