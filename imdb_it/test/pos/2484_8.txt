I saw Peter Watkin's Culloden and The War Game a few months earlier and I was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, in this film that describes on the one hand a trial of dissidents in California in the (apparently) near future, and on the other the attempts of a group of "criminals" condemned to slog through 50 miles of desert to gain freedom in a "punishment park" run by the government as an alternative to prison. Watkins films everything in a documentary style, which causes more than a little bit of embarrassment or a strong suspension of disbelief: how is it that the TV crew is with the group of starving and parched prisoners for 2 days without offering help or sharing their misery? And this is simply the most obvious example. Apart from the questionable storytelling, this gives a punch; There is no doubt that you must be interested in political cinema in order to be truly involved, but the film is not really like nothing else of its era: it does not punch, it does not offer simple solutions. The political figures of the left are certainly painted broadly, sometimes, but they are not all the same; right-wing government officials seem a little more imaginative, but they too are allowed to show at least some humanity. Overall, the film gives a lot to think about and leaves an indelible taste ... 8/10 DVD rental
