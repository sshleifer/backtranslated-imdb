I saw this film thinking it would be absolutely horrible and was ready for the whole cornea, the bad special effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to mention it's the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I liked the whole alternative reality / dream state that played the film. The graphics were pretty good for a DVD movie and I liked the overall look of the film. I liked the main character Sai. I usually end up hating female protagonists, but there was something about her that kept me interested. Yes, she makes some bad decisions, but it was predictable. Yes, the other characters were stereotyped, but I also expected that. I don't know if I highly recommend this movie, but give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised. I'm putting this on my list of guilty pleasures.
