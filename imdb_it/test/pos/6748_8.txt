There must have been a sale on this plot in the 1940s. An epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York) and nobody takes it seriously. Some might say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did better in Panic in the Streets, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> There is always something about these Poverty Row productions that really touch. Production values ​​are never so brilliant and acting is a bit rough, but that's exactly why I think this film and those like him are effective. Rough, grainy, sharp. And the cast. All the second actors or actors of a list after their first. No ego here. These people were happy to get the job. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin and the melodious voice of Reed Hadley flowing in the background like crude oil. By the way, I went to the hospital a couple of times; how come my nurses never looked like Dorothy Malone? In this kind of film they don't care much about make-up and hair, but they managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into a hag. Or maybe they just skipped makeup and hair altogether. However, it was quite effective. She plays a smuggler in love who collects a case of Small Pox in Cuba while smuggling jewels for the ultra-villain Charles Korvin (who is playing the part of his sister in the meantime). You found the customs agents looking for her because of the jewels, and the health department was looking for her because she was going to weaken New York. No fourth amendment rights here. Everyone has problems. <br /> <br /> You must have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this. I have a brother who scans movies to death. If they do not meet Orson Wellian's standards, he bombs them mercilessly. They must have the directorial excellence of a film by David Lean, the soundtrack by Wolfgang von Korngold, the Sound and Art by Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons respectively. This is not it. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude, and if you do, you'll love this movie.
