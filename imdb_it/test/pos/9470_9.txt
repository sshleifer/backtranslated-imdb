She is Man was everything I wanted her to be and maybe even a little more. I love "chick flick" movies and I knew it would be great !! In the same vein of 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorites of all time) She's The Man is a unique comedy, well written, very well executed with some of the funniest lines and a physical comedy I've seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (except for the exquisite Pink Panther.) But She's The Man is actually a more intellectual game and most of the mood is based on the witty script, the story of Three's Company incorrect identities and mixed messages, and the cast. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Since the days of the terribly captivating (but strangely funny "The Amanda Show", he showed a brilliant talent for comedy, he is probably one of the most talented comedyne in circulation: his style of physical comedy, imitations and witty dialect makes his debut on the big screen (where she was the star) was the rather hilarious and well done "What A Girl Wants". If that wasn't her She's The Man breakout vehicle she takes care of those hands down. She's really the last girl next door. It is a pity she no longer does work on the big screen because it could be the next "It" girl. She is the All American, pretty, down to earth, bubbly teenager (even though she has now twenty years and whether or not he will be able to bring his talent and his style to become an adult actor will remain visible, but for the purpose of this film she is perfect !! In reality, he legitimately brings out the rather extravagant plot of she imp he is the twin brother and makes it credible. Not quite ... but credible enough. Most of the script is based on the comedy of his mistakes trying to be a boy, but they are just hilarious laughs non-stop. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in "Havoc" in 2005 for the title of Duke. He is the jockey, the captain of the football team, and ultimately the object of affection for Bynes, unfortunately he is also Sebastian's roommate (who is Bynes.) He is a good guide man, and the chemistry is perfect between their. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who seems attracted to Sebastian (who is Bynes again.) She is also good even though her part is small and in fact she doesn't do the rest of the cast in one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as true Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is surprising ... they are absolutely credible as twins and even more so, from a distance one could understand someone believing that Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast fits somewhere and their roles range from short to more supported, but in essence they are all supporting the story between Bynes and Tatum, but everyone is more or less supporting the extraordinary performance of Bynes. Easily carry the film without hesitation and it's worth it. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it is not one of those films that when that part comes is no longer fun. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more fun in the real movie. Relative new director Andy Fickman does an incredible job in this film. It weaves a potentially complicated texture and makes it flow naturally and drops everything. The story that is loosely based on Shakespeare's twelfth night, but it is remarkable how they managed to translate into this modern film. It is apparently completely out of the wall, but more accurate for classic comedy than you think. There is not much to say on a negative side except for the fact that the last half hour spends a little and also becomes a predictable force, but does not change the hilarity of the first half of the film. Nevertheless, you will laugh to tears and it is one of the most entertaining films of the theater, now at the hands !!! 9/10
