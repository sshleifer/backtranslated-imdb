Am I the only person who believes this American version is far better than the 1934 English movie? The English version has no suspense, has an antique look and a very low budget, and has a not exceptional acting (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, in addition to having the best production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect "innocent" American abroad, and gives Doris Day his best role ever. Of particular note is the music - the music of the American film is almost classical; compare the sequences of "Albert Hall" of both, and you will agree that the music of Bernard Herrmann is much more exciting than the original version (although it is basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy store. I would appreciate any topic that can prove to me that the English version is better.
