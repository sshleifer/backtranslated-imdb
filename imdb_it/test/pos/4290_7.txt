Separate LIES changed my life. In fact, the Q&A did. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch the trailers or if you've already seen it: <br /> <br /> The character of Emily Watson betrays the character of Tom Wilkonson. My first reaction to Emily with puppy eyes was "It's over. Download it, bad release." For some reason, it got stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And he tried to accept his needs. Sometimes he had to leave. But he got stuck with her and allowed her to live his life. But I still wanted to see it <br /> <br /> Later, Julian, the writer and director, talked about the film. I'm glad I did, because frankly I'm too much myself and I was too immature to get the point before he broke it for me. <br /> <br /> The character of Tom loved her, and no matter how his search for his needs may be at odds with what he wants, he would always love her. The relationship and the love they shared was not a lie, all of a sudden, just because he wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was. When you're over fifty, there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come back, so you can't be as contemptuous as you were when you were younger. You have to try to make things work, because the alternative could be much worse. <br /> <br /> He needed what he needed, and she couldn't help him. He had to learn to let her go if he wanted to be the complete man he could be. He helped her in pursuit of her lover, even when he hurt him. Another thing: Julian said that the strongest instrument of a controller is guilt. <br /> <br /> Again: The strongest instrument of a controller is guilt. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Tom released her from her burden. He felt the need to let her know he loved her, but not to be able to bring her back; he wanted to let her know that he didn't need to feel guilty or think badly about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way. <br /> <br /> It is not my way of reviewing a movie based on the message, rather than the execution, especially when I better understand that message when it is explained to me by the director, but here I make an exception, since I I feel more mature than I would like to see the film. <br /> <br /> The execution of the film was a nice English rhythm. Rupert was slimy and disgusting. Tom and Emily were their usual real characters.
