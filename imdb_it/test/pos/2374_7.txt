The last episode sees Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (looks more beautiful than ever in his reversible coat!) Toss against each other for a final battle, this time in the future. The plot owes a lot to Blade Runner, but done in Takashi Miike's low-budget, frenetic and comical style. I felt he was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the ending was still outrageous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. Compared to characters like Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q, DOA: Final is not even remotely extreme, but it is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy. That said, fans of the first two (and Miike fans) will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.
