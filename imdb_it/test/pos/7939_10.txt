I saw this movie with a live performance of the Buffalo Philharmonic, and the music was one of two things that surely made the experience for me; in particular, the song after the battle in which the woman is looking for her husband was devastating. The other thing that struck me is the battle on the ice itself, a bit of a strategy ripped out by the creators of King Arthur in 2004. Furthermore, the battle lasts forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can't think of another propaganda film that makes the war look less fascinating or rewarding. I am surprised that Stalin has enjoyed this film so well; I wouldn't want to go out and fight after seeing it.
