Even if the copies of this film are hard to find, if you can find it, take it !! !!! I think this was, apart from In the Navy, the only musical by Abbott and Costello. Although they have distorted the plot a little, (I've never heard a version in which the butcher accompanies it), you still like the antics of Jack, a bit idiotic but lovable, and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. Slightly reminiscent of DuBarry Was a Lady, this amazing film will make you roll on the floor - just to get up and dance while singing Lou Costello. (I don't know why they didn't do it in other films).
