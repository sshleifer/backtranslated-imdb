The last American entry into the series of Filipino horror films "Blood Island" concerns Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), ruler of an imaginary country. He dies of cancer, yet he has figured out how to bring him back: he puts his brain into a donor body. The mad doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) puts him in a highly unlikely body: the scarred scarred giant servant named Gor (John Bloom). A doctor friend of the sovereign tries to remedy the issues and puts an end to the plans of the crazy doctors. <br /> <br /> Film producers Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) run several actors I worked with premiere, including Taylor, Adamsons sexy wife, Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to go for the feel of the previous "Blood Island" voices, but it can be said that this was done in the United States. Although not necessarily a "good" movie, it has a lot of fun elements to add to a fun and trashy set. A malevolent dwarf (Rossitto), bloody operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job on Bloom, a subplot of political intrigue, caves full of cobwebs, etc. The plot is actually quite consistent, with twists and turns thrown here and there. I think it may have been cut a little; some scenes drag. But it has its funny moments and an ending that people don't expect. <br /> <br /> For this kind of thing, acting is not so bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are funny; the latter seems to have enjoyed his role. Steering wheel is quite attractive, and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. In any case, it's nice to see all these familiar faces in one of these movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing special, but like a scruffy "horror" B (I use the word freely, none of this is exactly scary), definitely fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
