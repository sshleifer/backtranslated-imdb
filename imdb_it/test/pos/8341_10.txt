Too many Christian films are centered around the fear of judgment, and as a result they appear condescending and indeliberately cheap. "Second Glance" is right. This is an almost perfect evangelical instrument; it is the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with Christianity. It assures viewers that they must abandon their sin - not their enjoyment - to succeed in the Christian lifestyle. "Second Glance" also works like a movie. The filmmakers were obviously working on a very low budget, but they managed to write a script that was dynamic enough to distract the viewers from this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere that show it, surely it has had an impact on more people than on me.
