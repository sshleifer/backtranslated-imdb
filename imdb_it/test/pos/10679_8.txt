This film less known to Roy Thinnes (From TV's Invaders) is actually what I consider a lost gem. It was made at a time when history was more important than special effects (although the effect is good enough for its time). A scientist theorizes that there is another world in Earth's orbit directly behind the sun. Since the sun always blocks us from us, we can never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes is selected to go on a mission to get to this world. I don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give away the rest of the film. Let's just say that there are real surprises. <br /> <br /> The film is English and has a good British taste of acting in TV series like The Avengers.
