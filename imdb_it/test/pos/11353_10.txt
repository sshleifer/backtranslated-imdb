I was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told. And since I'm a big fan of love, I bought tickets and sat in the theater. After 90 minutes I left the theater with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing in the film. I was shocked by the same story, that two people can love each other but be so scared that they never play them. I could not overcome the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I ran into it ... I was in a different mood, I had no more expectations ... and I had more patience, more relaxed mind to "see" the movie ... and as soon as I opened my eyes, I discovered love ... the beauty of the movie. I went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (for a moment I never felt like I was acting!) And cinematography. The first time I heard a definition of what a film is, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots) and this is the film that matches the description. Almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with music ... and light effects ... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is just something you need to have in your movie collection.
