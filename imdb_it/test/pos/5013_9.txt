According to many, Stu Ungar was not a very nice guy. He spat on the dealers, rejected the people he owed money to and was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers could choose to cover the man, turning him into a sports hero who will triumph despite adversity. But High Roller doesn't. And this is a tough fight for hoeing. <br /> <br /> Instead, we must look VERY close to see a man who has never matured past the frightened kid from the streets of New York, despite all his successes. And the only real approval he gets is from death in person. Very brave (because people don't understand it) and very touching (when you do it). <br /> <br /> What is also brave is the use of a Scorsese feeling. "Aha! As a derivative," people will say. Really? But there is practically no violence. And Stuey LOVED's gangster movies. Maybe the feeling reflects the man Stu and not the director Marty? And if it's really a low budget movie and it looks so good, good! <br /> <br /> Finally, the linear structure of the flashback. Wow, he'll be hammered. However, not only does it work, it works exceptionally well, even for those who do not see the connection with the "Seventh Seal". (TEST: In SS, Knight plays chess with death: in HR, Stuey says "We can play a hand of cards for, you know" ... Death says "He was never good at cards ...". ) <br /> <br /> No complicated effects or camera movement. No shaky camera. Nothing fancy. Only a solid and narrow narrative. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this makes the film too simple and somehow imperfect. But then again, so was the boy. And that makes everything perfect. <br /> <br /> 9/10
