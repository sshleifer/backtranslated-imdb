Chokher Bali ?? A game of passion. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Rabindranath Tagore with the same name, this is a classic story of deception, adultery and exploitation of relationships. Set in 1900 in Bengal, director Rituparno Ghosh transformed the acclaimed Nobel Laureates literature into a delightful visual show. <br /> <br /> The history of Tagore elaborates the Bengali society, through its central character, the rebellious widow, who wants to live a life of her own. We are in the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful and young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). Despite his magnificent appearance, two handsome men, the wealthy Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), denied marrying her. <br /> <br /> Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) on Binodini and the bride. Leaving country life behind, the free Binodini accompanies Mahindra's mother to Calcutta as a custodian. Soon, his friendship with Ashalata thrives. It seems that the two, addressing each other as "Chokher Bali" (sand in the eyes), share a lasting bond. The English-speaking Binodini captures a special place in the home. But soon he unmasks his real face. By manipulating the good-natured Ashlata, Binodini approaches Mahindra and satisfies his sexual desires. <br /> <br /> When she is expelled by Mahindra's angry mother, Binodini seeks consolation from a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters intersect and culminate in an unimaginable climax ?? Aishwarya walks through the role of a manipulative and rebellious woman, still gaining the sympathy of the spectator with the elegance of a dancer. The other leading artists ?? Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury ?? they are equally brilliant in staging their characters. <br /> <br /> While Tagore wrote this "puzzle" story at the end of the 20th century, the very idea of ​​widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper classes! In parallel narrating the movement for the freedom of nations, the author affirms the importance of individual freedom from life in a cage. Congratulations to the artistic director, who gave birth to the Bengal of the early 20th century, and applause to the filmmaker for capturing these sets with verve. <br /> <br /> This "passion game", by Tagore, has been fervently converted into the screen of the most capable director without losing its originality.
