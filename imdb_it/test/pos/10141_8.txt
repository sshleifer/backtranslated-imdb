Certainly this film has the ring of truth about it, as it claims to be based on real events in a marine base. This is the attempted cover-up by the commander of the local navy of unacceptable conduct by a major of the Marines, which led him to death by gunshot from his ex-girlfriend, captain of the Navy. The man and woman had been lovers, but the captain tried to break off the relationship when he discovered that his boyfriend was married. He continued to haunt her, pushing himself so far as to turn his side arm in his direction at the same time. He finally entered his house, attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with his service pistol and killed. The prosecutor condemned the murderous self-defense, but the marines decided to accuse the murder captain. The major, you see, was a decorated hero of Vietnam, and an old friend of the colonel in command at the base of the Marines. Even the captain had made some enemies in his command by the pool, rejecting some male advances in a very butch style. <br /> <br /> There is a considerable psychological burden that motivates and controls the actions of the main participants in this drama, which the very capable cast crosses well. The director and publisher, however, seem determined to obscure events as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and changing viewpoints. You're lucky if you know where you are most of the time. Bear with them, though; it is an interesting story in which the captain's martial test takes place, and it seems that every man's hand is against her, even her lawyer, sometimes. <br /> <br /> The verdict? Well, after all, this is quite a suspense story, so you'll have to see for yourself. There is a sort of "pacifist" message folded into the film, but forget about it. Of course, "war is hell", but sometimes it cannot be avoided. Then we will need those Marines, even if they are not always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": "Tommy is this and Tommy that, and Tommy waits outside, but it's the right place for Mr. Atkins, when the troops are in order".
