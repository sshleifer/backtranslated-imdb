"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies EVER !!! I think I saw this movie years ago on TV late at night with my mother when I was a kid and I thought it was so funny. This film has also been called "Black American Graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful as Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is as big as Preach's friend, Cochise. There are also other great characters, and this film has a lot of humor. From the beginning of the film in which Cochise goes to Preach's home to prepare for school for the sad ending of Cochise's funeral, this film will make you laugh all the way. There are many scenes in this film that I like a lot. The scene where Pooter (another of Preach's and Cochise's friends) goes to the zoo with them and gets the faeces of the gorilla thrown on his shirt (very vulgar, but also funny), the first scene in the street corner cafe the neighborhood party at the home of this girl who has become a disaster due to a fight, and some others are wonderful to watch. This film also has a wonderful album of companion soundtracks, which is full of wonderful Motown hits and artists from the early 1960s (only 6 songs from the soundtrack were made in '75, while the rest was from the 1960s). The film is mainly about two friends who dream of leaving their poor and rough neighborhood after high school, but their future seems almost unattainable, due to their innocent ride of joy in a stolen car for which two other bonnets were responsible, and Preach's relationship with his girlfriend, Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) is almost jeopardized. Exit, rent or buy this movie and get ready for a load of comedy entertainment !!! Get the soundtrack too. It's also a lot of fun !!!
