Unlike some of the previous commentators, I was (and am) an avid carpenter fan. Admit it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I think the film did a great job, not excellent, in painting Karen's life. The film was pleasant to watch on TV in prime time, but the content was a bit short. I suggest you look for all the special Carpenter products shown in the 1970s. You can't believe how awesome drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent. Besides, Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. My choice to play Karen is Hilary Swank. I'd like to see a more concrete story, because there was much more to Karen than to meet the eyes when she listens to We have Only Just Begun. I have tons of unreleased Carpenters music, and it's absolutely excellent. (His California Dreamin song is to die for).
