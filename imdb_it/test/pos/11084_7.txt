I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but in contrast to my German colleague whose review appears here, I think he was chosen as a neurotic and drug addict in this film. He perfected every nuance and reminded me of different knowledge that had similar tastes in "recreational chemistry". I saw this film once, 10-15 years ago and this is the only part of the film that has been indelibly imprinted on my mind. I don't say it very often, but in this case I'll do it: Bravo, Sean Penn! As for the plot, well, it's based on the fact, and as such, it's a tragedy that people sell the secrets of their country to the then enemy. Again, Penn showed what you can do if you don't agree with the administration. Use the freedoms you have, paid with blood; do not break the law
