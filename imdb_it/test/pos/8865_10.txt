I'm ashamed to say, but I have to admit that the first time I saw this film was only a year ago. After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collector's edition and watched it many times since. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic on many levels. It works like a real monster or action movie, like a horror / science fiction and also a very intriguing look into the human psyche. The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, provided not only by Carpenter (which is amazing) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general. Kurt Russell (obviously) is extraordinarily understated in the main role of MacReady and, as a direct result, "feels" like a real person rather than a Hollywood "all-American hero". The other cast members play all their roles in style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere and a truly fantastic film.
