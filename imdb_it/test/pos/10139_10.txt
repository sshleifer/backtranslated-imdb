Spoilers !!! To understand what happened before you have to be a warrior, stay alive in the real war, think off-line, analytically, critically and non-linearly. Otherwise you will come to false conclusions that Maj.Gray was a stupid or unstable person. The truth is something completely different. He was a tough and confident veteran and the only way he could be killed by Captain O'Malley is that he wanted her to kill him. It was his way out. He chose it. He was not a man who will retire. If you've never been on the front line you can't understand it. He intentionally prepared his own suicide. First he seduced Mary Jane, who intentionally acted as a mute, rather than an open discussion - closing the incident before witnesses (to protect her later after doing what she wanted her to do), which she gave to her son a bullet (to make sure he could load his gun later), he came that night, loaded his gun, woke her up, put the gun in his hand, acted while he was attacking her, after firing the first time he raised a knife and screamed "A kill" shot him again and before he died he removed the knife as if he was trying to bring it back after the first shot. He also gave her a message with her latest cry. "After the first kill everything will change in your mind and will destroy your life, this is the only way for me to die like a man, still being killed by someone I love is my choice and my only prerogative, the war and the army is not what you thought so far, grow at last and save your life as long as you can ". He left military life eventually. She understood it. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him prepare all this and after completing the process and the outcome of that trial was Colonel Sam Doran with the help of Lieutenant Tim Macy. Macy didn't know what's really going on and what the outcome will be, but he did what he expected to do. He took pictures of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray by order of Colonel Sam Doran who gave that order because Maj.Gray asked him to do it. After refusing to leave the army (what Col.Doran asked her to do) Colonel Doran persuaded the prosecutor to indict her with a premeditated murder (he knew he could not be found guilty) instead of manslaughter (c ' was any chance of being found guilty) with pictures taken Col.Doran also suppresses the incident that closes to prevent the prosecutor from having any doubts about the accusation of premeditated murder, but lets it be revealed during the trial what he strongly influenced the jury. I have no doubt about the outcome of that process. Why did Col. Doran do this? Because he will do whatever Maj.Gray asks him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why does Mary Jane choose to go to trial? Because he was a person who has integrity, a principle. And that's why Maj.Gray chooses it. It must be someone he deserves, someone honored. Keeping his secret about what really happened that night, he also shows his honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
