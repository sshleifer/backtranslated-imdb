Minor Spoilers will follow. <br /> <br /> This film is even stranger and unconventional than "songs of the second floor". There is no main character we follow around. There is no "plot" in the conventional way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is no crowd. In other words, Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. Instead of resorting to conventions and the fixed formula, Roy Andersson concentrates his film around an idea. I won't go into what is the idea, but even if you don't "understand" it, I promise you will see the greatest visual depth ever achieved. Here the majestic scenes of "songs" pale. A work of visual splendor. <br /> <br /> So be kind to your fellows, because after all "we are the living", and only you and I have the power to change our lives. This is at least what I thought when I saw the final scene of the film, with the inhuman bomber planes investing the city in the film to take away our lives. <br /> <br /> And of course don't forget to watch this movie when you get a limited release near you. This is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person, like de Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". A very warm and humanistic film.
