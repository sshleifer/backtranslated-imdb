Get ready for Trip to Haneke's "The Pianist" ... The main character's psychological illness, wonderfully played by Huppert, goes beyond any limit you might expect. The best part is that you begin to feel sorry for the character Erika. Trash-Sexuality (without nude scenes), perversion, masochism, incestuous relationships ... Haneke offers us a raw, heavy meal to digest; sometimes, the only way to escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it. The "mise en sc√®ne" is perhaps not the most attractive part of the film, it has obvious Austro-Germanic notes, sometimes Scandinavian: static, long, but never boring scenes. The settings of vienna, the French language used, make it similar to a European blend. The music of permanent German music (Schubert) is beautifully chosen. Above all, both the Cannes awards for the best actors are well deserved: one of the best performances of the year by one of the greatest French actresses ever.
