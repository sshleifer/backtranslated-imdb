Bring a box of Kleenex to this fun, addictive and moving thing. The two main protagonists give tour de force shows - there has been a considerable debate afterwards if they are really disabled (they are not). I appreciated the fact that for once filmmakers dared to be politically incorrect describing people with severe physical disabilities as fully developed people, character flaws and all. As a result, their credibility involves us and makes us grow to like each other and worry about their conflicts. The structure of the plot is formidable, and many of the secondary characters are just types, but the two central characters are so compelling that it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Interesting - the original title, INSIDE I'M DANCING, reflects the point of view of Michael's character, while the new title for the US version suggests that Rory is the central figure.
