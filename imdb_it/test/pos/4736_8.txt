The movie that someone had to do. Waco: The Rules of Engagement dissects the evidence behind the deadlock in Waco, Texas, which led to the destruction of the Branch Davidian farm and the alleged government cover-up. <br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know about this film: you'll see short but disturbing photos of the bodies of the victims. This is not done for the shock value, but to illustrate the points on the way they died, as if I were present at the coroner's investigation. <br /> <br /> The second thing you should know about this movie: at a quarter past two, it's pretty heavy - especially if you've been following the events up close at the time. If you are not aware of events other than those reported in the media, or if the only part of the story that you know is the official government report, this may be an essential vision. If, on the other hand, you want a more concise (though not ostentatious) version of events, you should see "Waco: The Big Lie". <br /> <br /> In summary, this is practically the definitive documentary on this tragic event, and it is very reassuring, but like a work of film-making, it could test your patience, especially if you have a low capacity of attention. And sometimes it's superfluous for those watching CSPAN auditions and 60-minute reports. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day someone will make a documentary that covers some of the strangest aspects of this story, like the bizarre chain of events that led to the ATF raid or psychological warfare tactics, the FBI used the sect's explosive rock music, and their charismatic leaders (all the rock musicians themselves) took their instruments and turned their huge amps outward to blow their music right back to them.
