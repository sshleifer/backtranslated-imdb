Better than I expected from a movie that sells on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial slavery. The music is exceptional and the cinematography focuses a lot on turning Ricci into Betty Paige trailer stuff and it works. Samuel L. has to shout a lot, he's good at it, besides playing a lot of blues guitar, which makes it sound cool. Even Justin Timberlake was decent like the mentally disturbed boy. I have the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s *% #, but instead it was only barley able to carve out his strange little niche of transgressive pasta, although still an effective drama.
