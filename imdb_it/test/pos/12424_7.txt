In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man surprisingly well done - though mindless - little horror. He casts a small comedy, a beautiful blood and intense fear. It's hard not to say that Monster Man is really fun. The low budget seems pretty obvious, but it didn't affect the overall presentation of the film and embarrassed the biggest budget horror movies. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is somehow as generic as possible. Couple of friends, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) are driving the cross country to interrupt the marriage of a woman that Adam has always loved. While Adam is a more nerdy guy, Harley is a self-proclaimed gentleman and a very offensive megaphone. Adding a bonus to the plot, they chose a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turn into a nightmare when a monster truck with a scary face drives them chasing them. When the dead body starts counting, it must take the race against the time that precedes its life at risk. <br /> <br /> The plot is obviously reminiscent of many famous horror films, but Michael Davis as a writer and director manages to maintain the tension. The scare is built quite well, where the characterization is never the best, but quite okay. The screenplay is also full of comedies that work for funny moments and are rather funny rather than annoying and also await the turning point in the final. It's fun and shocking at the same time, which is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> As a conclusion, Monster Man is surprisingly fun. It deserves more attention on the big screen. Prove that the big budget is not an effective horror film, but the skill! Something that the director has shown and delivered.
