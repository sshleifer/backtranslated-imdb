Mike Nichols in the best shape. I wasn't a fan of "Closer", so it's nice to see him back on top of this comedy set in the darkest circumstances. Only a shift of tone could have ruined this compelling image, but Nichols and his strong A-list cast have never been wrong in this biographical film of a deeply flawed but absolutely convincing member of Congress. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman as The usual is sparkling and brilliant - here he plays a damaged but ultra-intelligent CIA manipulator, and is in the exchanges between Hanks and Hoffman's characters, where the comedy flies. Rarely out loud and even intelligent cinematic humor ... This colors the point from time to time with a pungent satirical side that makes you laugh and cry at the state of the world (often simultaneously). <br /> <br /> Another important advantage is the length of the image. The film is based on the fat book by George Crile with the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is "The West Wing") must have been to make a fattening film, but what we get is a ninety-five-minute story with subtle discoveries. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen and recognized to find an extraordinary balance between the darkest of obscure subjects and the lightness of the touch of its glittering script - even if this thwarts the obvious link between help that Herring and Wilson provide and the final consequences (9/11).
