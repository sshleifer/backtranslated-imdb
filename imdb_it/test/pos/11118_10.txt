This film tells the story of nine ambitious teenagers who try to follow their dream at the infamous New York High School for Performing Arts: Coco, the singer, Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, the struggling dancers, Ralph, the comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. While everyone thinks they have what it takes to truly achieve their goals, they will need much more than their talent. They will have to face rejection, heartbreak, education, pain and love to reach their fame. <br /> <br /> "Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspirational films of all time. It has everything a teen drama / musical should have: extremely engaging, entertaining songs, Oscar winners interpreted by the extraordinary Irene Cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in characters, and a great story, including the harrowing scene when Coco meets the video camera. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is fantastic. Irene Cara can really act, and it's not just her way of singing that makes her shine here like Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is as big as the castigation of Doris, and looks closely, and you'll see Paul McCrane of "ER" as Montgomery. <br /> <br /> This is really a fantastic movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to continue to follow my dreams as an actor and singer. Every film that moves me so much is a winner in my book. Not to be missed! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
