<br /> <br /> "We exchange murders - your wife, my father" - an apparently innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet during lunch on the train. Guy, a solid and respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, won't divorce him so he can marry his daughter Anne, a senator, and laughs for the whole conversation like a joke. The following week he is no longer laughing. In a classic Hitchcock suspense scene, Bruno chases Miriam through a carnival and strangles her. As he does so, his glasses fall off and we see the murder reflected strangely twice through the lenses. Bruno with a cold and amoral heart, completing his part of the agreement, approaches a frightened boy who expects, even pushing him to "do his part". Things are not helped when Anne's precocious and outspoken younger sister comes forward suspecting the murder of Guy of Miriam. So accused of a murder he did not commit and expected to commit another, what will Guy do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings who have a murderous side of their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection.
