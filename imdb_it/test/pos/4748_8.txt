Recently I received THE SEVEN-UPS on video and I have to say that it was a very funny movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great cops and swindlers respectively and a young Richard Lynch is as big as Moon's henchman. The late Bill Hickman is quite as good as his partner Bo and organizes a brilliant sequence of car chases that will have you sitting at your seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are rather insipid, but it is predictable. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that many people on this site supported this film. I think it should be a movie that should be published on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly loved every minute. The final scene between the two protagonists is excellent as the villain has to face the consequences of his actions. THE SEVEN-UPS does not disappoint.
