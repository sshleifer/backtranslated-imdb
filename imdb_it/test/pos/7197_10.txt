I've read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I'm also a fan of "Les Nuls" and "Les Robins des Bois" and Jamel so I was expecting a lot from this movie .... and finally we are satisfied Unlike the first adaptation by Asterix on the big screen (Astérix et Obélix contre César) which was not a real success besides the appearance of Laetitia Casta, this really captures the spirit of the comic (and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film the director tried to be too realistic about the time when the plot is set and killed the whole spirit that made Asterix hilarious. In this all the clothes, the way of talking and everything is identical to the work of Goscinny and Uderzo ... more, it is really faithful to the original story with the negative side that we know practically everything that will happen, but Alain Chabat gave us some surprises at the end. I really enjoyed that movie, and every time the first sign of boring appears, Jamel arrives and makes us laugh like crazy. This film is a great mix of all the kind of humor that I really like, and although maybe it's mixing it too much, I can't help but appreciate it. So if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents started in "Nulle part Ailleurs" (a French mix of the show tonight and SNL) go see this movie.
