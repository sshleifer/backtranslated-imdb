I heard about this film from a friend for the first time. He loved him and always looked at him. When he told me about it and said how old he was, I decided immediately that I wouldn't like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was a fantastic movie! I love music and dancing. I bought the soundtrack and the DVD immediately after seeing it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brilliant. They have captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. They were both good dancers. After watching the film, I wished I could dance like them and I hope that soon I will start dancing and dancing Latin. I became a fan of that kind of dance and now I'm passionate about all the movies and programs on this one. Dirty Dancing has revealed my passion for dance and music. My favorite parts of the film are when Baby enters the Staff building and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I think everyone should watch Dirty Dancing at least once in their life. If they don't, it's their loss !!
