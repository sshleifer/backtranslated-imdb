as I said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time, and one of my personal favorites. for me this film is the second best teenage movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. the last American virgin is perhaps also the most honest teen film of all time. is underrated and practically an unknown film for many people. arrives on TBS maybe once a year, but sometimes longer. the first half of this film is a sexual comedy with a few honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest and most often serious. with only a few comic scenes. I think this is the best soundtrack of all time. I've never heard this great song in a movie before. There are 4 love songs in this film that I think are among the best love songs in history. the film is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin. hes in high school who has a couple of best friends. his two friends are sexed teenagers. the first half of the film is practically sexual mishaps. they are very funny Gary is a great lover of the new girl at school. later he finds out that his best friend is dating her. he also cheats on the side. you can feel the love that Gary has for this very girl. you can hear it even more in the second half. Gary's friend turns out to be a dog. but his other friend is very nice. the film shows how bad people can be. you can relate to a lot about this movie. the plot looks like your typical comedy for teens. but it is much more than that. it's a very honest film. it's also very 80ish that I love. if you love the 80s or you grew up in the 80s, rent this movie. but there may be some people who don't like the 80s, but could still like this movie. I first saw this film in 1987, I think. it's a lot of fun and a lot of fun. combines very moving moments with very funny moments. it's an underrated gem! I have the movie. I love it! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 of ****
