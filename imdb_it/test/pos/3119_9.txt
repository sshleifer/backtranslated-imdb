Most of us children who grew up in the 40s or 50s were Western enthusiasts, but that was what I missed until I saw it on Movies for Men Channel today. I loved the film's history, the cinematography and the excellent cast of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. in the leading roles along with the always reliable Ward Bond. Apparently this film was the inspiration for the next television series "Wagon Train" which once again characterized Bond as the leader of the wagon trains heading west. Johnson steals the film with his riding skills and it's nice to see an actor do his stunts like Ben does in this movie. Other notables include the beautiful Joanne Dru in the role of Denver and one of the first roles not of James Arness, who later became famous for the role of Marshal Matt Dillon in 'Gunsmoke'. If you like movies like this you can't miss this.
