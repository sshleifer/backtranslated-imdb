This is a baffling, short absurd. A miller dressed in white heads towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. Even if the image is reduced, here is an obvious logic. However, he is stopped by the sweep, all in black because of his work. They begin to beat each other without a particular reason: has the furious miller insulted the chimney sweep? This class war? <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it hits its opponent with bags of wheat flying throughout the fight, making everything it did before the fight redundant, making the windmill redundant, so that everything becomes useless like the clash. The miller's grain fades the darkness of the sweep - later on Westerners would not be so thin, the heroes and villains that are color coded. Is there a racial hue here? <br /> <br /> If this were not wonderful enough, the fighters are driven out of the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately Kafkaesque end to a strange story (or are they just the social conscience rising against struggle that denies order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of silent cinema at the beginning. This mix of comedy, surrealism and Absurd is an obvious precursor to BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, "Foreign Correspondant" by Hitchcock.
