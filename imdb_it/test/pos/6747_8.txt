From 1950 a clean thriller arrives on a couple of diamonds smuggled from abroad and also on the contagious smallpox of the disease. Evelyn Keyes brings out all the stops as the essential victim of this film noir. Once back in the United States, he doesn't realize that he could spread the disease to everyone and everything he comes into contact with. Eventually it is prosecuted and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Apart from the success of Keyes, there is good support from the evil Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The finale is a humorist with Miss Keyes on a window sill with floodlights and hundreds of spectators below. A nice coup of B!
