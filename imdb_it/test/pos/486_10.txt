I have just seen it for the second time today and I have to say with all my heart that this is the damn time they made a film about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was perhaps good will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. Often in films the first nations are seen as people other than ordinary people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medical people. Hey, we're like everyone else. And this film showed just that. We hurt ourselves when injustice is done and we can win in search of justice. It's really a pity that the big movie companies can't see it. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. Thanks to those who have chosen to show this story as it was.
