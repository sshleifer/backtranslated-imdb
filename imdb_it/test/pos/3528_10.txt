This was a great 1981 film that had a good story about three men and two girls going camping together and crossing thick forests and high mountains with a large waterfall. This group of people runs into property of George Kennedy, (Roy McLean) who plays the role of Forest Ranger and rides a white horse. Roy McLean warns these young people that where they are going it's not a camping area and they should go back. Naturally these young people do not pay attention and proceed to have a ball that swims naked near the waterfall and that plays music and dances in front of the fire and drinking beer and wine. There is an old wooden school in a room that attracts girls and boys inside and that's when the movie starts to get very scary. There is an occasion when a girl has to climb a tree to get away from a human beast that wants her body and starts cutting the tree to capture it. Don't miss this movie, there's a lot of everything.
