If the vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth Vampire Chronicle by Anne Rice should prove a satisfying experience. A real consortium of undead in a contemporary setting, "Queen of the Damned", directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who live there for eternity. <br /> <br /> The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored by a world that no longer excites him, has been "asleep" for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world that he feels from his long sleep are transformed and, at his pleasure, ventures to investigate. What he finds is a world full of new sounds, a new kind of music - guidance and penetration - sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows that his time has finally come, that it's time for him and those like him to come out and face the world on their terms. Towards that end he becomes the front man for a band - a singer and a performer unlike any other world he has ever known. He looks like a vampire and very quickly accumulates a sequel that extends far beyond London (where it all begins), and eventually takes him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to hold a concert that promises to be above any other person has ever seen or lived. <br /> <br /> Lestat is powerful, no doubt, but there are those of his kind who are not satisfied with the fact that he revealed them, one of which is Marius (Vincent Perez), a powerful vampire in its own right, the vampire, in fact, who "created" Lestat so many years before - and they are gathering, coming together and making plans to meet Lestat at the concert. And they're not going for music. But there is also something else: at one point Lestat inadvertently awakened the "Mother" of all of them, the most powerful of all vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make his presence known to all, and especially to the one who chose to rule at her side like her king: Lestat. And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will be present, without fail. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this is the story of Lestat, and Rymer presents it in an atmosphere rich in atmosphere and with delicious moments, even if his film has less to bite than to say "Interview With the Vampire "or" Bram Stoker's Dracula ". It has a good rhythm, and there are some scenes that give real thrills, but on the whole the film is not as endangered as it could be, or as might be expected. In the final count, in fact, the quantity of meat that is incinerated wins over the royal blood, even if there is more than a taste of blood, and more than a good part of the lips and mouths that drip with the red stuff. There is also some good F / X, especially in sequences that accentuate the speed of vampires, as they move and move in the air faster than the naked eye can see. It's a decent job by Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it if he played the alienation suggested by Lestat; as it is, there is a feeling of its detachment, but not enough to involve you completely. <br /> <br /> In "Interview with the Vampire", Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that perfectly captures Lestat. He plays it with a sense of acceptance, and on closer inspection you may even find a hint of remorse and desire. It's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly. <br /> <br /> Like Marius, Vincent Perez also does a good job-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film, his character is a bit ambiguous; which, however, has more to do with the way it was written than with Perez's performance, which is quite good. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy interpretations are Marguerite Moreau, like Jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the stunning Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's Aunt, who ultimately plays a key role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha. <br /> <br /> And like Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely compelling presence. What else can be said about her except that she is a talented artist, with exceptional talent and beauty. And tragically, he left us too soon. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy). With a story much stronger than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans, in particular, will be happy with "Queen of the Damned", a well-made film made by director Rymer and his engaging cast. By focusing on the drama of the story - and the way it is presented - rather than just focusing on providing some cheap thrills, Rymer has managed to make a real horror movie that is definitely a cut above, and one that could tease appetite for more or less the same thing. And this is the magic of movies. I consider this 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
