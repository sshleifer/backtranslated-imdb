In the ever-growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best and most faithful (in general) to the original material .... since the character has almost 30 years of history in the comic strip from his debut as a figure of support in the Tomb of Marvel's Dracula, the writer has taken almost ALL the characters and elements of the plot of the comic story. While the changes have inevitably been made, the finer points of the steamroll film are on every criticism. Don't let any of you friends tell you otherwise: Blade is a good movie. If it seems too "comical" to you Stanley Kubrick snob, it's because it's expected. Face it, but don't cancel for it.
