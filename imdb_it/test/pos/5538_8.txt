I just wanted to write a quick answer to all those people who give this movie a bad review because they think it's not funny or boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick --- the movie doesn't just want to be a comedy. It has some depth. Like many of Demme's films, these are people who live in some of the bizarre corners of our society who are trying to figure out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film and home video industries do not adapt well to subtlety and release this in the "COMEDY" binder. It's fun, but a lot of humor is off-beat. However, the heart of the film is not about humor, but people in it. <br /> <br /> It may not be one of the biggest movies in the world, but it's solid and fun. <br /> <br /> And the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art in itself. Michelle Pfieffer is fantastic and this could be the film that has proven to have action chops to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a great fun and can chew the landscape the way only she can, in a role that requires it. Throw in Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and also Chris Isaak and you have a fantastic cast in which here, as usual, makes a big difference. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun, but more important, he's a great hottie in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. <br /> <br /> Sit down, wait for the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a good time.
