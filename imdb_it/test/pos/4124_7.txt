First off, I'm a big Buddy Holly fan. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about that fateful plane ride that turned off three incredibly bright flames just like that. But I had never really listened to his music. I had heard a lot about it, yes, but not until I sat down with the intention of getting something out of it, I really came to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is different now because of him. <br /> <br /> Thanks to this adoration for such an incredible man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without ever having seen it before. I am torn by my opinions on this film. Maybe it's because Buddy is so alive to me that I couldn't bear to see Gary Busey in this role. I admit he played well, but his singing seemed so forced. It seemed to me that he knew it didn't look like Buddy himself, so he used too much energy to try a similar sound. In some parts of the film, he succeeded. But others .. ouch. <br /> <br /> The film has gone through a period of several years, but I believe that portraying this time frame could have been managed much better. I had difficulty in distinguishing in which moment in Buddy's life certain events happened. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I think the worst was the representation of the Crickets. I understand how you can't use their real names and for simplification there were only two in the movie .. and maybe this was a good thing. Because the background voices of the film were worthy, and I didn't like the way they were interpreted as an obstacle to Buddy's career. Something else that didn't really make a difference in the movie, but it bothered me were Gary Busey's teeth. They have worn me out! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don't know why I noticed it ... but I did it. <br /> <br /> I will finish this review on what I felt to be the best part of the film: Buddy's last show. His last call to Maria, Big Bopper's performance, which brought him and Richie Valens on stage, followed by the end of the frame. I was surprised too, and I feel that it effectively shows the public how Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic at a moment, and that his flame was extinguished in the blink of an eye. It was a nice way to portray this horrible tragedy. <br /> <br /> Good movie, despite the obvious problems .. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious flaws, they could use some work ... but not bad
