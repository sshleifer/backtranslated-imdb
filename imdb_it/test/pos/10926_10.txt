I have seen many short films in my time. I often find them too compressed (throwing too much information to the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run), too "artistically" or without a clear vision. I can't say anything about these things on Starcrossed. In this review, I will do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers, but I also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is fraternal incest. <br /> <br /> As in any short film, the story is simple enough, direct and easy to digest. It is clear that the film seeks to illuminate one of the most deeply rooted taboos of modern society. This film is successful in every respect. In the fifteen minutes of execution, I found myself experiencing a range of emotions. With only a brief dialogue, the viewer is quickly dragged into the most personal moments and thoughts of these crossed brothers. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene set in their early childhood, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. When the film progresses to the present day in the next scene, the excellent acting and the honest and heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and hard way. As the relationship progresses, any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional anguish as the viewer suddenly realizes that there may be only one possible solution. And the consequences of this resolution are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this movie and absorb the message. If nothing else, he boldly and sincerely challenges the viewer to review some of our deepest beliefs about shame and secret incest taboo. Although the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates in the viewer long after the credits are launched. This is perhaps my favorite short film I've ever seen. I can't recommend it well enough.
