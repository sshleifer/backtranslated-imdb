Another masterpiece that needs a DVD version, but some libraries have VHS and it's worth looking for. Only a brilliant game on many things, above all euthanasia, "respectability", religion and fundamental human relations. The script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with a problem as a severely disabled child, but to tie parents in their love for "Jo" and each other. While the couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman are perfectly up to the standard of both virtuosity and the staging of their deep and intelligent characters. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Bates' brilliant performance in "Butley" which was released as a movie a couple of years after "Joe Egg" and plays a teacher in both, cynical, intellectual and funny, too if Butley is much darker than his Bry character here. If you perform in big shows on "The Go-Between", "Women in Love", "Whistle Down the Wind", "The Caretaker" and "Georgy Girl", not to mention the more obvious "King of Hearts" and "Zorba the Greek", and I would say that Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and the other great British actors of his era. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Medak also had one of my all-time favorites "The Ruling Class" released the same year (1972) as "Joe Egg", which includes a career year in anyone's book . He had a kind of fake filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two gems will distinguish him as a great director.
