Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because sometimes there would have been a flashback scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was small, he went blind and his mother didn't pick him up. She was a strong woman who didn't treat him differently because he was blind. It made him do things on his own and this led him to become a great musician later in life. His mother also sent him to school. Then, when Ray Charles became a man, he could defend himself and take care of himself, but there was a ruin in narcotics, sex and betrayal. When I'm discouraged about something, I can only think of this film and it will inspire me.
