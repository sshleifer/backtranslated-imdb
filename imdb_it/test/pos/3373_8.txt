Forget Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good part of the reviews I read on The Box equate to the simple but weak argument that does not hold up to the comparison with Darko. It's not that I disagree with that, I simply feel that this film is a completely different animal and deserves its analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are marginal concerns if we consider that the key to the heart of each film is different. In Darko, the driving force of narrative is existential. In The Box, the driving force behind the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say I understand the inclination to compare the films of an innovative filmmaker by looking for trends and models, but for me it is more important to face each new film first as an autonomous entity, and then widen my gaze later. <br /> <br /> The Box is one of those films with which you have mixed feelings because it seems to be in a sort of identity crisis. He is not always sure what he wants to be. The turns are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively credible couple of spouses who are in financial difficulty. A box containing a "pulsating unit" arrives at the door of the house and is informed by a horribly burned man who if pressed the button will cause the death of a person they do not know, and will receive a million dollars. One of the things The Box manages to do is to evoke this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. Before the button is pressed, it has a disturbing and seductive quality, but alluring left. Once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that cause the two protagonists to question their own morality and deeply regret their fatal decision. <br /> <br /> The idea that the Box is an experiment is interesting because for me it gives the film a paradox. If there are external beings who develop a "coefficient of altruism" based on data collected by couples who push and do not push the button, then while the conspiracy disintegrates, we note that in the end it is a forced altruism: be altruistic or the species will be swept Street. I suppose couples do not know the consequences of their actions when they have to make a decision, but they have no reason to suspect that The Box can do something, so why would they selflessly choose? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care when a problem is presented in our lives? <br /> <br /> The psychological obstacles in this film are everywhere. Press the button or don't do it, it's likely someone is joking with you. Take the money or no, nobody gives away anything for free. Search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your disappearance. <br /> <br /> I propose that The Box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will as we reveal that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life, is it that freedom? No, it's just another box because then you get caught up in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and this is another box. This is exactly why the outer beings in the film are ultimately antagonistic. They demand that we conform to the moral standards that deprive us of our freedom. We arrived on Mars and were burned and turned into slaves in a sick game. <br /> <br /> References to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point quite well. "You can only enter the final room for free or not be free." Of course, but no matter the form we enter the room, it is still a room. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
