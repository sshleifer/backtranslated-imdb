True, there are some problems for those who want to find them. They are not important, though. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this film is to look at the experienced veterans who do their job. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays the part of a strong woman well, but one who was injured. The same goes for Harrison Ford, who, for women, is as beautiful as Kristin is good for us guys. <br /> <br /> Their evil at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an embarrassing way, but one in which they find support in each other. The way they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity on the screen is why these are such sought after artists. The viewer cannot help but feel what he feels, nor can he help in wanting to do it when they are together. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops, but they do it only a little, and they are not a significant part of the film. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Dave Grusin offers a wonderful jazz-based background with trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought-after music consultants in the world of cinema. Blanchard shows why he is one of the best trumpet players on the scene. <br /> <br /> It is not a film for lovers of courage, blood and blood. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, we look at a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act, like Harrison Ford, in the endless relaxing accompaniment of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard, this is a move for look with someone you love. Preferably in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought he deserved at least an 8.
