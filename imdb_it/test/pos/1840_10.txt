Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman in her thirties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just had the tragedy of losing his wife in a car accident. The result can be guessed. Gracie receives Bob's wife's heart, even if they don't know each other ... yet! A year later, Gracie feels like a new person while Bob starts thinking about his social life. When a friend shows him out on a blind date, Bob is interested in the waitress, Gracie, at the restaurant where the date is held. They begin to see each other. How long will it take before the truth materializes and what will be the consequences? This beautiful, fun and touching film is one of the best romantic comedies ever built. The two stars shine like the couple that only paradise could bring together and the supporting cast, Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi and Carroll O'Connor, are simply wonderful. Near Chicago, the setting of the neighborhood is just as fascinating and beautiful. We make that dittos for costumes and script. If you know someone who goes ga-ga for miraculous love stories, you will be forever in their graces if you present him to this beautiful film.
