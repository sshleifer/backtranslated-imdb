As a review has already commented, this television comedy is among the best football parodies of all time. But ... after failing in the video when it was first broadcast, I now find that it is not around in any format. OK, so this one has only voted 17 votes to date, but an average of 9+ seems to suggest something special. Basically, I suppose it's a case of bad luck if you missed it because it's no longer available to see it !! Aaaaaaaargh.
