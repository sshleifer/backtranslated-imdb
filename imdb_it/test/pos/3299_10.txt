"Boy Next Door" is a fun ride through the male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most feature films can't even match. Great performance, excellent photographic work and editing --- this short is a classic from start to finish. Congratulations to Travis Davis for his double role as director and protagonist. It's the most fun and foggy after Woody Allen. And how wonderful to see Richard Moll again. If you thought that all he could do was play "Bull" the bailiff of "Night Court", think again. This jewel of a film highlights Stephen Garvey's brilliantly fun writing. Remember that name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the true king of eccentric comedy.
