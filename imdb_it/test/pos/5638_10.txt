This documentary is the most mesmerizing film I've seen in a long time. I must have had it for a whole day. The selected material included in the song flows incredibly well and develops three characters that are impossible to forget. The different layers of these people come off to make a strangely moving film about perseverance, loyalty and determination. These characters are surprisingly fascinating and the film is unforgettable.
