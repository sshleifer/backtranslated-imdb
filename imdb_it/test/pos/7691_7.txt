I first saw the opening of Otto Preminger's "Porgy and Bess" on TV, probably sometime in the early 1980s, and my younger self found it a bit slow, despite the timeless music . I turned it off <br /> <br /> Last night, an extremely rare and cobbled print together projected at the Cinematheque of L.A. and it was a bit of a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings a great deal of vulnerability, strength and subtlety (at least in today's standards) to eroticism on her part. It is said that Sidney Poitier is uncomfortable with the film, but his performance is exceptional, as is Pearl Bailey. Even better are Sammy Davis as the amoral, as Cat's Sportin 'Life and Brock Peters as the smug Corona peasant. <br /> <br /> Still, I'm not a fan of Preminger's previous, and much easier to see - "Carmen Jones". Porgy and Bess "is far superior to that less controversial film - though this may have to do with the fact that even the original material is far superior. <br /> <br /> As seen last night , this is sturdy but far from a perfect job. Not all moments come to life, and there is some embarrassment in the way the film mixes the openly styled Catfish Row set (beautifully crafted by Oliver Smith) with real positions., some short parts of the score seem unduly popularized. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, even if this does not detract from the success of the directors: Preminger's decision to shoot almost entirely in wide shots, without first plans and occasional medium shots, no doubt made it unwatchable on "scanned and scanned" TV and can ruin it even on widescreen DVDs if it gets the restoration it deserves. In smaller screens, we won't be able to distinguish the many details that are crucial. for the way Preminger staged the film. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the e-mail I heard last night was strange. Many of the voices, particularly on the "Summertime" opening, seemed excessively soft and were overwhelmed by instrumental music. Perhaps this can be solved in a restoration. <br /> <br /> There is the problem of the film's racial policy. Personally, I see nothing wrong with this, at least in a contemporary context. At a time when so few films have depicted strong African-American characters, this may have seemed like an unfortunate choice for a high-budget Hollywood movie. And, although there may not be much "power" here, these are recognizable human beings who are not racial stereotypes. They are operatic characters who make wrong choices because that's what the tragic characters do. This alone took a huge step forward at that time. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic African-American characters are less rare (though not yet quite common), these characters seem nothing more or less than human. They could really be poor and rude people of all ethnic backgrounds. Apart from thorny politics, the original work is undoubtedly one of the great successes of American and (secondarily) theater music. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes, Pearl Bailey, were all extraordinary artists that we would never see again. This film far from perfect, but still solid, clearly deserves to be seen and appreciated.
