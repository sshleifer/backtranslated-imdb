My wife and my children were and still is the best TV comedy series ever made. I really enjoyed it and everyone in the UK still looks at the recap. The Wayans brothers. they should all be somehow together in a comedy show. My wife and children were a comedy that the whole family could watch and not happen very often. Is there anything we can do to make it happen again? do everything to have that comedy again! 1 Damon Wayans should come back! I would very much like Damon Wayans to play or perform another comedy like this, obviously with the help of the whole Wayans family. I was very sad when it ended that way and I hope others will come in the future. Brilliant comedy, excellent stuff! your real, DezMo
