Based on the bestselling novel "The Dismissal", The Missing Star, the latest film by acclaimed Italian director Gianni Amelio, is the story of the growing friendship between an old Italian maintainer and a young performer he takes on in Shanghai to be his guide through the China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the maintenance manager of a steel plant in Italy that has been closed and the blast furnace sold in China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous, he goes to China to find the steelworks where the part was sold in the hope of avoiding a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> The film, of course, talks about the journey and not the destination to use a family clich√© and, in that journey, we are aware of a captivating look in China with all its immense beauty and complexity, through the extraordinary cinematography of Luca Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a journey along the Yangstze River that shows us the coastal areas that should be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam will be fully operational, a Chinese mega-project that caused the displacement of 1.2 million people. The journey brings travelers face to face with poverty, overcrowded housing and children left to their own devices. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling) who meet for the first time Italy, where his impatience with his translations at a dinner party makes them lose the job. When he tracks her down in Shanghai, she works in a library and opposes Vincenzo's approach. Looking at his offer to help him on his trips to China as little more than a well-paying job, he reluctantly agrees to accompany him. Their relationship, however, grows as they move from one city to another, its interpretative abilities are very evident to help the bewildered Vincenzo who does not own a cell phone. <br /> <br /> As they slowly open up to each other, they expose each other to vulnerability and the film deepens their past and present life and how they arrived at the current situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) at his grandmother's house. In China's one-child policy, he is one of the unwanted children who have been "hidden" since the boy's father left the family. Although the meeting between Vincenzo and the boy is casual, their relationship becomes central in the way the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Castellitto is an excellent actor (even if one craves a young Enrico Lo Verso in this role). However, he is emotionally distant throughout the film, his expression rarely changing from a far-flung dog expression. Although Tai Ling brings a great presence in the role, his relationship with the older Vincenzo never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known as film. Although Amelio is one of my favorite directors, following the brilliant Keys to the House, Missing Star is a disappointment.
