This was a funny movie. I just saw the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago (and I left more), I had as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could, including the really bad ones. This is fun, without being exceptional, but just as bad as the original. <br /> <br /> I mean that you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half-brain freaks, gypsies, ex-KGB taxi drivers, jealousy, passion, love, romance, sex, action and more, all with same 6 actors :) <br /> <br /> You really have to see it and have fun, I can't explain it in a text box. I guess it's not so much a cult movie as the Evil Dead, but it certainly has the touch of Bruce Campbell that I love. Ted Raimi lends a hand, Tamara Gorski seems both beautiful and interesting (she went a long way from the prostitute on Friday 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows many promises as an actor, although he will probably be chosen as a secondary character in Hollywood movies throughout his career. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead you will like it too.
