"Subspecies", like many other horror films, gets a raw deal on IMDb. Most filmmakers have a strong disregard for horror, and when they occasionally rent horror films, or want to laugh at them or shudder at excessively bloody scenes. Unfortunately, "Subspecies" is not particularly ridiculous, and it's not so bloody, so it gets a low rating. Sin. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is much to criticize here. Non-actors are flat, subspecies have little special effect and night scenes are too bright. But what do you expect? For a straight-to-video horror film, "Subspecies" boasts decent production values ​​and greater integrity than can be anticipated. The Romanian setting of the film is practically unique (I think it was the first American film made in that country, post-communism), and the locations, both internal and external, are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when deepening local folklore (all fakes, I'm sure). In some ways, location shooting and smartish scripts work well together - "Subspecies" has its very own world. Risking crushing with weak praise ... could be much more stupid. <br /> <br /> Fans of the most gruesome aspects of horror will undoubtedly have a kick out of the evil bleeding vampire, Radu. It's pretty effective in this film - powerful, with a memorable hoarse voice - but I like it better in the sequels, when actor Anders Hove gives a more self-critical and captivating performance. A totally sincere Radu is a bit silly. Other silly aspects include free nudity and the subspecies themselves, which are clearly only in the film because the producer Charles Band has a fetish for small evil creatures (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). <br /> <br /> But I will also focus a lot on the flaws of the film. For what it is - straight-to-video vampire horror - "Subspecies" is perfectly fine. The sequels boast better production values, more violence and slightly more thoughtful narrative lines, so I recommend them even more. However, this is not a bad start for the series.
