"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the greatest animated films of the 80s. Alvin and the Chipmunks have always been of some interest to me, since they were what really brought me to rock and roll. None of the Chipmunks has any negative traits. Alvin is really the star and has all the interesting aspect. Theodore is the adorable and sensitive. Then there's Simon (my favorite), the smart one who is often a spoilsport. I also really like the Chipettes. There's Brittany, who, like Alvin, is one who always tries to be so popular. Then there is Eleanor, who, like Teodoro, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only Chipette that is not very similar to its counterpart; she is very naive and really clumsy. <br /> <br /> In the first real Chipmunks feature, David Seville is on a business trip to Europe, leaving the boys with Miss Miller as he leaves. While playing an arcade video game, Alvin loses to Brittany and then says that if he had the money, he would really run Brittany around the world. Unbeknownst to the children, a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister, Claudia, who tried to invent a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world for cash, heard this conversation and said they would let them run worldwide for $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept it and go into the race. <br /> <br /> This adventurous film has a lot of great songs. "Off to See the World" created for an appropriate theme for the film. Then there is "Getting Lucky", one of my favorite songs in the film. "My Mother" is probably the most fascinating song in the film, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only cover used in the film (the rest was completely original). Then, of course, there is "The boys and girls of rock and roll", which, in my opinion, must be one of the greatest musical numbers in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> I used to watch this movie very often, until the death of my recorded tape. I still watch the film, however. This is actually a fun movie for people who are going on vacation to a foreign country for the first time. It will give you an idea of ​​the kind of things you would expect from travel in the world. Definitely one of my childhood films, and one I would recommend to fans of the 80s and fans of Alvin & the Chipmunks.
