I am absolutely disgusted that this film is not sold. All those who love this film should send an email to Disney and increase the demand. In the end they should have sold it. I would buy the copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone in this film did a good job, and I didn't understand why Disney didn't put this movie on DVD or VHS in rental stores. At least I didn't see any copies. This is a good bad movie and should be seen by everyone. The children of the new generation cannot see it and I think they should. It should at least be put back on the canal. This film does not deserve an economic download. It deserves the real thing. I'm emailing them now. This film will be on DVD.
