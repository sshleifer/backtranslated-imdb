The One and the Only! <br /> <br /> The only really good description of the LA punk movement in the early 1980s. Moreover, the definitive documentary on legendary bands like the Black Flag and the repugnant opinions of X. Mainstream Americans on this film are absolutely hilarious! How can music be so diverse in a country of supposed freedom ... even 20 years later ... find out! <br /> <br />
