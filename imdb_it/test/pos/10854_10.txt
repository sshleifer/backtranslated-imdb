As a lesbian, I'm sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on TV as a sad person, always wavering between suicide and murder, but never destined to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If, like me, you are fed up with Hollywood's anti-lesbian propaganda, you breathe a sigh of relief in this delicious BBC offer. Nan Astley is the daughter of a restaurateur of the oyster house who "wonders why she can't hear the way she should do with Freddy" (one of the local guys who set her sights on her). You fall ?? and falls hard ?? for Kitty Butler, a double of men with a visiting theater company. Does Nan accompany Kitty to London as her dresser? <br /> <br /> Not everything that happens to Nan is pleasant in this story, and even some of the things she does are not at all jarring - but she will conquer your heart, and her triumphant love story will leave you with a nice lump in the throat at the end. <br /> <br /> If you are a macho lesbian-hater or homophobic housewife, or some brand of religious fundamentalists who believe that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you But if you have a heart and believe in love, you cry as much as I do in the end!
