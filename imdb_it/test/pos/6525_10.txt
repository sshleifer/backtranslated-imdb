For a film shot in 18 days and a budget of less than 2 million, this little film would deserve the "best we could" award. Interesting premise (apart from the usual meteoric stuff) with perfect solids from a cast of familiar faces. 2 inches up. Advice for the other reviewer: don't be afraid to say you liked something.
