Well, where do I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other reviewers said, you know you're ready for a real surprise when you see the opening photo - minutes and minutes of film spent on a standing guy on a travelator. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat the excellent summary of Rubin's story. What I would like to say, though, is that this film captured me more than any film I can remember. I sat with my mouth open, and on the edge of my seat to the end. The work with the camera, the soundtrack and the * fantastic * performances (in particular that of Tony Servillo) drag you on the screen and don't make you look away. <br /> <br /> It's Italian, so obviously they all look fantastic, but it's not just a cool style exercise. This is a film that has a lot to say about luck, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Go see it.
