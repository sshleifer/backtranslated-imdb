This film is real action at its best, nothing like this. This is one of those movies that you can just relax and watch some great shots and non-stop kills plus there are some excellent lines to get going with all this. My favorite is that there is a bad man who is breaking into this old house of couples and is stealing a TV or something and he goes straight to them and shouts "I'll come here whenever I like !!!" and just before he pops out of the window he screams "Anytime !!!" I mean, this is just classic stuff all around so you have a choice, you can watch that lousy Will Smith try to make an action movie or you can watch one of the Masters Charles Bronson !!!!
