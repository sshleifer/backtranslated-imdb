This one man show could be the most fantastic show I've ever seen. Simply calling it an act of standing up is to do a great injustice, there is a definite reason why this was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master at making people of all cultures feel at home by listening to his story of growing up and confronting his family and life in general. I recommend this show to anyone, as long as they can handle the language.
