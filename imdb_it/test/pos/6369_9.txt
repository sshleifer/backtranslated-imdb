As a fan of Dan Aykroyd, I watched this movie when it was shown recently at midnight on TV. I didn't expect much, so it was a great surprise that I liked it so much. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film that Dan Aykroyd seems to love. A chance for him to "take it back" and not take things too seriously. If you love him in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters you will know what I mean, and you would be wise to take a look at The Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Aykroyd's avid fans will also enjoy discovering small links with his other films in the script! <br /> <br /> I can't describe this film without ruining it for you, so all I can do is tell you to take a look. I can't praise this movie well enough, and it's definitely time for a DVD version !!
