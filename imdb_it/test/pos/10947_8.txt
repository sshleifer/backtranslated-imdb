If you go into the Twins effect in search of a pure Hong Kong cinema experience, you will be disappointed. This does not mean it is bad, but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie, which runs similarly to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's definitely silly and youthful, so if you want a lot of serious action in Hong Kong, watch a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie. This film has a lot of criticism for its nonsense and I thought that the first thing I should do would be to explain what you're getting yourself into, as it is disappointed by many purists. <br /> <br /> For non-purists and those with more indulgent tastes, though, Twins Effect is a delightful kung-fu comedy. I liked it a lot for a number of reasons, no less important are the female protagonists who trigger each other in an extremely funny double comic act. I think this is the first movie of the type they were in, but they jump, kick and fly like experienced professionals. <br /> <br /> The clearly ridiculous plot is handled with great care and attention and the film is written quite consciously, making the movie laugh loudly. Comedy is really the most important thing here, and it's a subtle and kind comedy that relies on words like inanimate objects flying on a Stephen Chow. It must be said that even the slapstick is immense. The sequence with disco vampires is an absolute classic. <br /> <br /> The action is really a mixture of two genres. It falls between the "wire-and-sword" combat of the dramatic period (which comes more towards the end) and the comic fighting style of Jackie Chan, coming out with a mixture that even if a little derivative is sometimes always exciting to watch and occasionally launches truly innovative meetings. <br /> <br /> All this is fantastic, and the film is really fun to the fullest. Despite this, it has some critical points. For example, Twins Effect is in many ways much more westernized than kung-fu fans are used to, the inevitable comparison with the Blade series is certainly a good example, even though Twins Effect is honestly much better than Blade ever managed, especially for combative action. Personally, it was also a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong (the hateful villain of John Woo's classic Hard Boiled) so little exploited, but the younger audience he is destined for is unlikely to notice or really know about Hard Boiled or his other films, so this is just a personal complaint. <br /> <br /> If you look at this with an open mind, you will probably like it a lot as I did, but you must be firmly aware that it is a COMEDY, not a ball in the kung-fu movie. Keep it in mind and you'll be fine.
