I suppose it depends on when you see the film for the first time that their impression was formed as it is. <br /> <br /> I saw him as a child on TV in 1973, when he was "The Stranger" and I loved it. It was the time when the space program on the moon was a reality, when shows like "Search", "UFO" and "6M $ Man" showed a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You have to see the shows only once and it was then that the network sent them on the air. The only way people could cut your shows was their parody; they couldn't take your show and add their comments on it. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what this "pilot" concept was. I saw the movie and hoped that Stryker would come home; I did not know that there was a possibility that it would continue beyond two hours. <br /> <br /> So, would I have understood what they hated so many people in the movie now? I doubt it because I don't remember it as such. Do I understand now? Not really to understand the story, we must not see it from their point of view, but rather from that of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> If you look like an American, it could be fun for the lack of security in a police state ... but if one is a subject in that state, then you can expect the compliance and security may be minor. When things have to be perfect, perfect in an extreme way, perfect for not doubting, it's not easy to question yourself so quickly when things are out of order. <br /> <br /> The subplots of the film are as interesting as the old man who remembers the previous era but observes his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state appreciates knowledge to a certain extent because they are attentive to how they control or damage their brain power. <br /> <br /> These days, it's likely that you know exactly what the movie is about before they see it, so much of the suspense, the surprise is lost. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is a perfect exchange considering that this film was done well in the Cold War and the astronaut's greatest fear is that he crashed in the USSR. You get a certain distance in the film before it becomes evident that such a possibility is the least of its concerns. <br /> <br /> This is the main difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". The latter can be considered timeless since the comments it has on the Soviet Union are relatively minor and lost at the beginning of the film. In the first case, those links are through the film, apparently directly at the beginning and then as a variation of the theme after the departments. <br /> <br /> All that he said, despite my fond memory for the film, is rather easy to see that he would not have done it as a series. Every week Stryker made friends, chased Benedetto, Stryker went away. In the end, Benedict's society would get rid of him. Someone else would have picked up the chase. A furrow would develop. There may be a jab on something new, like maybe another crew member of the Stryker mission, but it probably wouldn't be enough to keep the show going. <br /> <br /> If one goes with the knives that others have used to cut the film, the chances are that they will cut it as well. But if you remember that this was done during the Cold War and what the other party's fears and estimates were at that time, of what the popular environment held for the viewer, then they might find some fun and intellectual themes.
