Where do I start. I have to say how great cinematography is. I appreciate some scenes that show the creativity of the directors. I have to say how realistic the scenes on Ellis Island are. I must say that for a change we don't have the cliché scene to see the Statue of Liberty. (Now the immigrants who observe the statue from the railing of the ships is a cliché) <br /> <br /> Now it's not nice, two important things, one of which is a modern song and not a good one to start. <Br /> <br /> Second and almost deadly, the film is boring because it moves so slowly, that watching the dry paint would be an improvement. <br /> <br /> The duration of the 118-minute run is too long yet the film seems unfinished. We do not see scenes of this family in the United States. Our hero says he wants to find his twin brother, I would have liked to see scenes of his useless search attempt, instead of other scenes taken. <br /> <br /> The film is almost missing. <br /> <br /> Votes *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
