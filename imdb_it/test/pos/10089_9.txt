Disgusted as an Asian horror, "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is actually a psychological drama driven by a complex character, which envelops the viewer in the problems of an apparently normal family. I was really surprised by the depth of this film. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story than providing economic scares proved to be correct. Create one of the most brilliant new horror movies. <br /> <br /> "A Tale Of Two Sisters" tells the story, as the name of two Su-mi sisters and the younger Su-yeon suggests, that after spending time in a psychiatric institution coming home from the father and the apparently violent stepmother. From then on we see how the sisters deal with the progressive aggressiveness and irregular behavior of the stepmother. To say what will happen next would ruin the whole experience. So I'll just do it. <br /> <br /> The plot is written very tightly. With well-made characters. Ji-woon Kim's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view of them and their mutual relationships. Moreover, each of the four main actors has a very different role and type of character. From the protective Su-mi, the weakest Su-yeon, the father visibly disinterested in the frenetic and then mortal behavior of his stepmother. There is a great sense of mystery, with a lot of unrevealed plot to the end and even after the film still leaves a large space for interpretation. Even after watching it once, the viewer will be forced to see it at least once so that it can understand better. <br /> <br /> Actors adapt perfectly to their roles. It is particularly difficult to create strong and exciting scenes in psychological films, but it is a great joy when you can create them and this is a prime example of such an undertaking. The direction of Ji-woon Kim is slow and thrilling, increasing the tension for the film's horrific scenes. While few of these moments are strong and frankly terrifying. The cinematography and the soundtrack are of the highest level, helping to create an atmosphere that adapts to that of a psychological film. <br /> <br /> "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is a demonstration of how the horror genre is actually much more than just a thrill. With its strong focus on character and mystery, this is a complex film that could easily seduce yourself by looking at it again and again just so you can understand it better.
