After spending five seasons on the small screen from 1976 to 1979, "George & Mildred" moved to the big screen in the mid-1980s. Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke maintaining their role as writers, Dick Sharples became involved as a writer. Unfortunately, this film adaptation does not seem to have affected the public. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself actually. It was a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> 'Mildred Roper' (Yootha Joyce) is eager to ascertain if her husband "George" (Brian Murphy) was remembered on their wedding anniversary. Obviously, he did not, but to try to convince his wife otherwise book a table at the restaurant where he proposed marriage to Mildred several years ago. <br /> <br /> Upon arrival at the restaurant, they discover that the place has changed hands. Finally, seeing George's lies, Mildred insists that they celebrate their anniversary in a swanky hotel. Arrived at the hotel, George is mistaken for swindler "Harry Pinto" (Stratford Johns) for a ruthless killer, who wants a rival to be exterminated! <br /> <br /> It is not an exceptional comedy as such, but a piece of good fun anyway. Plans to revive the series after the screening of the film were sadly terminated when Yootha Joyce died on August 24, 1980 from alcohol poisoning. <br /> <br /> Funniest moment - George talks to his favorite garden gnome. His neighbor, Tristram, sneaks up behind him and says, "I think it was our talk." George, thinking he had developed the power of the word, drops the gnome in shock! <br /> <br /> Merry Christmas to other IMDb users, especially "AdamFontaine", "Cyril Blake" and "TheLittleSongBird". Good vision!
