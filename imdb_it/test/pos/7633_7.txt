"L'Ossessa" (published in English under many titles and the most heterogeneous of them is certainly "The disturbing midnight horror show") is one of the best Italian scams of "The Exorcist". To really appreciate this movie you should have a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is at the same time shabby (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving. <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue that is going to restore. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ, perhaps already overcome by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps planning dark deeds. The face shows an infinite torment. The statue dates back to the fifteenth century. Danila is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor: the statue seems almost alive! He lives with his parents. His mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) lives a dissolute life and doesn't care too much to keep up appearances. His father Mario (Chris Avram) observes everything with disenchanted eyes. <br /> <br /> The wooden statue will soon take on a human form (Ivan Rassimov) and will possess Danila in a carnal and spiritual sense. An incredible scene! Poor Danila, from now on, will suffer the torments of hell. <br /> <br /> Danila (the beautiful Stella Carnacina) was raped, violated, possessed by the devil and now following her orders, she will try to seduce others. Is she not emulating her bad mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) who feels great pleasure when her lover lashes her with a bouquet of roses? There is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving, when Stella Carnacina runs for desperation through the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, remember?) Of a small Italian town that screams her heart. Luigi Pistilli is an excellent exorcist. His performance is, as usual, intense. The exorcism scenes (especially the final battle) are very, very amateurish, but this will only increase the fun (and / or the emotion?) If you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and this is a factor that adds pleasure when she is naked, but I think the film could have explored its natural beauty more. Lucretia Love is a very good sleaze companion (her nude scene with roses ... well :) <br /> <br /> Other scams of Italian exorcists that I would like to recommend for you are: <br /> <br / > Malabimba (very shabby and released uncut and digitally restored) <br /> <br /> "Evil Eye" ("Evil Eye") - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye", but other films, as, for example, "Rosemary's Baby" should also be taken into consideration. "Evil Eye" is completely over the top. Not so squalid but with lots of Italian and Spanish actresses. You'll be drooling throughout the movie. The film is ridiculous, the story doesn't make sense, but if you see it in the right mood you may feel moved! - a devilish sect, possession, murder, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women all around. A wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you liked "Evil Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness". This film can be found in the alternative market. Search for this title in IMDb. There are good reviews about it. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "The Ossessa" has many different faces. He is an exploiter, but he can also be serious and moving. It's cheap, poor ... shabby (but not so much) and has a basic "moral" message. This strange mixture can sometimes be a lot of fun. We all already know that "L'Ossessa" is a rip-off from "exorcists", so why can't we see it on its own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo was trying to earn a quick penny, but he was able to get the most out of a small budget. The story is well told, the film is atmospheric and overall the actors are engaged in their roles. Watch the movie with an open mind and you could discover two or three new things.
