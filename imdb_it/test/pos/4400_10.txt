Having seen most of Coen Brothers' previous films, I was expecting something different and a little off-center. OBWAT is certainly one of those things, but it also has a heart as big as ... well ... as big as the Mississippi. It is one of the most enjoyable films that have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-made, intelligent and superbly performed. <br /> <br /> The characters are delivered in their myriad nuances by a group of wonderful actors. George Clooney has completely captivated me with his appearance and his character of Clark Gable. Having always seen him only in Three Kings and in his Thin Red Line cameo, I am now a fan. More comedy please George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson help skillfully, especially Nelson. If ever "The Simpsons" has been turned into a film, then it must be natural to play Cletus, the loose-nosed yokel. I don't think there is a performance that is not up to the cast. My favorite is Stephen Root in the role of the blind Radio Station Man. <br /> <br /> Great old music, a jiggy-type dance by Clooney that I'm trying to learn, and a feeling of depression in the southern United States strengthened from sepia photography makes it the best film I've seen so far in this century. The only drawback of the film is that it almost sent me to buy the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it ... it's so beautiful! <br /> <br />
