Food is always a good topic in movies, as "Chocolat" shows. "Babette's party" is the same kind of thing. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French cook who flees her native land after the repression of 1871. She moves to a very religious Danish village. The people in this village simply don't need joy. That is, until Babette cooks one of her delicious meals. <br /> <br /> It's not just that this film is about bringing fun to a place that has never known it. Like other Scandinavian films (and non-Hollywood films in general), it shows that a film can maintain your interest without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. This is a movie that you can't afford to lose. <Br /> <br /> Another thing. Do you think the Danish word for "feast" sounds a bit like "tastebud"?
