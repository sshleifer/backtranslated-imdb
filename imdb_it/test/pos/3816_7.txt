This film has kept my interest enough to look at it several times. The plot has holes, but the main protagonists make it work. <br /> <br /> Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge), does a great job as a 37-year-old woman who sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. He worked for years to earn money to go to medical school. He performs brilliantly in his residence and is about to take his onboard exam and realize his dream. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are killed and as a close living relative she is forced to welcome her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to prevent her from becoming a state guard. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized by the murder of her parents that she became dumb. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days take better care of Amanda. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighboring man in their apartment building that makes its way into the lives of Julia and Amanda. He's always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda handle his discomfort. Amanda really starts to warm up with Kevin as the movie progresses, perhaps more than from her aunt. Julia starts relying on Kevin to take some of the burden of caring for Amanda as she tries to handle the load on her case and prepare for her onboard exam. Kevin is always present whenever a crisis breaks out for Julia. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. Keep watching them to see them reunite before the end of the film. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was also good. Arlen managed to convey a lot without the benefit of the words. The plot saw Julia and Amanda warm up little by little with each other. You can see them as they develop a relationship as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> We find out that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three partners who wanted to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under alleged identities. The plot is not clear if the Meyers intended to double their members or if they were doubly crossed. <br /> <br /> In any case the Meyers are killed in their home by 2 of their former associates. The assassins do not attempt to extract the position of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them. The killers look for the house and can't find their prize. They leave living testimony of their crime, Amanda. The killers then pass the rest of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is. In the end, the killers kidnap Amanda in the hope that she knows something about the location of the microchip. <br /> <br /> Julia eventually finds out the truth about Kevin. He's an investigator hired to retrieve the stolen microchip. After some difficult moments in the relationship they manage to save Amanda and send the bad guys. The predictable ending causes the three to form a family and move happily in a future together. <br /> <br /> What struck me about the plot were the main holes. Kevin moves into the same condominium as Julia and Amanda the day after the Meyers murder. How do you know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? The killers happily leave fingerprints on the scene of the murder, without bothering to hide their identity. The killer who pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remains of red paint from the murder scene on her shoe soles. At the beginning of the film it was not shown in the crime scene. There are other weaknesses along these lines that are too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much better if the script had been perfected more before the shoot. Filling the holes in the plot would have added a small expense and greatly improved the effort.
