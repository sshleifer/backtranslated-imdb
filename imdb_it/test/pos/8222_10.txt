This adaptation for TV was a wonderful vehicle for Bill Irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. With the backdrop of a fight between an actor and his writer / director, Bill uses his clown antics to show a variety of skills including tricks, pantomimes, dance and various physical devices. <br /> <br /> Although it takes a big hit in the entertainment industry and its art, it is compelling for people of all ages and ages. <br /> <br /> This work was broadcast as a PBS special. Bill did a part on the Tonight Show, but out of context it didn't go very well.
