Although there were some difficult points and some plot lines that weren't exactly faithful to the character, this was Classic H: LOTS. The characters, outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were faithful to the form, and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were deep and well acted as anything that could ever embellish the little one screen. /> <br /> "Homicide: The Movie" aka "Life Everlasting" is a fan flick, but stands alone as well as every 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a great job of staging the seven seasons and all the major cast members of the "best damn show on television" together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give him . Faithful to the form of "Homicide", there were no happy conclusions, such is life. This is what has always distinguished this show from the shows of fake cops on television. Congratulations to the writers and the cast for creating something in the series and in the film that challenged both viewers and producers. <br /> <br /> ** I call myself a "homicidal maniac" if for no other reason than to keep my collaborators in a cooperative mood. **
