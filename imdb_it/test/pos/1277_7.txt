Below is a little-known British film from 1998, which was made with a budget of Â£ 8000 and has a run time of 70 minutes. When you look at it, wouldn't you ever expect his director to go to Hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century ?? Well, everyone has to start somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> The director of Following, as you probably already know, is the Englishman Christopher Nolan, who directly after Following would have continued to direct the critically acclaimed independent film Memento; a few years later he would be hired by Warner Bros. to direct the new Batman series, which gave him more support, and so on and so forth. My point is that everyone has to start somewhere ?? even if it's not in the most stunning debut ?? and Christopher Nolan presents himself to the world in 1998 with Seguito. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it, I couldn't help but draw similarities with another directorial debut, David Lynch's avant-garde author David Eraserhead. Following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in this sense, but the similarities are obvious; the most remarkable, is shot in grainy black and white and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. It is difficult to describe in words, but vaguely resembles the smoky atmosphere found in the noir films of the past. Thus, it can be said that Following is a contemporary noir film, or a neo-noir. Overall, it's a fusion of this and a psychological thriller, and the story is more appropriate for these two genres. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is unnamed, and the title of the film stems from an early, obsessive-compulsive trait he possessed ?? randomly choose people on the street and follow them, sometimes even for hours and hours. During one of these "expeditions persists", the main character is noticed by one of the people he is following and is being addressed. It turns out that the 'confronter' is a man who is willing to make friends with our narrator and presents himself; his name is Cobb, and he is a small thief who invites the narrator to follow him on his thefts. <br /> <br /> From there, the main character is overwhelmed in Cobb's world, and gets involved in crime, passion and violence as he becomes more and more intimate with Cobb. Following is not so much a study of character, but rather a film that follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating ramifications that it has on our narrator. Nolan manages to make the film look like a film noir, and emulates its atmosphere well. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, Following is tense and atmospheric; however, as a film in general, it is a bit of a disappointment. If this were not the case, then it could be called disappointing. Is the entire film shot in a non-chronological and non-linear way, and makes the history and experience of the cinema unique to a certain extent? has this style been done so many times now it's almost a common technique? and the story itself is unique to some extent. <br /> <br /> However, Following is ultimately overwhelming for the entire film, and is disappointingly not spectacular. Does the story require more? more action, more suspense and more chills ?? but it becomes too enmeshed in its own plot, and instead focuses on creating an intricate plot. Later he manages to do it, but without other elements it is a noir film that does not work at all; it has a sense of emptiness that is not huge, but still visible. Also, the shocking revelation of the film in the end ?? almost a mandatory convention in film noirs ?? that's what makes us feel betrayed; it is unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story it is disappointing, given that essentially the previous scenes and the entire film seem like a huge waste of time. <br /> <br /> But the positives are far outweigh the negatives, and in the end it turns out to be an imperfect but satisfying movie, yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does it with Following, and does it excellently. A quiet, gentle but refined way. It's not the most stunning film, and it's not quite worthy of the accolades the director would have received in the following decade, but it's still a good movie. When you choose Later, you find a well-done thriller, tense and atmospheric, which lacks obvious nuances or an innovative style, but still manages to capture the public.
