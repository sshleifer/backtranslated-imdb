Although he is often considered Peter Sellers' worst film, it is actually an excellent source of corruption and abuse of power in the medical field. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film for which the Sellers were best known; satirical farce. This film has had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and the Karate Kid films), but has been characterized by its rebels, irreverence and total demolition by the medical industry of the day. He was ahead of his time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take to the cinema some time later. As such, it was unacceptable to the traditional Peter Sellers fan, who found the arrows pointed in this humor as something they were not used to. Currently, Peter Sellers' films are in demand by fans, but this effort, Where Does It Hurt?, By nature has become almost impossible to find.
