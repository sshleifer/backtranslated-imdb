It is always a pleasure to see the characters in a film who are totally kind-hearted and well-intentioned, even when they are surrounded by those who are neither. The film's discreet premise is that the conservative and religious family Franklin (mother, father, son and girl) is involved in an accident in which parents and brother have a pre-death experience during which they meet Jesus, a pleasant but a bit exasperated soul that removes from them the weight of "original sin". When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed, much to the dismay of their daughter, who did not share the experience. The religious side is, in my opinion, presented with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the terribly terrible (those of his "followers" who are obsessed by the sins of others and completely unaware of their own). It's a movie to make you think, give you some good laughs along the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world could be just a nicer place than you think it is.
