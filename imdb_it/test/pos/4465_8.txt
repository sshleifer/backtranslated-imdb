Putting on a seemingly more suitable title for a Looney Tunes featurette rather than a macabre yellow, "Do not Torture a Duckling" (1972) is nevertheless an A-grade thriller by the horror master Lucio Fulci. In this, someone strangled the preteen boys in a rural village in southern Italy and, typical of these yellow ones, there are many suspicions. There is Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia), looking more exquisite than you ever saw, a rich girl hiding after a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft practitioner boyfriend; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the priest with the sweet face; his strict mother; and so on. The film features some unusually violent pieces, including a chain that lashes out one of the main characters in a cemetery (one of the most realistic and bloody sequences I've ever seen) and a noble duke when the killer is eventually revealed. The film's explosions of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real fears or suspensions to talk about. Yet, this mystery fascinates, with its unusual rural background, disturbing murders of children, extravagant characters and the strange score by Riz Ortolani. The film was magnificently photographed in what I presume to be Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic in southern Italy (at least, the city's police forces are thanked in the credits). And while subtitling would have made this refined-looking DVD even more beautiful (American slang is not convincing in this Italian rural setting), Anchor Bay should be thanked for another job well done. Oh ... that title also makes perfect sense in the end!
