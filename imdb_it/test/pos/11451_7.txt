It's the old, old story: children have a party in an old house, demons are unleashed, death and naked nudity. You all know, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Many people (ok, a lot of horror fans, to be precise) have fond memories of this movie and it's always with a little trepidation that you revisit an old movie to see if it's still as good as you thought that was it. Fortunately, this is. <br /> <br /> It has something for everyone (well, all those that seem to be males, I suppose). From a fun sequence of titles to a silent scam involving the cunning use of Linnea Quigley's ass to the "specular" scene to complete demonic fun, this is a hoot from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The girls are cute, the boys are. . . . male, the scenes of death are well done with some good effects of gore and, unlike some horrors of the time, this actually maintains a good sense of the atmosphere and also the tension in everything. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun first of all, but it offers some interesting moments for all fans of the genre.
