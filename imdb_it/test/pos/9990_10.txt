Oh my God, what a story! This film is very good and it had to be God that happened! You did a fantastic job. The acting was really good, you definitely chose the right actors. This film is so beautiful that I'm really happy that you did it because if I hadn't done it I would never have known this story because I'm not a big golf fan and I think it's a bit boring so thank you. I liked it a lot and that's why I gave the film to 10. I also liked Shia Labouf who was perfect for the role of Fransis Quimet. I hope that even most of that stuff you entered was true. Oh and some parts were fun and some I was really happy.
