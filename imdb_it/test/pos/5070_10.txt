The Extraordinary Rendition is a frightening practice authorized, surprisingly, under Clinton, which allows the US government to capture and retain anyone who is suspected, apparently for any reason, to be a terrorist against the United States. This is a sensitive issue, especially after September 11th, because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition for believing that the life force of the United States must effectively combat terrorism. Fanatical supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves. <br /> <br /> But like a recent film that has lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty, The Life of David Gale, Rendition shows us a story of misuse of extraordinary surrender, or at least of the ease with which can be exploited and falsely applied. The story involves Anwar El-Abrahimi, an American-born American chemical engineer who is captured as he returns to America to lecture in Egypt. The cause is that he made phone calls to a well-known terrorist. No evidence has ever been given (or necessary) that it was Anwar who made the calls, that his phone was never stolen. Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, returned to the States frantically trying to find her husband, who boarded a plane to Chicago but apparently never went down. The feeble explanation that has never been there evaporates when he discovers that he made an in-flight purchase using his credit card. <br /> <br /> Lately I've been studying modern Chinese history, particularly that of the incredibly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by Mao Tse-tung, and it's more than a little scary to see the similarities between the extraordinary rendition and some of Mao's brutal intimidating tactics, including his public executions (which people were forced to watch), and the extensive use of torture specifically used to extract "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is rather disturbing to note that Mao did precisely these things to create an environment of fear in order to obtain obedience from the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration has not created an environment of fear and continues to milk it for all that is worth would be naive to the extreme, and even if the extraordinary surrender was not created under Bush, it is clear that it does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> In addition to the film's depth is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk for the CIA and has little experience in the field, until his boss is murdered and suddenly finds himself to supervise the torture of a man who quickly comes to doubt has nothing to disclose. Fatima's daughter (Freeman's boss) also plays a key role, as well as a senatorial helper played by Peter Sarsgaard, who could have the most satisfying role in the film. Meryl Streep is also adequately cold and clinical as a cold senator with dogmatic support for the necessity and practice of surrender. <br /> <br /> As a political thriller, the film is extraordinarily well made and rhythmic. But the scariest thing is that it's all true. The film's goal is to make people really think about things done in America, especially when they claim to have been made to prevent the same things. Conducing terror in the name of preventing terror will not convince us, nor will we extort confessions through brutal torture, which is the lowest form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in that direction, doing these things more than less. The frightening question is what is the event that will take place in the future at some time to convince us to stop and head the other way, towards civilization and peace, or we will continue to head towards a military dictatorship until we finally have There?
