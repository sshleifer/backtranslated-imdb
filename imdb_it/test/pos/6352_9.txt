Excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had teeth without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative and artificially rewarding. It could be a good double feature even with American Beauty. The best performance to date that I saw from Anita Mui, and every actor in this seems like a powerhouse to me. An affectionate greeting to Ann Hui as director and Ivy Ho for the brilliant script. Seriously one of the best dramas I've seen in a while, especially if you have a taste for the ALA poem of classical literature. Once again, excellent.
