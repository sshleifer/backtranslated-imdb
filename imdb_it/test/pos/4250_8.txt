"Putney Swope" is a unique, low budget very low gem from the late 1960s that probably would have been forgotten over time had it not been for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named the character of Don Cheadle in "Boogie Nights ", Buck Swope, after the eponymous hero of this film) and the limited version of the DVD. Watching "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make much sense (at least for me not having seen it for the first time), but you have to respect the film for its passion and blatantly rebellious message. I didn't understand many things about "Putney Swope", but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the film, the more it grows on me. <br /> <br /> The film is advertised as a parody of Madison Avenue in New York, better known in the 1960s as the advertising capital of the world. Members of Generation X and Y could be lost with this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of US history. What you need to know before watching this movie is that these advertising agencies were mostly male, and even more so largely white factories. <br /> <br /> Bearing this premise in mind, the film opens with a meeting of the ad agency board. The members are mostly white except for Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who has a strange resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film), the African-American token on the board. The members of the council are so absorbed and soulless that when their president falls in front of them, their only concern is who will become the next president. Without even removing the body from the board, they start a paper vote to elect the next president. <br /> <br /> Putney Swope is elected by a landslide, but not because the other members think Swope is qualified. Voting for Swope was an unfortunate attempt for these council members to sabotage the chances of any other member being elected president. With their failed plans, Swope takes charge and "sinks (s) the boat", firing all but one of the original members and hiring all the black people in their place. <br /> <br /> After this point, the film has become (for me) very strange and difficult to follow with regards to the plot. There may not even be a plot, really. The whole idea of ​​the film seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result that the new "Truth and Soul Inc." the company would be unconventional, but still successful. The company ends up making so much money that the members build a huge window to keep money for unexplained purposes. It could be because Swope does not trust banks, even if this point is not touched or explained in the film. It could also be metaphorical in some way, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place inside the advertising agency, with occasional scenes at the White House with a president who, for some unknown reason, is a dwarf. My hypothesis here is that some political joke has been made, but I can't understand what. Did the directors say the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Were they saying that the last elected officials (then Nixon) were insignificant candidates? I do not know. I found it somewhat disturbing, however, that the man who played the president had a striking resemblance to future president Ronald Reagan. It's fun to make this connection 40 years after the film was made. <br /> <br /> What this film has benefited from is showing how consumers outside the advertising agency have reacted to the new ads. Naturally, the advertising film had a strange and amusing call for its unconventional creativity, but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so, how? The film hinted that the new advertising campaign was successful through interaction with the customer and calls from the White House. However, it would have been revealing to see normal people, since the demographic has always been more profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Although the parodies and political messages that this film might have made probably did not pass the test of time, this film still had many unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor for him that helped him a lot in this film. The rough voice of Swope was actually director Robert Downey, Sr.'s voice doubled, sometimes poorly, but suited the character so well in being an authoritative outsider. He hires and dismisses the workers at random, but earns the respect of all but one of the employees to revolutionize the advertising agency and look for new ideas. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film was, and still is, incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film refuses to fall victim to negative black stereotypes that would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. Although some sex scenes can be a bit daunting to some viewers, the main message is that a color-owned and managed company can thrive through innovation and risk-taking. Many people might not bring a positive message away from this movie, but I just did it. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" remains a film overlooked by a strange era, and Downey, Sr. (even despite his son's recent past comeback) never received recognition as a director he deserved. However, if you find a DVD of this movie, buy it and watch it. If it's on Netflix, idem. It is a film that can sometimes be confusing, but it is worth looking at for its taste, ambition and its unconventional stature even for today's film standards.
