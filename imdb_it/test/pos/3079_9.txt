This movie is wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin Hood is perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. Personally I think that the German man of Marian is the most amusing character, along with Latrine and the sheriff! While the space spheres have become boring and stupid after a while, this always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great movie and it never gets boring. An exceptional cast is in the roles, and is perfectly falsified, and makes a lot of sense, and can be looked at again and again! You will love this movie if you only watch it if you don't hate comedy, or if you don't think Robin Hood has to be tampered with. But this old story gets boring, and this movie gives a new flavor!
