Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast on this powerful journey through the life of the blind, emotionally troubled, African American genius of pop jazz, Ray Charles. Although the entire cast performs wonderfully, Mr. Foxx has earned more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years, I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx does not only interpret Charles, he recreates it. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of his life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film. <br /> <br /> The dramas of Charles "fight against guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, dependence and success, are well intertwined tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the screenplay is, as far as I can tell, perfect, and the acting is legendary to say the least. <br /> <br /> The film's directorial method deserves to be discussed, Taylor Hackford - a director of whom I am generally ambivalent - has had to choose which aspects of Mr. Charles's more complex and complex life would tell his story honestly, dramatically and understandably, although some disagree (he seems to want a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic) I think he selected his themes admirably, much of the success of this film is his constant focus on some persistent themes in Charles's life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt, his musical genius, and his deep fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man who fights valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I listened to on my old record player with my father in his living room on Sunday night while football games were on TV. And nothing was covered in sugar in "Ray". The themes are carried forward with strength and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that embraces the length of his long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, the script and the direction, the music and the acting make this one of the most entertaining and suggestive biographical films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended to all.
