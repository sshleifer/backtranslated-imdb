Great "documentary" of how dinosaurs believed that dinosaurs behaved, captured with some of the most spectacular CGI since "Jurassic Park". Done completely seriously, like a prehistoric episode of "Nation Geographic". Capture your attention from the first frame and never give up. My favorite part was when the Diplodocus fights against the Allosaurus. <br /> 10 stars. This is what science is.
