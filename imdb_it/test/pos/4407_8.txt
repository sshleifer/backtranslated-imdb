I first saw "The Knowledge" during a Thames television marathon at one of Los Angeles' independent local stations when it was new. I really enjoyed the UXB danger. <br /> <br /> That a film I once saw over twenty years ago should remain so good in my memory is a testament to its originality and the quality of the cast's performance. <br /> <br /> I searched for a copy of DVDs here in the United States and found none. In the end I bet and bought a British DVD on Ebay and I was happy to find out that it doesn't have the regional code. So those of us who would like to see this little gem can have a copy.
