Even though I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson, I like some of his first songs and even some of Jackson 5. 'Thriller' is one of his great songs and comes from the best-selling album of the same title ever. As for the video, it's fantastic, one of the best of Michael, but also very eccentric and strange. <br /> <br /> There's a story behind this video, but it's so complex that even I can't fully understand it. It's strange. The strangest things are Jackson's transformation into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and those dancing dead. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, electrifying, cold and original. There are great scenarios and settings. The music is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the good old pop of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I like the soliloquy of Vincent Price. He makes a great narrative with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laugh at the end is fantastic! My favorite videos of "King of Pop" are "Billie Jean" and "Don't stop until you have enough" (both of his best songs).
