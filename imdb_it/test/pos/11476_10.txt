"Sorte Nula" is the Portuguese film of 2004. The film released from the limited budget (estimated USD $ 150,000) opened during the Christmas period in front of American blockbusters such as National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, but quickly caught the adulation of the Portuguese spectators. Despite the tough competition, the little film did surprisingly well, surpassing all the other Portuguese films of the last two years in the first few weeks. The film is a mystery / homicide with a humorous tone intelligently written and directed by Fernando Fragata that has become a solid reference in the European independent film arena. Did I like the movie? Oh yes!
