I feel like I know these people and I have met people like them. These days, however, people are discouraged from showing such a passion for something, especially love and loneliness. It has a slow start, but then watch out! If you love romantic comedies, but would like to see one that actually had a basis for change (or at least returned in the 70s), then you should see this movie!
