This is a "docu-drama" of (especially) the last years of KW's life, with almost all the parts played by the actors (but you can see which television quartermaster plays himself!). It was created for the BBC4 arts channel but I think there will soon be syndication and DVDs. KW is cleverly interpreted by the excellent Michael Sheen, who here repeats his previous theatrical role with great success. Most of the support cast is also very good, and a nice touch is the recreation of the period television appearances with the new actors. This is not, however, a clear vision - anyone familiar with KW's journals and general unhappy behavior will already know how twisted it can be in a later life - so don't expect 80 minutes of Carry On style buff, since the emphasis is definitely. Recommended, but it's tragic-comic, really.
