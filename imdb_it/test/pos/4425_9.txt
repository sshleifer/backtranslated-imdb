Then again, I like Rachael Ray. It's fun, sweet, fresh and so nice to look at. I have to change everything I do as a vegetarian ... but it's nice to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a TV personality. I think it's nice that she's so inviting with her fans and still looks down to earth. The studio audience seems to be quite small, but this makes the environment more welcoming. Some people have posted that the show sucks. I guess it depends on your interpretation of it and her. If you notice the first episodes of 30 Minute Meals you will see a completely different personality than those of recent years. I'm sure he will find his comfort zone even with this show. Good luck Rachael!
