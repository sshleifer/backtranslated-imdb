Anyone wishing to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find Dogtown and Z-Boys appropriate research materials. This should not be confused with Lords of Dogtown, that sorry attempt by Hollywood to cash in on the success of Dogtown's original revival. <br /> <br /> Directed by Stacey Peralta, a former Z-Boys in himself as well as pro skater and mind behind the Bones Brigade of the 80s, and co-written with skateboard photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary traces as a surf group the kids from the southern California middle streets (known as Dogtown) who made up the Z-Boys skateboard team (actually there was a girl - Peggy Oki) revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews of almost all the Z-Boys (where it is unknown where Chris Cahill is), the most notable of which is the ugly ass Tony Alva and the youngest, Jay Adams, the talents (along with Perlata) seemed transcend the rest of the teams. There are interviews with the team's founders (and the Dogtown store), surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews with people like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKaye (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were kids in the 70s when Dogtown was making his influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was another context in previous years as he explains the documentary). <br /> <br /> It really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how they were formed, but why their style changed not only the tricks of skateboarding (pool skating has become immensely popular, and so has started the vert skating), but it has also facilitated the sport (even if not in the extreme publicity that it is today) as something more than the escaped fugitive that it had been before, given that these surfers who were unleashed in the morning they needed ways to spend their time and eventually go skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand had long been the Dogtowns, at least through the advertising of their skate team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Since Dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step. <br /> <br /> It is a great documentary in the way it was put together, even though Stacey Peralta has always known how to do it even when producing the Bones Brigade mini-demos / skate demos like "Ban This" and "Search for Animal Chin ". Narrated by Sean Penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains lots of fantastic archive footage and lots of interviews to give you a genuine idea of ​​who the Z-Boys were and how they left their mark on skateboard.
