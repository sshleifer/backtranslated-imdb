Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectic of life. By the end of the 19th century in a remote Japanese village a young man and a married woman, older than him, fall in love and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy that freedom since the remorse begins to haunt them starting as usual at the moment from the weakest member of the couple, the woman of course. From now on, in an atmosphere where the dream (the nightmare) mixes with reality, the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman, but then also to the man. He also haunts the dreams of other villagers by creating a climate of suspicion and gossip about the couple, compounded by the arrival of a police officer who comes to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband. But what makes this film more interesting besides this almost common story of adultery is the evolution of the couple's feelings into a deep psychological and dramatic Shakespearean development of remorse, anguish and fear that turns their love relationship into a nightmare until to their final end. Expressionism so dear to the theater or to Japanese film acting is also present in the performances of the players, but not in an exaggerated form. Only to the extent necessary to more effectively show the deeper feelings of the characters represented. This is really a good movie.
