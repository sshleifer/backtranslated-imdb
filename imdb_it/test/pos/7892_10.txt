22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist worker who is known to hate "hippies and ni ** ers". He meets Bill, a businessman who has just murdered the lover of drug addict Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill escapes and joins a common hippie on the outskirts of the city. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their research leads them through the most sugary parts of the city, where the hatred and inner hatred of both men are further tested. <br /> <br /> Criticism: this was the first major success of director John G. Avildsen. : "Rocky", "The Karate Kid", "Split-Image", "Weekend at Bernie's"). The film is quite interesting as it has served to encapsulate the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s (Vietnam War, black power, women's lib, etc.). He also has a good interpretation of Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the first anti-heroes of the cinema. He has always been good at playing chills, bullies whose abstract ideas are reinforced by his intimidating presence (he would play Frankenstein's monster in Mel Brook's parody of Young Frankenstein). It reminds me of a child trapped in a large, mute, clumsy body. The film has a weak script (the meeting between Joe and Bill, for example, is a bit random), but it has a particularly gruesome ending, post-Taxi Driver. <br /> <br /> CITATION: Title Song: "I saw a guy selling junk to children, gets nervous every time I pass, because he knows that if I take it, I'll kick his head and kick his fat to $ ".
