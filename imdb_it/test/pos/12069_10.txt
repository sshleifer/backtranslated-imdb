The War At Home is so beautiful that it has become my new favorite show. My loved ones and April my carly and April look at it together every Sunday and laugh at how realistic it is. I like how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they dwell on every little problem. Once someone does something stupid they never live it and this is really like family. The father always plays on all three children on every little thing. I love how parents have no idea how to behave with children. It's so true for real family life and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve their boys' problems puts the show on top. The War At Home is so brutally honest and so faithful to the live world it has become a milestone for future sitcoms. This is not Happy Days or The Brady Bunch is real life.
