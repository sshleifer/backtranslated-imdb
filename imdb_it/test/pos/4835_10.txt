I saw the premiere of "Path to Paradise" and I was stunned by it, dramatic license and all the rest. I lived in New York (Brooklyn) a few years and kept it in mind. Today, given the links with groups like Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I see it as a warning not recognized by our government. That is why I blame our bureaucracy and our leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to decapitate two of our branches of government and there is no excuse for our government to prevent it, period. "Path to Paradise" was only a dramatic view of the 1993 preview, and nobody cared. Now, after about 3,000 deaths and years back, we strive to find a ten-year response to resolve.
