Okay - it was black and white and probably on 2 "tape - which means the BBC deleted it, right? But it remains in my mind all those years ago (1960 ??) as a perfect slice of animated story from the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado. <br /> <br /> I WANT TO SEE AGAIN! You are reading this, BBC? Find your original 2 "tapes or the 35mm movie, treat the actors and administrators for the rights and reissue! I know, I know, some of them died, some of them are missing in action. <br /> <br /> Where else can I see Mary Morris as the "heart of the snake wrapped in the skin of a tiger"? Where else can I see Paul Daneman doing 'Now is the winter of discontent ....'? Or does Robert Hardy give his speech on "that ceremony of idols"?
