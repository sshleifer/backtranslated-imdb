This dramatic film set in Chicago in the early 1960s, we follow a group of high school friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two main characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these guys have a promising future. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student and Cochise has just received a basketball scholarship. When they don't go around to the local club to play dice with their friends, hang out with friends or chase girls, skip school, drive trains to Chicago, or go to neighborhoods on weekends. /> <br /> Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and going for a ride on a stolen car. The police chase them and are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of an interested teacher (Garrett Morris's SNL) they are released. But the two hoods are not, and they swear to take revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking of blaming everything on them. <br /> <br /> This film is very episodic, but it still works because it is what life is like, a series of episodes. Some fun, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all credible and relate. Like Preach who romantically pursues a beautiful girl, or a party that becomes violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, or to deal with a younger brother. But even when a situation is not personally recognizable, like the guys pretending to be plainclothes cops with a money whore to be able to bring all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still exhilarating. <br /> <br /> 'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic 70s sitcom 'What's Happenin!' broadcast on ABC from 1976 to 1979. Although the show is most famous for the Rerun character, it is not in this movie, nor is there a remote character like him. The humor of that show was very broad, but still fun. The humor of 'Cooley High' is more true for life, and therefore more fun. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the soundtrack is wonderful. The classic songs of that period by Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas and Smokey Robinson play during the film, adding to the fun, youthful and exuberant tone of the film.
