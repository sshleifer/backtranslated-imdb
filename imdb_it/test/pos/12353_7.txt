If nothing else, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of the action regarding what was popular over time. I mean, a blaxploitation movie in Louisville, Kentucky ... who wants it?!?! I can only imagine the enthusiasm he must have had to get Pam Grier, a rather spicy object, to act in his photo. If you are familiar with the genus, Girdler's Sheba, Baby does not necessarily move away from the formula. Despite a change of venue, the film is still about a ruthless businessman nicknamed Shark who focuses on loan companies, using henchmen to threaten them in order to get their signatures. <br /> <br /> Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville policeman who works in Chicago and returns home at the request of his father's partner, Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's father, despite Shark's overbearing tactics (.. his man in the city is Pilot, an aspiring gangster, with minions who are not so threatening, rather funny in nature, so thin-skinned take men struck out of town for shoot the building of Shayne Loan), will not leave his company, and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force, leads to his death. Sheba will take revenge on all those responsible for his father's death. In other words, Shark's ass is grass ... can you dig it? <br /> <br /> Seeing Grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular film, the novelty of the Louisville setting is part of the package. You can even see a speedboat chase, Grier in gangster shootings (not necessarily the most polished type you can get used to seeing in Chicago or New York during this blaxploitation period), a lot of blood gushing from a bullet-torn body gunshots and colorful characters (.. like a lousy asshole in a pimp dress called Walker and Pilot who is one of the less scary mobsters you will probably see) who show up during the film, have the misfortune of making contact with Sheba very angry. The plot itself is nothing special, but it's always worth watching Grier, and Girdler orchestrates many action sequences to entertain the target audience. A modest success for Girdler and one of his most successful films.
