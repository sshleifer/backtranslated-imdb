This film is fantastic with some of the best songs preformed by Bon Jovi and kiss. The film is about a man named Chris (Mark Wahlberg) Who is the biggest fan of a band called Steel Dragon. And then when he gets the concert for the lead singer his world changes radically. With great acting of Jennifer Aniston this movie is not to be missed for rock lovers !! <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
