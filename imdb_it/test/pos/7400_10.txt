This is better than the first. The film opens with Sheriff Sam. Then, Sam and Anne pack their bags and head for the Tropicana while Jack makes the tag. <br /> <br /> People get hit, take the glass through the necks, get crushed by the anvils, get stabbed with icicles, dug eyes, explosions in the head, drownings, hangings, lobsters pushed in the face, cut throats, freezing to death, killed by snowballs, his arms are ripped away, melted by anti-freezing, icicles down his neck, hit in the face with pots and pans, fingers that come off, icicles through the mouths, bites on the neck, people exploding, toasted and pushed snowballs in blenders. <br /> <br /> Snowballs are hilarious, they put it in a blender and turn it on, then it says "it was fun" they put a waffle thing in and burn it. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie. Then they start thinking of other ways to kill him, and the snowball responds, "it's not nice" <br /> <br /> So it's worth ten dollars spent to buy this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
