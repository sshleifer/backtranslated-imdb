I'm a big fan of Rupert Everett. I love Kathy Bates so when I saw it available I decided to try it. The synopsis didn't tell you much. In some parts it was foolish, touching and in others some parts were just hysterical. <br /> <br /> Any person who is a big fan of a personality of any kind will find some small identifying traits with the main character. (Of course there are many that won't, but that's the point) <br /> <br /> If you like some of the actors give him a watch, but don't look for anything too dramatic, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I could also mention that you can see how damn high Rupert is. I mean, I knew it was 6'4 ", but it seems even more in this film, even if it seemed a little lowered because of the height of the characters in this: it's high! I mean high !!!! you Rupert the fans there is a bare chested scene ... WONDERFUL!
