I am slowly collecting the films available on DVD of Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both the actress and the director have done a bit of curse in their time - fortunately Mississippi Mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Next to "The Soft Skin", coincidentally with Deneuve's sister (the late Francoise Dorleac), I must be my favorite Truffaut movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Truffaut also wrote the script. Something that always strikes me about Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when he presents a story - it could almost be called naivety. <br /> <br /> There is a scene towards the end of the film in which Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot. The doorbell rings and Deneuve responds wearing a dress. In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street, Deneuve changes into his dress, puts on his best pair of socks and shoes, then lies down on the bed and pretends to be asleep. It's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but this is Truffaut for you. <br /> <br /> Watching Catherine Deneuve in her late 1960s films is truly a sensory pleasure. It is so extraordinarily beautiful that it is almost painful to watch. Incidentally, for those fans, there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this movie - indeed a sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the previous posters. I see nothing of "Hitchcockian" on the film. As for the "look", I love the look of the old movie used in the 60s. Surely it gives the films of this period a unique look. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for Deneuve and Truffaut fans ......
