"What's his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear." <br /> <br /> That gag still makes me, TWENTY YEARS years after the film was released. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie back then and I love it today. I must have seen it a hundred times during the day and when I bought the DVD recently I was able to recall some dialogues. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman imprisoned for a crime has not committed. When she comes out, she decides to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Griffin Dunne (whatever happened to him?), he plays a lawyer for the girlfriend's father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from the prison to the bus station and to make sure he gets on the bus, as part of an alleged new public relations program. An apparently easy task, but there are plenty of complications, some funny dialogues and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until I was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue (therefore only 8/10) incomprehensible to me, on the other hand, I can't imagine myself doing it with his normal voice. <br /> <br /> This film shows the comic side of Madonna (too lacking these days, maybe), and she is genuinely fun in the role. Dunne makes a big breakthrough, while Haviland Morris is perfect as a high-level girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think this is a great film and will sit happily and watch it 100 times more.
