I agree with Australia's comments for the most part. However, it seems that there is a fairly decent plot, if not original. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural property that intends to open a mountain refuge. He reacts with Chip (Bobby Johnston) whom he met when he grew up in there. The plot thickens when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane) because Christina had been James's friend over the past few years, and the implication is that James did something wrong with some way. To add interest to the film Sophia Linn (Monique Parent) a novel novelist appears as a guest at the lodge, as do Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), two lawyers in the city. James torments the local building code inspector on Christina's affairs as one of his dirty tricks to silence her. So the question is: "How far will James go to sabotage the house and will he succeed?" <br /> <br /> Watch Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty Betrayed". It seems to be making a transition from the core business to the "R" world. Another notable is Samantha McConnell, who plays the role of "Bait", clearly the most extravagant name of the character in the movies!
