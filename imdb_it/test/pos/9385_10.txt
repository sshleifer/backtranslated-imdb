This is really one of the best low budget movies, B I've ever seen. I'm not one who gets up and cheers during a movie, but this was worth it. Obviously the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well ... eat is a subjective term, I imagine, actually it secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into themselves and dissolves them in its acidity goodness. The best part of this film is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man actually started his career with this film ... and an afro. There is a lot of nudity in this film, so obviously not for children, but this should not discourage anyone from seeing this movie. I think everyone needs some Death Bed in their lives, at some point or another, it's best to do it as soon as possible.
