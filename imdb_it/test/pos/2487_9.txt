Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the dissidents of the nation (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) were collected and tried by a court and then gave the possibility to choose the prison or to direct the course of Punishment Park. It is a grueling 52-mile journey across the desert to an American flag, with the police, the National Guard and various other authority figures being chased. The idea is that, if you do it at the flag, you are released. The court is composed of a group of conservative types, who condemn any behavior that is not like theirs, and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of "Punishment Park" for someone of those on trial. There are many things that still sound real today, which is quite disturbing in itself. The people who run the course are promised halfway water, which is not true, and the officials they pursue are mostly a sadistic group that has just come out for some shooting practice. This is not a very graphic film, but it is more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. The scary thing is that it could happen. It is not a very optimistic film, but it is certainly worth seeing. Warning: it could make you angry. 9 out of 10.
