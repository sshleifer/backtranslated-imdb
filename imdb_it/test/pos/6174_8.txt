I lost it in the cinema and rented it on DVD. If I had the chance I would recommend it because it's better than almost everything I've seen in the cinema or on DVD this year. This is not one of the best films of all time or anything else, it's just that I've seen a lot of garbage :) <br /> <br /> I can't really add to what has already been said except for 8/10
