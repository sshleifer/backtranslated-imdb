I just saw this, a short short film by Harold Lloyd presenting his "glasses" character on Kino Video's DVD of "The Harold Lloyd Collection". He is actually a cheater with Snub Pollard as his partner who is discovered by Bebe Daniels who performs in fake seances. What he finds is that Lloyd and Pollard make fun of many customers by dropping "lost" fake rings. I will stop there and just say it was pretty funny, especially when Harold and Snub enter the place where Bebe works and meet some creepy creepy and wear costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's clothes. Not too slapstick but what's there was also quite funny. So on that note, do I recommend Are Crooks Dishonest?
