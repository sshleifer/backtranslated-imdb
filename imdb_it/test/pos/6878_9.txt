"House Calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they used to create them". It is played by Walter Matthau (in one of his best roles) as a newly widowed doctor who comes out again in the dating scene and hits paydirt as he seems to have a different woman every night. He then meets the Glenda Jackson hospital patient and soon develops a relationship with her. But he is one who will be severely tested as she informs him that she is a lonely woman and expects him to be a man of a woman. <br /> <br /> This is a sweet and very funny film that also sees Art Carney as administrator of the senile hospital and Richard Benjamin as a friend and colleague of Matthau. Don't miss out on Matthau fans or fans of light comedy. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
