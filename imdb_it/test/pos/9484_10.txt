After watching this DVD, I stayed on the ground. It's so wonderful. Not only does it capture Led Zeppelins during convent performances, they extend for a few years. This shows only the growth of the band and the growth of their BIG music. This DVD is a MUST HAVE! The DVD has a duration of over 5 hours, with extras. The extras are also great pieces, some are from the band performing in Denmark, and various other promotional spots. This contains a film that had once been thought lost, fortunately recovered and carefully restored on 5.1 Dolby Digital, under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page himself! Includes many timeless classics, such as Stairway To Heaven, Going To California, What Is And What Be Never Be, Moby Dick, and many others. Great acoustic songs are also included. This will correct any foresight that Jimmy Page is not a supreme guitar legend!
