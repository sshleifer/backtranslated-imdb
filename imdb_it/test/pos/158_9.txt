The first time <br /> <br /> I discovered that this film was beautifully made. The cinematography was well above excellent. I thought that almost any frame could be frozen, and you would have a great photograph. The use of color stands out more. In many cases the camera slipped through the scene and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> The management of Park Chan Wook was fantastic. It made me believe firmly in his unlikely universe. There were several touches of verbal and visual (of a dark nature) humor that added another depth to the image as a whole. <br /> <br /> Acting would not call it exceptional but it suited the film well and worked well enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place this film was missing was in history. Sometimes, I won't lie, the passages between the characters didn't make sense. Sometimes the flow of history was awkward. Overall, I was disappointed with the subdued narrative, and felt that it ran a little too long. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this film, for its vision, its visual splendor, its dark humor, and at the end of the day, it is an interesting though imperfect film. 9/10
