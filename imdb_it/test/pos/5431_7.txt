This was an interesting film ... a half-comic and political half thriller. It had many good elements, even if it was a little predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show where he gives a political commentary. Think of the Daily Show with John Stuart. During the recording of one of his shows, a woman in the audience tells him that he should stand as president. This, followed by some jokes taken seriously, was all that was needed to get the ball rolling and to start Dobbs' political career. <br /> <br /> He leads independently and opposes Democrats and Republicans alike. He is direct and honest and becomes more and more popular - but maybe not popular enough to really win. He is clearly the loser in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much faster and easier for ordinary people - but there is a technical problem. The problem was discovered by a young woman named Elanor (Linnley) who was appeased by the software developer with a lie that solved the problem before the next election. <br /> <br /> Election day arrives, and here Dobbs is declared the winner. (Big surprise!) Elanor knows he is not really the president - he did not win legitimately - He decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. His company came to poison her to silence her. In addition to that, he immediately takes a liking to Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The plot takes some twists before reaching the slightly predictable conclusion. But it never became boring. Robin was great as usual and Christopher Walken often stole the show as manager of Dobbs, who became a political consultant and best friend. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie and has a good message. I recommend it if you're in the mood for dark satire or something that makes you think. Overall, I give him a 7/10.
