This is one of the most frequently cited L & H shorts as the first "real" L & H team and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who came to the port to greet his nephew Philip, whom he never saw. At first Ollie is laughing at everyone when this strange little man sneaks up and draws a lot of attention to himself by the way he behaves during his medical visit, but he is rather humiliated when he discovers that this is the type that should be a greeting it has been said that Philip is a good boy, but he has a weakness: women. Mumblethunder and Philip have left to go home, but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip who breaks into a little dance whenever he sees a woman, then chases the woman. Crowds of people get together every time it happens, not so much because it chases skirts, but because Philip also wears a skirt (a kilt). Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop for a pair of pants, but Philip also flees from there to chase other skirts. There are many laughs around. It's also nice to see a short like this because the kids aren't exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is practically his usual character, but it is such a joy to see Stan behave so differently from his usual man-child character. Show that he was not a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he had the chance. With a run time of 19 minutes it is short and sweet, providing a classic lining that still has me in place.
