When I was five, it was my favorite TV show. I remembered that it was on channel 11 at 2:00 pm every day. The premise of the show was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of this television program for children. They sang songs and read children's stories. It was done in a study with only 54 episodes that was retransmitted over and over again. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day, I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember those days as pleasant memories and now I hope that today's children can learn to love the simplest things like listening stories, inexpensive props, riding swings and talking to puppets. The set was ideal and simple but it was Carole and Janis who made it worth while. I miss my childhood and those days when the most important thing was to look at the magical garden. Life seemed much simpler and better. Now, I hope children enjoy the show today.
