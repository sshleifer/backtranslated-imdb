This is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy / girl or family. Basically one of those movies that feel good you want to share with your loved ones .... without all the girlie crap you find in many American movies feeling good. This film is light but makes you think and will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Only a very simple but universal storyline. They would think that most people can refer to this film in some way. The characters in the film are fantastic and the actors do a great job of getting you involved in the film. And the film is completed all the time with exhilarating Jewish humor true to life. I saw the movie for the first time last night, and now I want to own it. :)
