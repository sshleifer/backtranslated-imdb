In a previous comment I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie - better the second time. I can't get over that opinion. Strangely, I can't find anyone else who likes it. <br /> <br /> My mother was going to see it, but several friends told her "No way". My sister and her family saw it and half of the theater came out halfway. <br /> <br /> My wife's suggestion is that Australians see characters as ordinary everyday Americans and therefore it's not fun. But hey, most Americans think that all Australians are like Dundee Crocodiles, so it's nice to have the boot on the other foot to change.
