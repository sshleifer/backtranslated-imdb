This film was a fantastic game, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in strange places and enormous energy. The famous director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through cinema get bogged down in fascinating ways while he is almost out of hand from a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images and suggested routes but not followed (exactly what is going on with the grim wife of the pedestrian tourist director?). The ending is so much better to be messy. Realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here. If we turn our imaginative marriages and lives into directors, we should be ready for a wild ride, this film seems to suggest.
