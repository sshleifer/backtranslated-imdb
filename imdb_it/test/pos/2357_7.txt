"The Charge at Feather River" is a routine western on the American cavalry against the Cheyenne Indians ... The film brought a constantly growing tension with some pleasant diversion ... <br /> <br /> Guy Madison and Frank Lovejoy play the officers who save Helen Westcott and Vera Miles from the Indians ... <br /> <br /> The outdoor scenes are well photographed, especially the exciting Indian charge of Feather River at the peak of the film with the rain of spears, the fight for death between Madison and Thunderhawk, the sketches of the Guard Brigade, even a morsel of tobacco juice used against a rattlesnake, and the romantic interludes between our hero and Helen Westcott ... Everyone is here, pictorially fun 3-D and Technicolor ...
