With all the dreck out there, this is a kind movie about young love. Yes, it is true that the love of young people often does more than something they deserve, but why are people not in "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle are models of good behavior compared to them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they run away and create an ideal life, but this is a film, not a real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who was taken badly. In the end, they have sex, but nobody is forced to do it. The film makes children understand that sex can cause children. <br /> <br /> Nudity in movies is one thing. The camera doesn't focus on it, but it's there. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film is likely to be discovered. In "Paul and Michelle", they separate for a while. If you don't like the ending of a movie, think about yourself. The alternative endings are not just for DVDs.
