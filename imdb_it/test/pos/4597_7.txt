As a social satire, Idiocracy is as good as Office Space, but with a wider reach. To criticize this film as too childish because of trivial humor is to not understand the point, I think. There are certainly farting jokes etc., but they are not meant to be fun for the public - they exist to define the state of "culture" in the world of 2500 AD visited by Joe, as a backdrop for the bizarre state of business in which he awakens . The true humor of the film lies in the many gags and attitudes present in this future society which are only a nuance of what we encounter in our daily life and which should serve as a warning. My favorite is the Fox News depiction. The subtle brilliance of the film lies in the fact that it also digs into "intelligent" people and in the average Joes as the protagonists. Look at the times in the film when Joe and Rita almost unconsciously conform to the idiots that surround them, and you realize that the Idiocracy is not created to attract any particular group of people, but to the idiocy in general. I don't know what to say about Fox's "conspiracy theory" behavior in publishing this movie, but if it's not playing in your local theater, ask it. We all need to see this movie, except for social commentary, at least for the farting lines ...
