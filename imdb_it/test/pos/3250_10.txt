I saw Two Hands in Sydney a few years ago and it immediately became one of my favorite movies of all time. Action, adventure, comedy and romance merge into one (and a little zen is inserted forever). Like many Australian films, the plot is easy to follow but wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should rightly feel proud of his work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he was on TV right now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favorite comedy scenes not only from this movie, but also from any movie, had been cut! So if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.
