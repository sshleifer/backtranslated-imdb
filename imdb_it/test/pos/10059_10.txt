Why does everyone feel they have to constantly put down this movie? It's cute and fun (exactly how it should be). Madonna wasn't out to prove herself as an Oscar-winning artist with this movie anyway! He was just doing what the character required, and he did it well. I loved her in this movie; is my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. The soundtrack is also excellent. It's not better or worse than any 80s movie. For all the critics, don't take it seriously and you might enjoy watching it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
