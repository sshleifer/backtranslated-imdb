Some of the reviewers here have stupidly judged this silent film according to today's standards of political correctness. <br /> <br /> "Battle" was an excellent film for several reasons, correctly noted by more rational reviewers: superb cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> His stars were actually the D.W. The Griffith joint stock company and this silent film enthusiast, is a sufficient incentive to watch it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and watched it again on YouTube; it was a poor quality print, but combined with my memory of a good print in a real theater, I can justifiably recommend this to reasonable and historical film people.
