I like this movie. I could be biased because I love dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 year old. the old man will sit down and watch the whole movie ... It's not Oscar-winning material, but certainly fun. Dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean landscapes and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper "flips" pop pop from the water that hits Sandy in the head. It's a fun and fascinating time that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand, the wicked jokes of the overbearing boatman (forget his name) are a bit difficult to take. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: do dolphins really make so much noise? Or is there any serious dubbing going on here? Bottom line: my children like it and continue to recycle through our video recorder.
