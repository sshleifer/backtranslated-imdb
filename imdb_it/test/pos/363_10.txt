This film was fabulous. It's definitely a top 5 hitchcock movie. The filming of the director and the camera is almost impeccable (apart from the dog scene when he licks the boys' hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent could fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> I consider Bruno as a hitchcock to the second most interesting character (obviously the bates are the first). Robert Walker plays a very credible freak. He did not exaggerate with the part that made him credible (more or less like perkins did not exaggerate in his part). Overall this is an excellent film, a must see for all hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
