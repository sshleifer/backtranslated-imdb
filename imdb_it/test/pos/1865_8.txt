I saw this movie on Sept. 19, 2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The Beagles are only in a couple of short flashbacks, all about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was placed in Kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of Origin were already were written and asked whether to complete the book. <br /> <br /> The script is based on the book Annie's Box by Randal Keynes (Annie, the daughter of Charles, who died when she was 10). It's mainly a family drama, but it includes sex scenes - however, the participants are married, both on and off the screen. Not too exciting, not a lot of science but a well-made film that is enjoyable to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons. A bit of a romantic whore, actually. I suppose the conclusion is that you may be a free and independent agnostic scientist from an atheist family background and that he is still an emotional romantic and an excellent father. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin himself claim or wonder if he "killed god" but the viewer is able to doubt it. What is beyond doubt, given the deadly struggle for survival and the network of predations on the shore of the meadow (well known before Darwin and completely incontrovertible) and the failure of Darwin's prayers is that the idea of ​​a gentle god and providential who loves "his" creatures are unsustainable ". <br /> <br /> I don't really see many Americans who oppose it. Some might have problems with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing in the film, or with the fact that Bettany has no horns, a tail and a pitchfork.
