A pleasant, amusing mix of music hall (in the first third in large part) and police procedural mystery while the stories of the various suspects begin to collapse. The final exposure of the murder may come as a surprise if you do not observe it closely. A gritty look at Paris of the time. You can ignore the final scene (the Hollywood finale). Louis Jouvet is the best as a police inspector who seems to be just passing through, but he's really on top of things.
