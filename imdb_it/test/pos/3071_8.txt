I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights in 1994 at the cinema. I went to see it because I always liked Robin Hood and saw the trailer for this movie and thought it was hilarious. After seeing the movie, I have to say that it was even better than I thought. Not only is it a lot of fun, it's also a very well done film with beautiful sets and costumes and a very nice Hummie Mann soundtrack. Even the acting in the film is good, Cary Elwes is as fun as Robin Hood and also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks are fun. But the best part of the film is played by Roger Rees as the evil Rottingham Sheriff. It has the best scenes in the film and even the best dialogues ("King illegal forest on wild pig kill in it is", which stands for "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the forest of the king"). Somehow it mixes up all the words and utters a sentence that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is in my book one of the best films of Mel Brooks to date and I can't say I laughed so much about a film like this. It's just a non-stop laugh.
