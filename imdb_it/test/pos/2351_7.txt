"Hollywood Cavalcade" is a slightly entertaining 1939 film featuring two main roles on the 20th Century Fox roster, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and contains a couple of lines. <br /> <br /> The film is about a type of Max Sennett, Michael Connors (Ameche) who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes it a great silent comic, eventually turning it into more dramatic roles. Become extremely successful with her as her star. Obsessed by his work, he is absolutely shocked when she and her protagonist (Alan Curtis) run away and get married. He is so shocked that he unloads her. She and her husband go and continue to be more and more popular as Connors' studio starts losing money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, he's finished. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to direct his next film. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of footage like Keystone Kop, which is quite fun, and some fantastic slapsticks by Buster Keaton, which is wonderful. The film also has a scene from "The Jazz Singer" when talkies take over. The in-joke, of course, has to do with Rin Tin-Tin, for whom Zanuck wrote. In one scene, Rinny's coach takes him as a potential contract player for Connors' studio. Connors throws them both out of his office. Some scenes later, Rin-Tin-Tin is shown to be the number one box office. The role of the famous German shepherd in this film is played by Rin Tin-Tin, Jr., a father who died in the arms of Jean Harlow in 1932, a month before his 14th birthday. Luck smiled at the end too. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very pretty and does a great job, as does Ameche, which turns into an energetic performance. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin provide excellent support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is not quite sure what it is - history, comedy, romance or drama. However, "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still quite watchable.
