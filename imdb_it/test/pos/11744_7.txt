Based on the 1952 autobiography "A Many-Splendor Thing", "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" (1955) tells the story of Han Suyin, focusing on the love story that Han, a Eurasian doctor widowed in 1949 in Hong Kong had a married American correspondent named Mark Elliott. "I don't want to hear anything, ever," Han says to Mark immediately after meeting, but the two soon develop each other's irresistible mutuals, and who can blame them? Mark is played by William Holden at the peak of his hunky-dude period (the "Picnic" of the following year would be the peak) in this, the first of three films in the next seven years that Holden would have found in China (1960s) The World of Suzie Wong "and" Satan Never Sleeps "from 1962 are the others). And Dr. Han is here played by Jennifer Jones, who, although not an Eurasian (unlike the greedy Nancy Kwan and the beautiful France Nuyen of those other exotic Holden films), does a credible job of passing as one. Regardless of whether he is dressed in cheongsam, European dress, surgical gown or swimsuit (hubba-hubba!), Jones looks ridiculously beautiful here. No wonder the East meets the West in this film so dramatically! With its two captivating protagonists, the breathtaking landscapes of Hong Kong, the wonderful CinemaScopes and colors, the Oscar-winning costumes and the classic Oscar-winning song that spreads throughout the film like an adorable incense, "Love is a very beautiful thing "be quite the winning and romantic blend. Han herself presumably did not worry about the picture, so I can only imagine that great freedoms were taken with her starting material. Anyway, I liked it. And if the end of the film brings a tear to the eyes, just remember the words of wisdom of Mark: "The greatest tragedy of life is not to be loved".
