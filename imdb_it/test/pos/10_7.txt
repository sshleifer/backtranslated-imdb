If you had asked me how the movie was for the whole movie, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theater unfulfilled. After thinking a bit about it, I think the problem was the rhythm of the finale. I feel that most of the film has moved slowly, and the ending has developed very quickly. So I would say that the ending left me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both played their roles very well. Yup! Ashton Kutcher can act! Moreover, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Also, I thought the different plot lines were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: good characters, great plot, poorly written / modified end. Anyway, go see it !!!
