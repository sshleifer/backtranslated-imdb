Jeff Garlin's film is full of heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his on-screen character is hilarious; but in addition we can see both the heat and a sense of emotional vulnerability that make history universal. While the film tells about his character's love dreams, success and weight loss, anyone who dreams of a better life will enjoy it. The supporting cast brings to the screen the frustrations and joys of his life in fun and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again, once life has disappointed us, are all themes. The use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this film. Any fan of Jeff Garlin's TV shows must see it!
