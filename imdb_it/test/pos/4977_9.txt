This is the classic western. The good, Glenn Ford, the unleashed hero, the former soldier, the man who wouldn't hold a gun. In the end he must defend the evil baron of the earth, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants everything. Then there is Barbara Stanwyck, the true housekeeper of the roost. Edward G. Robinson's wife, who will not let anyone get in her way, making Edward G. Robinson look weak too. It is so evil that all others pale next to its blind ambition and ruthlessness to govern the valley and all those who live there. The glow in his eyes when he sees people facing death for her is unnerving. It is worth the wait. In a young Brian Keith and a few others you have a drama that stands alone. With the necessary loopholes, shootings, ambushes and close-ups of busy cowboys and you have a hell of a western. Without giving anything, there are enough twists inside to make this not just a normal shoot-em cowboy -on it.
