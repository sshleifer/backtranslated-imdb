I bet you watch this movie 4 or 5 times a year, and I'll do it more often now that Hollyweird's magnates have thought of putting it on DVD, because it's a classic with a capital "C"! This film is timeless! How can people pay $ 10 nowadays to see the JUNK coming out of Hollyweird with films like THE Egyptian; TEN COMMANDMENTS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; and cable movie channels; I could go on and on, but this film is so big, and for an unknown relative, Edmund Purdom brings the film as Atlas brought the world. The plot is wonderful, the acting is top notch, and the graphics are so powerful in the end, you sit for a few minutes in your place, just trying to make the words sink! Really a movie knockout. I'd give this 15 stars if they would let me! They don't make them that way anymore, but they should !!!!!
