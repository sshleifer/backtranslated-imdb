Well, there's not much to say about this. But it's really good. Excellent work from Softley's directing and the film has a good acting cast. Even the plot of the films is credible and ... hehe good. So the good is the key word in this case. I just hope there are other films of this kind. That's why this stressed in the crowd. I give it 8.5 out of 10
