Just read because this show has been canceled, it hurts quite a lot. This was one of my favorite ones as a child and I always watched it when it came, no matter how many times I saw the episode. Of course, the effects weren't exceptional, but they weren't even horrible. They did a good job with the costume and they had the pleasant atmosphere of the 70s which is always pleasant to see and hear since the music was also very 70s. He actually had no bad guys in the comics, but most of the live comic book adaptations didn't have very few real super villains from the comics. Spidey's powers were a little different here too, he had his sense of Spidey and he could climb walls, but he wasn't as strong as the Comic Spider-Man. He was super strong even though I remember an episode in which he broke into a room breaking the door handle, he was not the car's hurler that could be the comic's one. The show was set in Los Angelos, so there were no buildings for men to go by, but they were fine with the web. It's great that this show actually has web-based shooters and not the organic shooters in the film. I love movies, but a part of me would like to start over and make Spidey's smarter pants that has mechanical shooters. This show had a good star as Peter Parker and was as good as Spider-man, it's nice to see a Spidey who doesn't live in the slums like in the movies. Neither this show nor the film have a spider man who is as fast with the insult as the comic. Still, this show was fun without being as banal as the Batman show.
