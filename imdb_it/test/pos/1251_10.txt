It's so nice to see Bruce Willis get off his throne of action and show us that he's really a talented actor. Shine in this film as the almost forty-year-old image consultant who has completely lost touch with her inner child - until she meets him face to face. This is one of those rare films that does not speak to the public and really offers something for the whole family. It's about taking care of each other, keeping a little child in you and realizing that you don't grow up exactly as you thought you were doing. Willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with children (only witness of "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment), and has a great feeling with Spencer Breslin here. There is beautiful photography and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting. A great movie to watch with EVERY member of your family.
