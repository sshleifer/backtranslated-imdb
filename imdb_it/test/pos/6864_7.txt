Anatomy (Anatomy) is an entertaining and engaging film that cannot offer the discomfort that should be linked to the object of the film. The idea of ​​ethical ignorance in the world of medical science is one that pushes the viewer towards uneasiness, and the realism of institutions ("Heidelberg") and special effects make it a film not easy to watch. <br /> <However, the characters, the script and the brilliance of the film all seem too familiar with the Scream movies that have repopulated this kind of genre. Unfortunately, while the subject is one to worry about, the viewer is presented with another film full of student characters that we are not interested in having to do, unresolved subplots and killings of hammam scenes that have reinvented themselves from the memorable scene opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream several years ago. <br /> <br /> Steven Ruzowillzky makes a reasonable effort for the script and direction, but does not go beyond the general theme. While we are presented with a funny movie with some reasonable performances, we unfortunately stayed with the old feeling: there is nothing wrong with this film, but nothing is extraordinary either. <br /> <br /> A fun and interesting film, a chance to see how foreign filmmakers were influenced by the culture of post-horror horror. 6 out of 10
