This was Charlie Chaplin's first all-round film. Yes, there had been some sound and speech inserted in his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still essentially a silent film. So it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear Chaplin speak in a movie. <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I was enjoying the film, I wasn't as impressed with this as Chaplin's other mid-twenties and thirties. This was because I really felt annoyed by some unbearable Chaplin action when he played Adenoid Hynkel - especially when he was giving his speeches. The stupid pseudo-dialogue only seemed similar to something that a minor comedian would have used (like the Three marmittoni). Furthermore, playing a funny Hitler is hard to accept. <br /> <br /> However, when Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he was not particularly funny (in fact he was not destined to be a funny character) but it was a terrible voice for reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially because it is not really exceptional), but for its excellent acting and humanity. The barber's last speech (impersonating Hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. Watch the movie just for this reason.
