Imaginary Heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24-year-old Dan Harris, is labeled "People are never what they appear to be". Perhaps this is wisely chosen as a marketing ploy; yet, I rented this film despite the tag-line, rather than for this. And I'm glad I did it. I found the move a thorough examination of the tragedy. Personally I found it to be a film about coping with dreams: in particular those that are lost. In the case of a child, the "loss" requires a thorough examination of what he has had, and has not had, in his life. However, the central tragedy of the film, while posing seductive questions in its own right, acts mainly as a background in which different styles of coping are highlighted. I believe the film investigates an important question: how do we face our dreams, particularly where the heroes become imaginary?
