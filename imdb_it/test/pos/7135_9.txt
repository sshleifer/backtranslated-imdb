I had already heard of "game" and "Dungeons and Dragons", but I knew it would be like the one I saw in "Gamers: Dorkness Rising". These guys are so fun and fun to watch. Especially the one who plays the "bardo" or "minstrel" or whatever, has a gift for physical comedy and timing. There is so much background humor and energy in some scenes that really make you think that at least part of it has been improvised on the set. The special effects had to be worked a little bit, but I saw it at a convention last year and this is one of the things they said they were going to do and improve, so it's probably evil now!
