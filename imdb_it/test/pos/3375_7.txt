I will not lie. To say that this film is confused is like saying that the sun is hot, but not really. And if you've seen previous films by cult director Richard Kelly, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales", you know it must mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour in the film, about half the audience was already out. In the end, there were only 15 people left to wonder what the hell they saw. I was the first to understand about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie a generous seven star rating? Because for one, we get spectacular shows (Marsden's great and Langella return as a disturbing familiar character), and above all two, because it's completely original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Frankly, it's the ONLY way - only through Kelly's unique style can this story be told the way it is intended. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're not willing to spend some serious thought in an intelligent film (and even then everything can be useless), you're a long way from it. But if you want to see a deep, rich, complex and stimulating piece of reflection on spirituality, existentialism and the predictability of human nature, go and see this. Get ready for long discussions with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note: if by chance you read this review, I took my recommendation, you actually saw the film and I STILL think I wasted 2 hours of your life, I would be happy to share my opinions on all the meaning and plot of the film. See, that's why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! Difficult as it is, I will try to summarize it by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote from the character of Langella, which explains the meaning of the simple box to an employee: "Your house is a box you live in. The car you drove to work is a box, on wheels. When you come home from work, you sit in front of a box with moving pictures. Look until your mind and soul rot and the box that your body is deteriorates, when you are finally in the box. definitive ... to rest under earth and earth. "
