"River's Edge" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw "Blue Velvet", you know it's saying something. Seen today, he has lost some of his power and remains much better than the overrated "Kids". "Kids" previews have interpreted it as an exposition of the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploitative film based mainly on the shock value. "River's Edge" was promoted as a youth exploitation film, but in reality it was much better. The only time that passes from being disturbing to unpleasant is the constant image of the dead naked body. Outside of this, the film is inspiring and, for all its minor flaws, quite realistic. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves, known for being a particularly wooden performer, gives his best performance as a burnt teenager. Ione Skye is likewise likeable and likeable. Dennis Hopper (in the wake of the return with this, "Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers") offers a great performance as the remnant of the disturbing but pathetic hippie generation. Crispin Glover, while always fun to watch, looks a bit out of place like the maniac and the group leader. The best performance is surely Daniel Roebuck. Like the murderer John, Roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. It is a pity that he did not become a bigger star as a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The film is overall fantastic and bold. Don't confuse it with another John Hughes film, a high school clich√© like "The Breakfast Club". This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this film are invited to take a look at a 1981 Canadian film entitled "Out of the Blue", directed by Dennis Hopper. It is another outrageously exaggerated examination of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, it may have been an influence on "River's Edge". (7/10)
