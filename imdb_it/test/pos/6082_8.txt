One of the most fascinating and, for me at least, most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's best film "The English Patient" is that, in the mid-1990s, when Hollywood was in the early stages of losing the head for Grandi new projects, a film was created that brought to light very powerful traces of the majestic majesty that produced films like "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956). "The English Patient" contains much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a long running time that looks just long and fascinating characters with past and stories. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient", based on a novel of the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the sense of how it is built. It is a fusion of two stories: the past and the present and everything revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the years of the Second World War. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who was marked for life by a plane crash, and was treated in a church isolated by a single nurse, beautifully interpreted by Juliette Binoche. Apart from the link with the patient who is tormented by a hoarse voice, Binoche gets to know his past when a stranger arrives (Willem Dafoe) and the two men seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> This is just one of two wonderfully elaborate stories that shape this film. The other, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The history of the present mixed with the patient's past and her love story that has tragically changed her life forever. <br /> <br /> To be honest, "The English Patient" is a love story mixed with a radical epic feeling and blends beautifully. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, obsessive, how lovely it was shown on the screen. Usually in love stories, like "Cold Mountain" (2003) by Minghella, romantic elements seem much more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes have elements that tend to be associated more with lust than love, but nevertheless, because it is so well developed and not hurried and not exploited to excess, we can believe that there is a true love between these characters. remembered a lot of "Vertigo" (1958) because the directors and artists convinced us that they were two real human beings who really fell in love. <br /> <br /> The performances around were great. I was particularly fascinated by the performance of Juliette Binoche, who brought the Oscar home for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe to play that kind of cynical and questionable character that is always the quintessence of playing. And of course I can't rule out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their interpretations of two very passionate lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I can't look at. Number one, it's a bit too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are some useless subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research led me to assume that this element of the plot comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly there, but in the film it just seems a little distracted and the relationship between the two characters doesn't fascinate me. I was much more interested in the character of Fiennes and his relationships with his two main actresses. <br /> <br /> However, these two defects are easily forgivable even if they slow things down a bit. Those set aside, "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement of cinema. For me, it was a bit like a crazy mix between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two remarkable and best films, and this effective blend proved to be worth my time. It's a pity that Anthony Minghella left us. Because he was a really gifted filmmaker. This is all the proof someone needs.
