I've seen this movie twice and the theme is invigorating. I have been in the computer for many years and this film inspired me in a technological sense as a new love that has fueled the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of infatuation. A very original idea, a great enticement in the way it keeps you while it tells its story to the minds that need a release from the everyday realities of this life.
