Roy Anderson's film "You, The Living" includes a series of fifty sketches, snapshots and cartoons set in a Swedish city. Some characters are on the screen for a few seconds, while others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn from dreams, nightmares and fantasies of strange but credible characters who inhabit this world. It is a fascinating approach: each of the scenes can be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what is human. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour or so, "You, The Living" is gloriously fun, much of the humor focuses on the members of a brass band, whose musical practice infuriates neighbors in their condominium. The highlight of the comic, however, is provided by a terribly crooked runway for dinner.After this hilarious introduction, however, the atmosphere of the film darkens considerably.The dream of dinner feast becomes gloomy when the unfortunate protagonist is put on trial for his life, creating a mixture of absurdity and desperation for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the subsequent scenes, the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes more and more evident Their is a world in which people are not able to connect to each other, where talking about dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no person can be comforted, even when others try to help them. The woman discouraged with rit ornello "nobody loves me" and the girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist, Micke, are archetypal characters. <br /> <br /> The world of "You, The Living" is also ruined by selfishness. An elderly professor is called away from the heat of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous son of extirpating money; a thief steals a ruthless executive's wallet; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his punishment. In the saddest moment of the film, a woman in church tells the long list of human sins while her fellow parishioners mix at closing time. <br /> <br /> Yet, for all the dark moments in this film, the shared refrain of "Tomorrow is another day" indicates the ability of people to continue living despite many miseries. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson (of ABBA fame) seems initially unjustifiably jovial, but it makes more and more sense when the film realizes this human ability to persevere. <br /> <br /> 'You, The Living' has an extraordinary style. The same faded, pale green colors recur everywhere, and there is no shadow in sight; this makes the characters exceptionally pale and creates the feeling that human life is laid bare to be examined. Almost all the scenes are captured in a static frame, as if they were photographs taken in life. The few occasions when the camera moves are all the more extraordinary; the contrast between life and the movement of the great banquet creates a surprising contrast to the death of the wardrobe scene. In the most intense moments of desire and despair, do the characters pierce the viewer directly in front of the camera ?? they know that they have been examined and have some time to pour their hearts towards us, the spectators. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful human film.
