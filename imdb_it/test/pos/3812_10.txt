Let's start from this point: this is not a film for the general public. Absurdly bizarre, in some way incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it simply keeps you speechless looking at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next. If this in itself doesn't agree, it's an excellent film, so go back to your "family" movies and forget about MOTORAMA. It has a material to be considered a cult film, it can be placed in the same category with films that win prizes at Cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately, Hollywood lets it fall by the wayside, simply because it is not commercial. The performance by young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be an Oscar material, but it gives the right touch to the story. Also the genus is difficult to describe; it's not a comedy in the true sense of the word, you don't know if you should laugh at the strange situations in which Gus gets involved. It's more like an impossible adventure that some children might want to have, but don't let them even look at it ... it's not a children's movie. So, if you like Disney movies or are looking for a "Home Alone" style, this is definitely not for you. But if you like reading Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton, then you will like Motorama. So jump into your red Mustang, get a tattoo with "Tora" and cruise Strangeland with Gus. I would like...
