Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this fun and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her non-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and runs away in her car, not knowing that there is a large amount of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the killers who follow her. <br /> <br /> What Betty is pursuing, as well as a new beginning (even if he can't remember the old life) is his beloved Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David is not real, he is a soap opera character on the show "A Reason To Love" and he is really a selfish actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> To say more about what is developing would be too much, but Nurse Betty is certainly original. His assassins are, like the murderers of Pulp Fiction, violent yet philosophical, his interpretation of soap opera is a wonderful spoof material and his acting is the best feature of all. This must be one of the best cast films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty, with the constant glow in her eyes that drives her in her quest. Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at his best comic as the useless actor / soap opera doctor. There are also great support performances by actors such as the Allmy Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier agent Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). In fact, the supporting cast is Who is Who of the best television actors. <br /> <br /> A unique film that is fun for a moment and chilling the next, Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting, casting and a terrific screenplay film.
