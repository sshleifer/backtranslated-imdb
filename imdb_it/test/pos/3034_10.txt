Coming in the wake of the 1970s "Blackploitation" era, CONRACK (20th Century-Fox, 1974) offered the public a sort of low-profile, sincere and daily drama. Offer a very different fair to its audience (which was much more general than those "Gansta" gestures); be a real dose of realism that offered a solitary counterbalance to those shooters. <br /> <br /> REPLACING main characters who were bad detectives, super-flies and mega / mack / pimp (Take your choice in terminological terms), he was a solitary, humble and gentle teacher. The academic we are talking about is the main character, Pat Conroy; who is the only lone teacher hired to take responsibility for some kind of one-hour old school on an island off the coast of South Carolina. <br /> <br /> "CONRACK" (Jon Voight) , the name that young people call finds the conditions in the school terribly backward. In addition to the physical properties of this "small red school", any systematic and progressively graduated education system was completely absent. <br /> <br /> OH yes, by the way, we mentioned that further complications to any successful educational firm manifested themselves in two incontrovertible facts. Those were that Pat Conroy was both a stranger and white; with almost the entire population of this offshore cay it was black and very poor. <br /> <br /> PERPETING these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local education council; being the principal of the school, Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and the superintendent, Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronyn). Between the two, we are made to understand that the teacher, being the low man on the totem pole, is in many ways powerless to influence any kind of significant and lasting improvements. <br /> <br /> BUT you say to a "young Turk", like Pat Conroy, who can't. (He can do nothing, this is). "Conrack" spends a year of unorthodox class performances and is making real progress; but alas, the strong-headed teacher will not yield and will recognize the authority of his superiors. While he is, by law and without his knowledge, at the service of your pleasure; disobeys Mr. Skeffington's specific order and the ban on bringing his class children to South Carolina mainland on Halloween for some trick or treatment; even going to the brazen act of stopping with them in Skeffington's residence. <br /> <br /> NEXT we see a messenger from Western Union Telegram singing happily as he crosses the Carolina mainland to the island; where he delivers the telegram to Conroy who bore the news of his dismissal from his position with that school and district. <br /> <br /> DON'T be one to take your lay-off dismissal, the Pat files against Mr. Skeffington, Principal Scott and the Education Commission protest against dismissal as illegitimate. In an impartial examination of both the "crime" and the law, the Judge asks Skeffington if there are minor penalties that could be replaced by Conroy's separation from the school system; to which it receives a negative response. Appropriately, the judge rejects the dress with the hammer that beats while he says "It's very simple!" <br /> <br /> The story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion while Conrack's students see it leave for the landed launch, while a phonograph record gives us the fifth SYMPHONY of BEETHOVEN; who had played an important role in Conroy's educational agenda, as well as our history. <br /> <br /> IN THE HUMIBLE opinion of this writer, the story (which we believe was at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the main character the name of its author), was much more than a story of a localized happening . For me and for me, Schultz and myself; this is a kind of representation of a microcosm that represents the deplorable general conditions that permeate government schools throughout the nation. (Just an opinion) <br /> <br /> AS TO THIS movie, it was just one of the many films that depict the shops of ordinary people; leading their lives of "quiet desperation" in the great hinterland of the country, which are located outside the DC Beltway and the urban centers of business and communication located on the Atlantic or Pacific coasts. <br /> <br /> IN OWN small, this is a good film, which will soon join the wheels of the 20th Century-Fox film with such great works as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both are from TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> WATCH if you haven't done it yet. Recommended both by Schulz and his friend. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Because, it's me, of course! <br /> <br /> POOL SCHNITZ !!
