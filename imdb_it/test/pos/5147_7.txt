This surreal and absurd film is the first film I saw of Swedish cult director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who has made his living shooting commercials, directing only four feature films in the last forty years. This background shows: the film looks like a collection of fifty 2-minute commercials. There is no story that links these cartoons, although some characters appear in more than one cartoon (there is a theme all around them, though: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the film's mannerisms (since the actors appear in a light white makeup) are more irritating than enlightening. Some sketches are very little (isn't a man sure in which queue to stand?). Other scenes are better, though. The best is the story of the rock chick who dreams of going on a honeymoon with her rock guitarist on a house that turns into something like a train (you have to watch it for it). A film that is worth seeing, even if the comparisons of some film critics with directors like Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki seem exaggerated: Andersson lacks the vision and the lack of a story that interconnects the cartoons is fatal for claiming to a masterpiece film.
