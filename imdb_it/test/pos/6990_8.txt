This was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks !!! The action will be non-stop and I just bought the special edition DVD with the animated background story similar to the Animatrix. This will make Vin Diesel into the spotlight again and hopefully get him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. It would be the logical choice for the role. Back to PB this film even if it is an independent thriller, it has a great story and characters with screaming backgrounds so you want to learn more. If they were to make books or comics, it would be a great read. There was one thing I felt was a little under-done. The finale required a bit of work but not all films will have the best ending.
