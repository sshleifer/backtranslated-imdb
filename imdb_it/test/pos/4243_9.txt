Chucky's bride starts late at night while agent Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the rehearsal room of her police station and among all the horror films in props she jokes about the remains of the Chucky doll that the serial killer Charles Lee Ray owned in the original Child's Play (1988). Guide the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) hits Bailey's throat and puts the remains back in her trailer. There Tiffany embroiders and covers Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) again together and uses a "voodoo for dummies" book to bring him back to the murderous life. The thing is not as Tiffany had hoped and Chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she blocks it in a game pen where Chucky is less than happy. While Tiffany takes a bath, Chucky runs away, strikes her and uses that book to bring her back to life in the form of a female doll dressed as a bride. Neither of them wants to be stuck in plastic bodies and has to work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey where Ray's natural body was buried with the amulet needed to bring their spirit back into human bodies. The bodies of neighboring Jesse (Nick Stabile) of Tiffany and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), both fleeing from corrupt uncle police chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), will be fine ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Ronny Yu, I adore Bride of Chucky. The script by Don Mancini is very funny, very fast, very funny and contains many other horror films with a good affection. From the opening sequence in which we see the hockey mask by Jason Voorhees from the Friday 13 films, the Freddy Krueger shaving glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series and the Michael Myers mask from the Halloween series. To the clips used by Bride of Frankenstein (1935) when virtually recreating the same scene. Chucky's bride never takes herself seriously, which is equally valid, there are many linings, self-referential gags that Scream (1996) made in fashion a few years earlier and does not seem afraid to make fun of himself and the horror genre in general. I love the scene when Jesse and Jade make a chattering romantic conversation that Chucky hears and makes funny comments and contemptuous gestures everywhere. This does not mean that there is not a damn good film there too, because there certainly are. The director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and a true sense of fun, both the human and the plastic characters are nice and brilliant given that each couple suffers from its own series of internal problems that the trail of corpses they are leaving behind would obviously cause. Technically, Bride of Chucky is great for the most part and has a big budget and about $ 25,000,000 I should hope for. The only thing I will say is that some of Kevin Yagher's puppet effects are a bit stiff and unconvincing, I don't even remember Bride of Chucky's CGI scenes. Fortunately, the film does not neglect the blood and blood with a beautiful cut throat, nails blasted in the face of someone supposedly a tribute to Hellraiser (1987), people impaled on shards of glass, someone who is dispossessed by a huge truck, robbed lip piercings and various stabs and gunshots. The acting is pretty good and Dourif, since Chucky is a lot of fun while he makes the liners come out. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and I find it very sexy when wearing all that fetish outfit, can't I be the only one for sure? I personally think that Bride of Chucky is a fantastic film, total entertainment from beginning to end, great humor and horror in equal measure and in just 85 minutes it never becomes boring or boring. One of my favorites, watch it as soon as possible!
