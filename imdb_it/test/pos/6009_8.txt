We all know the fragments of Gulliver's travels. Small people, yes, of course. Liliputians. Even the giants, some of us might remember. Some may remember that the word yahoo comes from here. This was for most people. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is omnipresent in school libraries. This was the first one I read, and there was a lot of people who read it for the last time. It is written treacherously, like many of the old adventure books. Children can read it. Yet it is dripping with satire, black and uncompromising. This is something that I think many writers forget when they adapt this movie. <br /> <br /> This film remembers, however. Our hero, Ted Danson, offers a credible and serious performance as the man adapted to the world who is thrown into mysterious countries like ours. Gulliver's travels criticize everything. Theologians, scientists, government, common people, ethnicity, humanity itself. Few are spared, and most of the satire is just as fresh today. <br /> <br /> Despite being very faithful to the plot, the film also dares to add new angles, all of which work very well. The writer deserves all the credit for being able to balance time and activity so well (it is not boring, that is). <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are far beyond a TV movie. With a little marketing this movie would have worked well at the box office. All of Gulliver's fantastic worlds are well made, explained in detail and often very funny, just like Swift's book. <br /> <br /> The actors are all professionals, as this is a British production. Mary Steenburgen stands out, along with Dr. Bates of James Fox, the cold cruel doctor who, just like Nurse Ratched, wants only the best of the patient. <br /> <br /> So, a modest proposal, if it ever happens to get this movie, do it. It's a real surprise.
