UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly fun. While the plot explodes in perhaps too many directions, creating a film that is too long, it never fails to fascinate and ingratiate itself. The different textures, warmly reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE, offer ample smiles, laughter, wisdom and tenderness. This shouldn't work, and sometimes it definitely goes on, but forgive its inconsistencies, sit back and have fun. He is a charmer!
