Given Christopher Nolan's hit film series, it's a breeze for me to want to check out his filmography by watching his debut film, shot in black and white in England, which lasts less than 70 minutes, done with little budget , but containing all the distinctive features that made him a master director and narrator. <br /> <br /> Although brief, the film is no less compelling with its twisted plot that will let you guess, because the premise does not even scratch the surface of this story, which is rather surprising considering the depth in the structure and in the characterization of the narrative. As mentioned, we follow an aspiring writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who begins a habitual obsession with the following random people whom he imagines on the streets in a voyeuristic way, which at the beginning could be conceived as a search, before he starts to invent its rules and breaks them. <br /> <br /> Meet the charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw) who turns out to be a thief with particular sensitivity and modus operandi, and soon finds himself hooked to go out with him while going to break and enter and speculate on the sustenance of their victim, as well as the search for a blonde femme fatale (Lucy Russell), a moll of a gangster who refuses all his progress. <br /> <br /> Told in a non-linear fashion that comes with scenes that are not added at the beginning, this sets the film for multiple views while you study like Nolan supports that suspense and intrigue you as the audience expects and wants more, which is duly delivered. There are enough twists here that make the film spin in a dizzying vertigo, where the free ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of the star story begins to shine. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising how, first of all, I draw low-cost lines, that something intelligent and sophisticated can be conceived from its experience of being burglarized, with Nolan involved in every stage of production, from writing to shooting, production and directing, having worked on the project for a year, filming can only take place on weekends. I imagine that here is an example of the humble origins of a successful director, who should serve as an inspiration and stimulate new directors out there. Now I will wait patiently for Christopher Nolan's Inception to be released later this year, whose trailer is already such a joke.
