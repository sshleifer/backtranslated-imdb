The magnificent Greta Garbo is in excellent shape in this, her first talkie. He gets excellent support from the rest of the cast which includes Charles Bickford, the sturdy sailor who captures his heart. Ms. Garbo does a great performance as she usually does with the foreign daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years. Also in the cast is the great actress Marie Dressler. A great movie!
