Definitely one of the funniest movies of all time. Excellent original music, intelligent, intoxicating ... it's hard to be articulated on something so beautiful. There is no character you do not like to see immediately - Myronex "Putney, there are problems in the black room!" "My name is Rufus." The lines, thrown to the right and left, are themselves classic, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue is not the punchline variety of the set-up. "Putney, Myronex called you bland!" "My organization is pro-integration ..." "Where is Lopez?" It's in my head "" They don't look brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ... This movie will eat your brain, it's too good. I've read reviews that call this racist film, which couldn't be further from the truth. Every scene is golden, from the ethereal advertising of cereals to the meeting of the Brothers in the black room to that disturbing trumpet in the final scene. One word - brilliant.
