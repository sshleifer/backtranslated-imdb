I was disappointed by the recent American remake (2000) of this English miniseries. Although he followed the plot very closely, he seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original. Not to mention the addition of 'messages' in a low voice heavy preachers ... So my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick to the original. It's much longer, but compelling and totally well done. Interesting, complex and structured, without the presumptuous hypocrisy ... and it is also beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> I find it irritating that these heartless shelters of big overseas films get so much Oscar fanfar. (Although I liked Benicio Del Torro get some well-deserved praise ...)
