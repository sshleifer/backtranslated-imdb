I saw this movie on TV and I loved it! I'm a real fan of the disaster, and this was fantastic. The cast was made of really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He knows how to play comedy and thriller in the same film as few others. The plot is also fantastic. The thought of being able to follow a timeline of what will happen and use this timeline to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea. And this film takes him out in an almost totally believable way.
