This was a "sleeper" for sure !! Much better than I thought! I did not realize that it was a horror movie ..... and who was this magnificent piece of punch with the baritized voice, called Vin Diesel .. by fighting over with spices and intrigues in this otherwise unsupported film ??? The monsters in this movie were quite unusual, not the same version of the mill gobbling the guys !! Even the end was great, for a change, not all "bad guys are bad" !!! I give him 2 thumbs up !!!
