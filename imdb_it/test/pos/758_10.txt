I wasn't sure what to expect from "driving lessons" - I didn't know if Rupert Grint could play this role, but in the first few minutes I was completely conquered. Deep down, the music, the acting and the scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, equally good, gave a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was forced into involuntary jolts, bursts of laughter and joy swelling as Ben freed himself from his mother who controlled and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated, but still one of the best films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend anyone looking for a good British film and an opening night and have fun
