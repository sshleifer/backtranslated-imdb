Don't let reviews (critics, IMDb users or mine) influence you in seeing this movie. I only read the premise of the plot and I was intrigued. After seeing, this film, in my opinion, is certainly worth seeing. It gives a perspective to life that many have probably not contemplated. However, as Leland himself says, it is not a film that "can be enclosed in a beautiful package with a bow and all the rest". Other user reviews on this site claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible. Quite obviously they lost the whole point of the film, which is disappointing. To say the least. <br /> <br /> In short, it is a well acted and well directed film. The story is not pleasant, but I feel that if you don't come out of the movie feeling good, you may have lost something. To characterize it as a "home of art" is unfair, in my opinion, but since our society likes labels, this is probably what fits. If you find out that you know everything there is to know about the world ... I suggest you skip this. If you feel that movies should be a form of escape "from the world" ... you will not find it here. But if you look at it ... you might find something in yourself.
