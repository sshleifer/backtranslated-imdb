What makes this one better than most "movies" is that it doesn't look fake. The film tells the story of the hot-headed director and his rise, fall and ascent, using real names and events recognizable during the silent and primitive sound ages. Instead of the generic business "the sound will put us out of the loop", they actually SHOW Jolson and "The Jazz Singer". The acting is really quite good, with credible performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.
