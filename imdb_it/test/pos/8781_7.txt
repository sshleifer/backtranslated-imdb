Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the run, looking for the real culprit. Hitchcock's familiar theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is well interpreted in this amusing fare that has elements of "The Thirty Nine Steps" and "North by Northwest", although it is not as good as one of those classics. There are some impressive pieces, including the final on the Statue of Liberty. The plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after a formidable start, seems to run out. Cummings is nice if a little stiff in the head. Lane is the blonde, but not the cool variety of the director's later films. Secondary roles are generally well interpreted.
