This is Clive Barker's masterpiece in my opinion. The film has a fantastic plot and some amazing tricks and effects. The only thing I'd like to see happen is a sequel. The film was set for a sequel and with an improved technology the second film could be incredible. David Cronenberg must appear in a sequel as well as Craig Sheffer. But this particular film was a great original idea, creative and fun and I could watch it over and over again. Cronenberg was perfect in this film and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the film.
