I saw this film on TCM last night, with all the exciting expectations, the last time I saw it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, that I had never seen him before, to look at the electrifying long shot, without cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus heading to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that surely precedes the modern Steadicam, the shot retreats and the cranes (the unwanted pun) on the road as it exits the bus, and launches itself between tanks to cross the road. THEN I remember that, without cuts, we follow her close to the fence as she scrutinizes, looking anxiously, but can't find it. But we continue to follow Veronika as she explores the faces of struggling recruits and their emotion-hungry women, all the extras, and each of them is a jewel of compelling Stanislavskian behavior. How, one wonders, Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky organized this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly stopped, and reduced the scene to the apartment, before continuing on to the soldiers and their families at the fence. It seems to me that this film has not only been restored, but also modified. What a downer!
