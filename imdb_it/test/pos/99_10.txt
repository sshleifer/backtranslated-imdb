This film, with all its complexity and subtlety, is one of the most exciting short films I've ever seen. The topics addressed are ugly, cynical and sometimes even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, skilled in its shooting angles and splendid in its style, skillfully recreating the eponymous story written by a storyteller, Tobias Wolff . <br /> <br /> Not wanting to ruin anything in the film, I won't go into details, except to say that this film is magnificent in itself. He is proud of what he does and does it well. Show the most important memories of life, each of which can be overcome by the most elusive feeling: unexpected happiness. This film, of its own accord, created the same feelings in me as the protagonist (Tom Noonan) felt when words transformed his very existence, and this is an impressive undertaking.
