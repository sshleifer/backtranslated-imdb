The great James Cagney, full of great letters, does not appear until the second part of the film, and probably has less time on the screen than Dudley Digges, who plays the potentate of the eee-vill reform school. But when Jimmy arrives, as deputy commissioner of something to reform the schools of reform, he breaks up the air with his hands and jumps on tiptoe and spits out the dialogue of Warners-First National with all the usual, and expected, brio. The psychology of this ancient crunchy, one of Warner's many efforts to affirm its place as a "socially conscious" study, is not profound: Digges is bad just because the script requires it, and there is the strange idea that the young man criminals will turn into smart children if they have just gotten a bit of autonomy. But it is done in that free and fast style to which the studio has specialized, and it never gets boring. Frankie Darro, who entered all kinds of screen problems during a brief term as Warner's Rotten Street Kid, is an ideal JD - a handsome charismatic man with a pug nose and a look full of hate that could wither 'steel. No child actor today can touch it.
