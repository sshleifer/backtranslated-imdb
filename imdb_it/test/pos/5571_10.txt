I admit that the first time I managed to capture Sci-Fi Prime Sci-Fi was last week, but despite being a big fan of Sliders coming into the experience, Farscape is now easily my favorite among the four shows. . <br /> <br /> Unlike most modern science fiction shows (including, unfortunately, the two new Star Trek series), this show manages to be fun without looking like a forage for MST3K.
