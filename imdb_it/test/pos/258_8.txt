Registered on imdb to say that the film is Love Love and I'm totally confused. It seems to me that someone has confused their titles. "Child plastic demon" what? This wasn't Love Life. A bit expensive for my taste but a fantastic, funny and original film. Above all, we liked the ending that didn't fall into the normal clich√© pit that all Hollywood romantic movies crash and burn. Nine out of ten.
