I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was happy to see that they finished with Comanche moon. I was a longtime fan of Steve Zahn and was anxious to see him in a serious role. I personally think that Steve Zahn did an extraordinary job in recreating Gus. I can't think of another actor who would have been better. He has the voice, the mannerisms, the pronunciation of the word, all in one T. Sure, nobody could ever hold a candle for Robert Duvall like Gus, but I think Steve Zahn did a really damn good job. Karl Urban behaves the same way in all the films he has been in, so he made a good pairing with Woodrow Call. As for the movie itself, yes it's a bit trivial, but can you really beat Lonesome Where? No, I don't think so.
