If it were possible to assign a 10+ .... this would be the only film I would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember capturing this movie on TV many, many years ago - and luckily I was prepared enough for video. Now my video copy is getting old, video technology is obsolete and I'm starting to fear that I might not enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer. <br /> <br /> As a wildlife film it is superb. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, he overcomes anything that was projected before or after. How can the film industry allow a classic of the genre to go unnoticed and forgotten? If there is such a thing as a lobby / lobby group to push for the re-release of this movie, count me and send me the details ready. <br /> <br /> My guess is that there is a tick to make anyone able to read this in today's market.
