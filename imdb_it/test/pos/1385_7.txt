"The Planet" is an incredible piece of film making. For a mere Â£ 8000, Stirton Production has long produced one of the most original science fiction films. <br /> <br /> Interpreted by the intimidating Mike Mitchell, the film is a mix of great special effects, strong narration and well-planned action. From the spatial opening battle to the pounding finale, everything about this film appears well above its budget. <br /> <br /> To start with the special effects, while it certainly isn't the standard "Revenge Of The Sith", I'm on level, if not above, similar to Babylon 5 and Farscape. And also for a price hit. The detail and movement are superb and capture the imagination from the outside. The design of everything, ships, weapons, entities is second to none. The imagination and creativity involved are a real surprise for a film of this budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the strength of the story and the arc it takes. There are some twists and turns, many of which are well written in the script, surprising and well interpreted. I was surprised that, after two years of realization and first imagined 15 years ago, how relevant some aspects of history were for today's society. With events around the world, there may be some resonance with the lengths in which mercenaries are forced to go to survive. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects are exact, as is the atmospheric music. The use of light and costume add further professional aspect. Balmedie beach in Aberdeen looks like a desolate and lonely place. <br /> <br /> In all honesty this film seems 10, if not 100, times the budget spent, and this is the testament of a group of creative and hard-working people, from the director, to the cast, to the effects through the producer and sound team. A wonderful effort, I suggest you put a copy on ASAP
