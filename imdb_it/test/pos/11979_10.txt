This film deserves the 10 I'm giving. <br /> <br /> But it's not the 10th you would give to films like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas" or "Psycho". This is the type of 10 you give to a movie that just makes you laugh, over and over again! It is the most horribly written and direct film, yet it never fails to entertain. It has the most amateur effects, yet you have fun at any time! I saw this movie on TV today and I didn't want to leave! Read the following dialogue to find out why! <br /> <br /> (All college is around Manisha, who has just suffered an attempted rape and the rape kids are asking for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad Guy 1: Forgive us! <br /> <br /> Bad guy 2: Yes, we won't do it again. <br /> <br /> (No response from Manisha) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come on, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Manisha: I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You're a beautiful woman, and even the dead can be excited by you! And these are young live males! Don't blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yeah Manisha .. <br /> <br /> Manisha (To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend ??? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I'd like to break his hands and legs and kill them. But nevertheless, forgive them .. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yes, if you do not forgive them, then it will be as if you were too arrogant for your beauty! <br /> <br /> Now it is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! This film never fails to entertain, especially because there are so many jokes and unrealistic situations! The villain (Munish) can do almost anything. He can blow a sandstorm out of his mouth, or he can take a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again. <br /> <br /> Each actor approaches to speak ... A line from Akshay, then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It is the main rule followed by the director, so as to give each boy the equivalent time for the screen. And then there's the all-powerful pendant, which can make even an accelerating car go through you without you being hurt! All these things make it a funny movie, and I can watch it over and over again. I think this movie can go into the celebrity comedy if there is one .. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that he wasn't trying to be funny.
