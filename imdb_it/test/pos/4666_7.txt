* NOTICE SPOILER !! PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SHOOT THE FILM !! * <br /> <br /> I originally thought I saw this movie last weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So my friend and I made plans to see him after school today. Boy, we're glad we did. The film begins in Italy, with a shot programmed with a group of boys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you will have the nickname later], Rob handsome [Jason Statham], left ear [Mos Deaf], and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a robbery to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the entire opening, which lasts 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a chase on the boat, which opens the film to the right. While fleeing into the van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold and kills John Bridger, who is practically the group's (retired) leader. Quickly about a year later, where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), daughter of John, is one of the top safe crackers anyone can ask. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for his father's death while calling him to retire from the robbery) says they found Steve (who hid) and wanted to come back to him for what he did. At first he declines, but later accepts, and the team gets back together, together with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to execute the perfect shot, while creating one of the biggest traffic jams in the history of Los Angeles. This film is a perfect mix of action with funny pieces in all. There's a joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, the Napster creation, and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only respond if he is listed as "Napster". There is also a funny joke in the Seth movie, which reads "He said in an interview that he called him Napster because he described his hair as if it were a diaper. He called it because * I * was taking a nap when he stole it! " The start and end sequences are pure genius and everything in the middle fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the film is that the acting of Edward Norton was a bit weak. He was not a big bad boy. He acted like he was paid and doing only the bare minimum (which is a fact, given that he was forced to make this film due to contractual obligations). But even if the problem is the only real problem in the film, the film is still a lot of fun and I highly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the movie, go see Seth Green shine in the comic role. He is perfect. Rating: **** on *****
