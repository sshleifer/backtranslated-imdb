Many people give this movie a lot of shit, and this is really undeserved. People give this film some difficulties because it is such a sickly topic or they complain about some technical aspects of the film that no one else sees when they look at it. If, looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you feel uncomfortable ... DO NOT WATCH IT! However, you would miss yourself in one of the best cinematic experiences of the late 90s, despite what others say. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy, the depth of the madness he scours to interpret this character must be beyond words, and is much further than anyone of us should be willing to go. The acting here is wonderful. The film itself has filmed beautifully. The subject may be a little excessive for many to swallow, but it is still worth it. If you haven't seen this movie, take a look.
