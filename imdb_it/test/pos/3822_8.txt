Ah the external limits. I love this show. It was incredibly disturbing or mysterious. I loved all kinds of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching it after it was canceled, when science fiction showed it as re-runs, or played marathons. It was a really nice show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything, but I remember that every time I saw the screen, I went crazy and the voice on TV said: "There is nothing wrong with your television. adjust the image "I would like to scream with joy. It was a good show, and I enjoy watching it if it happens. I give him a healthy 8 out of 10.
