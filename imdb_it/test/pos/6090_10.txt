I like this movie above all others. It is "multi-layer"; there is so much to see and appreciate. Every vision brings a new appreciation of the plot, the plot and the characters. He acted impeccably and extremely pleasant if you take the time to look at it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the atmosphere of the period. Ralph Fiennes is a perfect cast as the sheaf lover and Geoffrey, the offended husband, is beautifully undervalued by Colin Firth. The sandstorm scene in which Catherine and El-masy are discussing the different types of sandstorms is one of the highlights of the film and where the story really begins. The other relationship between Hanna and El-masy is yet another "level" of the film that is totally enchanting (and heartbreaking). A worthy winner of many awards.
