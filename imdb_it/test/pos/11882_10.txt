This film would have worked much better if this was the first Critters movie, this is a low budget movie with only two (2) Critters shown on the screen. Because this seems like a failure is because this is the last Critters film and it is so low budget that it seems that the director has made the whole film with his own pocket money. However, I liked this movie, I mostly compare it to the third film (which was bad). The Critters 4 have a more serious tone, the first half of the film (even without seeing a Critter yet) you have a frightening feeling watching it, too bad that they haven't "chewed" the Critters, I mean even if they only have two (2) puppets they could still use them on the screen much more. The Critters also has several deaths in this film that made it a bit special, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and it is different in this film that took me by surprise. Finally I liked this because it also has some sort of conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see Critters 5 anymore. Oh, one last thing, I lost a scene in this movie, we never saw a Critter shoot a peak from his shoulders , maybe these puppets didn't have this feature, but I was very disappointed not seeing it (in Critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting, which was the only good thing I liked about that movie).
