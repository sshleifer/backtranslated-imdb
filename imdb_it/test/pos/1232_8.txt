This film, for what it was intended, was successful. It's a short tragic film. Although my choice of films is one that really develops the characters and their relationships, this film is meant to give a taste, leaving you the "what happens next" factor. After seeing it, I really wanted more, more on the story of the characters, on what influences they had to turn them into people they were. I think this is what the producers thought the viewing public thought. The acting is incredible. There are not many lines in the film, so their body language, facial expressions and overall presence had to be powerful enough to hold a scene. Both Franco and Miner have that element and this show. For them (especially Franco) take the time to do it, of course he says they believed in this movie and wanted to be part of it and for that, I appreciated the film for what it was. I'm happy to own it too, so I can share it with other people who would never have seen it exist.
