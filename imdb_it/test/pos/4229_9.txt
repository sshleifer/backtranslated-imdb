I expected this to be just like the others, try to be scary ... ends up looking silly. Somewhere along the line the writers must have understood it and so they took the film in a totally different direction, basically ignoring the other films. This looks like a different film than the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works by making this the best in the series.
