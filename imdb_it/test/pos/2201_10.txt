I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. Here comment, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. The production was produced by the San Francisco Opera and starring George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 1980s, Hearn replaced Len Cariou with Sweeney (Cariou won the Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony for his portrayal of Mrs. Lovett) playing Sweeney on Broadway. They must have made the film about when I saw the show. Until today, the most moving moment I can remember in the theater occurred when Hearn sang "These are my friends". ("These are my friends, see how they shine." "My arm is complete again!") <br /> <br /> Hearn's performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me he didn't lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him playing the piece on Broadway and later in the movie. What a talent! He is funny, funny and scary - all at once; and he can sing, boy can sing. This reminded me of how great the film is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
