This is my favorite movie by Hal Hartley. All his films are little gems. I love independent films and I hope Hal Hartley never goes out of style or sells. What if the Lord Jesus returned and loved his people so much that they could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers? It was nice to see P. J. Harvey in a film since I was a fan of his music. Don't look at this if you are a fan of Hollywood cookie cutter movies, you will be disappointed.
