Wow. I've never seen or heard of this movie. He has just arrived on TV (2:00) and I am in complete amazement. Preparation: a group of fat-rich cats is playing golf. You beat a ball in the rough. Land from a NINJA !!!! A tuxedo man approaches to catch the ball. The ninja grabs him. He crushes it in his hand. The man pulls the gun. Ninja pulls the gun. Ninja blows the dart into the barrel of the gun. EXPLODE GUN !!!! This is just the beginning of greatness, people. Everyone has to watch this movie. 10 big and fat stars of trust.
