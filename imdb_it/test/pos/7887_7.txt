Unusual film about a man who makes friends with his social opposite for fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with his rude and surly portrait of a rigid "Joe" of the working class in love with the past and fearful of the future and worried about the present. The first half hour of the series presents the film debut of a young Susan Sarrandon in the role of Melissa Compton, a weak and rich girl who lives with her losing boyfriend, full of nude scenes. Her boyfriend is the weak point of the film, a drug addict and misunderstood merchant who meets his death after Sarrandon's overdose. We meet Joe of Boyle in a bar while he spits and complains about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it's easy to see that Norman Lear's TV character from Archie Bunker is based on a cleaned up version of Joe. The comparison is even reflected in Joe's wife, in personal life and pastimes. Joe sneaks into the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for Melissa who has escaped from care and returns to the addicts she calls friends. Their research leads them to an "oar" as Joe calls it, a nudity-free drug-fed love party and surprisingly, so tightly Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe come together. They are robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that foreshadows the bleak and chilling ending for Taxi Driver six years later. Joe is a funny film that at least on the surface is anti-violence and anti-racist. Yet the main character of the film, Joe, becomes the very instrument of the upheaval that he fears when he enters and joins the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses against which he lashes out. So, from this point of view, the film is not a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final outcome really was.
