It opens with your ship too long cliché flying in space. All I could think of at this point was "Spaceballs" and hope there was a sticker on the back that said "We break for Nobody." The film then shows some cryogenic freezers with the narration of Vin Diesel. I always thought his voice sounded strong since I saw Fast and the Furious. Since I found out he was a criminal, I thought the film would be a cliché. Was. It was very cliché and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Black out every 22 years. Fortunate, they land that day. Aliens can only be in darkness, hey is a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too easy and just a cliché, the movie pulled out and kicked the biggest @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it. I really don't see the wait for Chronicles of Riddick.
