1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: "The Gunfighter" by Henry King and "Wagon Master" by John Ford. "The Gunfighter" was historically noteworthy as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's "High Noon" (1951) and later the revisionist Westerns. <br /> <br /> However, personally I find the "Wagon Master" superior to its contemporary counterpart. Ford's little masterpiece has little to do with storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing the conceptions of the old west. Although optimistic and warm, we deserve ingenuity because it is completely devoid of pretentious underlines. The frontier scenario is well used as it perfectly supports the poetic narrative. Add the naturalistic work of the camera and we are transported among the Mormon travelers to witness the western folklore narrated in a cinematographic way.
