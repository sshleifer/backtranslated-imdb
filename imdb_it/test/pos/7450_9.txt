Yes, I am an FF7 fan, but how many people watching this movie will NOT be? And so, I'm reviewing this movie from an FF7 fan perspective, and no regrets. (I don't know how to adequately review the film for someone who hasn't played the FF7 game.) <br /> <br /> Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent Children. It's a sensory pleasure - a complete audio-video overload. The images were breathtaking: some businesses have been accomplished that I simply wouldn't have thought possible with an animated film. When the action scenes were born, they were, for lack of a more accurate word, a roller coaster. With a dramatic camera movement ranging from one wide range to another, to bullet-time effects perfectly integrated at crucial moments, down to the level of detail, it's hard to go wrong. The animation looks like a big budget, the style and the images are fantastic and the effects sometimes made me forget that I was watching the animation rather than the live footage. I could ramble for hours repeating myself about the fantastic quality of the images, but I simply wouldn't do it justice. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices for all the characters did not disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. Music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best soundtrack of the game EVER, magnificently transferred to the film. Most of the memorable themes of the game are present in the film, although they often use different tools to better adapt to what is happening. There was a bit more bold rock and light thrash metal music on the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all suited the movie's situation well at the time. <br /> <br /> Story - 7/10 The story and characters would be the main flaws of the film. Both aspects were simply not up to the game - but again, the game could take more than 40 hours to develop these points: the film has only 90 minutes. As for the plot, the plot was not bad or anything, but simply not as ambitious as expected from someone who played the game. In fact, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate twists and progression of the story / development, that the film never really had the chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the film took the most sensible approach - to expand the action and try to put in so many jokes and themes within it instead of trying to impossibly recreate the factor of history, which was originally a driving force of the game. Even the lack of use of Materia has caused me some controversy: the story of the film has chosen to use little Materia (even if not ZERO), and instead a lot of supernatural skill and fighting skills. I hope that if a sequel were made it would incorporate Materia in a much more extravagant and important way in the film. There were also many holes in the film - all that can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a casual anime, but it seems ridiculous when you realize how it was based on a game that performed tremendously well. <br /> <br /> Characters - 7/10 The characters, although they are all present in one form or another, do not necessarily shine at their true potential. There simply isn't enough time for movies to be spent with all of them. And so, all their basic stories and abilities are not entirely shown, and in some cases, barely entirely (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no lasting impressions). Even Cloud, which is the focal point of the film, I think he doesn't use enough of his familiar skills from the game. The matter matter is a valid reason for this. That being said, it is a joy to see the cast return to action, even if it is in a role that does not make the most of them. The new characters were the ones that caused me most of the conflict - the Bad Guy Trio and the Denzel boy - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it, but objectively the problem is still there to be commented and is therefore a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 The replay value for this movie is excellent - Personally I want to watch it again in a bigger and stronger way - bigger screen, higher volume. <br /> <br /> Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the film's flaws, they simply weren't big enough to hinder my enjoyment, and I honestly think it will be the same for most people. I had a great time with Advent Children and encouraged FF7 fans to see it.
