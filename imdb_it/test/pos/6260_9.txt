`Shadow Magic 'takes back the joy and amazement of the public of the first film. It also shows the power of the film in its ability to bring the world a little closer, overcome cultural barriers and preserve ourselves for the generations that are yet to come. Of course, anyone who truly loves the art of the film will appreciate this film. It's a great first effort by screenwriter / director Ann Hu, which hopefully has a lot of movies to follow.
