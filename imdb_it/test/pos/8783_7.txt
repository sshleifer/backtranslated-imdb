Screenwriters Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and (of all people) Dorothy Parker allow director Alfred Hitchcock to expound on what his favorite film theme might have been: the innocent man, unfairly manipulated for the crime, takes him on the run. Hitchcock, who has some credit for giving rise to the story, will engineer a great deal of suspense in the plot of a warehouse worker blamed for the explosion that killed his best friend; he sets out to find the real culprit. A lot of excitement in style, with usually colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) doing a surprisingly excellent job. Even the eternally pleased Robert Cummings enters the right spirit! *** from ****
