This is an excellent anime film. It is well animated, has an intricate plot and good music. I understand that some may think it's a bit long, but I think it's a good length and the animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE CHARACTERS: <br /> <br /> the way they use Tenkai is masterful. For example the double body that shows in all these positions adds to the disturbing tone of the film. Tenkai's design is also good, the way it looks like a monk and at the end the armor he wears. <br /> <br /> The old Andou is down to earth and a very nice character. When Jiro meets him it is a turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> Sanpei, the Satsuma Shinobi who infiltrated the Tenkais clan, saves Jiros' life twice. However, most of the film remains in the background, but it really is one of the heroes of the film. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: The plot is good. It is traditional without being non-original. The historical time in which it is performed is interesting, The meiji restoration. The treasure is sought after by Tenkai to restore the shogunate while Jiro finds him using it to help the anti-shogunate forces overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> The way the Tenkai Jiro tricks are interesting and has a sort of "Hamlet" feels to it. There is also a sweet irony in the fact that if Tenkai hadn't gotten Jiro to become a shinobi, I don't think he eventually managed to kill him (perhaps with guns, but not with melee combat weapons). <br /> <br /> The plot with all the death makes it mostly very dark, but there are some light moments when we see some of Jiros's childhood memories. All in all it is a good plot, dark and complex. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: The opening theme for example is very good with electric guitar and drums. Occasionally in that piece they use what I believe to be a taiko battery, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good music. Like the one played while traveling to the shinobi Iga. I believe the piece is called "Numatou" and has an incredible flute. The flute could be a pan flute, but more likely a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The final theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The voice is beautiful, as is the song in general. <br /> <br /> ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> The animation, although good, is not perfect and the blood flowing down the characters sometimes seems to be orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very nice. An example of a pleasant transition is when Jiro and the Iga shinobi are running, there is sunset in the background and the music is playing. The transition is simple but effective and also has a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL WORDS: I think the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make it one of the best anime movies I've ever seen.
