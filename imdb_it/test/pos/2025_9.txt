I was very excited to see Rock Star because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised that I liked it more than I thought at the beginning. The script left something to be desired, but the film's performance made up for it. There have been a few moments when the visions of Spinal Tap are back in a hurry, and I can't help but think that this film would have been even better as a documentary. But, I digress. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to show his talent, while credibly playing a normal boy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that make you believe not only in him, but also to make you really interested in his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who hasn't impressed me in the movies to this extent, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend / manager. It shows more real emotions than those I've seen in his latest films put together. <br /> <br /> But above all, it is the music of this film that really attracts you. Peppered with some songs from the 80s (let's face it - Bon Jovi would have all the music fans of the 80s swinging on their seat), the film actually oscillates with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg's performance. <br /> <br /> I'm going to see this movie again, but first of all I'll go in a hurry and buy the soundtrack!
