Long last! Third time lucky. This film has always been in my mind, but I forgot my first vision and captured only the second part of the film. Then only a couple of months later I had my second chance to see it, so I decided to register it. Only to find out that my timer went late and again I lost the first half of the movie. I wasn't going to let it happen again. So when he came back on TV, I thought I'd wait until he turned it on, so I'll record it. And it was a good choice. I just watched the movie, but they always performed around midnight on weekdays. <br /> <br /> After discovering a hole in their crowded cell, nine prisoners flee their isolation to track down the key to the universe, which another prisoner known as the Counterfeit King said he hid. They think this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit banknotes. On this journey, of course, they see this as an opportunity to resume their lives before being judged. Even if things don't go as planned, with most criminal plans out of the way. <br /> <br /> "9 Souls" is a lively spiritual journey by the Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who threw his viewers into a film of two totally different parts. The first half of the story is more like a psychic comedy with criminal ties and situations in which they find themselves to be the strong point, but all this gives way to a second dramatized and moralistic half, in which the real troubles begin some rather unpleasant and bloody moments that replace the goofball tone with which it started. While, the first half is quite fun with her on the road, scribbling fist fight and exaggerated jokes. But it's really the last authentically haunting half with his particular round of events that hit you so hard with some amazing touches that make you really nice to these very human characters. Even if they are not really innocent of their crimes, you are only entrenched by these flesh-and-blood characters in the first half that when you see them fall into their ruin, you know it's an effective drama when you're shocked into the dramatic change. The nine characters get enough time on the screen to really understand their personal history and which weaknesses could eventually bring them down. The way the plot works is that Michiru and Torakichi are the protagonists and we see it mostly from their perspectives. The evasion story is a study of unquestionably engaging character which is clear in its objective and asks you many questions about the society and the path you have chosen to escape life and free yourself from these constraints. <br /> <br /> While symbolic history is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is only a vague atmosphere and trance that is channeled into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to this factor and gave the film a pass was the ample and moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The soft atmospheric gel that he was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the eternal emotions he was able to provoke. Simply beautiful and decidedly powerful control on that front. The rhythm of a film so long (2 hours) seems to be beating me and the editing is fast, because we are so involved in all this. Hypnotic photography is sharp in detail. While the cast's interpretations as a strange group of criminals are of high quality, each of which provides a personality and characteristics sufficient to separate. <br /> <br /> I found "9 Souls" a surreal and rather surprising surreal film that arouses emotions and then slaps you with an all-powerful craving when it changes direction. Highly recommended.
