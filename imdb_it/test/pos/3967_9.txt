Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are incredibly fun to watch. <br /> <br /> (MINOR SPOILERS) As usual, the main character, B, is the healthy one of the group. B has this crazy idea of ​​creating his own college when he is rejected by all the universities he addresses. He is known for making false documents. therefore a letter of acceptance is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Since B's dad is a tough @ $$ and suspicious of this university he has never heard of, B invites his friend Sherman to design a university website. Sherman has been accepted into a large college and is afraid of being arrested for fraud. He is very fast with witty lines but his defect is that he wants to be accepted socially too. <br /> <br /> Glen, Hands and Rory are the three minions who follow B along. Glen has a zero on his SATs and has no thought processes. He continually offers battle kings, but he is very good at making shakes, which somehow get him a lot of sexy girls. Hands was a great football player who did not receive the scholarship he was counting on and dedicated himself to craftsmanship to cover his lack of athletics. Rory was preparing to go to Yale from 1st grade and was not accepted. Spend time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Picture Lewis Black plays himself. If you have no reason to see this movie, then you see it for Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are fantastic. <br /> <br /> Monica is B.'s love interest. Like most of these stories, she is more popular than him and doesn't even notice him until the middle of the movie. Unlike many other stories, B really takes it and keeps it to the end. Monica is actually a good character on her own, but of course it's mainly there for B to worship. <br /> <br /> There are more college support students invented who are fun to watch. The name of A.D.D. it is self explanatory, and fun enough ends in meditation. Kiki is a boiling ex-stripper who falls out of breath for the chance to go to school and eventually becomes a crush on Glen. Maurice is an ex-military fool who got his G.I. Bill and wants to study rock and roll in college. The last guy is only known as Freaky Student, who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. You who have little confidence in him wait until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Naturally the villains are the dean of an opposite university, the president of the student body of his university, the girlfriend of the president and their circle of friends. <br /> <br /> Each character is lovable. I think this film has a good plot and is well done, despite what many people say. Even if you think the general story is predictable, the characters will keep you guessed and make the movie fantastic. Go see this movie. I give it 9 out of 10.
