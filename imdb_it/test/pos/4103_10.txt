It amazes me that production companies are suing because of reproductions that they won't provide. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. You can get all kinds of movies online ... old movies, new movies ... but they all appeal to a particular group. This film is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Perhaps if enough people write, the copyright holder will have a clue. It is time for this to happen. Yes, it's the date, but so is the Wizard of OZ. It does not seem that this should be so difficult. So, for now, I will continue to see those illegal copies on search engines like many others.
