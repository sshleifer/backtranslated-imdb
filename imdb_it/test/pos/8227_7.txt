Ronald Colman plays a prodigal son. Even though he is NOT a bad boy, he is a bit fickle and has not done much with his life except to travel the world and have a good time. Now that his last adventure in Africa has failed, he is returning home to England. His wealthy upper middle class father plans to throw it in his ear, although thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly welcomed with open arms. <br /> <br /> At this point, there are two women in his life- - showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged). How this will work and Ronald will know how to behave as a responsible adult - these are the main themes of this pleasant little film. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie and it certainly won't change your life, but it certainly is a lot of fun and fun. Most of this is due to the always brilliant acting of Ronald Colman. Heck, in the heyday of his career in the 1930s, he could have played on REEFER MADNESS or some other dreck and anyway made it fun and enjoyable thanks to his charming character. His seemingly effortless style in this film makes it very easy to appreciate it and it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the movie! Furthermore, the writing is very witty and makes this a romantic comedy.
