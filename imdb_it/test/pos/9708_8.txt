That's what you expect. It induces laughter, shivering and panting, not necessarily in this order. It's exaggerated. You will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind. "Jackass Number Two" is better than the first; the actors certainly took more risks during the filming of this film. There are many stunts that could have killed the actors, especially Johnny Knoxville. The treatment of the animals was suspect, but apart from that, the film achieved what it was done to achieve. If you like the preview, watch the movie. If you don't, be careful! <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
