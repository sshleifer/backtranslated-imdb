The symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery of the Illuminati before a new scientific experiment makes the city explode. <br /> <br /> The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006, but for the vast majority The followers of Dan Brown did not do his justice for the award winning books and, even though running for 2 and a half hours , they seemed to bore many. <br /> <br /> Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou trying to solve the mystery of the Louvre murder but for Angels and Demons the stairs were raised again as the main star and director return. <br /> <br /> Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to the Da Vinci code for fun reading and it seems that criticism and fans, although not yet fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to 2006 version. <br /> <br /> This image of Howard certainly has an energy and a more clinical exercise unlike Da Vinci, Robert Langdon h of Tom Hanks as just one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and due to time constraints, action and despair increase the stakes and produce an excitement that certainly beats the Da Vinci code but also generates many twists and startling murder sequences. <br /> <br /> The interesting factor of this 2009 release is that the constant elements are justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to deliver a feeling of general power to the situation. <br /> <br /> This really justifies the label of the thriller with a constant tension and a sharp drama with the questions and beliefs have again given a full functioning. <br /> <br /> Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and symbol discoveries that once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is still the key figure to show everyone the light inside and among the controversies of other circumstances pressing. <br /> <br /> It is fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex writer; He certainly likes to capture problems and dramas between his action and the electrifying sequences. In addition to trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, relations with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is again present. All interesting to discover and to listen to, if occasionally debates and dialogues tend to send the mind to the drift but since there is so much in the novel, this has always been probable. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who held a regular franc type of director who rolls into Da Vinci, returns perhaps in the worst possible way. His style of shooting camera and always in motion does nothing to keep the pressure high, and we can never fully accept what is happening on the screen thanks to this style frankly horribly portrayed. It's certainly not Paul Greengrass and this isn't Bourne at all. <br /> <br /> Clear and stylized it is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci
