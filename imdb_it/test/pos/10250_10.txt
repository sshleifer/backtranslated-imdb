This film aroused my interest from the beginning to the end, with lots of laughs and a real acting by the whole cast. Glynn Turman, (Preach Jackson) is the star of the photo who plays the role of an intelligent boy who loves poetry and has a very sexy girl. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs, (Cochise Morris) was an outstanding athlete at Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship at a famous college. There are scenes in this photo with the Chicago police department chasing all these guys in a Cadillac and a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo with a monkey dung being thrown around. The music is exceptional and there is a large photograph in the city of Chicago. Great movie, have fun.
