The original The Man Who Knew Too Much hailed Alfred Hitchcock for the first time outside the UK. Of course, part of the reason for the acclamation is that people marveled at how Hitchcock had such a small budget compared to the sumptuous Hollywood products that could provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot in a studio. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason he chose this among all his films to be redone, Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount) decided to see what the man who knew too much it would have been like a big budget. This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international box office names. This was the third of James Stewart's four Hitchcock films and his only collaboration with Doris Day and his solo film Hitchcock. I wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance it suited the profile of the blond protagonists that Hitchcock preferred. Perhaps because his healthy image on the screen was at odds with the sophistication that Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris plays her best performance on The Man Who Knew Too Much. His best scene is when his doctor James Stewart's husband gives her a sedative before telling her that their son was kidnapped by an English couple who made friends with them in Morocco. Stewart and Day enjoy each other in that scene. But Doris especially when she records four different emotions simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they know the French Daniel Gelin and the English couple, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back in a market in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to Stewart about a murder that will take place at Albert Hall in London. Their child is kidnapped to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> For the one time I can think of a hit song from a Hitchcock movie. In fact, Doris plays a well-known singer who has retired from the stage to become a wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of nine. You couldn't go anywhere without having heard it in 1956, also this year he competed with Elvis Presley. Que Sera Sera won the Oscar for best song by beating titles like True Love by High Society and the title of Around the World in 80 days. She became the soundtrack for Doris Day for the rest of her life and still is if she ever wanted to come back. <br /> <br /> In fact the song was performed quite well in the plot while Doris sings it at an embassy party at the height. <br /> <br /> Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock shot the murder scene in the real Albert Hall and as another reviewer said it's not direct, it's choreographed. You will be hanging in your seats at that time. <br /> <br /> This was a remake that was worth doing.
