A couple of years before SCREAM has spoofed the slasher / horror genre with wise and knowledgeable people who know every trick in the book about what to do and not do in a precarious situation, a small film produced in Russia hit theaters without grandiose claims. <br /> <br /> This film was MUTUAL HEADS. Played by a cast of strangers (except an extremely short cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were supposedly filmed eight years before the shooting of this film), he told the story of a silent makeup artist, Billie, who is working on a film set in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend, Andy. He is not aware of the fact that the set ended when she goes to retrieve her things and inadvertently runs into a porn movie that becomes extremely bloody. Overwhelmed by horror, she warns the killers of her presence, a hunt ensues and in the end she is saved by Andy who brings her home while they alert the police. The problem is ... there is no body, no proof that something like this has taken place. Even so, a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie's side of the story .... <br /> <br /> And to say anything else would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that requires a scrutiny of the most intricate and intelligent thriller because, though it is a twisted thriller, it is a film that pays its shares in films like WAIT UNTIL DARK and Hitchcock's best in his camera cuts, impassive humor, Americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless, and suspense that teases their nails until something seems to be triggered. Even if the plot becomes a bit too implausible due to the fact that the narrative arc suddenly becomes the center of an even greater conspiracy, the film manages not to deceive the public with low-cost shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crash of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a distant shadow. Very clever.
