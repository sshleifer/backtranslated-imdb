This was a great movie. He had a "very good" outburst. Furthermore, there were very intense (dramatic) scenes that could make it inappropriate for the younger ones, under 6 years old. <br /> <br /> For a film under the radar, the acting was rather pleasant and touched in our family room for an almost perfect landing. It caught the attention of our whole family and we were a little sorry to see it finish. <br /> <br /> This film contained elements of espionage for children with young people who saved the situation, but was given a somewhat more credible scenario. The dream scenes were initially a distraction, but they did much to establish the plot. Jokes and hi-jinx were also very funny. <br /> <br /> We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
