Freely based on real events, "River's Edge" is a film, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but nobody does anything for a long time. With the best interpretation of Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting of everyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), who drops a doll from a bridge (murder No. 1). Tim then hears someone screaming, when he looks up he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the river bank with the dead body of his girlfriend behind him (murder No. 2). Samson finally shows his body to his friends. Everyone is horrified, not only because of the murder, but also because the victim, Jamie (Danyi Deats), was their friend. Despite everything, nobody goes to the police. You may think this is unrealistic, but this is what happened in the true story. If you know the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), you will know that the same thing happened there too. Through all this, Layne (Crispin Glover) is working to keep Samson safe, even though no one (including Samson) seems to care about keeping him out of harm's way. Over time we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged elderly man who deals with drugs with local teenagers, also killed a woman earlier (murder No. 3). From here things start to tighten Samson and his friends and in the end everything is revealed, but not in the way one might expect. <br /> <br /> In the film we learn three murders, each with a different reason, a different reaction and a different effect on those involved. When Tim leaves the younger sister's doll off the bridge, we are never made aware of his motives. However, we see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams as her mother comforts her. Later, her older brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helped her put a cross in the courtyard in memory of her doll. Jamie's murder upsets everyone (except Samson who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when Layne asks why he did it, Samson replies, "He was talking about sh * t."), But they don't sobb or scream, they run and continue their lives trying to forget what happened. In Feck's situation, he didn't kill his girlfriend for hatred. We never really know why he killed her, but we see that Feck is not proud of what he did. He even mentions that he is sorry, and that he loved her. From this we see the different ways we can be affected by death. In the film, it's easy for us to identify with teenagers, because they don't know how they feel, or how they should feel about their friend's death. Similarly, we, the public, do not know how to hear ourselves, because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by death and we realize that Samson should be arrested, but we do not feel strongly for Jamie as an individual. <br /> <br /> There are many similarities between "River's Edge" and "Twin Peaks" (1990-1991), especially in the general feeling of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking about "River's Edge" when they were creating their series. After all, Tim Hunter directed three episodes of "Twin Peaks". <br /> <br /> The performance of Crispin Glover as hyperactive and frantic Layne is a performance worthy of the Oscars. Always in a hurry and always worried about preventing Samson from being caught, Layne is an intense character who seems to be at speed. If you've seen Crispin Glover in any movie, you know it can give you a line like no other. It's always a pleasure to see him perform. The other big performance in "River's Edge" is by Dennis Hopper. His portrait of Feck, the drug pusher who has a leg and an inflatable doll that speaks with the name of Elly, reminded me of a more humid and fun version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character in David Lynch's film, "Blue Velvet "" (1986). <br /> <br /> River's Edge is a fantastic film and I think it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic, when in reality we need to intervene and speak against the evils of the world.
