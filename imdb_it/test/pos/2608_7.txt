This is a nice movie with Spanky, Alfalfa and Buckwheat of the "Our Gang" comedies. Set in the south during the civil war, it may seem a little strange to see buckwheat as Spanky's slave, but this film is as fascinating as the best of shorts with the same cast. This was Our Gang's only feature film, and I highly recommend it for the 1994 remake of The Little Rascals.
