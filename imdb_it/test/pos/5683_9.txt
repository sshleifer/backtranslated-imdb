One of the best horror / suspense films I've seen in a long time. Wow, it was a great surprise and surprising how beautiful this film was, sometimes a gem like this will emerge but it's rare. I was expecting a movie of popcorn monsters and a slightly fun way to spend an evening late at night, but instead a well made and directed film with great acting and made with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a film that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it's filmed as if you were there and it's really happening. I know that some people in other reviews compare it to "Open Water", but I don't agree because I thought Open Water was rather boring and mediocre, while this film was the opposite, even if superficially they are shot in the same "realistic" style . br /> <br /> Actors are unknown, at least to me, but they are all very effective and convey the terrible situation with frightening intensity and realism. The plot is well done and runs smoothly, the plot is logical and seems to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are exactly what a person would do and think. Very credible and this makes the film more real because of that. <br /> <br /> I had tears in my eyes at the end. I have to say that rarely does a film have this effect on me, this is how the film was made in a powerful and emotional way and I am appropriately impressed by the director and the actors of this great film.
