This is precious. Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely fun from the first delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I was waiting for him to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is fascinating as always as Jonathan Safran Foer (author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it is Eugene Hutz (who plays the Ukrainian author and translator of Jonathan, Alex) who really steals this film. Alex is a Ukrainian hip-hop-lovin break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II. The Ukrainian countryside has never been so breathtaking. I am thinking of putting everything in order and moving to the former Soviet state. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film, however, changes when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and suddenly, this adorable comedy turns into a breathtaking historical drama about a Jewish village that has been annihilated during the Nazi occupation. Everything is illuminated about history, heritage and the wisdom that can be obtained from the discovery of the past. It's perfect.
