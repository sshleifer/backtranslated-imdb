This is the best job I've ever seen on television. The story is compelling, all the more because it's true. Writers have done their homework: the accuracy of events is well documented. The acting is great. This must be the best role Sam Waterston has ever played. And black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available for purchase. A few years ago I contacted someone involved in the production (with PBS or in England) and they told me they had no intention of releasing it on VHS (at the moment). This was a BBC production and ran in the United States on American Playhouse. There is such an interest in seeing this - it's hard to believe that nobody can make it available.
