I saw this movie when it was released and it's definitely touching. I liked the point of view of a child who came to know that what he was thinking about her really wasn't true. It's a puzzle for that kid. And his quest to find out who she is. And before and after she knows about her, the relationship between her and her adoptive mother. This is a beautiful vision. R Rahman adds his stress with good re-recording and songs. In this film mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advice (as in Vuyire) but simply tells the characters as they are. And that's why the film hits the audience exactly. The chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas pool bath scene did not communicate perfectly well what it was for. Mani Ratnam is incredibly improved.
