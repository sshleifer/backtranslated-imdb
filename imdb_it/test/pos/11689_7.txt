Wow. At first I thought of who writes these things! How difficult is this choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth, respectability and security compared to a husband who offers you only oppression, abuse, degradation and poverty. However, our choices are not always as clear-cut as one might think. In fact the rich gentleman was all that a woman could aspire to, yet ... her husband's attraction, her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. What to do, what to do ?? As a spectator you have become as confused and misguided as she is. Anyway, what I came to hang out on this site was my admiration for Engish's voice, I thought, even though it's actually the voice of an Irish singer in the film. Looking at him, I discover that it is Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard of before that day. What a find. I'm very grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thanks BIFF!
