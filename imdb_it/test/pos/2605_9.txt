I have to admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello films I saw at the theater. Most were seen on T.V. and I have to admit that Lou is really funny and he gets the girl too. This was my first time to see Dorothy Provine perform and of course I fell in love with her like so many others that day. I saw most of the work he did and I enjoyed it. His performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons I bought the record in the first place! <br /> <br /> Any comment on this film says that this is the only film that Lou Costello made with Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou had lived, he would have made many more. He really does a good job and doesn't have to rely on his old routines to get laughter. I for one am sorry that the little man by Patterson, N.J. I didn't get the chance to do it. <br /> <br /> I hope this time will be available on DVD a little time, so I can add it to my collection of comedies / sci fi.
