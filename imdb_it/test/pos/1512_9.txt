Fulci is one of my favorite Italian splatter directors ever. He is also a great storyteller who mixes horror, supernatural and psychedelic themes very well. This film really was his last big story before directing disappointments like "Voices From Beyond". The story is as simple as Fulci interprets himself, a horror director. After years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that Fulci begins to suffer from a collapse in which he begins to hallucinate on people who are massacred. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes things worse when he convinces Fulci that he is killing people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used gore scenes of several photos over the same period. I don't think these films have directed but certainly produced. Some of these films are "Massacre" directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground), "Touch of Death" directed by Fulci, "The Murders Secret" and I can't remember the rest of the films. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated film, even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and I've seen it many times before. It is sad that Fulci has not had the opportunity to direct something worthwhile after this, but still this is a great film and I recommend it to all Fulci fans, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
