One of the most unjustly defamed programs of all time, "Terry & June" was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> He started his life as 'Happy Ever After', but when Eric Merriman decided he didn't want to write anymore, it turned into this, hence the fall of "Aunt Lucy" and Fletcher to become the Medford. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was welcoming, domestic, middle-class stuff; the plots covered the range of cliches of the chief who came to dinner, the vicar who organized a confused sale and unwanted relatives who came to stay for the weekend. It was certainly not a "terrible lazy comedy". Although he was "not intelligent", he was not meant to be. It was fun and well executed, and that was enough! <br /> <br /> I too loved the 'alternative' boom of the 1980s ('Spitting Image', 'Black Adder', 'The Young Ones' etc.), but I also liked conventional things like this . If nothing else, he provided an alternative comedy with something alternative. I found it sad even when the likes of Ben Elton took against both of them and Benny Hill. Well, the family-oriented comedy has almost vanished from our screens, but where did you leave us? Have a look at the latest T.V. All the soaps and the dross of reality. The few plays left are aimed at teenagers, which means that they are chock full of jokes, bodily functions and explicit sexual references. And they're not even funny. <br /> <br /> The "alternative comedy" boom has been good in many ways, but it has had a dark side. It made the traditional sitcoms look old-fashioned, turned away talented writers and artists like Spike Milligan, and eventually led to an unspeakable spin like "Little Britain" and "Tittybangbang" (heaven helps us). If it's not broken, don't fix it!
