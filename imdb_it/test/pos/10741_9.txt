This exceptional film has to do with the best acting you've ever seen, and this alone makes it a must see. The whole cast is excellent, but then again, he had to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me long to be passionate about this film, and apart from a court scene that is simply good, this is high-level entertainment. This is a rare film that has earned all the Oscar recognition it has received. See it yourself and you will certainly not be disappointed.
