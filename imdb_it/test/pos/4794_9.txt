Luis Bunuel has always been a director whose work was obscure to me. My first experience with him was The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie, often considered his greatest work, with which I became so frustrated and bored that I finally closed the tape. In the same way Belle de Jour, which is almost certainly his best-known film and generally considered one of his many masterpieces, did not interest me at all. I didn't hate it like I was Discreet, but I didn't like it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or. Finally, I had gotten somewhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados, also good. However, neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados left me speechless. Great films, but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel, and I like it just a little more than the other two. It's about a priest from Spain now in Mexico who refuses to live in the luxury in which the most priests live. He wants to be more like Jesus, leading the mildest life possible. He is also willing to forgive everyone for everything and to suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure that Bunuel doesn't sympathize with the character and consider him rather hypocritical. However, I only assume that, due to my knowledge of the director, whose most famous phrase is "Thank God, I'm still an atheist", which apparently said in this interview about this movie (I received this information from John Baxter book on Bunuel, if you're interested). The interviewer who dragged those words from Bunuel's mouth must have been confused with Nazarin himself. Who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction, who knows nothing about Bunuel, could see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if the viewer has his criticisms of organized religion. The priest may be a bit hypocritical, but he seems to be basically a good man. When he hosts a violent prostitute in his room to protect her (and, presumably, to save his soul), people begin to discover and assume that their relationship is sexual. His superiors take the same and punish him for it. Later, he suffers even worse penalties from clerics.
