I got him on the late and late Mexican cable and I have to complain. The title has been translated as "Secretos" (secrets). Well, there is a secret that plays an important part in the film, but come on! We are not stupid. We know that there is a novel behind this. <br /> <br /> However, the film is quite interesting and is supported by its solid performances. The always beautiful and surprising Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston offer great performances and have a great harmony between them. Even Cameron DÃ¬az is good even if he has a minimum time on the screen. Blythe Danner is perfect and his last appearance in the film is moving, sad. Great shows <br /> <br /> The character of Jordana and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to Europe to have her deal with her demons and see why her sister died. Through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth and cannot help but feel sorry for the whole family. The ending is really moving. <br /> <br /> So there is nudity but it is minimal. In fact, sex scenes are artistic and are not meant to be hot or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I kept watching it for the fascinating beauty and beauty of Joranda Brewster. And in the end I enjoyed the story and the dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Try this movie if you like solid dramatic features. Great movie. The last, last scene was very sad. The two little sisters through flashbacks.
