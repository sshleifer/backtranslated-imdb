Having discovered the Ring trilogy, I'm greedily devouring all those other Japanese and Korean films that are following or following the wagon. <br /> <br /> I don't have an easy definition of horror, but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons, although I can't say that the film makes much sense. I'm picky so there were several points in the film when I didn't want to see what was happening on the screen. The film made me nervous, so I became worried about seeing things I thought I saw. <br /> <br /> It is an imaginative film that visually offers a lot. It also provides food for thought. And a lot of material to discuss when the film is finished. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined to say the least. Could they make films like this in the West? <br /> <br /> So in the end it doesn't make sense, but when you have an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the bizarre, the otherworldly, then the film will distribute a definitive pay-off.
