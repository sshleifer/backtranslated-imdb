The Hospital is a film that was made ahead of its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-winning film, "Network", deals with personal overload, great incompetence and bureaucratic corruption in a large Manhattan conglomerate hospital. George C. Scott, in a superb performance as a primary, is driven to alcoholism and a death wish, as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing out his son from home and, worse yet, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence takes precedence over the care and healing of the sick and injured. <br /> <br /> Scott renders the film his and viewers will be shocked by what they observe in this medical center. You can feel the "pain" (the pun) of what this hospital did to him. The vivid images of the incompetence of this hospital are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you could find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> If only the film had remained with that premise in a documentary style as it begins, this image would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a sub plot of Scott who falls in love with the daughter of a senile patient. The patient killed people at the hospital. This is where the credibility of the image becomes tense. The romantic dialogue scenes add nothing to the image, and the mental patient, pretending to be a doctor, seemed absolutely incredible to me. A simple security call and record check should have prevented the senile patient from killing. It takes almost the entire movie, before the security people are introduced into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see A PERSON doing so much damage, even as corrupted as this hospital. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the character of George C Scott is "overloaded" (another pun) because the script has too many things going on right away. For example, within a period of 20 minutes, you could have up to 20 different doctors accused and deny what they should have done or not done. With nurses and help, it's the same story. Someone's card was mistakenly read, someone was given the wrong drug and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, another doctor does the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on duty because the second nurse who was supposed to admit the patient was on a coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle and dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption fed to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical ineptitude is unforgettable. However, the murder subplot is a distraction rather than a help for this film. When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's reactions to it, you're glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the crazy patient's daughter force the film to a mysterious type "Who made it?" scenario that seriously damages the quality of the film. When the madman is revealing how he did the murders, I asked myself the following: why do the producers need the "under-plot" of the killer "find the killer"? I think the only place where Scott's character has a relationship with the patient's senile daughter was to give him someone to talk to. The hospital should have kept the ferocious accusation against the medical profession, removing the scenes of love and mad patients. He should have focused more frequently on the incompetent B.S within its walls. In an age where this film could be phenomenal, the sub-story stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece that could have been.
