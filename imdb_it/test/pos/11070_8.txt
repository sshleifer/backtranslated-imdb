I thought Nick Gomez's look at the gritty streets of New Jersey, where auto-ammunition is at the highest level, was both challenging and fun. This is as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim. I thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable, had a realistic and gritty appearance and was very atmospheric, both on purpose and by pure coincidence. I really enjoyed this movie, an underrated gem that I found on TV and happy to have taken it. Go see this movie if you have a chance. If they don't have a DVD, they should release one. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb Rating: 5.9. My vote: 9/10
