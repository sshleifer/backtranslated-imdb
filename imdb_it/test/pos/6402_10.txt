I agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the series as well as I was in the Florida Keys when the show debuted. I was looking through old video recorders that were "keepers" and I found two that had about eight episodes. I ended up spending part of the Christmas night (and the next) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - he saw his name appear in the credits. He comes from Anguilla and has a beach bar called The Dune Preserve. He is a longtime friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise" is featured on Buffett's latest CD / DVD combo called "Live In Anguilla" - it's track no. 12 on CD 1 and # 8 on the CD. I would also like to see this short-lived series come to DVD one day. Have faith!
