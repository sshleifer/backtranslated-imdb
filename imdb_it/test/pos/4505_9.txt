THE KITE RUNNER is one of those modern epics with which one is occasionally honored. Spanning on two continents, more family generations and many decades, this film touches on a myriad of elements including friendship, love, loss and, ultimately, redemption. <br /> <br /> His first mover is the young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with hired help; mainly the young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a Hazara boy whose family is presumably inferior to the Afghans in power. But the two form a bond of friendship based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), the closeness to the house of Amir and, of course, the flight of kites. <br /> <br /> But the bad times are coming for the city of Kabul. The communists are invading and Amir and Hassan have split up due to an unacceptable act of prejudice against an Afghan boy against Hassan. The two may never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's father runs to free himself and his son from Afghanistan, and then find his way to America. Here the two create a service station and live to the day selling to niche markets. And while Amir's father gradually falls ill, a new revelation will strike Amir's heart; one who cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul. <br /> <br /> A study of friendship, war and reconciliation, The Kite Runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema. History is never pronounced inappropriately in English whenever we are in a foreign country, and only English is broken whenever we are in America. This was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> The acting was on par with the best you will see. A special note should be made to Homayoun Ershadi who plays Baba, a sick father of Amir and a strong patriarch. He also leads Khalid Abdalla while old Amir is played well, especially when he returns to Kabul to find him in ruins; the contrast compared to when he was gone. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the Afghan during Amir's escape and the final return are nothing short of breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks that will make you slow your mouth (I'm not sure which mountain range they used in the film , but wherever I wanted to go and film it myself!) But it's not photography or the acting of one or two people that makes this film a success. It's a simple story, told very well, which makes it worthwhile for all cinema viewers. Highly recommended.
