Many believe this film is a baseball movie. These people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the film is not about baseball. Some think this film is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship is not very developed. This film is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is about culture. An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a strict traditional Japanese baseball director cannot succeed because they cannot, in fact, not understand each other. It is after they succeed in overcoming the cultural barrier that they succeed. The baseball player becomes more Japanese in the mentality of his team and the more American manager in allowing individual results, and they meet in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance are subordinated to this critique of the two cultures. Many of those who do not understand the Japanese mentality, lose it and think that it is a film about baseball or romance and see cultural confrontation as a slight remedy for comedy. It is not --- the cultural clash is the burden of the film. Based on my experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think this film has gone very well as it has not overly romanticized Japanese culture nor exaggerated in its portrayal. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is a fun and relaxing movie if you understand what it really is.
