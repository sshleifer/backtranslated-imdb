I've seen this show since the beginning and I'm a 45 year old man. For me, this is much more than a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, perhaps unusual, but still a family. He focuses on a mother and a daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two brilliant, attractive and in their own way successful ways. Lorelei has returned home in the fiction Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family. The show also throws the relationship between Lorelei and her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, the old DAR WASP money that does not approve of Lorelei's choices in life, although Lorelei does not care. The history of relationships and through the line are what make this show, in my opinion the best on the WB network (which will soon be the CW). Watch this show!
