As a fan of history, mythology and the fantasy show "Mystic Knights" he took me from the beginning. It has a semi-decent script, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has a pretty good acting, and the heroes and villains all play well with one another. <br /> <br /> SCRIPTS - Half screenplay is rather large, the other half falls flat, but it's all mixed together, which means that many episodes are so-so. Also, some of the key players are repeatedly given dead lines (King Conchobar and Angus for example) need to receive something ... more. I'm not sure what but the authors should be able to invent something. ACT - Apart from some excessive action by villagers (horrible lines end up putting too much effort), the casting did very well in choosing their leads and so on. All, good and bad, work well together! COSTUMES / WEAPONS - Everyday clothes they all wear are spectacular! The armor of Mystic Knight that is missing from Deirdre and Garrett's. A bikini with chain mail would probably have better protection in her case ... and it wouldn't look like plastic; looks like a bunch of pieces of brown plastic snap, when it should look like bronze. Ivar's trident seems to have been bought at a discount store and while the Garrett weapons look nice, they also look like plastic. <br /> <br /> "Mystic Knights" recently took on too many "Power Rangers" traits, if you watch the show, you will know what I mean. As the series progresses, however, he should find his niche and perfect his style. Overall, it's a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I watch and we all have 20+). The plot thickens and bends, even if it becomes a bit youthful in some places, and everything continues to become more interesting. It could be of some interest to fans of the "Willow" movie or the T.V. "The Adventures of Sinbad". Lots of adventures, a touch of mystery, a touch of romance, a sprinkling of forces on nature ... Take a look! (My score: 7/10)
