While I keep his predecessor, "Fast Times At Ridgemont High", as a standard to be compared to other comedies for boys, "The Wild Life" is one of the least known films of that period - and a worthy sequel, if you can call it so I believe his slogan is "From the creators of FTARH, something even faster". This is certainly true. Although it may lack the depth of the first that addresses issues like first dates, teenage sex and abortions, "The Wild Life" is, however, a great film. It's pure chaotic fun, especially thanks to the exaggerated character of Chris Penn, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli had a coke rather than an herb, it would have been Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first major role, is as exceptional as Bill Conrad. The two characters work well with one another. Think of a strange younger couple, more hipper, complete with 80s gloss. Outside of them there are so many other great things about this film that are worth mentioning. Lea Thompsom has never been prettier, especially during the scenes of her donut shop work. Jenny Wright is simply delicious and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a great nerd / pervert who is dying to get his pants on. Thomas Drake's wrestler companions are hysterical, especially Benny, the little Puerto Rican boy, who says some memorable lines. One in particular who screamed during an evening at a strip club made me on the floor the first time I saw him. He's saying something! Finally, the film ends with one of the best party scenes of the 80s on cinema, ever. Look for special appearances by Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (the father of Sean and Chris Penn) and a casual Michael Jackson impersonator at the party. Throw a soundtrack no less than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can't go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open for riffs that could be found on albums like 5150, OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. <br /> <br /> If something upsets the flow of the film is a small subplot involving Randy Quaid as a burned Vietnam veteran. It just seems out of place and useless. Besides that, it's almost perfect. If you are a fan of irreverent but amusing 80s movies and haven't seen this yet, you're looking for something special. Rent it NOW !!! <br /> <br /> p.s.-The credits say that Cameron Crowe has a cameo as one of the cops in the film. He turned his back on his scene because I still have to find him. Someone, please help me.
