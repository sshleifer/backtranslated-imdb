A lot of USA The film can be summarized in its title. He draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a sort of Hollywood falsehood that exalts the things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the director's direction on recent events (although, frankly, I can't always say exactly where he is) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poems etc. They play an important role here as images. Most of the time the images of the story are accompanied by these audio elements with good results. I'm kind of a radio lover so it was satisfying to hear how the radio was integrated into the rhythm of the film. In fact, most of the dialogue is about history rather than the characters talking to each other. This does not mean that there are no "characters" (real people), but with the exception of "Jim", the protagonist (a sort of "60s abandoned with an erratic mental state) the others come and go quite quickly. Some they give a very powerful impression, especially a guru-like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself.When he bursts into a spontaneous prayer song while driving Jim to the subway, it is a very powerful moment. the quote "The danger is clear", which is taken from President Bush's speech that paved the way for our incursion into Iraq.In retrospect, listening to that speech at a climax of the film brought home how we live in a time load that will always be remembered.
