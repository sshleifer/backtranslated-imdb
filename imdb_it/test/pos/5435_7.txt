Robin Williams shows his talents and reinforces his comic status in this "what's wrong? In American politics and how Hollywood can try to influence without boring people". Obviously Hollywood uses films with hidden or not so hidden programs. I think this film is for people who like to stand and discuss politics. And the trailers for this movie were for everyone just to make sure as many people as possible saw it. Everybody knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than Bush & Co, so they have to do these movies from time to time ... but this was perhaps too obvious, at least I imagined it, for making a real change. <br /> <br /> Again, great stand-up and new issues and political speeches ... I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb.com reviews I was positively surprised when I left the cinema, and yes, I laughed a lot times. Sometimes you just have to let go and forget all the seriousness ... see this movie if you like clever and clever stand-ups or politics and you won't be offended by the many references on how things are not going well at the moment. Rent it if it doesn't match.
