OK, so this movie might not have won any Oscars, but it's not a bad movie. The original "D.O.A." it's definitely a better film, but that doesn't mean this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> The film is played by Dennis Quaid in one of his first roles, when he became famous for the first time after "The Right Stuff" made him a star, and a beautiful Meg Ryan, when he was still quite famous. <br /> <br /> This is more of an "update" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters are different too. The plot is practically the same. A man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned and has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young university student who tries to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's extraneous wife, in a low key, but with an intense performance; steals every scene in which it is found. Daniel Stern (also in a previous role, before "Home Alone" made him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is also good in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is top notch; The film is elegant, with a fast pace that makes you guess until the end. <br /> <br /> I think this is a film that deserves to be seen as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic movie.
