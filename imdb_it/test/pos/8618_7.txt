Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. She accompanies us to witness how a film is made on the spot. The film in production seems to be based on itself, since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne, a female director, very similar to Mrs. Breillat. Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director. <br /> <br /> Jeanne reaches an impasse at the beginning of the shoot. Not only did he choose the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold period, as it involves places on the beach that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two main actors, in particular, the male protagonist who has trouble accepting the way the director decided to show it in the film; even the leading actress is not an angel. <br /> <br /> Making a film, Mrs Breillat tells us that it is a process like no other in a creative work of art. First of all, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, Jeanne wrote a script, which when it comes into production reveals problems to which the writer / director has not thought. There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of history has her first sexual contact. What appeared intelligent on the written page does not necessarily translate into easy time in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear a false penis and has many problems accepting the fact that a trick must touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man. <br /> <br /> Anne Parillaud is as wonderful as Jeanne, the director. He makes observations about the production, the actors and the crew that fit well into the story told. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the main actors, with the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set. Jeanne has to massage her ego to get what she wants in the end. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> "Sex Is Comedy" allows Mrs. Breillet to give us her personal interpretation of films in general. This is a great look at how films are made in a Breillat style.
