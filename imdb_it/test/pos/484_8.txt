I really like this particular production of "The Mikado". The producers have added a few more touches to make it more fun for the modern public - for example, "As Some Day It May Happen" (the "small song" list) is completely updated, and some lines are advertised throughout the game. Freedoms have also been taken with the setting. The costumes are not Japanese, but English of 1920 (although some of the "Tittipudlian" girls wear kimonos inspired by the 20s). This production is well choreographed with dance styles from the 1920s, and there are a few waitresses and bellboys dancing extra to keep the eyes (and even the ears) amused during the songs. If you are a purist of Gilbert & Sullivan these changes could bother you, but I think they look good - and I love costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely funny; all his scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite add-ons is when he makes his first entry - the bellhops who dance annoy her with their antics, so she screams out loud, "STOP IT !!"). All the other main characters also do a good job. I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (that wig!) And Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> You must keep in mind that this is a theatrical production that is filmed and fixes your expectations accordingly. There is no change in the setting, although the directors have used some 1930s film techniques to add interest. If there is one drawback to this production, it is that the stage make-up has not been modified for close-up shots with a camera. The baselines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner, lipstick and blush everywhere. I've seen this kind of thing happen before with comedy films, and it's a bit jarring at the beginning. However, I hope you get used to it and that you like "The Mikado" for what it's worth - a really nice rendition of a classic!
