Our Toronto auditor told you what you need to know about this movie (except note that it needs editing, the manual technique gets really old, very fast). I saw this film last night in Menerbes, France, we are in the Luberon valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine producers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente for the demonstration. Overflowing, patient, brilliant. Although my French is pungent, I understood the meaning of the film, but I noticed that the public loved the "old" terrorist farmers interviewed - esp. that of a communist village in Languedoc. He had a lot of laughs. This is unusual in France - laughing out loud. There is no doubt about which part of the war for the globalization of terrorism is underway! SM
