If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would have been recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth, subtlety and passion, a film without equal in the visual field. He is incredibly amazing and also very brutal in his portrayal of our great legacy of greed and annihilation. And, of course, what the reviewers couldn't tolerate is that they don't tell a simple fiction like crazy and jane like 99% of Hollywood production. His characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to think, something that average film reviewers don't understand and can't tolerate, so they destroyed it. Watch the untrimmed original widescreen version. It's amazing.
