I saw this movie for the first time a little while ago. If you ask me, he doesn't have the merit he deserves. It's a bit like American Pie meets Fast Times in Ridgemont High but with greater depth. It handles the same problems as both films, but in a way that holds back some truth. The ending is sad, but that's what life is like. I think everyone should see it. I have it on the DVD module, and it took me so long to find it too. This should say something, heh and another thing I will add is that it is quite difficult to find the soundtrack. I think they stopped it, but the soundtrack of this film is incredible. He has songs by artists such as The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many others.
