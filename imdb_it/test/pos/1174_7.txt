This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say about "I didn't think they made more films like that". Walter Matthau gives his usual performance over the top, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the landscape, he leaves eye-catching spots of fat. It's like that great uncle that we all know he still wears a polyester plaid and embarrasses everyone, but we love him anyway. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). It gives a realistic performance of fundamentally "good, normal man", even in a farce environment. <br /> <br /> This film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to deal with or offend, but will appeal to those who appreciate the farce with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The entire supporting cast is excellent in its ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. /> <br /> Brent Spiner offers a wonderful performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. Anyone who has known professional guests in real life will immediately recognize the type they are playing. Nail the type perfectly. His interpretation of "slime" deserves to be studied as a perfect example of the contrast between the absurd and the pathetic. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather a direct theme 'we marry rich' which has the usual results. Just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times doesn't mean it's dated, but rather it's a timeless theme. <br /> <br /> The rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals show off their skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of competing for the spotlight. In this film, second-tier actors also shine. It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film. <br /> <br /> The plot can be standard and thin, but it allows artists to shine. <br /> <br /> This film is a real pleasure for people who want to see professional actors engaged in their trade. The plot falls and the artists shine.
