I'm not a big music fan, but this is one of the few that I really love. Unlike many other musicals, like "The Sound of Music", none of the songs talk about free things. Each song is a social commentary, wit about war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality and freedom. Particularly surprising songs are "Easy to be tough", "Age of Aquarius", "Hair", "Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0", "Walking In Space" and "Hare Krishna". Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to see it live!
