Bobby and Mikey are two little boys who cross the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Shortly after the family settled, their mother married "The King" who ended up being an abusive stepfather, especially for Bobby. So Bobby decides he will "fly away" from the abuse on his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This film was hard to watch, especially the abuse scenes. It was difficult to look at an innocent and playful little boy who was abused and turned into a grumpy and frightened young man. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> I cried throughout the last half of the movie. There were also some funny scenes like the Monster Brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't suggest letting the kids look at it. It was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really flew away.
