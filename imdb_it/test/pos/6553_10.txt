Uzumaki has a unique story and I will never look at spirals in the same way again. Not really a spine-tingling horror thrill, this film has a dark and sour taste, which gives it an acid sense. During some parts, was it just me or did you see vortex images? Camera shots are interesting and the film lets the imagination run wild. The bizarre supernatural atmosphere of this movie attracts you just as the title suggests. The acting is well done and the city itself seems wrong to begin with. <br /> <br /> This may require some visualization to sink. A great trippy movie.
