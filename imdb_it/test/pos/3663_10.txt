I loved this movie, which I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends and this film was very real. I referred to everything and enjoyed every moment. The characters are credible, the story is moving and the ending is realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the screening. This film shows mixing very well, but not the complete mix of 2 worlds (east and west). The supporting cast was wonderful, representing the life of a tourist in India quite realistically. Humor is subtle, sometimes dry, and this makes it even more realistic, as it is woven into the daily escapades of the characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations represented.
