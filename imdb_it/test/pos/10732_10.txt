I have seen many Dustin Hoffman films like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked them, but his characters are often very calm or even shy. I expected him to be in this film like him in Straw Dogs, but I saw a completely different person. He was much more energetic in this film and reminded me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The film was very interesting from beginning to end. I liked the way the Dustin Hoffman character was ready to do practically everything to be with his son. This film is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to compromise on themselves without involving other people.
