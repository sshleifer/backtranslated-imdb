"Just before dawn" is one of the best slasher films. It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Deliverance" by Tobe Hooper. Deborah Benson plays the heroine well and director Jeff Lieberman has created a lot of disturbing and obscure films. "Just before dawn" is beautiful photographed and the soundtrack is very disturbing. I have never preferred slasher or gore films except with this film. Very impressive and convincing (at least for me)
