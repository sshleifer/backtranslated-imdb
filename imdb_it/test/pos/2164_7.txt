Don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. It has nice animations with the exception of a strange looking bug and good music. And the highlight was definitely the dance of Elmer, Bugs and Daffy on the floor, it was such a nice and fun touch. As a matter of fact, the whole comic strip is beautiful to look at, but all in all it is not what I call exceptional like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they were used before I heard, and there wasn't much that would have seemed hilarious to me. And Daffy joins Elmer? Somehow since he was a target of the hunter, it didn't seem strange that he would be his friend. Although I will admit it was nice to have Daffy there. Even the vocal acting was above average, but somehow I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> All in all, a comic book that is not exceptional but very beautiful. 7/10 Bethany Cox
