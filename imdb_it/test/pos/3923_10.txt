I recently saw House of Wax and I have to say I loved it. <br /> <br /> has been one of the best Horror / Thriller movies in recent years, if not one of the best and most entertaining. /> <br /> I heard a lot of people hit the so-called slow start and development of the character that occupies the Films opening 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> but if the film dived straight into death, the public and critics would have criticized the film for not having decent characters that they didn't give a shit about. <br /> <br /> as for the character development, I think it worked incredibly well. <br /> <carrying out my answer and others (from reading messages outside the forum), a lot of people ended up wishing that the characters lived, one of which I noticed that many people mentioned was Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton ). taking Warner into consideration. Bros. started marketing his death, it was a surprise that caused many viewers to end up encouraging her to survive. <br /> <br /> speaking of the chase / death scenes, they were among the most imaginative and full of suspense. I watched for a while and had a great time. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film was absolutely satisfying, I couldn't criticize any of them, especially Paris Hilton, I thought it was very decent and I was hoping for her to get more than just a 25 minute screen in a 120-minute film, yet the scene of his pursuit made up for it, and believe me when I say that Paris can be scary, (Look at the scene where a car is hiding from Vincent and he passes by it .... the expression of terror on his face is VERY real. <br /> <br /> In general I give House of Wax the maximum of the stars, in terms of entertainment and suspense and even the cold blood ... only the criticism is that I hope that during the commercialization of the film, they did not reveal the death list and who dies and who survives, as I am ten times better than I do not know if the chased character would die or die and horrible. <br /> <br /> can't wait for the DVD, but go see it at cinema while you can, it won't be the same in your living room, but if you wait for the DVD, watch the film in the dark without interruption, believe me you won't be disappointed.
