After 10 visions in 20 years I also think this was the best film in the Crazy Gang on the cinema, with greater cohesion in the plot than their next best, "Alf's Button Afloat". They were really a crazy trio of double acts put together mainly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until Chesney Allen retired in the 1940s through "bad health". He survived them all for years. Apparently they were crazy even outside the "work", regularly playing beats on each other. <br /> <br /> The Six Wonder Boys troupe heads for I-Get-Her-To-Tell-Me (Alaska) to dig for the gold that was there. It seemed a better idea to go to Mansfield ... because they had been there. When they arrive at Red Gulch they find that their information was only 40 years out of date: they thought the chips that were in the guilty newspaper they had read had a strange taste. But at that point it doesn't matter how everyone fell in love with Snow White and they want to help their grandfather find his long-lost gold supply. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants it anyway. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual word games is surprising, but most of them will probably only make sense (?) For the British and ex-fans interested in seeing The English comedies of the ' 30 in black and white. Almost all the gags and routines work, including the Gold If fife between Bud & Chesney and the "Whistle While You Work" pastiche - also the "Always Getting Our Man" Mountie inserts. A wonderful little film, in rather tired conditions but absolutely recommended.
