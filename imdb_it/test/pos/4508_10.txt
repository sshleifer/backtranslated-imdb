I read both the book and saw the movie today. The plot is so powerful that almost every script or script would do justice to it. So nothing much there. However, this is still a beautiful film because it makes you think and feel, just like the book. Seeing that it is not like watching a documentary about a failed state and feeling in solidarity with the people who suffer under an oppressive regime, but it is like watching any other history of the common man, across generations, across continents. The cowardice of Amir, his guilt, his dilemmas and finally his choice of a way to redemption could have been the story of each of us. There is not a single foolproof character to look at and idolize, but everyone is gray, just like all of us. <br /> <br /> Another important observation is that the film does an excellent job of chronicling the lives of Afghans through the twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. Vibrant and worry-free childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the desolate and destroyed remains of the city echo what the Taliban have done. <br /> <br /> The child actors deserve the "thumb lifted" all the way. They can make any matured actor feel ashamed. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the film yet or read the book, enter the theater keeping in mind that you are about to witness a multi-layered story woven on a multicolored fabric of human emotions and feelings. This film is not intended to arouse anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban sentiments but to prove the evidence of human existence. <br /> <br /> I have read some external reviews related to the site and I must confess that I do not see the point of writing reviews that summarize the plot as a distant viewer and highlights technical details on a fantastic photograph or something similar. At least for this film, one should try to connect to it rather than judge it objectively.
