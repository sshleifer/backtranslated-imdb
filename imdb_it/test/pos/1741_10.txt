I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it is deleted, after only a start. I've been waiting for this show all week. And so sorry for the people who hoped to be The One. I would have liked to see who won. It has just started and, in my opinion, it should not have been canceled. I hope these young artists have been seen by talent scouts and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I voted and sat down waiting for him to arrive; never knowing that it was canceled. And I couldn't believe it was. I am amazed that he had low grades; because in my opinion it was one of the best reality TV shows.
