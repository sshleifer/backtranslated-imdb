The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were absolutely convincing and genuinely nice in their roles. Imelda Staunton brilliantly played compatriot Mrs. Sucksby. Although she was a vile opportunist, in the end she somehow managed to make you sympathize with her. Rupert Evans played the slime gentleman with pure charm and snark. He was a scene thief. The story itself was really unique, as was the way it was told. The setting in Victorian England with two lead lesbian characters was intriguing and delightful. There were some fantastic and unexpected twists that really kept the audience involved in the story. A wonderful cast and an excellent story have made this film superb.
