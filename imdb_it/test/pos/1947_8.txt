I finally saw it on video, after hearing about it for years. It's definitely not a perfect movie, but it's strangely hypnotic - one of those rare and special films that creates its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** First, the bad things. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are heartbreaking. Although the subject is Social Studies, this guy is WAY over the top. His speeches are so exaggerated as to be ridiculous. And no teacher I ever had should dismiss his students that way, and tell those protesting "Shut up!" These scenes are short, but they break the atmosphere and distance the viewer from the story. So, how on earth, does Layne leave the police station near the end? Also, what happened to Samson's car after the first scene he rode in the city? Spend the rest of the movie taking a walk around Layne or Feck. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is awesome. Dennis Hopper effortlessly steals the film. "Check in the mail", "I love company", "you're my friend" - every line is a classic. It gives Feck an internal logic that makes history work. Incredibly, it actually makes the public feel empathetic about this guy, especially when Samson talks about his future (of Samson). <br /> <br /> In contrast, Crispin Glover is hard to catch sometimes. Yet the scenes around him that go around the Beetle are perfect: children with machines in high school always have something to do and buds to do it with. Matt's low-key attitude makes a good sign for Layne - their friendship is credible. Glover's mannerisms are a little too much, but he is consistent throughout. Guide the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - try to imagine this film if Layne was so much a zombie as Matt or Samson - snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** What makes Edge's Edge "shocking" is the fact that Samson is not really evil, in the usual sense. He's a boring guy who got tired of being taken for granted - in other words, he's like thousands of other boring types. After killing Jamie, he starts to unravel, which creates a bit of suspense as we wait to see when he clicks again. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of the appeal of this film is the way the action remains centered around the kids and their point of view. Parents are a comic relief - Clarissa's mother, Tony's father - or overwhelmed - Matt's mother. This underlines how the kids get together for the attention that no one else gives them. It keeps the story focused on relationships within the clique and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is Feck. "River's Edge" is a textbook on alienation. It transmits how embarrassing, mysterious and puzzling adolescence is like no other film.
