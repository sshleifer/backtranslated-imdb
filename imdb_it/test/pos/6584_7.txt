I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and director Aku Louhimies presented his film and was available for questions and answers. For some reason this film is called Frozen Land in English, so I don't know how the distributors were frozen by Paha. This is a great movie. It's not enough for me to be beaten in an excellent category, but I talked to some viewers who thought it was an excellent film. Louhimies said that in Finland people loved this movie or hated it and said that many people in the theaters left. I'm sure some have opposed some of the violence, profanity, drug and alcohol abuse and explicit sexual scenes. It is a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together due to a relapse effect. This film has very interesting and strong characters. I would rate it 7.0 out of a possible 10 and I would see it again and recommend it with caution.
