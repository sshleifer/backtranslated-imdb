Ever since I played it for the first time in 1998, GoldenEye was one of my favorite video games. In fact, I recently bought a N64 purely to be able to own and play it more often! The game is practically perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersion as Bond, with various mission objectives, convincing weapons and a great design. Although enemies' artificial intelligence is pretty straightforward by today's standards, this only adds to the appeal of GoldenEye. The method for obtaining cheats (completing the levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I haven't cracked some yet! <br /> <br /> The game has a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this is not as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the sequel to the "Perfect Dark" game, it's still incredibly satisfying to blow up your opponents in a thousand pieces with a burst of fire RC-P90! ;-)
