Oh yes! Hollywood remembers how to use the good old formula and when lightning strikes, it's a pretty wonderful feeling. Hollywood rarely creates a masterpiece because lately it seems that there is more interest in rushing and getting the best prizes in a hurried way, or there is the problem of too many cooks in the mix. Usually good scripts are the result of a talented writer who has full control of his property, understands his material and is a good writer. Then there is an unimportant part, often overlooked by marketing geniuses who often lack creativity and vision: a good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre and a half-cooked film and a fully realized film that may not be an important and relevant film, but that contributes to its genre and could eventually become a classic of his gender. We receive very few romantic comedies, and we are people who are hungry for them. Buried in the sexy humor of "Sex in the City" is Big and Carrie's romantic but stormy relationship, and people flocked to "Mamma Mia" because they had a little romance, cleverly played by Streep and Brossnam. He could have a silly musical, but he touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" offers us more, with the extraordinary talents of a woman who does a magnificent job in romantic movies, Mrs. Diane Lane. Since his childhood days, we have been able to appreciate how his talent, combined with his grateful soul, has allowed us to see in the hearts of the protagonists of the story. A few years ago, he collaborated with Mr. Gere, giving us a tormented, romantic and sexy performance like his wife who is not too sure of the consequences of her actions in "Unfaithful", a job that should have earned her at least an Academic Recognition. She is back, doing a more formidable job in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up her romantic prospects, and suddenly realizes that there may be another possibility around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane makes this film beat with intelligence and passion. His facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions his character undergoes. We can read frustrations, desires, despair, anger, hope, loss and a reach that is within the reach of many of the marketable types that Hollywood constantly slows down. Here is a mature actor who has the gift of projecting real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way as to be moved as we become part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film to the end. His discoveries become ours as we celebrate the power of hope and love with her. He is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love, just as a teenager does, and yet never lets you think of his foolish or irresponsible character. His eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynical of the public. She is one of the stars who can work miracles with a single glance. In her the classic sensations of those great films of yesterday are back. His work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who played every day and made them memorable because they created complete characters. We admire those superb actresses who recreate legends of real life and are rewarded for this. Half of their work is done by the mystique of the figures they impersonate; however, as much as anyone can make you think, it is the roles like those of Lane in this film that are a more impressive result because they are created from scratch, given a personal imprint and are able to reach heights without any previous theatrical material support, such as like theatrical works and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid homage to the big screen. The character of Lane is a woman whose experiences could be any of us. You represent our dreams and our emotions with a lot of quality, class and the right amount of feeling. It is a truly remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays. <br /> <br /> There are some adjectives I could use to pay tribute to his work, but I can only say that, in my humble opinion, every single plot of his work in this film is the testimony of one of the most great performances never made in celluloid by a living artist. Thank you, Mrs Lane.
