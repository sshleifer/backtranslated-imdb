Now that I've seen it, it was NOT what I expected, at least until the end of the END. I read some of the other reviews before taking a used copy of this from Amazon and I was glad I did. Having been presented for the first time at Park works through Oldboy, I was curious to know how he would handle the genre and was quite satisfied with the clever way he performed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because, while Oldboy and some of his other works have a very nice and deliberate photographic work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I hadn't seen in other vampire films. For example, the scene in which Father Hyeon is making the "beast" that grows inside him while giving his shoes to the Tae-Ju always barefoot and is able to SEE the blood that pumps through the skin of the Tae-ju and his eye widens in the desire for blood for this. It was a nice effect. I was also happy that Park did not come up with the film's crap and that it is indeed a small CG. I came away from Bakjwi who was totally ready to think that something would happen and be taken for a ride in the real Park fashion. Also, I liked that Park played with a bit of symbolism and a turnaround, but it's not usually about Asian cinema. During the beginning of the film we see the plot developing slowly and getting to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that is transpiring. Park treats you a bit like the future of Ghost of Christmas that comes to show you, even if a little boring, what life is like outside your world. Ah, but then we begin to feel a little affinity with the dejected father and his nascent yearning for Tae-ju and the conflict with the duty of a priest. We almost begin to take root for them even until Park gives us back so well to reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a film about moral and right and wrong dilemma. It won't spoil you if I tell you to look at Bakjwi from the mind of a priest and I think you're going to leave with what Park wants you to come away. Don't expect Oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here. A really interesting interpretation of the genre. Those who lacked many literary elements and religious allusions witnessed other films, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, look at Let The Right One IN, it's not even what you expect.
