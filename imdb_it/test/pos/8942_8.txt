Wales seems to be filming some eccentric films recently. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. But Plots with a View is not just bizarre, it's fun to laugh out loud, has a cast of talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is incredible), and a plot that, although not entirely original, is so cleverly written that you're always happily gathering on what could be almost lines of flight. It was the kind of film I wanted to see again right away that it was finished, and one of the very few I really want to own. Although many of the characters are caricatures, and you must have been in a Welsh village to appreciate it, they are also very human, and the relationship between Blethyn and Molina is a joy to see.
