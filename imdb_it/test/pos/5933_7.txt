The Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favorite events, and I've been a wrestling fan for some years. The other shows may have better matches, but I have always found that the game of the real rumble is full of excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to reveal the winners of a game because I don't see it is right to ruin the results on a review. However I will comment on the quality of these. <br /> <br /> We have the 4 standard games, and then the big rumble event. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Edge open for Raw. This proves to be a good match for two talented guys. This is a game I would recommend to watch. It is difficult to summarize without giving away the winner. <br /> <br /> Then we have the usual Undertaker against an evil monster, whoever he is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala ... well this time it's Heidenreich. It is also a casket game. Typical Undertaker rate. See if you're a fan. I have to admit that I am, just for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be considered a classic wrestling match. <br /> <br /> The next two games are the title matches. For once, Smackdown manages to overcome the raw. Their title game is rather exciting and enjoyable, but with an anti-climax and disappointment to end it. The Raw game is a pretty boring and boring affair, which is a shame because I'm a fan of both boys involved. <br /> <br /> Now, for the main reason I love the event, the roar. It's pretty good this year. Coming to the event we all had a good idea of ​​who could win, and it might not be a big surprise, but hey, it's very funny. There are the usual different ways of eliminating people. There is the token that does not arrive in the ring, the participant who is ridiculous and we all want to see defeated, and someone is eliminated by a previously eliminated fighter. He has his usual ups and downs, and I loved the ending, especially the entry of Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show. WWE is not in top form, but it is still valid. Add it to your collection.
