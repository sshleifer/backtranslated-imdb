Romanian cinema is little known from Romania. No Romanian director has come to the attention of the international public, as some of other Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Czekoslowakia or Yugoslavia have managed to do so. One of the few great directors of Romanian cinema is Lucian Pintilie, who 35 years ago directed a great film "Reconstituirea", quickly taken from the circuit by communist censorship. After that film, still a reference for Romanian cinema, Pintilie was not allowed to freely create in Romania until the fall of the communist regime in 1989. <br /> <br /> 'Fury' reminds me of the Pintilie film 35 Years ago. The title means "The Rage" and I can't imagine why the distributors chose to translate it differently. It is a lost generation. While in the classic of Pintilie the root of evil is in the oppression and lies of the communist regime, here young people need to face the emergence of sub-culture, and the moral filth that has filled the void left by the totalitarian rule . The end is tragic and painfully awaited. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed and the acting is good. Without too much complexity, he manages to create an emotional bond between the characters and the viewer. It could be said that some situations seem similar to "8 miles" or "Fasting and the furious" - but look at the production date! This film was made at the same time, if not before the Western peers. If this is really the first film by director Dan Munteanu, as IMDB says, it is an exceptional debut. In any case, a good movie can compete and can sell well on the western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films that with a little luck and good distribution will make its place in the international cinema scene. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale.
