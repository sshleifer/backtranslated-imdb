Leaving aside the drawbacks and shortcomings of the film mentioned by other viewers, I must say that it seemed like a film about power, which in my opinion is one of the most compelling illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to ask a question about what the benefit of the nation is and what the price of "happiness" is for everyone. Is there justification for forced benefit and "happiness"? How much can be lost for the security and peaceful existence of the nation? Is the idea of ​​a powerful aspiring empire worth reducing to poverty and killing thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and try to learn it as long as the film runs. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically tormented by the discovery of his true origin. He almost seems to hate his subjects for having renounced his father and his love, loving people like a good emperor. No wonder his actions are controversial and his emotions confused. It seems to me that, like another film that presents the problem of human power compared to other men, the film is a success.
