I only went to see this movie because I always liked Kevin Costner. I heard that Ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect. Unfortunately, even though these two actors were / are capable of good if not great moments of acting, some of these were missing here. Some scenes were simply not credible and didn't have enough support for the plot. <br /> <br /> Although the film supports the influence of Hurricane Katrina, there was not much (anyone) to do so in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the fact that the film brought to the fore what is needed to save lives from a water perspective. <br /> <br /> The special effects were quite good and more than a little intimidating. I'm not sure I'll ever go deep fishing again ... <br /> <br /> I was expecting a little more excitement in the film than what was presented. <br /> <br /> Surely a movie that could have been seen on DVD.
