I think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me. It's obviously obvious once you look at it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for The Simpsons bullies. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney and Tony is Dolph. There is also an episode of The Simpsons in which Jimbo uses the phrase "I hit her with a stick." <br /> <br /> The Jimbo-Layne connection is the most obvious with a knitted hat, long hair and voice. Kearney has a shaved head, unlike John, but he is big and silent. The Tony-Dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long haircut and even second-level status.
