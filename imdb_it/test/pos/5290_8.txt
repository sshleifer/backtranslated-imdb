I've read many different opinions and reviews on this film, and I understand why many people experience mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it's the plot, the animation, the dialogue and so on. And I think the easiest way I can answer that, is that it's a film for a much younger age group. A much younger age group than that of Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). Being a fan of Miyazaki like most surfers on this site, I expected a wonderful animation, musical composition, complex stories, the great constant development of the characters, as the story is intertwined with today's society, etc. etc. etc. of a typical Miyazaki movie we grew up with. And to tell you the truth, I didn't quite understand what the hell this story should be or what the hell was going on up to an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes left in the film), that this movie is NOT for deep thinkers and Ghibli - pits, but for young children and young people and happy go Japanese lucky. Furthermore, I believe this film is based on simplicity and creative animation; Ghibli Studios straight grassy roots. <br /> <br /> The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, apart from his father and maybe that absurd typhoon. But apart from that, this film is simply fun; stimulate the mind of a young person and make happy the good time. That's all. <br /> <br /> Animation dates back to the first half of the 80s of the 90s era of Miyazaki films, where very specific details were not very important, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke ) and the latter. I admire the simplicity that created a bit of nostalgia when I first saw Ghibli's films like Tonarino Totoro when I was a child. The reaction and movement of children are all very similar to those of children, and a lot of body language from the Studio Ghibli is very obvious. Studio Ghibli has added some creative moments and scenarios that they can only do with his wonderful animators, but he probably won't take the Ghibli-ist ritual in awe. <br /> <br /> Even the Japanese dialect seemed very suitable for children and many scenes and dialogues are very, very related to what Japanese children and mothers would say and act. The music if very hoppy and "soft" I guess you can say (similar to Totoro) from beginning to end. Even the darkest scenes didn't seem assertive. <br /> <br /> In the end this film is one of a kind. Almost every aspect of this film is for children. And I waited a full 80 minutes to realize it. Frankly, I've never seen a movie told or shown as Miyazaki. It's nice to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story for a wider and more diverse audience, while still maintaining the imprint of the Ghibli brand.
