This was / is an incredible film, with an incredible cast, music, song, stories, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Preminger) can prevent them from being available from generation to generation. I wanted to see it all my life again. I just found this site and I read why it wasn't available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and has never seen the movie. Not even my stepchildren or my grandchildren. It is very sad that a film of this depth and quality is not available for them to see. From where these families come out taking such a presumptuous, self-important, self-centering and condescending decision to forbid generations from enjoying this movie, these stars, these performances, this music! Release the video and let the world judge and appreciate!
