This film represents the early eighties and FUN !! I remember seeing this movie on HBO when I was a kid, and it was my favorite movie. For some time, no one I have ever met knew what it was. Then, roughly when my roommate said he had seen it too, and that it was his favorite, they started printing it again !! Fortunately, I have a copy now !! If anyone ever wants to see the biggest (fat) treasure hunt that was probably the initial idea of ​​hazing for the friars, this movie is !!! (Observer - must have a serious love for 80s type movies !!)
