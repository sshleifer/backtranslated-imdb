I can't stand people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as "too graphic" or "useless graphics" or that contain "free nudity / violence / sodomy" etc. <br /> <br /> Guess what? Prison life is not PG-13. The "free" graphic content is TRUE FOR LIFE of this situation. The prison contains rapes / murders / drugs and showers. If you don't like it, then don't look at the program. I'm certainly not a fan of prison rape, but if he had been excluded from the show I would be surprised and give less credibility to the show. If the prisoners did not curse, it would simply be foolish. Certainly it is a free language, but this is REALISTIC. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some of the spectators .... not so much, I guess.
