An excellent film about anti-Semitism towards the end of the Second World War. The scene that really speaks loudly of the ignorance of these people is the meeting in church when the priest speaks his speech against "the international grubbers and communists". It seems surprisingly like the speeches that Adolph Hitler used to force the throats of his people, but none of the meeting participants seems to make this comparison.
