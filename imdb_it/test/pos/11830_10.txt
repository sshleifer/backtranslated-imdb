A rich young man, raised as a SON OF THE GODS, must confront his Chinese heritage while living in a white world. <br /> <br /> Although the premise on which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot, revealed at the conclusion of the film, makes everything that preceded it a bit ridiculous , history continues to offer discreet entertainment and good acting. <br /> <br /> Richard Barthelmess has the role of the protagonist Oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he seems Caucasian. Barthelmess maintains the tone of his performance seriously, staring intently at the middle ground (a mannerism he developed during Silent Days) whenever his character is indecently abused. He makes no attempt to replicate his classical interpretation in BROKEN BLOSSOMS (1919) by D. W. Griffith and this is to his credit. The beautiful Constance Bennett is the daughter of the millionaire who makes Barthelmess unhappy. She is as beautiful as ever, but her behavior does not make her fond of the viewer and her terrible illness on the last roll is mercifully kept off screen. <br /> <br /> The talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess' impromptu friend. Serene E. Alyn Warren and the bold Anders Randolf play very different fathers among the star stars, while Claude King distinguishes his brief appearance as an English author who makes friends with Barthelmess. <br /> <br /> The film stars will recognize the young Dickie Moore, uncredited, playing Barthelmess as a small child. <br /> <br /> The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence faded with time into a ruddy shade. The shot that claims to be the south of France instead seems suspiciously like Avalon on the island of Santa Catalina, off the coast of Southern California.
