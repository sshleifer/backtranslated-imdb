Never Been Kissed gives Drew Barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. Return to high school and make the necessary corrections. Actually the first time for me was pretty bad and at my age I doubt I could take it off the way Drew does. <br /> <br /> Of course the reason could also be that once we leave high school it is like leaving a cocoon and we are dealing with the great hostile world out there. I met some of them in my life who would come back and stay if they could. In fact there is an episode of Law and Order that explores the dark side of this same situation. A girl young enough to do it, she goes to high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles in her secret. <br /> <br /> With Drew it's a task. She's a script editor for the Chicago Sun Times who wants to be a journalist. The publisher Garry Marshall, who plays the part as Donald Trump took over the Sun Times, has this brilliant idea and sees in Barrymore a person young enough to appear in mask. <br /> <br /> High School the first time was pretty bad. Drew was not the most popular of the time and would not improve the second time. That is until his brother David Arquette returns to school and helps her overcome problems. <br /> <br /> Of course this raises a lot of problems for Drew, peer pressure from two sources, work and school. What should a girl do? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is a light and fascinating comedy that to its credit misses the opportunity to be wildly exploitative and gives us good entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet and his performance in moments of stress for his character moves nicely in pathos. Michael Vartan as an English teacher is the kind I would like there to be more in education and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a couple of cool headless guys with whom Drew desperately tries to connect. <br /> <br /> It still doesn't inspire me to go back to Midwood High School.
