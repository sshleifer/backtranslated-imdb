Little Dieter Needs Fly was my first film during the 1999 GÃ¶teborg Filmfestival. Since I was extremely tired that night, I was hesitant to see it, but the overall score of 9 incredible here on IMDB made me go there. <br /> <br /> It was 80 minutes of pure life force! Experiencing the life of Dieter Denglers through his way of telling has been enchanting. <br /> <br /> SEE IT! And if possible ... watch it at the cinema!
