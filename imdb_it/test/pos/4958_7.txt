I'm sorry, but I can't help it, I like watching Iron Eagle. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a great movie. No, rather, I would say that this is an infinitely fun movie. For people who cut this film to pieces so as not to be realistic, the point is missing a bit. Obviously the Iron Eagle plot was ridiculous. But I think his target audience was children, and I sure remember having found this cool when I was little. Now I find it fun as a guilty pleasure, a bit like Road House. This film is part of the great pantheon of the 80s, films for children that take-for-the-power-adult-power-structure. You must remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, just watching Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" in the beginning is worth the cost of the DVD. This whole sequence was so STUPID! But at the same time, it was fun, fun, totally 80s, all good stuff. So, after all, Iron Eagle is a great guilty pleasure from the 1980s. Hairstyles, dances, music, dialogues, it's all very funny. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and for me it was a total value of $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you love laughing at outdated and unrealistic action films, this is a must see. Oh yes, and I think his plot was only marginally more stupid than that of the 1986 action pilot, Top Gun.
