I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed to be in place for a funny, if not revolutionary film. It was set in the south of France, good-looking and recognizable actors led the cast, and I really admired the lively African customs, proverbs and music. Despite all this, I didn't love it. Movies should convey their meaning to the first vision, but "Secret Laughter" does not. Nimi and Matthew, played by Long and Firth (both have already interpreted romantic songs and should have known better), emanate heat and passion like dried fish. I deliberately used "dried fish" because it was one of the few - too few - strong lines and scattered moments throughout the film. Another winner was when Nimi surprised Matthew to poke his nose into his apartment. He finds his book with his name written on it and says: "Your name is Nimi, I never knew it." Then he insists that you call him by his first name. I looked closely at this scene while Matthew asked Nimi over and over again to "say my name", realizing that until that moment they were always called by their last name. I thought this was a turning point for the film and I expected it to improve. It was not so. Why does Nimi and Matthew always seem to be at ten paces, even in the "say my name" scene? What does Matthew of Nimi do, apart from his obvious beauty? And why does a sensible woman like Nimi fall in love with a comic book writer who sees her marriage as something she can put on hold when a beautiful exotic "adventure" arrives? And I would like to add that it was a bit difficult for me to stay behind a love story built on adultery. Yes, Jenny is a wicked harpy, but if I were in her shoes, I would probably be compatible with her Cruella tactics to prevent my husband from being misled. Believe it The story suggests Nimi's painful past, but he never completely explores it. Some critics say that Firth seemed a little awkward here, and I agree. For heaven's sake, the actor has evoked the most palpable desire and passion of that early nineteenth-century snob Mr. Darcy (and while wearing those horrible pimples)! As for Long, who shone in "Love Jones", there were moments when he seemed to focus more on his accent than on his character. Even so, have there been many moments ?? the scene 'say my name' between them ?? when he had total control and came across really well. Yet, "Secret Laughter" is not without its ransom qualities, and I discovered that it grew on me with more visions. Nene has been well interpreted as supportive and well-intentioned, although she does not fully understand Nimi's attraction to Matthew. I loved it when Nene fought with Mama Fola in those scenes of proverb duels. My husband liked it, and he's usually the first to sigh and throw insults on the screen if he doesn't like what's going on. He even chuckled on the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very sincere questions about sex. So that's it. "Secret Laughter" was good enough to entertain a declared murmur as my hubby, but a greedy spectator like me will need more than a vision to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey.
