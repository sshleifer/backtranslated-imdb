I didn't know what to expect. I only saw it on a rainy Sunday afternoon on pay TV. From the beginning it attracted me. The music, settings and characters were excellent. I had never heard any of the actors, but they were all exceptional. A wonderful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now that I have read other comments on this film in reference to previous versions and the book, I will try to find out more about this great film
