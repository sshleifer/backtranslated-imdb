This film is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is clear, the pace is fast. Not only is this a clever comedy, it's an interesting look at what happens behind the scenes in the television news industry. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny lines ... a couple of my favorites: <br /> <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe to know better, to always think to be the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's terrible !! <br /> <br /> Aaron: Must be good-looking Jane: How do you know? Aaron: Nobody invites a bad-looking idiot into their room! <br /> <br /> The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully fun Joan Cusack! I love the scene where the editorial staff runs to get past a deadline. There are so many fun scenes that it's hard to choose a favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
