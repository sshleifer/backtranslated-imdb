the fact that there was so much clamor is ironic, since the whole point of the program was to highlight the way in which the media treat these "taboo" topics, such as pedophilia. the newspaper set, the outfits, the smug presenters, the men in the scene shouting about things that can be seen behind them, the useless graphs and statistics, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire . the way in which c-list celebrity will say absolutely nothing if their agent tells them that it will be good for their career ("there is no proof, but it is a scientific fact"). It might be hard to look at (with milly dowler and cambridgeshire girls, as well as 9/11), but satire should be challenging, and we shouldn't be afraid to face the resounding scaremongering and the media-grabbing title, only because it is a sensitive issue. How this show failed to win any TV awards for the fact that intelligence, observation, courage, acting and thought provoking are shameful, but, watching him show you, it's not surprising.
