this movie is weird but i loved it. it's a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messy honeymoon. he doesn't love his back and he's a bad son of a bitch. he starts to love her after something really happened happened during their honeymoon, I won't give it away. it's weird yes !! but different from other films in a good way I think. I don't know what to compare it to but it is a love story. but it also has a lot of fun things. how to see James Franco in a wig. I really liked the Notebook and it seemed so because of the love story. but the rest is very different. nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this film to a test grader because I really like his fashion. I liked it in a factory girl but this is a better film than it used to be. she and james franco seem really in love with this movie and I hope they are together in real life but I don't know <br /> <br /> seeing it !!!!
