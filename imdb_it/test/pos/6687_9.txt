I don't usually like movies with / about aliens but K-PAX is different. The actors are fantastic in the film - in particular Kevin Spacey played his character breathless! The film never falls to a lower level - the suspense is always in the film and you absolutely want to know how it ends, what is Prot ... You have to think a lot after the film for the film because there are some open questions .. It is Robert Porter Prot or is Prot only using the body of Robert Porters as a means of transport. How can you see uv light and how can you know a lot about astrology. But everyone can end their life and decide what they want to believe. Great movie with excellent Kevin Spacey!
