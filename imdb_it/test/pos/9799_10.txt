This story is an excellent story of two boys doing everything they can to get away from the abusive drunk father. The star "Lord of the Rings" Elijah Wood is exceptional in this unforgettable role. This film is one of the main reasons why I didn't touch a single beer and I'll never do it while I live. This may make me look like a nerd, but that's what I have to say. It is a wonder because this is not felt as a classic American tale.
