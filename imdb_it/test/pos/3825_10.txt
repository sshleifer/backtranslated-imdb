What can I say about the series nicknamed NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only this was one of the best TV series ever assembled !! You have actors of all ages, actors who are somehow known and that time has forgotten. Everyone does their part for exact perfection! These shows always have some kind of moral history for them that most of the time (if not always) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed into the credits and at the beginning and at the end believes in what he is saying with all his heart! Not only do these shows have great narrative lines, but they also throw you in them, drive you crazy and make you pump blood. The original external limits were black and white in the 1960s, these shows made a triumphant return as I had never seen them before! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the new EXTERNAL LIMITS are where it is! If you haven't seen it, I'm begging you to check out these episodes and you'll see exactly what I mean! LIVING THE NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
