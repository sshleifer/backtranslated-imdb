I waited 9 years to watch this movie, simply because I never saw it advertised on TV. In the end I got it and it was worth the wait. It's much better than your overcrowded scream or last summer's trash because it's all at a pretty fast pace, with no extraction, crawling around the house down to poor music scenes. Only the ugly dubbing makes it lower a little, but don't let it discourage you in any way. What's underneath - above hyped and crap. Mute testimony - low budget, not advertised at all and very good.
