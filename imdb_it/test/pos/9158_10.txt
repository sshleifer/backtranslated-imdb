As far as I can remember, my family insisted on staying home the night "Nichols" was on (Monday? Tuesday? NBC?). It was an excellent vehicle for James Garner, very well written, great cast of ensembles. His character looks a lot like the films "Support Your Local ...": a retired player with a mysterious past settles in the city and has adventures every week. In fact, it seemed pretty obvious that it was the same character. He was just a charmer of a TV show. A sleeper, like "My world and welcome to it", which may have been his contemporary - I forgot. I really want these shows to be made available on DVD. It was just a good TV. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." come close, but only for a mile.
