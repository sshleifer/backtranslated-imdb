Although it is not labeled as a Slasher movie, it has all the elements. The fact that the coupons are well known for its limited budget, lame plot, cheese effects and all you can add, does not mean that there can be no good slasher movies. "Opera" fills the description. Even if it is part of Italian yellow; which is anything but a slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento shows he deserves the label of one of the best directors of Horror. "Opera" is one of the most elegant horror films of the last 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful and shining place; situations and gore make it one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I think of "Opera" as an elegant Slasher, even if there is a deep storyline and character development. The cheese factor often used in most Slasher films is not present here, but in return we got a suspenseful and visually surprising tale of gore. The plot of the film is simple (as in any Slasher). There is a psycho in the work that is somehow obsessed by the main actress / singer and forces her to look macabre dead. The scenes of death are extremely gruesome and are the best thing about the movie. The infamous "peep-hole" death scene is the strong point of the film in my opinion. It's a terrifying death scene that none other than Silver could release. The knife through the neck (and mouth) is another gruesome but less violent scene than the death of the scissors. The blood in "Opera" will please the wicked and the lovers of violence. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about the film is the lack of coherence or logic. I mean, after seeing the first death, the female protagonist calmed down as if nothing had happened for a ride home and it's not a big deal for what she saw. Furthermore, she is left alone at home and takes no security measures. However, the suspense in the film makes you forget the lack of logic. Silver knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. For example, when Betty's friend tells her that someone is watching her from outside, she goes crazy and puts suspense in case something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is fantastic. For an Italian yellow it is excellent. POV's creative shots of Argento are impressive. Crows have also added a disturbing feeling to the film. Silver adds its own unique spice. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is one of the most undervalued, but popular through the horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: - the surprise (brilliant) death scene - the raven attack at the end - opera scene - the knife through the neck and the mouth - the heavy metal score combined with Opera music (this music never scared me before) - the killer ferocity <br /> <br /> The one something I don't like about "Opera" are the heavy metal songs used in the scenes of death. It's okay to disturb the audience, but I think Opera's music may have added a more disturbing feeling. However, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a singular and disturbing aspect in the film. <br /> <br /> Watch "Opera" even if you don't like coolness. There is a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical person. This is not "Suspiria", but it deserves to be among the best in Argento.
