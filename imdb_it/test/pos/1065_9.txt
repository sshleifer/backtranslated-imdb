In the end it hit me by watching my Christmas VHS in Connecticut what other movie reminded me of this. If it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake. <br /> <br /> Just like Rock Hudson was a fake fishing expert for Abercrombie & Fitch who had to get some of it, Barbara Stanwyck plays a 40-year-old version of Martha Stewart. About Martha Stewart's job training. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a kitchen columnist who built the entire image of living on a small Connecticut farm with a husband and puppies who cook all these wonderful delicacies. The problem is that she's not married, childless , writes his column from his apartment in New York and doesn't know how to boil water. But his way of writing is a success with the public. <br /> <br /> The trouble comes when she is abducted to cook a Christmas dinner for a sailor of war heroes played by Dennis Morgan who can also sing a couple of songs. I have to keep the image at all costs. And its publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea of ​​having dinner. <br /> <br /> So, with the farm on loan, small, and Reginald Gardiner who would like to make it real with Stanwyck, she tries to challenge through. <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a Yuletide classic and deservedly. Leads are warm and human and receive great support from the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall is the owner of the Hungarian restaurant / friend of Stanwyck from which he receives information about his kitchen and Una O'Connor as the housekeeper have a good understanding between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck don't have any kind of chemistry, obvious to everyone except Reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt style. <br /> <br /> Many people remember this film as one of the few adventures of Sidney Greenstreet in the comedy. If he is not a real criminal, a cynical life watcher or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is a few other things on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and made the most of it. <br /> <br /> In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she remembers that she enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some evil parts like Double Indemnity she had recently made. One of the things that made the movie so much fun was that between the shootings, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would make a fun cast and crew entertainment with the English Music Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly. <br /> <br /> Now if only someone had filmed those numbers.
