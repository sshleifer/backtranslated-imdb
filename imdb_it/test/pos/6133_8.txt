I came across this movie casually. I was traveling a few years ago and this movie was on a cable channel in a hotel late one night. Not much else and I thought I'd watch it for about 20 or 30 minutes until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I stayed awake and watched the full movie. The plot was very interesting and makes you wonder if there were not the SS who did this or at least thought to do it. I've been looking for this movie everywhere. I even sent emails to the production company, but I wasn't sure it would ever come to DVDs, but I said there was always hope. If anyone finds this movie, leave a note here where you found it, since I'd like to have a copy one day.
