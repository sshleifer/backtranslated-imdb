Having finally achieved this "masterpiece", it seems to me that it must have seemed terribly intelligent, in its time. It is French, artistic, undervalued to the point of agonizing and ultimately disappointing. But seen from the perspective of 37 years in the future, it is also just a bit empty, pretentious and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Others have summarized the story, but I don't think anyone pointed to the dramatic flaw in the heart of this film: the protagonists, Corey and Vogel, don't really deserve what they get. They play squared in their code, they never hurt anyone who doesn't ask for it and show great courage and initiative. In addition, Corey in particular is a victim of his former gangland friend, who stole his girlfriend and repeatedly tries to kill him, apparently just because he (Corey) dared "borrow" a few thousand francs. These are guys that should be due for a break! Instead, things are much worse for them than they really need, in the logic of history. <br /> <br /> It could be argued that this is the point: that the real villains are never discovered; who collude with the police, if necessary, sell their friends and always come out on top. But it is not even shown. Corey's old gangster friend is not colluding with the police. Nor does he show gloating for his victory. In fact, after having materialized several times when it is necessary, one cannot see anywhere at the end, leaving a dramatic tension (his feud with Corey) completely unresolved! <br /> <br /> However, I would say that this film is worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow and deliberate rhythm, its great impassive performances, its elaborate robbery sequence and its style encapsulation artistic film of the late 60s.
