Therefore it is important to talk about the release of the DVD instead of just the film. Tales from the Crapper is a film that only a studio in the world could offer. What gave us innovative and original REAL independent films for over 30 years: Troma. This is really a very special film because it can certainly not be my favorite of Troma productions, but it was released on a record that, for what I just said, is one of my most appreciated and favorite DVDs. Not only counting the countless Troma discs I own, but counting my entire film collection. The film itself is the result of a sick plan for the making of a television series directed by a director who has been entrusted with a considerable amount of money (especially for Troma) to make something wonderful and deliver a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material first quit (or be fired, I'm not sure what the time is). To avoid having to spend a large investment in the bathroom, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to bring together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of a film. A film that is actually composed of two, in the beautiful anthology of Tales From The Crypt, hosted by the Crapkeeper starring Kaufman himself. But, as I said, not really my favorite of all their films. This is largely due to a strange sense of discipline in the various sets, forgetting Troma's harsh rule of "no alcohol on the set" discovered by a furious Lloyd and other less respectable employees that Troma had at the time of shooting. of the added scenes. All of this made it almost impossible for Mr Kaufman to make a valid product in the editing room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius and, with the disturbing scenes added to an already deformed starting product, was not conceived as a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances would allow the most brilliant director to work together and is certainly very funny, totally confused, full of those elements that have made Troma great and certainly unique and one of a kind. Like a film in itself, though, not as bright as many other Troma productions. However, the genius of Independent Cinema has made the DVD of this film much more than a version of a movie with some extras. The film is, when the thrust arrives, in reality only a part of the whole DVD which as a whole is a document of the difficult situation serious directors find themselves having to survive in a world that is monopolized by the few Very Great ones who do not really allow to other players on their market. A document of the problems you have when you trust people to be at the level, only to discover that freedom is sometimes something difficult to live and the awareness that access to a film's budget when the Boss is not in around can corrupt even those who should really know better. The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect, and that Lloyd KNOWS it, and does not want anyone to believe that it is. The full-length commentary is a show in itself (as often happens with Kaufan's audio commentaries), mixing humor, jeers to those who deserve it and very interesting information for anyone interested in making independent films in such a way that watching the film again with this comment immediately after seeing it for its merits is so interesting that it's hard to quit. The documentary feature film THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes in the various places where Lloyd visits the sets only to take over and make the most of what he finds there. We see him a bit disillusioned at times, different from his appearances in other Making of Documents documents like Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon, both present in the tool set MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE. <br /> <br /> The scenes added with James Gunn (who began his career at Troma only to find success as a writer and now director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone who started with a work published by Troma ), to be a national hero with his South Park series) they are fun and probably (like much in this version) a reason to get this record on their own for anyone with a remote interest in the work of these two characters. Loaded with much more than I could mention here (including a SECOND audio commentary) this is one of the best versions of Troma-DVD.
