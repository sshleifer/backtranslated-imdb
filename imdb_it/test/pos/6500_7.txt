... scratch it. Just as the African rhythms created with the jaws of a donkey and Virgin Islanders have welded oil drums into steel bands pleasing to the ear, so did the urban DJ's itch to scratch the search for new methods of creative expression. "Scratch" is a totally unjustified documentary that will take you to the heart of the hip-hop / rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl and the ultimate expression of DJ / MC entertainment. The film reveals some surprisingly clever and articulate "Scratchers" with extraordinarily unique skills in concert and competition where rhythm meets the road. Good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto movements in sound art. (B)
