The best years of our lives are often compared to It is a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that has required millions of lives. It is difficult to know what value individual life can have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? With what statistics we have to live with.) Even our feelings about the war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved away from thinking that war is only if the enemy is the right one to believe that no war is totally right, especially those that have been fought recently. <br /> <br /> I've been a pacifist all my life. I object to the whole war. Not long ago I had that tested position. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that was 3 or 4 times the community I live in. It is a powerful experience, moving on its bridges. He had seen a great deal of action. Someone gave me the right to be a pacifist and was not bought cheaply. <br /> <br /> I can't look at the best years of our lives without thinking about things like Lexington. <br /> <br /> of the three veterans paid their debts. And they paid mine too. <br /> <br /> None of them came out easier than any other. The navy, the aeronautics and the army paid similarly, albeit in different ways. Everyone had problems directly related to the war. And everyone had to work very hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilized environments than it was to face the war, because everyone had to do it alone. Everyone could understand and sympathize with the problem of others: ultimately no one could help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the film (this could be the initial part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male hosts found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is difficult for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he was a football hero and an athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens. <br /> <br /> The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Do you keep your relationship with your wife ?? standard fair for films from the 30s / 40s. Derry did not discuss the point: he felt it was not suitable for Al's daughter. So he accepted. The truth of the film emerges when we believe that the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings, feelings and honor. Sometimes I think we believe these values ​​do not exist. This is perhaps why people watching this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Al is not without advice that he does not want totally. Every time his boss talks to him, Al is tied to knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by employment standards: they must be judged by huge general intangible assets and only someone tested by the gravity of life could understand what these intangible assets are. <br /> <br /> All this leads to a scene towards the end, where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon recycled: their function, value and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome the translucency he does, making him fit, in his mind, to the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are a few films that I feel like this about. This is not a popcorn movie. It deserves our attention. We are privileged to witness something as private as the lives of these wonderful people. We should be careful not to abuse this privilege.
