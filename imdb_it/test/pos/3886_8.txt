Garlin exceeds himself as a writer-director-actor in his independent production of a great boy (Garlin) who wanders through Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughter continues to come almost every minute. It's a rather dramatic and serious story about a man in search of love, but made with great comic writing and acting. The secondary roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her role as receptionist, bringing you directly to the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is fantastic with some of the great pieces she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically exceptional in her role. I just hope there's more of her in the film, because I think most will agree. Surely it is nice to see her again with a leather suit. David Pasquesi was the detached and detached attache, and the voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother with whom she lives. There were numerous other cameos, all done very well. <br /> <br /> Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie due to production problems. Anyway, it's nice to let you want more. I think it's the indie thing to keep some things ambiguous to allow the public to think for itself about filling in the blanks. The long-winded title should lead you to this. <br /> <br /> Jeff said that some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships. This explains why they work so well. People in real life are always unusually colorful and make great characters. He moves away from what you would expect, after seeing Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other works. It is one of those things in which an actor takes risks to do something that maybe they always wanted to do but could not. <br /> <br /> I think Garlin's Second City improvisational background is noteworthy, and Hunt's background for that matter, set the acting style here as the fulcrum of the plot and direction. It is perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improvisation and independent film.
