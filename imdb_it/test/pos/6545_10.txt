I remember seeing this movie many years ago on VHS in a friend's place. At first I thought it would be a boring car movie. But to my surprise it has become one of the best films I remember seeing for his time. <br /> <br /> It has a good plot and, above all, has some fantastic Australian cars and street racing. I really loved the Fox car that was a working Dodge Charger. The painting work that was done on this machine was truly exceptional in my opinion :)! <br /> <br /> There is also a two-door black blown 57 Chev that comes in the film later. <br /> <br /> I managed to get a copy of this VHS movie last year at K-Mart here in Australia. I intended to convert this movie to DVD myself because I believe it is a movie worthy of conversion. But to my surprise this weekend as I was browsing the DVD movie basket, I found it on DVD. So, of course, I grabbed it while I could since it was the only copy there. <br /> <br /> Anyway if you really want to see some classic road races with real muscle machines, including a great plot without intuition rice burner. Then this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here are some additional information taken from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> It will win at any cost Fox is a young man who lives in the fast lane. He believes he is the fastest man on the road - but road racing is illegal. If he doesn't accept his last challenge, he could lose his girlfriend ... if he accepts, he could lose his life. Living dangerously, living fast and winning at all costs is their obsession. They don't turn around, they don't give up ... and they don't ask for help.
