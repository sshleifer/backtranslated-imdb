Crackerjack is a hit movie set in the Cityside Australian suburban lawn bowling club. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has marked free parking spaces at Cityside. When the club is put under pressure to install poker machines on its premises, it is necessary to raise $ 8,000 to prevent this from happening. The club needs new members to help and this is where the character of Mick Molloys comes into play and he must tail to save the club. With many emerging and growing Australian actors, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a lawn bowling knowledge, but there are many fun sight gags that provide comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy are the co-stars. In general, the film should be recommended for people who play bowls or have played, but there is enough extra material for a fun game if you have a slight understanding. If you like Australian humor I suggest you get bowling and go to the theater because this is the first comedy of the year in which the bowling green is held (also the only one).
