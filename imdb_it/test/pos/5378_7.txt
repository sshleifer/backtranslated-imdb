I had no idea what I would see when I decided to watch this movie and to my surprise it is just an extremely well done horror film that is easily one of the best of the 70s. The film is obviously low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of a film creates chills, not special effects! Strother Martin is one of the great actors of the character of all time and has a rare starring role here and the film also sees the good friend of Martins, L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore have contributed to the production of this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and beauty of "Enter the Dragon" Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and is simply beautiful to watch! The film does a great job of staying with the story and doesn't add a fake nice ending and I really liked the way the movie ends. Great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by Bernard McEveety. Martins' performance is top notch also because he does not hold back and really throws himself into the role of Doc. A good and undervalued film!
