I don't understand why this film has such a low rating. It deserves absolutely more! Of course, it's completely ridiculous, but that's what it had to be. Don't expect the cinematic transcendence from a movie about competitors in beauty shows stuck on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a huge parody of almost all sci-fi, fantasy and block-buster movies in film history, and even references to other spoofers. All completely exaggerated and sometimes totally unnecessary, but that's exactly what sets this film apart. If you like parodies and love to say Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you'll like it. I certainly did it!
