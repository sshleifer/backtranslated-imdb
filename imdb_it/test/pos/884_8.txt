Although I saw this film in Korea, in Korean, and therefore I didn't understand the language, the images certainly say more than enough. From what I can make of it, this is the story: two superb swordsmen become friends in their service as guard of the king. One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and begins to assassinate important men. The other must hunt him down. This film is visually fantastic. Sword fighting is fantastic. And the film has a compelling end. I just hope this movie will be marketed to viewers of Western cinema. And to be published on DVD, of course.
