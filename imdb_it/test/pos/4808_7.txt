Running Out of Time rests somewhere in the middle of Johnny To's cannon, in the "solid good" category. As a crime thriller, it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes won't leave you breathless but have something else to do. It's a Johnny To movie, after all, must. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau has 72 hours of life. He decides to play a strange cat and mouse game with a Hong Kong police hostage negotiator, played by Lau Ching Wan. This is the plot in a nutshell. On top of this, it piles up layers of twists that keep the processes interesting. Occasionally he becomes too twisted for himself, but he never lets it get the best of it. However, just as Johnny To is about to deliver a well-made and well-made criminal movie (which, let's face it, is a dozen), slips into pieces that bring Running Out of Time alive as a full emotional experience, providing the soul the heart to the skeleton well oiled. <br /> <br /> The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (paper clips in his work) are explored very effectively here. Always thin, letting the images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shot, an exemplary score cut, that's all. A little love story in a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple but so powerful. Ditto for the Lau and Lau Ching Wan scenes and the bowling alley showdown. <br /> <br /> However, something prevents me from saying that Running Out of Time is a masterpiece. Having all the craft skills and abilities up to a notch, but sometimes it can even be too professional or tasteless. When he's good, it's REAL REAL. There are also isolated moments of pure brilliance that are TOO good for their own interest, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the film. I am convinced that if you put your heart into it, you can make a really great movie. As it is, this is another of his films that is imperfect but fun. Under the elegant HK style, it is the black humor and the sorrowful drama that makes this film compelling. Definitely worth a look.
