I was lucky enough to see a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I have to say that I expected a horribly cheap film with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely wrong. This film was not only incredibly fun, but everything I simply loved. Bruce Campbell was fantastic as always. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and intelligent dialogue, he did nothing but shine. But I can't really ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell. Even though I thought Ted Raimi had stolen the show, Bruce did what he does best on the big screen. Somewhere between the sketchy American businessman and the tragic victim, he showed the same energy that has always proved to be incredibly attractive to the public. The film itself has often been interrupted by applause from the spectators. The crowd was definitely excited about every little twist the film took. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be an Oscar material, but my God, it was great. I highly recommend it to all Bruce Campbell fans. Also, to all those who like campy sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch it. I can't wait for the DVD to arrive. <br /> <br /> Take it the way you want .... <br /> <br /> - fed
