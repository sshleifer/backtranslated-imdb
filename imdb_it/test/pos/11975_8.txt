When a saboteur detonates a controversial government research lab, two experimental animals are released into a small community in Washington State. One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is a "Outside eXperimental COmbat Mammal" or "OXCOM". Due to further disclosure reasons in the film, the Oxcom hates the dog, and so is trying to kill it. Observers relate to the accidental involvement of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with the dog and the oxcom, as two agents of the National Security Organization, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff (Blue Mankuma), track them down. <br /> <br /> Many comments are made about Watcher which is very different from the book by Dean Koontz which acts as a springboard for the film. This is true. But it should not affect your assessment. If you want the book, read the book. Judge the film for its merits, not for how closely it matches the book. Bill Freed and Damian Lee, who wrote the screenplay, are as much artists as Koontz (not a qualitative comparison, but a statement that they are all artists). This is the director Jon Hess. Their job as directors is not to slavishly follow the book as if it were a script. They are adapting the book, as artists, to create a unique work of art. It is based on the book. Not identical to it. You have to relax your preconceptions / expectations when you watch the film, because you will live a work of art with which you are not already familiar, even if you have read Koontz's novel. <br /> <br /> So, observers are a good movie? It's pretty good, not excellent. Good enough to earn a "B", or an 8. Hess starts things off on the right foot with one of the most wonderfully filmed explosions I've seen in a while. Unfortunately, he stumbles a little later as we listen to a very thick and slang show. After that scene, Watchers threatens to become a cliché of the 1980s movie, when we first meet Travis and Tracey. Voting towards the cliché is a trend that is continually threatened. But it's just a misalignment. More often than not, Hess is able to transcend well-traveled territory with a series of interesting twists: Both Travis and Tracey come from single-parent homes, with their genres turned upside down. Both have unique and mature relationships with their parents. Even if it is a horror film, the main objective is a cute and intelligent canine, and often it seems so much an adventure film as horror, thriller or science fiction, all genres it touches. Hess introduces a large cast of characters, some that do not enter the game late, yet the film is never confused and no character feels like it is left in the dust - all the threads are well tied at the end. The structure is also complex in that there are two major criminals, the second becomes less patently ill-intentioned as the film progresses, until a breakthrough accompanied by brutal violence makes an antagonist clearer. Shortly after, Hess gives us a nice moment of doubt with the other antagonist. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in my eyes is a dreaded, common horror film since at least the 80s - the "attack" the scenes are turned too dark, too close, too blurry, and they have changed too much quickly. It makes it extremely difficult to say what is happening, which weakens most of the tension from scenes that should be a highlight. Surely, a part of Hess's motivation for style, and this is the typical justification for this problem, was the concern that the creature might appear humorous and / or false rather than terrifying and full of suspense. From my point of view, presenting the public with a dizzying blur is not a satisfactory solution. We clearly see the creature's costume / trick towards the end of the film. It was done well enough that a better scene and modified attack scenes would bring the film to at least 9. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, Watchers presents a compelling story using intelligent and seductive characters. Often it is a nail of nails and the horror scenes are more ferocious than one might expect, if not really raw (even if there is a good amount of blood in a couple of scenes). Observers tend to be undervalued due to misconceptions about the role of the film when it comes to adapting the literature: don't let it pass or briefly eliminate it based on a misunderstanding.
