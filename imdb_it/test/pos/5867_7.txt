When I was very young, my mother had a series of four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies on tape and I watched them all several times. A Coy Decoy was one of these short films, and I was really shocked to read in another comment that had been banned. When I was young I probably didn't even understand the Black Beauty gag to begin with. Yet this is probably why he was banned, even though until I saw him on a video site, I didn't even remember the gag. After watching the video, I recalled some shots - in particular the shrinking of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes that turned into a watch as the bait surrounded him in the lake. I wasn't bothered by the gag which was probably why the gag had been banned. Instead I was flooded with childhood memories of having looked at this short. Because of how much I liked this short as a child, I rate 7 out of 10.
