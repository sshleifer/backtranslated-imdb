The actors in this dark movie are truly believable and well made. The quality of the camera's work makes you feel like you're there. The script is intense and not vague. The plot is the one that makes you want to see it a second time from the new perspective gained from the final. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at the Gadsden Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, a patron was never eager to discuss the film and a person called me the next day to say that they were still "annoyed". While we have included an age limit of 18 on the film, I would watch the film with a group of young people as it is a very realistic representation of a bad situation and prepares the ground for a great conversation.
