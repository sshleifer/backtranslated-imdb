I recently saw a trial screening of Blurred, and I'm surprised to say that it was actually quite good! It's a film about different groups of children, your wealthy, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, as well as two geeky boys and a post hippie girl. Together, but as separate plots, each group is traveling to the Gold Coast for Schoolies week. Australia has never had problems writing comedies and Australia is never short or actors who can play comedy with sophistication and just the right amount of extravagance. The cast is full of Australian stellar actors with enormous talent and a lot of on-screen presence. Keep an eye on Craig Horner, a young graduate who is optimistic for a week-long party gets lost in his cheating friends. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who have successfully faced a complicated physical comedy while the two got rid of the clothes and Jessica Gower as a cutie, but confused the anguish of love. Veronika Sywak makes her film debut while all the teenage boys dream of the girl, and keeps her among the many more experienced artists. Look for Matthew Newton, skillfully launched as a sluggish driver. Fantastic Aussie
