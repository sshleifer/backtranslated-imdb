Written by William H. Macy from, probably, the best and most difficult to find of Donald E. Westlake, "A Travesty". * Very * true to the story, the film sees Macy as an unlucky man who puts himself over his head after trying to cover up an accidental death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles. The strength of the film is in the intricate twist-after-twist plot and in acting, particularly by Macy who regularly and delightfully breaks through the 4th wall here and gets along every time. A good plot with a lot of dark humor, this has engaged me enough to have seen it three times a week since it came out. Prepare to put aside your critical faculties and make a noisy and bipartisan "wheeeeee".
