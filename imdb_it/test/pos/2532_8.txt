I studied Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I ran into "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably good or BETTER than "City of God". <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography and musical supervision make this film a unique experience. I haven't been to Brazil yet, but this film presents the harsh reality that plagues the citizens of Sao Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you like good cinema. This film is disturbing and you may feel a little discouraged after watching it. <br /> <br /> Something you want to see, but nothing you want to go to sleep on.
