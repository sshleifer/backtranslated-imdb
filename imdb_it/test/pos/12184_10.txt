I must say that this film is absolutely incredible. I don't understand why he got such a low score. He has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Even Stuart Townsend did a great job with Lestat, the acting was great. Also, normally they are not in that music, sometimes well. But I must say that in this film the music fits perfectly. If you like dark vampire movies this is definitely for you or even if you don't there is a love story. But, all I can say is one word: Incredible! My vote is provocative: 10 out of 10. However, I seriously recommend looking at it. I remember not seeing him for years, I looked at him again about a year ago and I was again dependent. lol. Great movie !!!
