Dark Harbor is a small, moody hike in murky and emotional waters that flow in depth. It is basically a piece of 3 characters, with a finely layered performance of the ever-great Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. A perfect late-night movie, with a surprise ending to boot.
