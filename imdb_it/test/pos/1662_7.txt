You can take the swindler out of the joint, but it seems extremely difficult to rip the joint out of the recess. We have seen this type of character in this kind of situation before (and since then): in films like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, THE ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps make this one of the most notable is (obviously) the same blow, which develops without words in real time, and the demeanor of lead. Bogart would think twice before crossing this boy. The ironic ending adapts perfectly to this story (almost requires it). All around, one of the best film noir.
