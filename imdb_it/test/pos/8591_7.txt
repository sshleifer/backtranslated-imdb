an excellent historical drama, carefully prepared - well played, artfully written, filmed in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo and with more than a few touching moments, especially for those who care about the history of Africa and imperialism . however, a good amount of useful content is lost in the translation and because names, acronyms and so on are difficult to follow. so I highly recommend checking out a neutral source as wikipedia to get a fundamental sense of the story being portrayed (and the next story) before enjoying the movie. if you have the DVD version, there is also some useful historical background. there is a point towards the end of the film in which the name of a character who speaks with an American accent is actually played - a simple google search for "lumumba film censor" or something similar will reveal a real charm (and perhaps disturbing twist) regarding the production of this important film. this film, if coupled with a little external research, helps to contextualize dozens of other films related to central-eastern Africa and / or imperialism, eg. Rwanda hotel, shaking hands with the devil, various adaptations of Corrado's dark heart and even "wings" when Mohammed Ali visits Kinshasa.
