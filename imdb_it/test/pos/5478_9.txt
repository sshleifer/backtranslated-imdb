This is a Hollywood movie. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This film will not change the world. However, it is well done, well traced and well acted, which matters a lot. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the cat and mouse of a dissatisfied former CIA assassin who feels betrayed chasing an intelligence agent who was protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent was understandably troubled by this failure during the following years of his career and when the film resumes in 1992 - or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which gives a transformative performance) has been consumed by frustration and anger and decides he is going to assassinate the President. Imagine having a common cause with the secret service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood at his cool, calm and good-natured best-seller) who believes he must hold a grudge like he does because the Warren Commission, blamed Horrigan - unjustly, believes assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is accelerated by some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary who want to keep Horrigan close but not betray his position and his plans. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines, an agent with whom Horrigan develops an adult relationship. It's nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is a good deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the witty Horrigan in friendly jokes. It's a good part for Russo, which allows her to play the role of a capable and professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. Lead acting, Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, thoughtful use of music in plot development and excellent cinematography make this film a film I can watch again and again.
