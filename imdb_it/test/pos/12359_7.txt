Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor sister of the Salvation Army. At the door of death, he asks "Send for David Holm!" But Victor Sjöström (like David Holm) cannot be located, because he is spending New Year's Eve in a cemetery, with his drinking friends. The dying sister Astrid Holm (in the role of Edit) wants to see if praying for the soul of Mr. Sjöström, in the last year, has produced results; probably not. In the cemetery, Sjöström tells the story of "The Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his late friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person who dies every year must collect the souls of all the dead, until the next New Year is lightened ... <br /> <br /> Director Sjöström, whose main performance is very strong, joins the photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing movie. The great "double exposure" effect is used frequently, but it never seems exaggerated; and it does not make the other dramatic highlights of the film less memorable (for example, Sjöström is tearing the stitched coat and the door plank). A story of Selma Lagerlöf was probably not the one you could or would want to tamper with in the 1920s - which could, or might not be, because the end of this film is a disappointment. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it is difficult to suspend disbelief, if you think too carefully about what is really happening in "Körkarlen". <br /> <br /> ******* Körkarlen (1/1 / 21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
