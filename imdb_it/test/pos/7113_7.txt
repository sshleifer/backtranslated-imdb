This is a fun B-flick in the Universal Horror series with Dracula, the Wolfman and the Frankenstein monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, the werewolf (Lon Chaney Jr.), on a separate visit from a revolutionary doctor. Both ask if they can be treated, and the doctor tries to devise a way for each. Under the doctor's castle, they find the Frankenstein monster buried in the mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous film in the Frankenstein series). <br /> <br /> Of course, if things had gone as planned, the film would have turned out to be incredibly boring. Instead, Dracula cannot suppress the appetite, and the doctor is eventually infected with a blood transfusion, with vampirism. Like a semi-vampire, the doctor goes mad and awakens the Frankenstein Monster. As with all Universal Horror series, the ending is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the doctor's two assistants, has a particularly gruesome end. Also, you just have to feel sorry for the Frankenstein monster in this movie - he's awake for about two minutes, kills a police officer, and then another building (what is this, the fifth hour?) Collapses above him and is consumed from flames. It is also a pity that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is really reduced here. People underestimate that movie and Chaney's performance in it. Here, it would rightly be criticized as being made of wood. All in all, though, it's a very fun movie just 68 minutes away. A good waste of time. 7/10.
