A milestone in the history of cinema, "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of the few great films out there that deserves to be called a classic. It was the image that made Sergei M. Eisenstein a leading figure in the cinema at the time. And today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema that has always been. <br /> <br /> 'Potyomkin' is a film that needs to be seen as an entity, not to be chosen. Don't just watch those clip shows in which they present only the "Odessa steps" sequence and then switch to "Citizen Kane" or "The Godfather", you will see everything in its glorious 75 minutes of execution to really understand and enjoy it. Don't expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect, I mean the recitation of the 1920s silence era makes Scooby Doo look like a master of sober realism, certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences seem dated, but it is however an extremely pleasant film. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments of the film are the mutiny on the warship, the body of Vakulinchuk that falls from the ship, the sailor in the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child, the wheelchair on the steps of Odessa and the lion that rises up to roar while further carnage is unleashed. For every new pair of eyes that look at him, "The Battleship Potemkin" comes to life once again.
