The Duke is a very stupid film - a dog that becomes a duke! But it's a very funny movie. It has some of those jokes that have many films for children, but (fortunately!) There are no jokes about the physical function, as many animal films feel obliged to have! Primarily, it is only dogs that are dogs and people. . . well, folks. The "good guys" are nice and attractive. The "bad guys" are ridiculous and, of course, the pun on many jokes. But there is something dignified in this film, even if it is stupid, it is not out for any economic laughter like "Home Alone" and others. <br /> <br /> Crocket, Simon and Copper do a great job playing Black and Tan Coonhound "Hubert" who becomes the duke after his beloved owner, a true duke, dies. For the most part, they behave like dogs, without 'talking' or human emotions and attitudes. However, they make stereotypes of poodles, and Hubert makes them fall in love with her, just because he is a poodle. Come on! These are dogs - they have a different view of beauty !!! <br /> <br /> Overall, fascinating, fun and entertaining.
