You don't have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was nine, having been a fan of the T.V show, and my parents laughed as much as I did. It is done in the classic style of the Bugs Bunny cartoons of yesterday, and considering the vulgar cartoons of today, I would think that someone would appreciate a cartoon film that is based more on "wackiness" and then on vulgarity, to get some laughs.
