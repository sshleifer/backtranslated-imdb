A labor of love. Each frame is perfect and captures you. So pure emotion and storytelling bring you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director has the heart and guides him through 100 minutes of visual poetry. Be part of the emotional circle of the characters. I saw this film in 2 festivals and got standing ovations at each screening. The remarkable story telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was part of the drama that unfolds before me. The casting is perfect as can be achieved. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit each hold their own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good cinema. I can't wait for the commercial release of this film.
