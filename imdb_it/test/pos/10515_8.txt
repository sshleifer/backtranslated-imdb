I love the Ln Chaney version of "Phantom" and I appreciate Webber's version if only for the growing interest in the book, I would like to find more of a horror mystery with undervalued romantic aspects. I do not approve of the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber has made the relationship between Raoul and Christine less balanced. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, since this is a short film with only Erik and Christine, this version does not even have to worry about other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought I would still be waiting for another version to match Lon's performance. I was completely wrong. Leslie Nielson is as fabulous as Erik, obviously a parody. It's still bright. I particularly liked the fact that Erik was more like a living corpse than an accident victim. I haven't seen a Ghost so different from Lon's yet. However, I don't recommend this short if you don't like parody. Because in no way should it be taken seriously.
