I don't really see what's wrong with this movie. I loved this movie! I thought this movie was the best movie in the series. Although part 3 is the best in the series, I still gave this movie 10 out of 10 because it's great. I don't see what they all hate this movie. Who wouldn't want to see just a little critical action. I wish Brad Brown would have appeared in this because he could have improved a little. Who likes a bit of drama because ... wait until I tell you, you just have to watch it. This film also contains some popular actors who are ... (I don't tell you because I hate it when people give spoilers, so I don't want to be one of those people). Well, I guess that's all I have to say about this movie.
