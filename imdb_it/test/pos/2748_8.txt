William Wellmann, who directed one of the most exciting silent films ever made, 'Wings' (1927), returns here in the skies with another story with chills of courage. Wellmann had been an ace in the First World War, and nobody knew the biplanes like him. Here they are, stunt-flying, crashing, exploding in the air, and everything you can think of, plus a fascinating taste of commercial air operations in 1932. And there's a good strong story, excellently interpreted by the grim Richard Barthelmess (the silent star who made several films with DW Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a true sparkler. Such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character in place of one of those fake bifosites acting in today's Hollywood movies and they all look the same. The story is sad, played with genuine and well directed pathos. Towards the end of the film there are some extraordinarily exciting danger and rescue scenes, and what must be the most brilliant blind landing in the dense fog ever thought. I dare not give up the genius aspects of that particular episode. The character played by Barthelmess is very similar to that of Wellmann, a true wild hell in the air. Anyone who loves first-class aviation would love this film, and it is very rewarding for all those who love good solid entertainment, love, tears and never-ending action, all combined in a kind of delicious Wellmann omelette.
