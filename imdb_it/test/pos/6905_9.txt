This film was really a breath of fresh air from the weight of Hollywood shit I've seen recently. The acting is superb and the characters are captivating and strangely captivating. There isn't really much to the plot, it's simple and works well. A film easy to sit and have fun. The atmosphere was fantastic and the sets really helped to push the film together and offered beautiful images. The film obviously has aspects of horror, but it is oriented a little more towards the humorous side of things. You won't laugh hysterically aloud with this, but you'll be smiling all the time. Humor works very well with the characters and superb acting doesn't hurt. I really saw this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is a little smaller than I expected, but it doesn't matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you busy. If you like horror, look at this. If you like comedies, look at this. Just go ahead and watch this anyway, it's really quite excellent.
