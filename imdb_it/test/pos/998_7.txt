With its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy to look at Kira, this is re-atonement. <br /> <br /> This is a story of relationships with concentrated main characters that work out the balance between the first and the fast love in the home front of World War II. The poet Dylan Thomas intrudes between his wife and ex in the dark and smoky Blitz London and later in the windy wind. <br /> <br /> Vera's ex and the next trigger each other while the poet and the soldier become a spy while the girls unite and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bounces along with a few drops in pace. It would work well with French subtitles, but lately I could have been in too many art house films.
