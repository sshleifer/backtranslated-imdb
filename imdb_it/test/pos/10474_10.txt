A kind story, mention of fury, with a redeeming message and a glorious celebration. The photograph is wonderfully well executed. Filmmakers watch this type of film to hone their craft not just for what the eye can do to improve a story, but what the right camera vocabulary can do to increase emotion. Feeding the soul is by definition what this film faces, but with an elegance and a grace of delivery that simply does not happen much anymore, at least with this degree of taste, moderation and finesse. If you are interested in the history and development of the character, this is also a great film to see how an example of what simple lines and the right delivery can do to completely fill the impression of a character. Combine all this with an almost minimalist and perfectly conceived soundtrack, and you'll get this movie.
