I'm just starting to explore the wonderful world of Monsieur Ozon. I've only seen 4 films so far, and with the last in a row I was struck by the fact that all of them were actually about women alone and their actions. Not a single non-solitary female character out of 12, and all have a strong environmental impact. <br /> <br /> This film is probably the only one (out of four) in which this impact is forever. br /> <br /> The gay theme is an almost standard part of the background for Ozon's movies, so it doesn't catch the accent (although the characters' appearance might). Look at the feelings, not their objects. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful and fleeting, really like a summer love story, and while being a relaxation for thought and mind, it gives some food for the soul.
