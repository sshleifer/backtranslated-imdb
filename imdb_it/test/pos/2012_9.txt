I liked this show, it was in the UK, but not in the highlights, and they seemed to move it in all the shows, so I wasn't able to watch them all. I was surprised when he didn't come back and I had no idea why, I don't know yet, but I guess it's not important. <br /> <br /> Great performances by the two protagonists, they were very credible as friends. The two secondary actresses also contributed to the mix. I imagine it was part of a whole load of lifestyle-centered shows, friends are the obvious principal, but sex in the city came a few years later. <br /> <br /> The characters, take coffee, drink in nice bars, that kind of thing, a little woody fair in a sense.
