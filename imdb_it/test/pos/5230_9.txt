The best photography I've ever seen? Considering the year in which the film was made, I was absolutely amazed and deeply impressed by the amount of attention given to the scenes and what appears to be authenticity. Although I'm not particularly fond of western movies, every single scene is given in the smallest details, and it's haunting. There is a sincere connection with nature. Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by the amount of action that goes through the scenes, but I never get bored. I feel like I'm really peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west. I recommend this film to anyone who is studying set design, location planning and, in general, photography in general. It can be a humble film to experiment with regarding images considering this era of digital retouching that we now experience.
