I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Based on Jonathan's novel Safran Foer, Everything Is Illuminated is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the script. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively gathers objects from his family, from toothbrushes to lids to pieces of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins on a wall of his house to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is obviously bared. All that Jonathan has of him is a jewel and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during World War II. Jonathan decides to undertake a mission to Ukraine to find the woman, thank her and learn more about her grandfather. <br /> <br /> His research is aided by a couple of characters who run a tourist business for Jews, including a young man obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who thinks to be blind and who may have memories and demons of their own from war, and temperament by seeing his grandfather's dog. <br /> <br /> The script effectively combines humor and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside in search of Jonathan's grandfather city, pushing ever deeper into memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, who plays Alex Jr., who starts the film as a loser who wears the tracksuit and just enjoys having fun but evolves into something more not just like Jonathan, but all the characters get their own lighting. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz participated in the screening and asked a very funny question after the movie: <br /> <br /> - Schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a Ukrainian immigrant, and who died in 1993. This made him start writing to put his memories on paper. Meanwhile, he was asked to read Foer's short story, The Very Rigid Search, which is an excerpt from the unpublished novel. Schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing, saying that Foer had done in 15 pages what Schreiber tried to do in 107. Schreiber contacted Foer and talked about their grandparents, culture, film and the nature of short-term memory in America; in the end, Foer agreed to let Schreiber adapt the book. <br /> <br /> - The same Schreiber project was to be a road movie, but the book has a parallel narrative that is a chronological history imagined of the city of Trochenbrod covering 500 years; given his budget and limitations as a director, he said he would leave that to Milos Forman and take the road trip instead. This imagined chronology was what prompted him to make the film, first and foremost, the idea that "a lovingly imagined past was as precious as a carefully remembered past". <br /> <br /> - Schreiber said the film was a series of happy incidents. After unsuccessfully searching in Ukraine for an actor, he was walking around the Lower East Side in New York, when he saw a poster of a centaur woman, topless from the waist up, with a crazy Cossack sitting astride her. Under the poster he said the name Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz then took over the story. He had never pursued acting since music was his first passion. One day, a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a similar way to how he writes music; tighten sentences / syntax, the language is mine. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, they received a call from a production company, looking for music from Eastern Europe that was medieval but modern. Hutz met Schreiber and found that the film was based on the book he was reading. Not long after, Schreiber asked Hutz what he thought of Alex and if he could have been a character by accident. <br /> <br /> - Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of September 11th. Both were in Europe at the time and talked about the derogatory comments they heard about Americans, which led Schreiber to want to look for an articulate American who challenged the stereotype of Europeans in Americans. Someone who was clumsy, vulnerable, imperfect, innocent and who sought history beyond the borders of his own country. Schreiber started thinking about who he was, and Elijah arrived. <br /> <br /> One of Schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think that's what he said, who also directed a segment in another film of the festival, Tutti the Invisible Children) that said "don't look for the actors, you look for people ". Schreiber said that there is something about who Elijah is who has a generosity of spirit and sincere kindness as a human being who came across the film. Schreiber said that eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer, and that if "the eyes are the doors of the soul, Elija's doors are garage doors". <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this film as both are a kind of clean slate on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may seem firm and apparently emotionless, but it's all based on his observations, his experiences with other characters and the environment in which he was. <br /> <br /> - On the differences between directing and writing: Schreiber said he likes to write a lot more and jokingly described the direction as "hell". After his grandfather died, Schreiber started thinking about how to preserve a certain sense of history and himself; Is he satisfied or not, or simply good at interpreting other people's work? He said he loved the exercise of understanding what excites you, important to you.
