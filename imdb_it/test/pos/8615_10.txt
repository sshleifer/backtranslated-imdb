It did not surprise me to read a comment by the director according to whom he made this film an antidote to all those "making of" DVDs, as surely it struck me. I confess that I have a weakness for "meta", but I found this film very accessible and fun, and not even in a laborious and self-conscious way, which is certainly what you expect in a film about film production. It is very "French" in the sense that there are many extravagant, but occasionally compelling theories about how "film production (and even sexuality)" works, "but since the director doesn't play at all (using an avatar instead), there There are many choices left (as I'm pretty sure it constantly contradicts itself.) Apparently, Catherine Breillat specializes in hard-to-see films, but I would definitely say that this doesn't qualify, I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between the cinematic and the natural, the relationship between the character of the director and his assistant and actor, etc. Highly recommended.
