I agree with most of Mr. Rivera's comments, and I just want to add a couple of warnings. The film, "The Mascot", is neglected in its current form. Moreover, it is also "Vampire". "The Mascot" is not a "bonus feature" - it is attached as a chapter in "Vampire". Although it was made clear that this is a separate film, it should have been treated as such by the producers. And while I'm at it, "Vampyr" needs some of that same respect and cleanliness. I had the feeling that the decision to put The Mascot there was just like that. <br /> <br /> Dude A: "We've just transferred Vampyr to DVD, but it's about 20 minutes less. We have to put something there that wouldn't cost much money. Can you believe that movie critics want to get paid for talk about movies! "Dude B:" Don't worry. I have this little animation that has remained in my drawer. Just go ahead and launch it as an additional chapter. "Dude A:" You are fantastic, Dude B. "The animation of The Mascot is great, and I don't need to repeat what Mr. Rivera has done so well. However, this needs a bit of cleaning and restoration, especially the audio. The plot goes through the dialogues and in my copy there were so many hisses, pops and places where the sound is just finished (not I would have had an idea what the dog was pursuing without having read the box.) There was no volume to make the words more understandable, only to increase lightness and make whistles and pops more hissy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is: Starewicz's films must be put into a respectful collection, cleaned up, pulled up, liner notes and all nine meters. In other words, they must be "Criterionizzati" 9 out of 10 for the film, not the product that would get only a 5.
