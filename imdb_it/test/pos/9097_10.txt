Go see this movie. He is able to draw on everything that is wonderful for rock and roll, the band has some great songs in store (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder etc.). All this with the Humor of Teancous D makes this the best film ever. <br /> <br /> The Cameos are fantastic right behind, with Meat Loaf and God singing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are fantastic, I really like the character of Tim Robbins. Discover who Satan really is! The musical and musical references are hilarious and fantastic. Listen to great songs by The Who, God, and others simply complete it. Personally I didn't think the band could overcome the fantastic songs of D, but they did it with songs like Classic and Master Exploder. Really fantastic music. <br /> <br /> Just go and see it, it's a must for anyone who loves rock!
