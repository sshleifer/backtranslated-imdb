This film has everything for him: fully developed characters, a realistic representation of Washington's work, immersed in the warmth and humor that is uniquely Albert Brooks. The stupidity of network news is even more problematic than it was in 1987. Remember, this was pre-wired! So satisfying to be interested in complex people trying to reach complex goals - and everything moves together at the speed of light. A representation so faithful of friendships that staggers towards romance. See if you can spot John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from the news broadcast by real life? Finally, if you come from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's directions to taxi drivers!
