"Two Hands" is an exhilarating Australian gangster film set in charming Sydney. I bet the tourists never imagine Sydney and Bondi as in this movie: all sweaty bodies, an oppressive night and gangsters in nylon and jandal shorts. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with the intention of joining the gang of local boss King's Cross. He looked rather magnificent in his green wife's bat and in the blue parrot smuggler. He becomes a sweaty tattooed bod. I always had him as a "home and away" guy, and he was in that soap, which is a little more sweaty than the "neighbors" of Weetbix-insipid. The film really deserves to be seen for its combination of sardonic humor and violent violence: the drowning scene should soon give me nightmares. Totty awards: Country girl loves the brother of the city of interest and tattooed streetkid.
