Cecil B. DeMille directed a series of domestic theatrical comedies in late adolescence and the early 1920s. He found his perfect protagonist for these provocative pieces in Gloria Swanson. In Do not Change Your Husband, Swanson plays a bored housewife whose wealthy business husband (Elliott Dexter) pays more attention to work than to her. She is chased by a handsome roue (Lew Cody) until she gives in and divorces her boring husband for the new lover. <br /> <br /> Things quickly become familiar and Swanson discovers that the new husband is careless as the first. To make matters worse, he finds out that Cody has a woman on the side (Julia Faye). After several clashes and convenient meetings, things were resolved. <br /> <br /> This was a great success in 1919 and helped make Gloria Swanson one of the biggest stars. Although he was only 20 when he shot this film, he is as good as his crazy wife. He looks good and wears beautiful clothes. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene that is 100% DeMille in which Cody attracts Swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure and love. As he approaches her, she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is a fantastic scene of Swanson in a spidery hammock that swings over a pool while people dance. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is guarded like a Babylonian queen while servants carry her jewelry cocks, which are thrown to the side. Love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph who makes love in a forest clearing with a character similar to Pan (Ted Shawn). Pure hokum but very funny, and Swanson looks good. <br /> <br /> Dexter is as good as the insipid husband who takes off his mustache and starts working to win back his wife. Cody is also as good as the fake charmer who is a liar and a cheat. Faye is funny as the bitch another woman - by the way, Toodles no less - who gets her. Sylvia Ashton plays Ms. Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. Denis and together they were modern and influential dancers (from the Denishawn school). Swanson impresses me the most every time I see it. She seems to have been such a natural actress, yet there is a way in which the camera captures her expressive face that is simply fascinating. It is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie with many shades of color in various scenes to keep things lively. And many of the furnishings are back in style 86 years later.
