He kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic and perhaps even more in-depth story about political invocations. But then again, most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins. Perhaps the only true British film genius artist to emerge in the 1960s, Watkins has made quite a few rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the external aesthetic world - the world of political charges, social problems and solutions government. Therefore, his work is probably less "filmic" than, let's say, political, which some might call a weakening of their intrinsic artistic quality. Then again, why shouldn't art get involved? Watkins dares. And it happens. You will not feel good about it. You will not feel happy. Actually, you won't like the movie; he is intransigent, honest, direct, shameless; a confrontation in the face, in short. You can't help but get angry, you can't resist letting the things you see touch you. This is what makes Watkins movies so rewarding.
