Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the anti-Nazi propaganda piece of the great actor, which pierces Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is the Spitting Image of Hynckel. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen newsreels about Hitler will recognize the strange resemblance to caricature. <br /> <br /> I thought the film had a slow start with a typical Chaplin slap-stick focused on the adventures of the Jewish barber's first world war. Having never seen it before, I must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so I was wondering what it was. But the film quickly takes steam. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "Hynckel-ism" to make the point of propaganda. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech by Chaplin at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Although Chaplin is in this film, I thought the whole thing had been stolen by Jack Oakie, he plays the "Bacteria" dictator - "Benzino Napaloni". Our first look at Oakie shows how well he studied his subject - he had the arrogant attitude of Mussolini in hitting. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiated the fate of "Osterlich" developed me. <br /> <br /> This was a very nice film, and it's worth watching.
