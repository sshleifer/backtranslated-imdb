Although it is a cable film made by HBO, it is a fun film and a fascinating look at the back-stabbing and double-dealing television world. Allowing the viewer to peek behind the scenes of the so-called late-night talk show wars in the early 1990s, as Jay Leno and David Letterman competed for the coveted position as host of the Tonight Show. Kathy Bates performs as good as Leno Helen Kushnick's mercenary manager and you can feel empathy for what Leno / Letterman has endured at the hands of TV executives. It's just as timely now, considering the recent events that involved ABC's failed attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. Regardless of the number of times I have seen this movie, I find it a real pleasure to watch it as when it was first broadcast. Should this ever be published on DVD, I would certainly add it to my collection.
