LOL. <br /> <br /> The mere fact of starting my review with "lol" says it all. I watched this movie all the time as a child; and even then I sensed the stupidity of it all. The low budget, the horrible acting and the lame script were always apparent. I looked at him again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so ugly that it's actually a good lol. As another reviewer said, it is not taken seriously. There is no way to watch this film and say that the producers did it. The soundtrack is so funny that I laugh every time I hear it. The "climax" is just a riot of laughter. It's a war zone in New York full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous that you can't help but giggle at the sight of it. <br /> <br /> More fun moments: <br /> <br /> - The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like 2 cowboys against the entire Wild West was so much fun that it was fun . <br /> <br /> - It killed me the way the bad guys could shoot at Kersey and he could even fall on one knee taking more and more attention (and slow) to avoid being hit by LMAO. Of course, with him was a shot-one kills with his LOL elephant gun. <br /> <br /> - Another exhilarating scene was the end when he finally killed the gang leader .... with a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... destroying all the side of the condominium with it. <br /> <br /> - It is evident that Kersey is far from used to losing loved ones ... when his new girlfriend is quickly eliminated after only a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone who can only think that Kersey is angry with the destruction of the car lol ... he runs down, looks at the carnage and leaves. <br /> <br /> Again, so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> stars ****.
