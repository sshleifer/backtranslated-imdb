Honestly, when I went to watch this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield, Indiana, I didn't expect much. I went to this movie just because I thought it was a WWE movie, it would be nice to laugh. Then I sat down and saw him and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the craziest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has a big advantage for other films that attract me in a horror movie. Show Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and disturbing. He feels pain, something that Jason never does or seems to show. Feel sorry and pleased, even if both are crazy again that you will notice if you see the film. All in all, my experience was different from that of many woodcutters, and it surprised me in some ways, as in those who lived at the end.
