Unfortunately, this film is relegated to the status of "curiosity" apparently. Many people I asked "Did you know the Monkees made a movie?" I usually say "No" That said, if you're one of those big numbers, I suggest you see it, but with the following warnings: If you expect monkey-style humor, it's in there. It's not like TV shows everywhere. <br /> <br /> Yes, they are trying to break their television mold a bit by teasing themselves like a group of non-longer teenagers who have been on the shorter part of many sticks. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be drunk to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be drunk to understand it. <br /> <br /> If you like the classics, you will love spaced clips everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you like the psychedelic era, you will love some of the cameos. <br /> <br /> If you are a Monkees fan, you may recognize some of the hits that are taking to the heavy marketing of the band. <br /> <br /> In the immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it: "This is a strange film, friend." In fact it could be better if you don't try to understand it, sit down and react. It's strange, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (yet) ... it's many things. Overall, it's an experience.
