It could be a remake of Capra's 1937 movie, but it's wrong to consider it just that way! He had to present the Hilton novel in a completely different way. As a musical it is excellent. The scenery is fantastic, the good characters and anyone like "Leonard Maltin" who considers the music of Bacharach horrible must be completely deaf! I highly recommend it.
