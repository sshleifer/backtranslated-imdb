A remake of the 1916 silent film, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. The detective series would be transformed into numerous theatrical performances, films and TV series in the United Kingdom, the United States and France over the years. This 1932 version played the Barrymore brothers, like the Duke, and Lionel (in the role of Detective Guerchard). They would also act together at the Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight and many others over the next two years. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in the Duke's bed during a party in this pre-Hayes coded film; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then they go out in the main ballroom, then the search is in progress for the scammer and the missing jewels, as well as other missing valuables ... It can be said that the talkies were not running around too long, as they still use captions multiple times. Look also for a new type of safe that does not need a combination. Plot well thought out, without big holes, but without big surprises. Not bad for a first-run movie. Smart end.
