Chokher Bali was shown at (Washington) DC Filmfest on April 15th 2005. The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a brief introduction and answer the questions later. <br /> <br /> As always, I think Aishwarya has done a fantastic job. I can understand who you think should be more aggressive or more rude, but would it really be realistic in 1904? Possible, perhaps; realistic, I'm not so sure. I think his interpretation was valid, although there may be other ways to do it. <br /> <br /> I hate using the word, but this was the most "inaccessible" of Indian films I've seen so far. I know a fair amount of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far beyond me. Clearly you would have a much better understanding of the film if you were intimately familiar with Hinduism and its customs, esp. how were c. 1904. I missed many things, one of which was the fact that the mother-in-law wanted Binodini at home as a kind of counterweight to her beloved Ashalata. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Ghosh had many things to say that explained the film to me better. First of all, the original Bengali version lasted more than 20 minutes. So what was left out? Apparently three main things: an initial segment in which Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal for Calcutta. According to the director, several characters are talking about W. Bengali against E. Bengali - who published some political comments later. Of course all this is lost in the Hindi version, and certainly in a non-Indian like me, it wouldn't have mattered anyway - but a setup of the Bengali situation would surely have. Subsequently, there was a segment in which Binodini was writing a poem - a sign of his independence, etc. Finally, a little more business on jewelry. So, although some people think it's too long, I think the original, longer version would have been clearer. <br /> <br /> The women's hair was apparently another sign (Ghosh again) - the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister - also a widow - had longer hair (more modern!), and of course Binodini / Aishwarya had very long hair to the waist (refusal of widowhood status). <br /> <br /> Has the finale really struck me - all of a sudden Binodini, who had never had a political thought, is writing a political manifesto? Whoa! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno, in a film festival, when the subtitles were over. Subtitles use the word "country" in the letter of Binodini. Gosh said that a more appropriate word would be (I forgot his exact word) something like "self" or "independence" - he was talking about his own liberation and "being" - not Bengal, India and the English. So why did Binodini disappear the day after finding Behari? Apparently because during his stay on the Ganges he realizes that he does not need a man - no man - to define / complete it. She can only be herself. So he refuses Behari, who threw herself in a few months (?) First, and leaves. Sure, I'm not sure how you buy the next meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red shawl (still Ghosh) he buys represents "revolution" and "passion". I'm not 100% sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman, but maybe she's rejecting the passion / revolution? Binoculars, which Binodini uses during the film (to watch Mahendra and Ashalata, the boat on the Ganges, etc.). You are a voyeur to see a life you crave but cannot have. In the end (he escaped me!) He left the binoculars on the table with the letter, showing that he no longer needed them - he was going to lead his life. <br /> <br /> Finally, Tagore's quote at the beginning said how he apologized for the ending ... Apparently Tagore wrote it like a serial, hooking his readers with the sexy pieces of widows. But in the end he sold conservatism and made Binodini kneel at the feet of Mahendra and Behari, imploring their forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore bringing him to work on his final sell-out ... and Tagore responded with his apologies for the finale. In the film, of course, Ghosh goes in the opposite direction.
