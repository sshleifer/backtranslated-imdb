The sequels are a whimsical lot with most nowhere near the height of the original. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (like John Charles) have stated that Project A2 is better than the original, I disagree, but this film is still a useful follow-up and yes well suited to the production of Hong Kong's brilliant action films in the 1980s and Jackie's work. I wonder how with such a fantastic release of great films that his subsequent films were not as good. He has only directed two films in the 90s and none, but he has had a lot of influence in many films in which he is not officially the director. <br /> <br /> In early 1987, Jackie had made a disastrous fall in the shooting of Armor of God. This encouraged him to work on his next film close to home. This didn't encourage him to stop risking his life and his stunt team for our fun. What resulted is a great success at home that eclipsed the original in the box office rankings (HK $ 31 million compared to 19 million for the original). Jackie Chan is once again an extraordinary officer of the Dragon Ma police and he was ordered to work with Superintendent Chun "Tre Wan" (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors) who is the only Chinese policeman who is allowed to have a gun but is he thinks he is making arrests to make himself look better and ignore the crimes of a lord of the triad called Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Apparently Chun has too much power to be directed directly, but he is relieved by the Sai Wan district (now it's "Two Wan") that Dragon Ma takes over. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon have a makeover and there is a great scene in which three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, try to attack Ma to teach him a lesson on the police report. It soon takes the form of a district ship and Tiger Au takes care of it. The choreography and combat stunts with Tiger and his men are really great. My favorite stunt was a beautiful and brutal fall from the second floor in a large vase and that vase didn't seem to be soft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a couple of subframes are happening. There are pirates who survived the first film seeking revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries like Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood For Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) who are trying to raise funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing government and government officials who are trying to find these rebels. Throw a mixture of corrupt Hong Kong and British policemen in addition to the legitimate ones and you have a stew that is getting a bit too many ingredients, yet it still seems to unite. It works well when there is a scene influenced by Marx Brothers (the Marx Brothers did this kind of scene a few times with The Cocoanuts (1929) as the first) instead of Maggie where everyone is looking for someone hiding from someone else. Many weeks have been devoted to this scene alone and the effort certainly proves it. <br /> <br /> There are several flaws in the film. Is there a certain didactic nature that creeps into the film that seems a bit out of place ?? in particular a small speech towards the end that Jackie gives when dealing with the revolutionary continents and the extremely easy conversion of the surviving pirates from the first film. The female characters are once again underutilized and little appreciated, especially Maggie Cheung. I was not satisfied with the continuity of the plot as much as the first film. Individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this film as a coherent whole. I did not criticize the film for not being able to have Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao as the first (I felt that the main reason for this was that those two were filming Eastern Condors, but I wonder if Jackie could have waited a little while to get them exhibit this way they would work together for the last time the following year in Dragons Forever), but they were lost. <br /> <br /> I found this to be quite enjoyable and made into a movie and is rightly considered one of the best comic action movies of the 80s. This film is also quite good in some unexpected places. The art direction is superb (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, the cinematography is good and the film looks authentic. But acrobatics, comedy and action are what I remember this film for. There is a chase involving a handcuffed dragon and Chun who is superb (part of the ax launching scene would have been used at noon in Shanghai). The last twenty minutes are full of amazing successes, falls, chili peppers as mascots (Jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene, you can see it in a lot of pain in the mouth during the outtakes at the end) and it is a worthy conclusion for this film. The most famous stunt in this sequence is his tribute to Buster Keaton of Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak section in which his head opens. <br /> <br /> The fans of Jackie and / or Hong Kong action movies should consider it a must and watch. I certainly do.
