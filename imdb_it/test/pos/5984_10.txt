This is one of my favorite movies; a delightful comedy; so I was excited to know that it is going to be released on DVD in the UK in September 2007. <br /> <br /> Romuald, played by Daniel Auteuil, is a wealthy president of a dairy company. Juliette, played by the excellent Firmine Richard, cleans the company's Paris offices. Julette, a black mother of many children, discovers a plot against Romuald that initially ignores his attempts to warn him. Slowly he grabs what this charming lady from the Paris subclass is trying to tell him. seeks refuge in his crowded apartment while his marriage and his career disintegrate. An unlikely love blooms. Cultures collide in what is a delightful carefree comedy.
