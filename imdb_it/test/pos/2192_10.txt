Not having seen the 1936 version of this story, I cannot offer any comparison there. However, I can say that Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely brilliant. Only Sondheim could invent music and lyrics that are stellar in all respects, but perfectly suited to very bizarre themes. If anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, he should also see this (and also "Dr. Strangelove"). When Ms. Lovett goes from having the "worst London cakes" to a booming business, we're not talking about "Soylent Green", but the ingredients are similar. Particularly brilliant is the song in which Mrs. Lovett transmits her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory issue, the phrase "... have gone to their Creator impeccably shaved ..." provides a great indication of the premise, drama and comedy to come. Awesome!
