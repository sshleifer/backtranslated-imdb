In "Hoot", Mullet Fingers is engaging in sabotage to stop the pancake house. The problem is that the builders start again and must take more drastic measures. When confronted with dogs, it scares them with snakes, not before being bitten by a dog and has to go to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Roy at bedtime asks his father, who works with the Justice Department, how he behaves with the criminals. His father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through the papers, because sooner or later, everyone slips away. You can see it with Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at the documents related to the pancake and finds a deleted document (he must enter the company trailer), so when the police see it, he has the law on his side. Unlike when he evaded the police. <br /> <br /> I remind you that, as already mentioned, Roy is not always respectful of the law, and when the man of the company is killing owls (illegally), Mullet Fingers acts directly. He can't wait for the law (Mullet Fingers hides). The film suggests that one should work in the system.
