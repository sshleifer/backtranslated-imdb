After watching this film, I came to the conclusion that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This movie wouldn't have been watchable without Drew. The fact that someone as attractive as Drew could really drive me crazy, and he did it when he was "Josie Grossie". His "transition" attempts, as the fantastic girls called them, were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the nightclub. We also had the favorite SNL, Molly Shannon, playing an important role as Anita, Josie's. best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the film was Anita who tried to teach class and sex. This was one of the most entertaining and best performances of Mollys. <br /> <br /> Even Leelee Sobieski had a great role and I felt very good for her, because I know people like her who have been tortured that way. <br /> <br /> This film is a must see for Drew Barrymore fans, because Drew makes the film.
