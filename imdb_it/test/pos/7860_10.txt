Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film. He is filmed in a ruthless, graphic manner without being visually graphic, well acted by all interested parties, and covers some of the most taboo problems of a day in a worker's normalcy, almost waited until now not seen in any other film by this review. I didn't know what to expect sitting around watching this: a civil war movie or some soft soft core of the 70s with Eastwood coming down on a school for girls in the south. But in reality it is neither one nor the other, but rather the examination, exploration and descent into the soul of men and women - an obscure commentary on what is at the heart of the civil. as previously noted by a reviewer, nobody - nobody - of the characters is nice for the end of the film, yet each of them is interesting, complex and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by the young Pamelyn Ferdin (you will recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl in a fashion school led by Geraldine Page amid the chaos that was the civil war, particularly in the South. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, the adorable and young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual ties with Eastwood - each with their own needs, secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a good guy. she plays the girls from each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. In unfolding we get some really interesting things revealed by latent lesbian incest. The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. This could be (with the exception of Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best film. It is certainly one of Eastwood's best REAL performances. the page is always very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin and others excellent. the gothic mane set for school is actually claustrophobic. Some scenes of sexual lace disturb. And what happens to Eastwood is an advantage for much of the competition for creepy, disturbing, insane movies.
