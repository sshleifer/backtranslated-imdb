this film is simply amazing .. unfortunately in Portugal there is not even a shadow of him ... and I agree with a previous opinion, only FF fans will really give the film the real merit ... but for the rest .. I challenge you to watch it the story is great, and I thought the game had ended the story, but the writers gave us a great story to the god of all the rpg ... the ost, as usual, came from the sky;) ehehe but the little details they gave us (we fans of the game) are beautiful .. as the ringtone is the winning song of the battle of the game, and even some moves are quite familiar enough to watch it is a great movie , a great story, a great animation ... only a 10/10
