Reading the comments I am struck by the obvious effect that this wonderful film has on viewers. But how can you watch this film and not reflect on the fact that artistic dialogue was a subtle and audacious reproach to the authorities "in control" of what was then the USSR at that time in history? They were not souls only in the time and place where the action was revealed. The questions, superficially requested, are clearly provocative if addressed to the here and now. Who are the real "collaborators"? I'm surprised the writer stayed out of jail. I read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for the production of great art. This film is a masterpiece of bad direction, which seems to indicate a way, while asking the public to "look beyond my shoulders at what I'm really talking about". What courage
