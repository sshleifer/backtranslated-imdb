I remember seeing this movie when I was young enough and being disturbed enough. I found the plot very distressing and I can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spit in his soup before he could even taste a spoon. They also tied and shaved his private parts. That was all because it was unpopular. Why was it unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have the feeling though that even if he were good at games he would have been bullied because it is difficult to decide what makes someone popular. For me, he is the kind of person who would always be chosen because that's how children operate. Popular children are popular because they are somewhat "cool". Popularity is a difficult thing to define. So even at the end, when he is successful in his career, it makes no difference and he still remains tormented. I found the ending quite distressing as there was no solution.
