The evil Professor Moriarty tries to gain control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE SECRET WEAPON that could win the war for the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return to the screen as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and sidekick's beloved detective, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in this fun little mystery. Universal Studios didn't waste money on imaginative production values ​​or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be the attraction the public would need. In fact Rathbone, like the brain ego, and Bruce, like the id bumbling, seem to actually become the characters they are creating, cheerfully keeping their faces straight as they engage in the most absurd nonsense. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as inspector inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard; paired with Bruce, these two friends with a tender but smart heart manage to save Holmes's intellectually superior life twice. Lionel Atwill, a master of the accident that deserves more recognition for his talent, does a great job as Moriarty, making the evil scoundrel an enemy worthy of the steel of Holmes, enjoying the scenes in which he inflicts torture and pain. /> <br /> William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the center of the mystery, but don't have much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon appears as the owner of Holmes, Mrs. Hudson. <br /> <br /> Rathbone enriches his already classic interpretation of Holmes coming to appear in disguise three times during the story, thus revealing to the spectator that the great investigator was a bit of a heart actor in the heart. <br /> <br /> This film - which is based very freely on elements in Sir Arthur's 'The Dancing Men' and 'The Empty House' - followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON (1943).
