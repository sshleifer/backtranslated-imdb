This film has had some very funny moments. The payment sketch above for beginners. <br /> <br /> The parts where Rik tries to behave with dignity in front of his guests, looking at them from top to bottom through his nose. Very subtly done, especially since the guest was himself a smooth-nosed adulterer. <br /> <br /> The scene where Rik discovers that Gina has a boyfriend, "Ahhh. He was holding me all the time, the cheeky bitch". with his 2 candle eyes. As if he had really imagined it. But he believed it. That's why it was so fun. Good time. <br /> <br /> Even Gino was excellent. He should have been used more like a bad man. "Where are the whores I ordered!" he suffers. Brilliant stuff.
