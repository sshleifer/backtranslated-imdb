1st guarded 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): Simple, sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures that survive in the everyday world without a roof over their heads. The film begins with the woman in the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) who is released from prison, but we don't know what it was or how long it was there. He crosses the anti-hero of the story and his fianc√©, played by Sebastian Haro, while parking the cars for the change. They gather together under an old dilapidated building, with nothing but the warmth of the other and a small mattress in their possession. He is a drug addict who only tries to do it from one correction to another, but has a strange obsessive attraction to him as a person, which we eventually accept. He also has some sort of sexually transmitted disease, so sex is out of the question for them but this doesn't seem to be a problem for any of them. He loves this man as he is, without a doubt, and without him having to change, which is a rare discovery everywhere. He makes his living by carrying a bucket and washing shop windows. They eat a sandwich every day and consider it a party. Isabel's character dreams of a normal life but does not expect it to happen and does not expect to adapt to that role, so she doesn't think much about it. Both characters come from extremely destroyed homes and therefore the public has sympathy for them despite their imperfections. Without giving up much of the story, the character of Isabel continues to persevere while the man gets worse and worse in the obsession with drugs. There is a beautiful melodramatic conclusion to the story that elevates it to make the masses have fun, but overall this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between non-mundane mishaps that keeps you interested until the end.
