"Crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece: it is well acted and beautifully filmed, but written subtly and too short. As it is, it is only a decent judicial procedure with hints of film noir (at its peak in 1947) and social commentaries (even fashionable at the time) launched for good measure. Today he is remembered as one of the first two Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism, and it is much better than the similar "Gentleman's Agreement" (it is no small feat). But his real argument is the difficulty that the soldiers of the Second World War, as trained assassins, were having while making the transition to civilian life. (For a more refined approach to this topic, try "The best years of our life".) A man is beaten to death in the first frames of the film. We don't see his attacker. The film is about the investigation of this murder, which is actually quite simple, but it takes some unnecessary detours, like when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, ends up in the apartment of Gloria Grahame, a ballroom prostitute with a strange pimp played by Paul Kelly. There is also a civic education conference in the middle of the film that slows the proceedings to a crawl, and the ending is quite orderly for a cop show. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. And yet, what a great noir it could have been. Director Edward Dmytryk cites some references to the subject of the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - as when Monty's sadistic asshole is seen in the image of his friend Mitch talking to a strange man at the bar. And the cast is excellent. Robert Ryan is a very credible idiot and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes, not unlike Peter Lorre as the killer child in "M." He earned an Oscar but lost to Edmund Gwenn that year (you can't beat Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is a former soldier friend of the accused murderer. Was Mitchum a great actor or a big star? Someone else can understand it, but his sleepy eyes and his amused little smile work very well here, since they imply that his character knows something that others don't know. (And he does.) And Robert Young, as the detective in charge of the murder, is surprisingly gritty, discarding his usual affable affection even when he has to deliver the sermon on civil rights halfway. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would have been brilliant in the role, but none of them was present at the RKO in 1947, so you will only have to deal with Dr. Welby. Still, Young is good enough to make you wish someone launched him into a police drama instead of "Father Knows Best", which he hated and pushed him into alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserved better than Smarm and Sanka.
