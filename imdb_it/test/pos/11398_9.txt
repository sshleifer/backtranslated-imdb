Boogie's nights are full of surprises, nothing prepares them for her soul. Yes, he has a soul, while facing the most difficult issues, with an ironic smile and respect. Brilliantly cast and a wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of theatrical acting with improvisation within a true cinematic style. <br /> <br /> The plot turned out to be richer than I expected and the underlying themes are staged quite profoundly. The "Grade B" human being is brought through the crisis into perspective. <br /> <br /> The case of a sociologist's dream, the film makes the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem, the love of parents and the lack of it, attention / love deficit and the its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. Something for everyone here .. almost disguised as untouchable issues and their separate environment, but of course they are universal. <br /> <br /> The film works on a number of levels. The irony is that the environment depicted exists only for the voyeur, who watches the film ... Boogie Nights does not judge the subject and the characters, a rarity. It deserves every recognition it has received and more.
