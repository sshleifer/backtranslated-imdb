This film has been filled with great acting, great musical sounds that completely blow your mind. Larenz Tate, (Darius Lovehall), "Waist Deep", '06 was a keen cat with girls and soon met his Waterloo with Nia Long, (Nina Mosley), "Big Momma's House", 2000. Nina put his heart and his soul in this role and when he meets Dario, the sparks fly first and then there's a sort of hate relationship. The whole cast of actors has made this movie very funny, with lots of comedies, dramas and lots of love and cheating going on. This is a very realistic film and at the same time shows how everyone ultimately has his and his destiny in life and finds himself in his little corner of this great world. Great movie, have fun!
