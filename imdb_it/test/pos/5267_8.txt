Vidor shines like Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. His brother, David, is so oppressed by his father that it's a surprise that he even manages to tie his shoes, rather than asking Dad to do it for him. <br /> <br /> The other reviewers have already outlined the plot, so I won't do it again; However, I will point out that Nan, who is pregnant with David, is also married to him. This is not a pregnancy outside marriage, which would have been horrible by 1921 standards. The two are secretly married, but Nan's father, having been paid by David's father, tears up their marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> The scene of Nan's death, with Judith present, is a truly heartbreaking and highly emotionally charged experience. It is worth watching this scene alone, but there is much more to the plot; why are not modern films made with the same attention to history?
