The three most significant names in this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three offer the best performances, but the entire cast does a great job. The film, even if it concerns the porn industry, does not get out of hand with its sexual premise. On the other hand there have been many scenes that involved drug use and although they are important for understanding the characters' lifestyle, I think there has been some excess in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson did not do much directing, but may have been chosen for this film based on his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story". One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family atmosphere between the characters as they work, live and party together. Although it is not a typical family, they certainly seem to care for each other. The wonderful soundtrack helps give you an idea of ​​the period in which the disco was in fashion. There are many favorites on record and some other wonderful songs. <br /> <br /> The story is about a talented young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who is invited into the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes a movie star for adults overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director who takes his films very seriously because he believes that his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. However, Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads for a dangerous road where he is to lose everything. Although more attention is paid to the character of Dirk, there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. You will find yourself wishing and hoping that their situations will improve. Overall a well made film.
