While fleeing a bank robbery, the outlaw Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the chief engineer of Western Union who is guarding the Wild West and has had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work for Western Union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with Edward Sue Creighton's beautiful sister (Virginia Gilmore) and choose Vance. However, his past haunts him when outlawed Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals Western Union cattle disguised as Indians. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" is a good but predictable western directed by Fritz Lang. The story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the West, confronting thieves and Indians. The funny story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of the identity of Jack Slade, there is no surprise in the story. Randolph Scott offers another magnificent performance with an exceptional cast. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
