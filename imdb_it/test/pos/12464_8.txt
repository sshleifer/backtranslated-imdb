This is both a fun and touching version of the classic story, even quite clever, not the "Me Tarzan, You Jane" school. <br /> <br /> It is the famous story of a child bred to manhood in the jungle of monkeys. A titled British couple (the pregnant wife) is stranded in the wild African lands after a shipwreck. After the death of their parents, the child is raised in the jungle by monkeys. Twenty years later, this young man (ie Tarzan) rescues a wounded Belgian explorer, bringing him back to health. The Belgian discovers that his savior is the young Lord Greystoke and puts him back in his legitimate property in Scotland, where he must adapt to civil society. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. In the first half we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. Not being an expert, I am not aware of the realism of his representation of a monkey's life, but it is certainly fun. For me, the most moving section is the second half, when Tarzan has to meet his real family, develop language skills and adapt to British aristocratic society, while courting Jane (Andie MacDowell). He is portrayed as a "noble savage", both in nature and in elegant Edwardian salons. In contrast, the upper crust is often depicted as much more barbarous than the Tarzan jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his cute portrait of Tarzan both in the jungle and in civil environments. It conveys a true sense of its confusion and its conflict, torn as it is between the two very different worlds, its family of original apes and its new human being. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the old British legends, is brilliant as always in the role of Tarzan's grandfather, the sixth Earl of Greystoke. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggles in adapting to civilization and his inner conflict than on his jungle exploits. This unusual interpretation of the old classic makes both the typical dramatic adventure, but also, above all, a moving personal story. I'm not surprised to note here that his director is the same individual, Hugh Hudson, who also directed Chariots of Fire, another brilliant film.
