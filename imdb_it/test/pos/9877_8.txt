Halloween 666 (1995) The manufacturer's review! <br /> <br /> Halloween 666 starts with a summary of the terrifying end of the fifth part. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this will really drive you crazy. A mysterious "Man in Black" broke into the Haddonfield police department freeing Michael Myers. In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was kidnapped by strange cultists. What do they want from you? Who knows, but let's say that his long suffering will end soon. Dr. Loomis has returned to spending the rest of his twilight years trying to prevent Michael Myers from killing other innocents (good luck). Friend of Loomis, Dr. Wynn returns after a break of four sequences to help the good doctor. Another old face from the guest stars part as well. <br /> <br /> This dark and depressing sequel was dismantled during post-production editing. For some reason the distributors felt that the final product was not worth the average time of the guardian of the horror movie. So they decide to silence him. Then, after the film remained on the shelf for several months, he laid an egg at the box office. Regardless of what they did to the film, they made it worse. They should have left pretty well alone. Hey, the movie company now knows better than the producers ... right? <br /> <br /> Producer's Cut: Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Published version: Not recommended
