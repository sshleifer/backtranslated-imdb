I saw this movie for the first time about 3 years ago. I was shocked by the way the FBI was not stupid at preventing such a tragedy. It could easily be prevented. This film was incredible. <br /> <br /> Now, after September 11th, I am horrified and can say that this could have been prevented more easily than most people would like to know. <br /> <br /> This film is 100% true <br /> <br /> In the final scene of the film, when the mind of the first attack is taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers, it makes a note chilling, he was mocked when he said it. "Next time we'll bring them * BOTH * down." This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This film reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the nose of the FBI and NYPD. Shows how the 1st and 4th amendments are partially to blame for the attacks. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie now and I know that both attacks could have been prevented.
