I'm a Maharashtrian, a teenager who lives in the 21st century, and it's obvious that I don't even like Bollywood very much, not to mention the Marathi films. However, when I saw Shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling that only an extremely effective film can generate. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that, like most Indian films, the film has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language. Many of the film's emotions and meanings are incorporated into his Marathi dialogues, which, however difficult, cannot be effectively translated into English. <br /> <br /> Shwaas explores, with intricate detail, the relationship between a grandfather and a child. And it does justice to this strong bond. Dialogues such as "mazha parsha pan laakhat and k aahe" (my parsha is also one in a million) improve emotion. Anyone who has closely observed the relationship between grandparents and children will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's definitely worth looking at. It is a film that has left a profound effect on me. I will definitely recommend it to anyone!
