Always Fi! I saw "The D.I." in 1957. Two and a half years later I joined the Corps. <br /> <br /> The web and the company understood how they could in '57. Boot, in '59, was more like, in effect, exactly like, the Boot Camp shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. A black recruit, in my training platoon, was called "Snowball". They called me "Stick" because I was as thin as a parapet. Each recruit had a nickname, a bit cowardly, that kept him with his service in the Corps. Being slapped, or knocked on your ass, when you failed was SOP. "Give up and give me fifty" must be a ho-hum. Then, he turned into "Drop, and give me two hundred!" <br /> <br /> DIs were a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was a controlled sadism, and with a primary purpose of keeping us stupid MoFos alive when we hit the fight. 200 years of experience were rooted in that "sadism" and throughout the D.I. did or said, had a purpose oriented to his mission. <br /> <br /> A bad D.I. gets grunts killed. A good D.I., although apparently the biggest asshole in the world, keeps them alive. You can't kill the enemy if you're dead. <br /> <br /> In case you didn't know, the Marine Corps has a primary mission: to kill the enemy. PFD. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure good sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (ret)
