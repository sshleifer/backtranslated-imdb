If you put Seinfeld aside, this is the best comedy ever, no doubt! Simply fantastic! <br /> <br /> "The King Of Queens" has just concluded its eighth season of domestic happiness. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an active amateur, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the daily challenges of love, life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie take care of everyday domestic realities that reflect our times and allow us to laugh at ourselves. Their mutual love eventually leads them through every dilemma they face, whether it's Doug's fixation with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie also have to deal with Heffernan's third family member, his father with two widowed widows, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie came across an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy with his regular tours with the gullible Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Friends of Doug Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) complete the cast with their "boy" humor and different perspectives. <br /> <br /> In a way that evokes "The Honeymooners", THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in everyday situations in life. Only last season, Doug "lent" Carrie to a Deacon without help for the Thanksgiving dinner aid; the Heffernani who suffer from the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their home; and Doug and Carrie strive to copy a couple whose photos of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie have accidentally taken home. We also saw Arthur grow up jealous of a new dog that Holly added to his path, and Doug found that his overprotective parents replaced his Rocky childhood dog three times behind his back. In all, the series highlights James's incredible physical comedy, Remini's sharp wit and Stiller's exclusive comedy presence. <br /> <br /> You can't ... You shouldn't miss it!
