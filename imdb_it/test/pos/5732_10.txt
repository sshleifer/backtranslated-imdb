My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed "The Elegant Universe". After three hours of observation, in addition to hurting my brain, I learned all about wormhole, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternative universes. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the show was about string physics, a semi-new branch of physics that makes many of the ideas of science fiction not only possible but PROBABLE. With "String Theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternative timelines ARE possible and it may just be a matter of time until we have the knowledge to use them. <br /> <br /> Although you may not have given new information to someone familiar with the subject, I found the show VERY interesting and informative. It was very understandable to anyone who had just been introduced on this topic.
