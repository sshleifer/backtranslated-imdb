The previous profile was written by me when I used the OldWereWolf56 nickname, which is still my email address. I still believe that the character of Andy Devine of Frisky is the best of the Twilight Zone episodes and I watch this episode at least once a year, because I consider Frisby a lucky man, since he has many friends who love him very much. <br /> <br /> In the event that many of you were too young to remember, I am 61, Andy Devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 1950s, I think his name was Andy's Gang. On it he had three assistants: a cat named Midnight playing the violin, a mouse named Squeaky playing a hand organ and a diabolical toad named Froggy that could appear and disappear embarrassing many of Andy's funny stars like Billy Gilbert .
