You, the Living (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I never wrote that word before, but it comes to mind here. Let me see Well, it's part of it - corrosive, but also fun as hell. So corrosive funny. This is a dark film, of course, with so much dry dry humor and bizarre humor it is impossible not to like it at a certain level. Shot in a very Spartan style, often with a static camera and truly balanced and stable compositions, like theater stages, we see a brief staging. <br /> <br /> But that makes it look ordinary - which it isn't. Ordinary life is shown frank, ironic, delicious, timid and depressing. It's impossible. We, the living, must live, and since we are alive, we can also take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you find yourself laughing and you don't know why. Exactly. And the promotional material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they mean is that it has the dry, silent and inquisitive aspect of Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish films, but it has the strange, somehow moving elements of British comedians. <br /> <br /> I would say, definitely, definitely look at least half an hour of this. There is a part of me that I thought I had gone through by then - the rest continues in a similar assemblage of small scenes and moments, and they gradually evolve, but there is not a great plot to follow or a climax of the usual type. There are some great moments later, even just the attention to the storm, which takes us away pleasantly from the worldly human events. <br /> <br /> The shots are magnificent in their classic control, almost like a series of scenes by Gregory Crewdson (and actually surpasses the photographer, actually). And the acting, with all its ordinary people, not glam, is right. An amazing, beautiful, strange experience.
