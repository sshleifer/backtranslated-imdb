The mascot is the masterpiece of Ladislaw Starewicz. It tells the story of a toy dog ​​looking for an orange after hearing its mother tell her daughter that she has no money. The dog is chosen with other toys to be sold. In the truck, after the others jump down while the vehicle is running, the dog stays and waits to be picked up by the shop before leaving alone. He manages to grab the orange after nibbling the woman's leg while holding and selling the fruit. While running, he meets the devil and accepts his offer to stop at the nightclub. There, he meets the other toys that jump off the truck. The cat that was next to him in the vehicle is particularly determined to take the dog's orange. I will stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in a nightclub that you will have to see for yourself. Suffice it to say that if you love Starewicz and are interested in all the animations of the past, I strongly suggest you look for it!
