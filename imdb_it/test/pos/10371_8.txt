I saw this movie on the A & E channel last weekend. The mystery was ok, I wasn't able to guess the culprit before the end. But I really appreciated the characters and their development much more than the mystery. There was a mystery about some of them, particularly George Abernathie, played by the wonderful Michael Fassbender and George's cousin, Susannah. In fact, the story of those two characters left me wanting to learn more. From what I've tried to read in Agatha Christie's book with the same title, I think this film didn't follow it to the letter. Excellent performance of the actors involved, in particular Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / accompanist.
