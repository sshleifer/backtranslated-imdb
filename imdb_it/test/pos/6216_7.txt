This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced at the ABC branch in Detroit and consortium in 90 markets nationwide. Last week, Detroit public TV recorded a 1-1 / 2 hour movie as part of their pledge commitment. Wow, the memories that have resurfaced! While I remembered the show, there were segments that I had forgotten, but instantly remembered as soon as they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomato and the cakes in the face). <br /> <br /> For more information on the Public Television special, search for "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
