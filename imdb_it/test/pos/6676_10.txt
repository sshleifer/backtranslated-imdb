A beautiful, magical, stimulating and exciting story. Excellent direction, perfect cast, wonderful script, excellent soundtrack, beautifully lit ...... I have to say more? <br /> <br /> If you love movies that not only make you think, but also warm your heart (some come to mind "Contact", "Field of dreams" and "Groundhog Day"), then you will surely love K-PAX. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
