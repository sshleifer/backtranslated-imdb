This is the question astronauts Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of Earth always hidden on the opposite side of the sun in this 1969 cult science fiction melodrama, published here in America as A JOURNEY TO THE FAR OF THE SUN. The plot of the film was designed by British writers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the creators of such television programs as "UFO", "The Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". Sometimes it's extremely strange, betraying the influence of "The Twilight Zone" and even of the 2001 classic of Stanley Kubrick: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The visual effects work of Derek Meddings, who would later also work on SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, surprisingly surprisingly well over the last thirty years of progress in special effects; and although I'm not on the same exalted level as Kubrick's film, they are really superb. If you do not foresee a type of STAR WARS film and can overcome the sometimes banal dialogue, DOPPELGANGER is a good film; it was good enough for me to classify it as a "7" and consider it a science fiction gem to be discovered.
