I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the United States. This film is based on the events in the life of Gerrit and Celeste Wolfaardt. It's an extraordinary story. It inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved Country". The film is well produced. The music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashbacks. You will learn the stories of a white South African racist (Gerrit) and a black South African (Moses). Their lives cross violently. The ending is not typical of Hollywood - it's unusually realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about the characters and themes. <br /> <br /> Make sure you look through the credits - you'll get to watch Gerrit's footage in real life.
