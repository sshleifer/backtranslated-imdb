Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of film propaganda. The Russian people are threatened by two great enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to unite rival and struggling principles in the Russian realm, Nevsky takes over and fights the lesser of two evils (The Teutonics). This influential film has been copied many times and is still preserved to this day. Director Prokiev's soundtrack and Eisentstein's direction are a vision and a sound to be seen. Many years later, John Milius used many scenes from the film, scenes and costumes of this film and incorporated them into Conan. <br /> <br /> of my favorite Conan lines was taken from this movie. "It is not the strength of the iron in a weapon, but the strength of the person who exercises it is what counts." The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor that James Earl Jones and the leader of the Teutonic Knights wear are practically identical. A real tribute paid by one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my top tips. The film sounds like the last act of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is truly amazing.
