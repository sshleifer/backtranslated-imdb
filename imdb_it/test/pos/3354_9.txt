The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland ?? an X-rated musical comedy", it was in the early 80s in a cinema-theater in the city of New York with some friends. I remember that we really liked it a lot, even though we wondered why all the "goodies" were covered by various shapes in the shape of colored spots and why the film suddenly jumped from one scene to another, letting us guess ... what we is missed. Obviously it was the modified soft-core version (cut), which left me wanting to watch it again soon, but in its original full version. Well, more than 20 years have gone by, during which I forgot everything about this film and, just a few days ago, by pure chance, I came across a widely used VHS copy (which had seen better times: faded colors) , scratchy sound and some flaws), but guess what? It's the original full version and, this time, I really had a ball! Humor, Musical and Porn may seem an embarrassing combination but, in this case, it really works and, unlikely, most of the boring porn movies that today invade our screens, is a really fun and funny sexual fantasy, that won't disappoint you. The direction is intelligent, the quick editing makes the film fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are adorable or just funny, all the actors seem to have fun, the songs are catchy (it's worth mentioning the one about "growing") sung by Alice at the beginning of the film and by the exhilarating "What is a good girl like you in a Knight like this", the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged (incredibly energetic Terry Hall proves that she can "even" dance and her dances with enthusiasm make them disappear ... Don't worry, she also does what she was most known for ...), acting, singing, set, costumes are of a qualitative level and then ... c ' is Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in the first starring role in her career and (oh boy!) She really has some HC sequences! I personally think that they are not absolutely unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and quite exciting. She is young and (ohhh!) Very pretty; with the help of his new friends in Wonderland, he discovers his body and his sexuality so, he sings, dances and ... what do you expect? He is also experiencing sex! The closing sequence, when he finally makes love with his boyfriend, is exceptionally well-photographed and direct and is the highlight of the film. I think his "physique du role" (the innocent blue eyes and his captivating smile) and his ability to act make these explicit sequences more than acceptable and actually extremely pleasant. There is a lot of sex in (this) Wonderland and everyone seems eager to "get busy" with the first available boys or girls (or girls), which means that many hard-core actions are visible. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly "spliced ​​in", just to make the "porn-hounds" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, sexual action is not offensive since it is handled with a lot of humor and blends almost perfectly with music, dances and comedy. If you think you and your partner can manage the graphic sex, watch it together. Take my word, you will have an hour and a half of good time (maybe even an additional action after the show ...) This is "Entertainment for adults" so be careful, don't leave this video around or among other children video. If your 10 years can put it in your hands, it may entertain itself, but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations as to why "this" Alice behaves completely differently than the one she talks about in the Lewis Carroll novel or has looked at on the Disney video. I bet you won't forget this "one-of-a-kind" anytime soon. It is a pity that they do not do so ...! I give him a 9 out of 10.
