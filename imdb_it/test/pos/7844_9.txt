This is a wonderful film that takes place during the romantic period of the civil war. This film is a must see for Eastwood Fans and Eastwood claims this is one of his favorite movies he has made. Could not agree more. Careful! This is a spoiler: Eastwood dies at the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel have rightly argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for some reasons. They wanted to stick to the book, for example. Secondly, there cannot always be a happy ending. Thirdly, this was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement to this terrible war fight in which people were dying unnecessarily. I agree with all this. It's a beautifully shot film and I love most of the civil war movies. It is more a portrait of how deceiving women can be - which can be more dangerous than men, so the title has a lot to do with the BEGUILED film declaration - to be deceived. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and end of the film is another statement against not only the civil war, but also the Vietnam War and perhaps indirectly the women he meets during the film. Wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes - NOTE: This movie is rated R for no reason. There is almost no language, it is probably a part of the matter that involves sex, but there is really no nudity. Excellent film - 9/10.
