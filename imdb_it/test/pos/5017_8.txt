What do certain films that generate such opposite reactions talk about? <br /> <br /> Some people here have called the High Roller "disgusting". Some have called it "extraordinary" (as I would say, actually). <br /> <br /> Why? I think it's because movies like this don't make the heroes of the idiots or the glamor of degeneration, and some people can't handle it emotionally. They NEED a hero. And I also add that if they are gamblers or poker players, they may feel personally betrayed when their existence is not justified. <br /> <br /> High Roller is NOT a poker movie. It's a PEOPLE movie. It's not perfect, but it looks good, it's well written and wonderfully performed. And above all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what makes some people so damn crazy.
