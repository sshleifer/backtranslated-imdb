This young director has a talent for quickly capturing his audience with an unusual photographic work and scattered but intense scripts. The concept of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well executed and the soundtrack is very good. <br /> <br /> The decision to publish the film in twelve online parts requires the director to make every episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in the purchase of each upcoming episode. I just wish all the movies had this kind of commitment to keep their audience entertained during their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
