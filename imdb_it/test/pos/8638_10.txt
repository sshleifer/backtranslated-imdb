With an opening segment that mimics the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes's Safe (1995), David Lynch uses the dream, myth and distorted notions of reality to tell the fragmented story of a failed Hollywood actress / maid, Diane Selwyn , disappointed by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to director Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> The film actually takes place in the drugged head of Diane; we are witnesses of his extravagant distortions, his desires, his regrets, obsessions and fears. Using dream narrative as a way to present two concepts of conflicting reality, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively involves them. The last 45 minutes are as dreamlike as the one that came before; and the problematic air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly safe distinction between reality and dream that we expect to see in the movies about nightmares and dreams. <br /> <br /> Lynch's film borrows many films, old and new, but in the end it is a film unlike any other, except for the director's Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. Yet it is not as pretentious as one might have imagined because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist, despite his murderous actions - an element that was missing in all his other films, except for Straight Story. He does this by presenting the alter ego of Diane's dream, Betty, as a healthy Canadian farm girl destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and denies equally. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue woman? What does she mean? Who's the ass behind Winkies? What is the meaning of the rotting corpse in the Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is Silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential reflection on the state of the film as a fiction? Lynch is not willing to answer any questions she poses, choosing instead to present her "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs. <br /> <br /> The acting is in first place, especially Naomi Watts in the role of Diane Selwyn / Betty, who has yet to eclipse this performance. Laura Harring has the Hayworthesque charm required as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings free-wheeling arrogance and paranoid aggression sublimated to his role. It was amazing and a grave injustice that none of them was even nominated for an Academy Award. <br /> <br /> This is a film that needs to be viewed and analyzed closely. The mystery in the heart of the film remains in the hands of Lynch but half the fun is finding coherent ideas from the maze of apparent inconsistencies it presents. On closer inspection there is a precise sense of an enigma, perhaps an incomplete puzzle that teases us with the closure but denies the imaginary fullness of narrative coherence. Ultimately, this is Lynch's key film.
