This film is about the crew of a spaceship crashing into a strange bright planet with three suns. Among the passengers, the serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser), were sentenced. While the wreck survivors are oriented, an eclipse occurs of all three suns. Shortly thereafter, frightening creatures begin to appear and begin to take the crew members one by one. During the eclipse, Riddick enters his, while his eyeballs have been surgically polished, giving him night vision. The crew must rely on him to try to bring them to safety. <br /> <br /> This is a very elegant film, with the color of the sky changing scene by scene, giving it a very strange look. Vin Diesel is as brilliant as Riddick, really threatening but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat. There is also a basic humor in his performance, which adds another dimension to the character. This is the kind of role that Vin excels, the anti-hero, whose character is not as one-dimensional as it appears for the first time. I can't imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him. <br /> <br /> Roll on Chronicles of Riddick!
