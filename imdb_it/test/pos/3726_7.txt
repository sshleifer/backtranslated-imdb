Well, I guess I'm in the mood for a movie that really caught me from the start. This film was not. For the first 40 minutes it was a slow and deliberate rhythm, but there was nothing really interesting that interested me - there is an intriguing and mysterious feud between the character of Jean Reno and an old man, but more than the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wandering of the main character, of which I did not know much and to whom I could not really relate. He wanders alone for the most part, meets no one; I imagine the director is trying to describe the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something like that, which is okay, but I would still like it shot down from 40 minutes to 15 because it can become incredibly boring. <br /> <br /> But after those 40 minutes, things start to get very interesting. I guess I won't say any more about this because I don't want to ruin anything. So if you've seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking of turning it off (like I was), just do it - it gets a lot better. <br /> <br /> One of these the most interesting things I found on this film was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever, which made me think about what was happening, how the characters felt and what they were their motivations, because things were as they were in this post-apocalyptic world, which gives the story plenty of room for public interpretation. And it's amazing how more satisfying a movie is when the actors don't tell you exactly what's going on.
