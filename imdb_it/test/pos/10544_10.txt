At first it seems the current novel where a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the point is that this film has a feeling that others do not have. The first time I saw it I didn't see it complete because But as I was walking I thought I had to see it again but I had no opportunity since. One year passed until I saw this film in a non-free channel and I saw it and recorded it too I saw it once, twice ... up to 200 times and not kidding. I knew all of Hart's dialogues and I don't know why but I saw him every day and I never got bored. And I must say that I'm not used to seeing a movie more than twice. The act is very good. Gerard Depardieu is also a talented actor and also katherine heigl. I'd like you to be in a good movie because I think you can do it. , it's a film I can't get out of my head.
