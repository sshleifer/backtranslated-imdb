This documentary traces the origins and life of the Zephyr skateboarding team, using an original film shot in the 70s (mainly by Craig Stecyk) combined with interviews with team members and other influential people today. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film documents how the "Dogtown" section of Venice, CA, was born from the beginning of the century, when the city was created to be a European city similar to Venice and to the 'Italy. In the 1970s, the only remaining local attraction, the Pacific Ocean Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with many exposed piers and other dangers. The poor children living in the area had nothing better to do than to sail, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. As the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they took skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty pools caused by the drought in those years and the surf backgrounds led them to create the style of vertical skateboard that is mainstream today. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the film was much more about surfing than I expected, which seemed like an advantage because I didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before watching the movie. Even the soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good. I also liked the way these guys were following their passion and generally went better for the experience. The parts that didn't work out so well for me were the drama they tried to create, that seemed a bit forced, and the slightly exaggerated sense of their importance (although this is probably just a street-like attitude from where they grew up on). This does not mean that they did not have a significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were also other factors. <br /> <br /> A note: my wife is more affected than most of the nausea when the movies use what we call "SpastiCam" (flopping camera movements). This film is often guilty, so if you are so distressed, be warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone who has skateboarding and / or surfing in his story. <br /> <br /> Seen 5/11/2002.
