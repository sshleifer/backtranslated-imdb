This program is definitely my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very few good programs - most of the TV I watch (and live in Australia) comes from the United States and England. <br /> <br /> The most fun part of this show is how controversial it is. Like when they overcame numerous security barriers at the APEC summit pretending to be Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show is composed of pre-filmed acrobatics, general satirical discussions on current world events and, sometimes, stage shows. These come together to create a fabulous and extremely entertaining TV show. Segments like "Ad Road-test" and "Message from Osama bin Laden" are hilarious. For anyone interested in watching a fun satirical television comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch. <br /> <br /> All the guys are fantastic and do a great job entertaining you for half an hour. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 10/10.
