Many other eloquent reviews of this have described the rather spectacular acting, casting and style of this film. It seems that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the management of the moral issue (euthanasia) of the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from the final scenes, this film is meticulous in emphasizing Ramon's belief that he is not making a big point but simply that, for him, a life without dignity is a life that is not worth worth living. We, as spectators, see an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for his physical limits, a fully lived life. At the center of the tragedy of this film there is only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - and this is him. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie and saying that the only counter-argument comes from a bumbling priest's visit is absurdity. The visit of the priest is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the response of the Spanish Catholic Church to the question of euthanasia. However, the sister's words of separation to the priest momentarily reveal the powerful "pro-life" feelings that calmly support the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we can gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning, but we have never been reconciled to his decision. <br /> <br /> I don't remember a film that touched me and caused me so much.
