First, let's call this movie what it is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a wellness film with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. The acting is ok, the dialogue is slightly better, the production value is quite good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby scenes ... barely viable. <br /> <br /> But here's the trick: it's not something that Hollywood invented, and isn't trying to be a fiercely accurate portrayal of sport. Instead it is a good representation of mostly real people, in real circumstances and a real plot. Of course, they could have done a better job of representing sport, but my vote: it does a good job at what it proposes to do. <br /> <br /> (And fw, I can't think of many football, baseball, hockey or soccer films that are true for sport too. Come on ... Bull Durham?) <br /> <br /> I am not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated in Highland, I attended the '86 -'90 and occasionally I trained with the Rugby boys. My brother-in-law, David, however, was one of the original founding members of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother, Billy, played the following year, if I remember correctly ... If you're interested, there's a Highland Rugby website on highlandrugby.net that addresses the team's history. <br /> <br /> When I was there the club had existed for about a decade and had long since built a reputation for excellence. they focused on "broad" training topics: devotion, honor, discipline, commitment, not tactics I thought the rugby boys I knew were a bit "out" in the head, but I think I could have been a little jealous They were hard-core dedicated to the belief system promoted by Gelwix. <br /> <br /> As for the "cultural mix" issues that have been raised, it might be interesting to note that while I was there in the 1980s , one of the largest schools in the city was closed - South High School - and its s tudents were distributed among the other 3 SLC primary schools. To be honest, the Highlands of the 80s were a nice focaccia ... I have a picture of the team since (I think) 1977 showing a white * all * club. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a couple of friends from the South who joined the team, a Tongan, a Samoan, and as a souvenir there were a group of island nations players who joined in '88 -'90. I don't think anyone has questioned the credibility of the team in adopting the Maori traditions (or other cultures): if there was one obvious thing about these guys, is that they walked. <br /> <br /> And as for the strength of the team compared to the best high school teams in the world: yes, it is true that American rugby, on average if taken as a whole, does not represent particularly well against the best somewhere else. There are exceptions, but hey - it is a fact that Rugby does not have the pre-eminence or exposure necessary to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the United States that arise in other countries. <br /> <br /> Having said that, rate Highland in its merit: <br /> <br /> - the * only * team that qualifies for the US National Rugby Championships every year in that 25-year history organization. <br /> <br /> - a record victory of 392 victories, 9 defeats. Read again ... most successful coach in any American sport in history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing victories against some legitimate international groups. <br /> <br /> Are they the best world? Maybe some years, probably not most ... but they are pretty good on a consistent basis. And it is disrespectful for the game to blow it, when Highland Rugby could be the best sports ambassador in the United States.
