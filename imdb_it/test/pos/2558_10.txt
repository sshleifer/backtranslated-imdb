my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold London night in Leicester Square, after the film, says: if they didn't speak English and didn't show the stadium, you might have thought they were the slums of a South American city or some other slum anywhere in the world , not Queens in New York. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani is, at this moment, my official hero, because he seems to have dedicated his work to showing not the OTHER face of the American, but the true face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani's films are like Bicycle Thieves, or Germany Year Zero, or Rome Open City. Chop's shop is actually transformed into a film, it's more realistic than a documentary, in fact I think Ramin Bahrani's films are more realistic than documentaries. This is a fantastic movie, but don't expect to chase or shoot in the car. This film is about tragic lives on the edge of the richest and richest country in the world.
