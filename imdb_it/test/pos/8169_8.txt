The last few days are the best gay movies of the homosexual genre. Do most movies include weak night stories, and let's not forget the infamous baseball teams? The last few days really contain male affection beyond the kiss in the dark, and a fairly graphic material that made me wonder if the film belonged to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The emotional journey of the film is what sets it apart from the rest of the genre. Not before this film I saw a story of passion and love so intense and the torture it can bring. I think when people cry during movies they should be beaten, but I find myself sobbing in different scenes because of the realistic nature of the world we live in. I suggest that every gay male see this movie, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
