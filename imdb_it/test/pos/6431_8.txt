It must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens, yet still attract the attention of the spectators. I think this short film gets this with a simple quality. Rutger has an extraordinary voice, very soothing, wise and paternal, (I'm not gay) and remembers the qualities that Robert Redford has in narrating. The end is very sad, but beautiful. One wonders how long Harry has left, will he feel lonely and can say his goodbyes? Also one gets bored with Mr Hauer for not getting involved in other jobs of this caliber. We hope you continue to do a good job in the Netherlands and stay away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing
