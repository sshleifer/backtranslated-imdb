A great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their days as a student in 1960 at their meeting 10 years later - a Yugoslav immigrant in love with the American dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality; a son of the undertaker prematurely bald; a soldier; and the crazy hippy girl that everyone loves. Good direction and a strong cast do justice to Steve Tesich's brilliant script; the dialogue is not as lively as in "Breaking Away", but the themes of growth and of the father-son conflict are treated equally, and there are still some wonderfully comic moments between the shocks and the drama.
