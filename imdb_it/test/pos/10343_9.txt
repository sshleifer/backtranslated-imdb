Great movie. Good acting, a wonderful script. It is exciting to find out what people think and how they react to the situation in which they find themselves. A pity for the ending; a "page" of text on how Nynke's life went, instead of moving the images it was a wrong choice. I hope this film attracts many people; it's worth it!
