A year after the release of the "House of Frankenstein" media, Universal released another Monster Mash in which all their famous characters would clash once again. "House of Dracula" would have brought together Dracula, the creature of Frankenstein and the Wolf Man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for study. Once again directed by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement compared to the previous film and offers a story better built (even if still imperfect) which, far from being perfect, is a more complete closure appropriate with respect to the previous film. <br /> <br /> The story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new perspective into the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide in the sunlight, asks for help from the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a doctor famous for his research in biology. Edelman is fascinated by Dracula, and soon an experimental treatment begins, meanwhile Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the Wolf Man, visits Edelman in order to get rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him. The discovery of the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacomb will bring more tumult to the mind of the brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it is nice to see the series go back to the roots and offering an almost linear Gothic horror that returns to the obscure pessimistic nature of this kind of film and moves away from the comic relief of the previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.), has many interesting themes, such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure, but for different purposes) and the growing madness of Edelman. Probably one of the most interesting topics is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a beautiful but deformed woman who helps Dr. Edelman hope to be healed of her condition. <br /> <br /> Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time he finally manages to capture the dark nature of these three characters, a nature apparently lost in the previous film. Despite the small budget, Kenton creates a gothic horror that, although simple, is quite effective and even manages to present old partners as these characters in a new way. Although it is never at the level of the originals, "House of Dracula" recovers the charm that Universal Studios horror films had in the past, and Kenton makes sure that at least one last time the monsters get the chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange resuming their roles (although the role of Strange is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than the previous film. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast bring the tragedy and drama to the series, with Stevens offering a formidable performance as Dr. Edelman. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the creepy Steinmuhl complete one of the best casts of Universal's horror films over the years. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a nice addition to the series, especially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein". It's nice to see Kenton in good shape again in a rather serious horror movie, and while the plot is quite original, he suffers not only for the budget, but because the film tries to do a lot in a very short runtime with results. It is true that the characters have all very creative narrative lines, but the film devotes very little time to each of them to develop, and the film seems very hasty and disconnected. <br /> <br /> Although not perfect, it is also Far from being the worst in the series. "House of Dracula" is a beautiful closure for one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and demons roamed the misty nights, and mad scientists gave birth to horrible monsters. Later the monsters would return to "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would have been a completely different context. after the previous disappointing rumors, it is easy to reject "House of Dracula", but give it a chance and let the monster wander for the last time. 7/10
