From a perspective that is possible to make films that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this is definitely worth it. This is the second Bruce Willis film that manages to tell its story without nudity, offensive humor, obscenity or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both films are engaged on more than one level. This is also appropriate for children, although as others have pointed out, it is not a children's film. <br /> <br /> It bothered me that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know that Russell himself starts it as a 70 year old child. Also, because his dying mother has to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; because, if as his older self says, he has to fight that boy over and over for the next few years, his mother doesn't have to come and get him every time, and because he doesn't learn to kick ass. I also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate for action on stage. <br /> <br /> A good use of the red plan as a metaphor, however.
