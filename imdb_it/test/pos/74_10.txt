Darling Lili is fantastic! It is by far my favorite movie! It certainly did not deserve the negative reviews it received. Julie Andrews, in the lead role of Lili Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole film. She is lovely and spectacular! Since Julie Andrews is my favorite actress and singer by far, I was not at all surprised by her beauty. This film is simply ... fantastic (I'm short on adjectives!), It's magnificent, wonderful, fantastic, fun, terribly romantic, sad, and just a total thrill and all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews! to her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh, yes Rock Hudson was ok, too :) <br /> <br /> Julie Andrews is the beautiful and beloved singer, Lili Smith. Rock Hudson plays Major Larabee, who falls quickly for Lili, and she with him. But their relationship was not coincident. There the meeting was planned by the German government (I'm not sure it is exactly what you would call them, but you understand the point), because the warm, happy and singer entertainer Lili is actually a German spy. Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee to get information on the new Top Secret Opertaion (later known as "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, he falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), for real, making his original research challenging. But Lili approaches and completes the task, having discovered something that is not really true about Bill. The ending will remain untold by me as it is beautifully defined. If ever, you'll like this movie very much, I definitely did it !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
