I remember I didn't love this movie the first time I saw it, but it grew with me. I love the costumes and the poses of the actors, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. The scenes are very rich and move very quickly. Every time I look at it, there is something new that catches my eye. Aaliyah like Akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Lestat's film in this film is different, it's not the same character. You can see that the character Armand has been given qualities like Lestat because I assume Anne wanted it. But there's no reason to destroy this movie just because it's not like books, it's fascinating on its own.
