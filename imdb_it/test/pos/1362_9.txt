I liked it a lot, but I have friends who hate it. There is no sex, but there is very little nudism in any of the episodes - which is a good thing. Furthermore, Keitaro has a toilet fixation that is explored in at least half of the episodes. (The toilets are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I wonder why I rated it so high ...? It certainly isn't that I like nude cartoon girls. In some ways, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is analogous to Johnny Bravo, except for being a hateful, muscular athlete, Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of him as Japan's answer to Leisure Suit Larry. It's easier to take if you look at it with subtitles rather than dubbed, but it grows on you in both cases if you give it a chance. He is the golden boy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. The boy meets the girl, the boy tries to win the girl's heart despite being a perverse perverse, the boy somehow succeeds against all odds. Generally, the girl does not realize that she likes Keitaro until after being defeated in a mess and / or having done some spectacular feat like designing a modern operating system in a week or winning a race against a gasoline motorcycle using his bicycle. br /> <br /> Episode # 1 presents a rich software tycoon. I think animating her tits is a big problem for the budget because she is the only female to have this kind of animation. It also dresses completely not professionally. Most people who evaluate it negatively probably never passed the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode 2 has the rich, young daughter who likes to tease. He is only 16 but is legal in Japan (and in some states of the United States, I might add). His father is also a brutal type of yakuzza who has a reputation for killing boys interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner who is confused with a bad boy. Apart from Keitaro, who interferes with the girl and is kissed by a boy, in this episode there are almost no echoes of any kind - a sharp drop from the previous ones. Nevertheless, Keitaro and the evil boyfriend beat each other. <br /> <br /> Episode number 4 caused Keitaro to try to impress a top-notch swimming instructor. Keitaro seems more "direct" to his intentions with this particular girl than any other ... and is rather direct in return ... <br /> <br /> Girl # 5 is the biker girl. It is probably the heaviest of the 6 (though not super-dynamic like girl 1) and "more angry" in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is easily the most exaggerated in terms of (lack of) realism. Keitaro should have broken every bone in his body at least twice during the race against the biker, but I think producers and writers said, "It's just a cartoon! We can do anything!" This episode of realism makes him a favorite fan. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode n. 6 introduces a new girl (who works in the animation) and the previous 5 girls help Keitaro as he tries to cope with time and resource constraints impossible to get an OAV outside the door within the deadline. In terms of ecchi, this is also very docile, but there is a lot of humor. The final has all 5 extremely cute girls from the past who team up to hunt down Keitaro, who slips away unnoticed, apparently with the intention of raping him in a group. Yes, that - ALMOST - happens in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (Samurai Shodown wing) with Steve Urkel (Family Matters wing) ... <br /> <br /> All in all, there is no middle ground for this. Either he will hate it or you will love it. If you're new to the anime, you probably don't want to start with this. At the same time, if you can stand characters like Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that lean more heavily towards stupidity, but with very sexual nuances, you should give it a try.
