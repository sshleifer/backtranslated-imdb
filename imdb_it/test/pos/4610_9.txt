The British nobleman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene) decides to look for his two best friends who disappeared after visiting Count Karl von Bruno (Stephen MaNally), an evil and powerful man who lives in the Black Castle. Sir Burton travels under cover with another identity, since he fought against Count von Bruno in Afrika with his two missing friends and the count lost an eye in a battle. When he arrives in the castle, he is invited to hunt in the Black Forest around the castle with the count, while he looks for evidence that the count has killed his friends. Later, he and the count's wife, Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corday), fall in love with each other and with the support of dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff), Sir Burton and the Countess try to escape from the claws of Count von Bruno. "The Black Castle" is an excellent film from a romantic moment, with action, romance, mystery and even horror. The plot is compelling and is a great entertainment for any audience. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Castelo do Pavor" ("The Castle of Fear")
