I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with most of the comments of the people that this is an all-around action film with a well-told story and good acting. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 100% cinematography for its opening sequence. The opening blow is staggering and I still haven't figured out how they did it. It's worth watching the movie for that shot alone! It's a shame then that the DVD currently being released is just the film and no information is given on the making of the film. We hope that someone will come with the special edition. <br /> <br /> And the best thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending, letting you fully guess! Big things. A must for a classic movie collector.
