This is a great gift for Valentine's Day. A gorgeous boy and a cute girl fall in love as they try to beat the competition in a cooking contest. Very romantic. I am a true fan of Costas Mandylor from his days at Picket Fences and has not lost his charm. Lauren Holly is still adorable and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together. The supporting cast was also good. Seeing all those wonderful sweets made was a delightful sight in itself. I loved that Costas and Lauren have come together to win in the cooking competition and in love. This is the kind of film that satisfies all palates, romantic and not. Hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception. The whole family can watch this movie. It also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity. I found myself sighing and wanting more for this film and also for the wonderful desserts. I highly recommend this film for all ages. A great surprise for everyone.
