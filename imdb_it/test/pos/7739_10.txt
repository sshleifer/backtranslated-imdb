What will Prospero be in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why would a man need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and her friend? Because it is too difficult to live and love in good condition in "civilization". This man (John Cassavetes) is a giant with a broken heart, he can command the storm. It has power, strength but it is human. The deep love of life is the subject of this extraordinary film. The acting is incredible, all the genius of John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and Paul Mazurky of course. don't miss it will be a mistake, this film is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of movies.
