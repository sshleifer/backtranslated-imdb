VHS - I watched it over and over again and loved every moment of it, so I ordered the DVD. I was just hoping the movie could have lasted longer. I never worry about what others think I prefer to think completely and completely disagree with the negative comments and not allow others to ruin my enjoyment of the film. Make up your mind and don't let others leave you! I have all the Jane Austen BBC series but this is my FAVORITE. I see that there will be a NEW Northanger Abbey published in 2007 that I will buy when it comes out but it won't stop me from seeing Northanger Abbey released in the 1980s.
