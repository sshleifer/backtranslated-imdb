I must admit that this film was horrible, poor, sexist, badly re-named and poorly written, but I love it anyway. I saw this film for the first time when I was 14, and has stayed with me ever since. Sincerely, this is very close to hard-core porn as a memory. Surely he ran my juice. This film gives a completely new meaning to Swedish eroticism. It is a humorous view of human sexuality, seen by very randy female aliens who, I think, are only looking for some sperm for their dying race.
