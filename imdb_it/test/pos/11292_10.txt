The visual effectiveness of this film has no equal to anything I've seen. And the work required to do it must have been incredibly long and boring (don't just paste "Kodak Grainy Film" into your camera to get this look). Don't watch this movie to entertain it, watch it visually stimulated, see it challenge and provoke in your thoughts about the film and any other topic that comes to mind, religion will probably be a thought. <br /> <br />
