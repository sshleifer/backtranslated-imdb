I don't think the world is ready for this movie. I know I wasn't. I would have expected a low budget standard schlock exploitation potboiler. Instead, I got the smarter reworking of Shakespeare from Peter Greenaway's "Prospero's Books". This should become the definitive film version of Romeo and Juliet. He obviously won't. But this is the loss of the world.
