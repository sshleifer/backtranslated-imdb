I actually saw One Dark Night in the theater for the first time and wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper. I loved it and still love it. The plot revolves around two people. First of all, a woman discovers that her father has a telekenisi after his death. She then tried herself for her father's strange powers even in her death. The mauseleo in which he is buried houses the other main person, a high school girl who does something to enter with a group of girls who just want to torment her and who make her stay in the mauseleo all night to join their group. They come back at night to frighten her and find fear for themselves. The cast is led by Meg Tilly with Adam West's secondary roles and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Daily. Take a look at this if you love 80s movies and cheese horror movies, you will never be unhappy.
