Although it was not inspired by inspired opening music, somehow we know that the word "go" is going straight to the "big fun" drawer. The moment we observe Monica Dolan (in a brilliant casting piece) delightfully joking about Cora since we were already engaged, but it is only later when she reveals herself in her wonderful creation of screens, that shocking, intriguing, evil queen of murder and deceit posing in the guise of Miss Gilchrist, who not only steals the entire telemovie without effort for herself, but simply sweeps away from the screen anyone who comes close to her, including the always well-measured David Suchet who appears to be him herself being a little dazzled by her acting talents and, very kindly, allowing her to be at the center of the scene. Dolan is the real motor of the film and his Miss Gilchrist is a really well rounded character in this interpretation of Christie, helped by a lively screenplay and the lively direction of the rhythm - and also by the rest of the cast led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott, that all show signs of sympathy for the given material and play accordingly with taste. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are bet as usual, and if there are weaker links, most of the last Poirots, and perhaps the lack of a real actor of Italian origin for the role of Cora's husband. In addition to this, this is an hour and a half of pure television pleasure that is as self-indulgent and enjoyable as it is lovingly put together.
