In 1968, when "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" was published, it came out of nowhere and struck like psychedelic lightning. The African American actor and director, William Greaves, aimed to forever change the "newsreel" style of documentary production, and to date there has never been anything like it. The film is a film about "the making of a film", and intentionally written and directed in order to create as many controversies and possible contradictions. Set in New York's Central Park, the action and the lack of dialogue relate to a couple fighting and bickering about homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants to get out of the relationship and the man wants an explanation. Towards the end of this interaction, a drunken homeless interrupts the proceedings and offers his comment and personal background. Then, after the main movie was filmed, the film crew adds its opinions to the filmmaker and what they hear is its ineffable management of the film. And throughout the entire movie, multiple cameras are used to record the action within the scene and extraneous commentary for cast, crew and viewers. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone interested in Avant Garde's film makers like Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves attempts to prove that something cannot really be observed and understood because the vision itself would alter reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be seen as a cinematographic representation or application of the Principle of uncertainty. This is only a possible explanation, and the true intent of Greave is certainly open to speculation. Above all, this film tries to confuse, to face. and stimulate, and without doubt, it succeeds admirably.
