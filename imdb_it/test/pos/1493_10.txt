This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in other excellent sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (better than this) and Blackadder (not better than that). <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is a human disaster without words. He goes to places and finds himself in absolute chaos, chaos includes: Climbing onto the upper trampoline and being too scared to jump off, taking about 20 minutes, until some children finally throw him out, ending up in a washing machine and driving his car while sitting on a roof. Bean drives a Mini and has a teddy bear. <br /> <br /> This was quite similar to The Baldy Man, a series that stares at Gregor Fisher that says very little, but is in chaos Best Episode: Do it Yourself Mr Bean, Episode 9: Bean hosts a party of new year, then he gets some things to decorate his apartment, but he has too many things and has to drive his car to the roof.
