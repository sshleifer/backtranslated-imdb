"Head" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The film is a complete contradiction of the image of Monkees. Present the Monkees in a way that their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, Monke had the opportunity to tell their version of the story. The film makes fun of their image, the entertainment industry and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It is a film that is worth seeing over and over again.
