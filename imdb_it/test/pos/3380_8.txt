I just saw this movie in prime time out of curiosity and pure nostalgia. I loved (unloved) "Mork & Mindy" as a child, especially for the zealous energy performance of Robin William. This movie reminded me of why. Was the original show great? Not really, but surely Robin was. Which brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing but a painting based on the chronological number that tells the show (which in a sense was). But of course, the real goal was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from the street jester fighting the national star, and how such a drastic difference struck him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is ready to play Chris Diamantopoulos while playing Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity and heart; it's not just a good impression, even if it was even perfect. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin's struggles were somewhat similar to Andy Kaufman, who was little appreciated by the television network and retained creatively, but this is the "Taxi" behind the biographical film.) < br /> All in all, this was a very funny film, in which I felt I knew a little more about the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid from everything, never from the melodramatic point of view, as I suspected, and the story moved well. Shows that were particularly good were those that played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi called Robin was a hoot!). Not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a little more about Pam Dawber), but certainly watchable, especially for those Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy" fans. Nanoo, nanoo!
