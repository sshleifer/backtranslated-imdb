As a film, THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best; good (not great) acting, <br /> <br /> beautiful graphics and rhythm, a mediocre plot, but not bad enough <br /> <br /> to go out. But as a car spot for the new generation of MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, this film is spectacular! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Ok, it's a typical robbery movie with the strange touch (the submarine cracking was nice, if not unlikely), and the cast was pretty solid <br /> <br /> (with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg), but when it all came to the end, the true "stars" of this image were the three MINI < br /> <br /> Coopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping, <br /> <br /> projectile grip, driving gold, resplendent new glory. The audience I was <br /> <br /> sitting between "ooed" and "aahed" when the little red number of <br /> <br /> hit the screen (strangely, neither she nor <br /> < br /> Wahlberg has collected the same reaction). <br /> <br /> The film starts promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as a <br /> band of interesting and humorous characters, with the only true <br /> Uninspired performance is that of the usual good Mark <br /> <br /> Wahlberg. Because he claims that this is his best film that I can't imagine; his character <br /> <br /> is completely monotonous, and he interprets it so blandly that it is as if Mr. Rogers had returned from the dead and lived. <br /> <his Charlize body is as good as Sutherland's daughter, though nothing magical. Seth Green's character is perfect and Napster's <br /> lines (including a cameo by Napster founder, <br /> Shawn Fanning) are hilarious; he and some of the early <br /> lines of Mos Def add some very necessary sparks of humor. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't get close enough to <br /> to the screen. <br /> <br /> You can see much of the plot coming from a far, and the dialogue <br /> <br /> is full of bad jokes and gifts, but I doubt that the filmmakers went to reinvent the wheel here , then taken as a typical action / suspense movie, comes out well. It is worth visiting the cheap <br /> night I would recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10. It is not worth its weight in gold, but it makes fillings pleasant.
