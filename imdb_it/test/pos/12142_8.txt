I've only seen half a dozen films with Lino Ventura, but this one looks very similar to the others. He plays a laconic criminal - one who is at a loss for words and submissive but occasionally explosive. Given his silent character in such films as ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I noticed that his minimalist acting style is extremely effective. In other words, because it is so quiet and polite, when it does bad things you tend to notice. And, like these other films, it also has a very strong, though twisted, moral code. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner, Lilane, both live in Italy and are career criminals. Both grew up in France and eventually had to clean up because of their criminal activities. Now in Italy, when the film begins, they continue to live the life of hooligans and the heat is turned on to capture them. Strangely, instead of rushing to a third country, they decide to return to France - even if Davos was tried and sentenced in absentia - and if he is captured it could mean a life in prison or the death penalty. Much of the first third of the film is about their secret return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Davos, the return does not go perfectly and now it seems that every policeman in France is looking for him. Moreover, the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what one would expect. In fact, their lukewarm response on his return ends up unleashing a series of terrible events towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Davos meets and is caught in my stranger, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Although Davos apparently has no friends, Stark and her friend do their best to make his comeback successful. What throws another wrench into this, though, is that the two very young children of Davos - what is Davos to do with them - keep them with him in his hiding place? <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great criminal film - a bit like the French Film Noir. Unlike American Noir, the many French versions I've seen look more realistic and bleak towards them. Fatalism reigns supreme, that's for sure! The acting is top notch (especially from Ventura and Belmondo), the direction is very safe and the script is very beautiful, although I'm sure many won't like the ending. It just seems to be attacked - like an afterthought. I understand why they did it this way, but can also see how it could leave many dissatisfied. For me, he left me a bit flat. Otherwise, an exceptional film.
