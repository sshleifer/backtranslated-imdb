I LOVED THIS MOVIE well I loved the romantic part with COlby and the girl ... Rachel (?) 4got her name .... honestly I was only interested in those too. I loved them in the movie I want to see more movies like that. but please don't end up sad anymore where they can't be 2gether! = (it made me cry! but the love story between them. the plot of the trauma was all fantastic. =) I was just more in Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) Everything about this movie was kind of thrilling to keep you glued to your place. because I was sure. Honestly my only personal wish would be more concentrated between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent ending. I hated the ending, a better one could have been more thought of, not the fact of forcing COlby to his death and Rachel having a son. The ending would have killed the film.
