How many reviews of this film will I have to write before I got it right? Tom Conway completely inherits the mantle of the Falcon from his real brother George Sanders with this voice. Dressed in beautiful double-breasted suits, with a single button and drape, in stunning 110% cars with huge fender skirts and suicide doors that reach your armpit, Conway travels from New York to Miami to hold a formula for industrial diamonds to fall into the wrong hands. His "client" is the adorable, virginal Louisa Briganza who has gorgeous hair, but will only let you kiss her for the first two months. Along the way he comes across the kind of colorful matrix of characters that only a B movie could provide. His partner in this release is perhaps the best of the Falcon Edward Brophy comrades in the role of Goldie Locke who are given some really fun lines. Doris Blanding, the type of chick of the 1940s we know, comes across a left plate. His cohort is Benny played by Steve Brodie who, twenty years later, was a Presley punching bag in two Paramount King movies. They both work for the cold fish and the sailing garment worn by Kenneth Sutton, ready to do what it takes to get the formula while he is sailing his yacht in Brazil. Saddled with the smartest policemen chasing the Hawks, this voice still reigns supreme. Forget those 120 minutes of melodrama, give me a 1-hour Falcon movie every day. I have a wife and two children - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake a dry martini and forget your problems with this great Hawk movie. But if you didn't record it via local TV in Toronto like I did 17 years ago, you're unlucky.
