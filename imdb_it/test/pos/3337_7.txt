Excellent voice in the RKO Saint series with a well-written original screenplay, good photographic work and transitions, good direction to manage some plot twists, good editing to keep the flow constant and good acting. George Sanders is sweet and witty. Jonathan Hale is simply Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can't stand the pressure. Will return to a later item in the series. The story begins on a transatlantic liner bound for the United States where the saint meets but fails to connect with Wendie Barrie. In the end he succumbs to the charm of the Saint, but she breaks his heart at the end. The Saint helps Inspector Fernack erase his name from a frame. Some bodies fall along the road. Have fun and above average for this type of film. Watch it.
