The Beguiled is one of those films under-viewed in the careers of a director and / or actor that ends up playing better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry, they also worked together on this little psychosexual drama set in the Civil War period Confederation. It's almost a 180 of what Harry has had for the public. Here is a film that is under the radar, and with a budget reduced to almost no business when compared to what Dirty Harry pulled into. It is also a story in which Eastwood is not surrounded by a world full of dangerous men, but women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides to them. And there is also romance among some of the roughest and most complex scenes. But in this kind of frame to make the film, Siegel therefore has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the image that wanders into something more European; Polanski's work in the 1960s comes to mind here and there. Everything works very well even with the initial doubt that these two male film figures (Eastwood the obvious and Siegel who made his niche in B-noir and low-budget thriller) can pull out material that could be made for a film Lifetime. <br /> <br /> It was also captivating and really darkly comic here and there to watch Eastwood's performance work off these girls. He is doing something a little subversive in his performance while still having that kind of Eastwood machismo - if there's anything like his clich√© movie image - being a step ahead of this little school for young women sometimes and not in others. Seeing Eastwood in a performance like this, as in the case of Play Misty for Me (Eastwood's other work from 1971), shows how good it is to be able to act credibly with very good actresses. In particular, here are the four main female characters, each of varying ages and each with different attractions for their man 'Yankee'. While Siegel's work to direct all the actors has its moments in the first half, it is really once the story goes through half the sequence of dreams (less successful than the director could be) that the real juicy scenes begin to rise. Much of this is the best that Siegel has dramatically directed, pushing the psychological and emotional boundaries of scenes that were not expected. <br /> <br /> It is a difficult film, apart from this, because it does not paint anyone being too respectable, only the character of Hallie, the slave on duty played by Mae Mercer, is somehow separated from what happens between women too curious and McBurney. Along with this, Eastood here is playing a role that is and is not what is usually seen in this period of his real formative years in films. He's an anti-hero here, which was his trademark for westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time. But unlike those films, it is not in a way in which it is "bigger than life", to put it in a sense, since it is both a deserter and a womanizer, deceiving and deceitful even in its most fascinating and amiable moments. If it's not one of his best acting jobs, which is hard to put together considering his catalog, it's one that is worth taking a look at fans who might want to see another side of him. It is a merit for him, but also for what he has clicked with his collaborations with Siegel, as both have taken opportunities at the moment in Hollywood.
