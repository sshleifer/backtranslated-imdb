'Rejseholdet' is one of the best new Danish TV series I've seen. <br /> <br /> The series is about Danish Police Unit 1, a kind of FBI-style team that helps solve homicide cases all over the country, the cases they work on, the influence their work has on their personal life and the price they sometimes have to pay to be part of a superior police team. <br /> <br /> I expect a lot when I started watching this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes funny, it has both drama and suspense, I love it.
