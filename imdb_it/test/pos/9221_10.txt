I loved it, but I'm a guy from the 80s. I love Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I don't know if the little ones these days would be very interested in the show, my no. (But that's okay, I bought it for myself anyway. I just brought the kid so the guy at the checkout wouldn't look at me funny.) I love non-violent drama and colorful scenery. It simply reminds me of a simpler moment before cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) Although I could only be a little biased on the subject. After all I was Rainbow Bright 6 consecutive years for Halloween ........ I wonder if they make a Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Lol.
