The characters of Ma & Pa Kettle were very popular and controversial. The films that characterized their brood paved the way for the television sitcoms that came later and tried to emulate its winning formula. An obvious reference is "The Beverly Hillbillies", where the new house was purchased with oil money, not having been won in a competition. It could also be said that the 1980s sitcom Newhart borrows his idea of ​​backward rural characters from this series. However, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the author of Washington who created these characters, has done more harm than good. His portrayal of hilly characters makes them the target of many jokes in terms of alleged neglect and laziness. (The real family in which Macdonald founded the Kettles, sued successfully ... claiming to have been ridiculed and humiliated with these less than flattering references). Sure, it's comedy and situations bring us lots of laughs and funny moments ... and political correctness as we know it today didn't exist in the 40s and 50s. But I think that Macdonald could still have written these characters in a more sensible way and Universal International could have made his writers show them on the screen with more dignity (there's something like good taste). The most realistic moments are when the eldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage, but learns to accept his parents and siblings for what they are. For their part, kettles must realize that they do not fit exactly into a modern world. It's not a joke ... it's a sober truth.
