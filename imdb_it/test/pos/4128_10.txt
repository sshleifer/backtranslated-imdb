"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the beginnings of the famous singer in the dunk Lubbock, Texas, until his rise to fame, his tragic death in a plane crash. Strengthened by the fact that Gary Busey, like Holly, plays his own instruments, this film is the biopic in its purest form. There are some things that seem a little trivial, that is, the people of Lubbock who consider rock 'n' roll as the music of the devil, but the magic performances outweigh any weakness. If there is only one thing that is certain in this great world of ours, it is that Buddy Holly's music will never be stale. Whether it's "That Be Be the Day", "Peggy Sue" or another of his songs, they still sound great after all these years. It remains one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> Just to show what Lubbock really thought of their most famous son, they didn't name a road after him until 37 years after his death! What a bunch of ingrates!
