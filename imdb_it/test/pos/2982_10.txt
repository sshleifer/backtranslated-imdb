Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so pretty, and I really fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Truly the best film of my youth. The "seasons reprise" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sing me forever in the head ... Please, if you know where I can find a VHS of the movie, send me an email !! My 26 year old husband and I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend and he continues to be. I think we both shouted our eyes. I think maybe we were attracted to the film by the music of Elton John, but they were wiped out by the adolescent anguish of it all. Paul and Michelle were about our age when we saw the movie, so it's very easy to identify it !! It is wonderful to hear that Sean is doing well, I am also in the "helping professions" (an RN). I thought his performance was good and very credible. "Michelle" seemed very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they don't have to deal with the "real world", then they could be happy and continue to be in love. How many times did we all just want to have a "Calgon moment". If we all had no external concerns and could simply deal with our "basic needs", it might be a little easier. I have a 15 year old daughter and I would have no problem with her seeing this movie .. Children see much worse these days than this is very meek. For those of you trying to locate the CD, my husband (a big fan of Elton John) managed to get a set of 2 CDs released in 1992. It's called "Elton John-rare masters" of the Polygram studios. This has all the songs of friends and many others. As far as we know this is the only CD with "Amici" music. We also had the LP years ago and were excited to find the CD. Good luck. I recommend this film to anyone who loves the theme "young love". I just wish it was on DVD now !!
