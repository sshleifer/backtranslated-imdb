Don't expect a classic military comedy, which claims to make fun of the military, while only improving a militaristic perspective. Instead it deconstructs the elements that make the army such a deadly machine. A kind of version of "Buffalo Soldiers" from East Germany. <br /> <br /> "NVA" works on a meta level that sympathizes with the attempts of his heroes to escape the army exercise in any way possible. These are not strong laughs but long lasting smiles. Utopian, of course (in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality), but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Just to fill in the 10 lines required: don't get into that movie if you were an army officer and I liked your work.
