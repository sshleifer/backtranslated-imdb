Kathleen Beller, an elementary school student, is found beaten and raped in the opening scenes of this TV movie. The film <br /> <br /> then flashbacks for the few days before the rape, as Beller is <br /> <br /> harassed by a stranger. <br /> <br /> Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson and Dennis Quaid are doubling up soon. Beller's anxious parents, <br /> <br /> relaxed Tony Bill and screamed Blythe Danner, waiting at home wringing his hands <br /> and so on. Immediately, the 70s make its entrance <br /> <br />, while the young couples discuss romance and love on <br /> <br /> "Three days of the Condor". <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, begins to receive threatening notes <br /> <br /> stuck in his locker at school. The filmmakers wisely give us a whole bunch of suspects: Beller's new boyfriend, boyfriend <br />, Beller's father, Beller's ex-boyfriend, and what do you think? > <br /> overly friendly photography class teacher who wants Beller to be a little sexier in his self-portraits? I knew who the rapist was <br /> <br /> because the corporate videotape of Worldvision Video has a photo of <br /> <br /> the attack on the back cover, destroying all suspense in that <br /> < br /> regard. <br /> <br /> Without revealing who is the aggressor, Beller starts receiving <br /> <br /> telephone harassment and is eventually raped. The film then heads south as Nancy Drew does and secretly sets <br /> <br /> a time lapse camera to capture the boy chasing another student. <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmakers face a hokey narrative ended by <br /> <br /> Beller on the lack of understanding for rape victims on that day of <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The suspense here is very real, without going beyond the scary movie stuff. <br /> <br />. Beller is very good, and he looks for her and <br /> <br /> Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater - both do great jobs. The movie <br /> <br /> is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and everyone is a professional. <br /> <br /> This was done in 1978, and shows. I'm sure no one had any idea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by a lover of the superlative horror movie <br /> <br /> who needs to go to bed and wake up early morning <br /> but some of the attitudes here are embarrassing. The teacher <br /> <br /> who tells Beller to be sexy is never meant to explain exactly what she had in mind. Today, if a high school teacher said that, then, that would have been a TV movie alone. <br /> <br /> After Beller has been raped, the rapist is still a part of his life, as warrants are issued <br />, <br />, blah, blah, blah. There may not be a case because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin, and cannot prove that she was raped by those who said <br /> <br />. Many of these problems have been addressed with <br /> <br /> modern technology and police efforts, but this film obviously knew it would have the chance to add to the reform debate. Rape is <br /> <br /> an act of violence that has not disappeared, but efforts to capture <br /> <br /> attackers today are far ahead of twenty-four years ago. The problem <br /> <br /> is that the anti-rape corner is attached, like an afterthought of <br /> <br />. Before this, we have a small supporter who has a really honest characterization of God. After the rape, everything changes <br /> <br />, filmwise, and not for the better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller from the 70s and 80s (and who could forget <br /> <br /> his revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she did nothing in <br /> <br /> almost ten years. This is a shame, since he was very good <br /> <br /> then. <br /> <br /> I will advise you "Are you home alone?!" based on acting alone <br /> <br />, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of the movie <br /> <br />. If you want to relive the 70s made for the life of TV high school, <br /> <br /> this is your Cup of Tab. <br /> <br /> This is unrated but contains physical violence , some sexual <br /> <br /> violence and some adult situations.
