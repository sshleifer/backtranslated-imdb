First of all, it is pure joy to hear the legend perform in such wonderful and timeless music. This film and soundtrack is a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and surprising. I loved the movie as it was challenging and fun throughout. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of the best actors in Hollywood as is clearly shown in Ray and should get an Oscar for this role, it is unprecedented. In fact, everyone who has worked on this film should receive awards. I really liked Kerry Washington who played the exceptional wife ... Ray Charles, of course, got married well. Regina King is a beautiful actress and also the extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a young mother in difficulty. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I would say that the whole project was providentially organized. The whole cast was perfect, great script and fantastic settings ... important props for director Taylor Hackford and the crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing Ray Charles's life to the screen flawlessly. This is my photo of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.
