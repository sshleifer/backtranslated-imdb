I'm sorry for the "extremely intelligent" summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking, but I couldn't really help myself. <br /> <br /> I intend to see "Bloody Birthday" for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by mistake and at such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are unlikely to happen. It is a real pity that some of these "gems" of the 1980s are now almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of those films that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays. It is certainly not a masterpiece, but it is still fun and guess what? ... Actually it has no unintentionally funny scenes. I know it's a shock if we keep in mind that this is a low budget movie from the early 1980s about a group of evil children who kill people. But believe me, the film manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part. <br /> <br /> In "Blood Birthday", the story revolves around three children born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and the moon block Saturn, which controls emotions. As a result, the three children who are born that day eventually become indifferent and evil. Since they have no feeling of remorse, these 10-year-old kids fight with almost everyone they stand in, including their parents and siblings ... and kill them! The body count increases day by day and the police authorities believe that there is a psychopath lurking around the place. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Steven, do not hesitate to continue to massacre people, since nobody seems to suspect those sweet angelic faces (?) <br /> <br /> As I was saying before, "Bloody Birthday" is surprisingly NOT funny. I know I said it before, but I'm really surprised by this. I was expecting some hilarious scenes, but the film wronged me. True, it's not exactly what most people would consider a "serious" horror movie, but to be honest, I'd say the story is decently performed. One of the most important reasons why we would normally expect ridiculous situations (as I did), is because in these types of films where the main villains are children, young actors tend to be simply horrible and make the whole thing ridiculous . Let's face it: children tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable and we can't blame them for that. But to my surprise, the three young actors who played the ruthless killers in this film seemed very scary and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good and if you are a George Clooney fan, you can see his uncle play a doctor in this movie. Yes, I know right? ... who cares? Moreover, Julie Brown, the great actress, singer, comedian and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the bad little sister and in case someone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and looks naked. Too bad I didn't have more time on the screen! Julie is "absolutely fabulous": P <br /> <br /> So basically, this movie is fine if you're in the mood for a modest 80s horror. My only objection to "Bloody Birthday" would be the way to justify children's motivations. This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. Let's see: if the children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless murderers, then how come these three were the only ones who killed people? I'm sure there were other children who were born the same day ... and even on other days of total eclipse, oh well! Overall, it's not a big deal, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I've seen worse, believe me. Take for example 'The Children' (1980), in which the early killer gets his evil after being turned into a zombie by a toxic cloud. No, believe me, 'Bloody Birthday' is much more decent and if you like simple slashes, you will like this a lot. <br /> <br /> So now you know: you are invited to the children's birthday party ... and the hosts will serve a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on, you can't lose it;)
