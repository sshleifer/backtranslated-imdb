Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born in a baking family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been well known for their packaging over the decades, the company has fallen into hard times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is a most talented sweets maker in Manhattan but, due to the glass ceiling, she doesn't seem to be able to get a top-notch confectionery position. A chance encounter between Marco and Grace translates into a conversation about a possible solution for both. There is a high profile bake-off, The Golden Whisk, which will take place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to join him. There is a great deal of "pasta", haha, at stake for the winners, enough to put Grace in their business and also save the Polonis restaurant. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow competitors may have past problems with both Grace and Marco. Moreover, even though Marco and Grace both feel a kind of attraction for each other, Grace has a long-time, very rich boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? This is an adorable movie for the romantic in the heart. First of all, there is the beautiful cast. Holly has always been a beautiful actress with a familiar hoarse voice that promotes her attractions. In this film, she is perfectly chosen for the determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, also welcomes the good rival baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, is very nice. Like a Hallmark film, the production costumes, sets and accessories are beyond reproach and the script still looks fresh and fun, despite some familiar themes. Treat yourself, diamond lovers, to a sweet pastry ensuring the vision of this film. It's definitely the cinematic equivalent of a large box of quality chocolates.
