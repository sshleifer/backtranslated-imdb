Bon Voyage is fun for the public because it combines the foolishness of a comedy with sufficient sobriety to keep viewers actively involved and invested in the result. But above all, the film is also historically instructive; captures the tension of the so-called "fake war" and, later, the flight of the French aristocracy from Paris before the German attack. Yet Bon Voyage is not a "war movie". It is a comedy about the life of a handful of people against the background of extraordinary times. Bon Voyage conveys the chaos, confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation on the verge of collapse and the broad spectrum of French reactions to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertains the audience, a love story that cleverly uses many clich√©s and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them.
