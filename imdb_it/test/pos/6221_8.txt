All of Risto Jarva's films deserve to be seen. Some like "Jäniksen vuosi" and "Loma" are the best films of their genre and have achieved the status of a classic in the history of Finnish cinema. <br /> <br /> Most people gave the impression of actor Antti Litja through Jarva films. Litja played the lead role in three of Jarva's films, all of which became box office and film review successes. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" still lives in the commercials (I think it was tele- Sonera's TV clerk adds where Litja was walking in the mountains and fell in Lapland with the hare in his arms, Everibody who saw the film knows what I'm talking about ..) "Jäniksen Vuosi" It's a beautiful film with great actors and good locations for filming - like the famous town of Lappland, Sodankylä, where holds the best film festival in the world: the Midnight Sun Film Festival. I recommend everyone to go there in June - but remember warm and waterproof clothes :)
