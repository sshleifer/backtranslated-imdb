I'm a big fan of the $ 5.50 DVD basket at my local WalMart. I hope you have one in your local branch. It is possible to find a group of campy movies, a pile of garbage and the occasional surprise. This film is one of the surprises. My friend bought it recently, and thinking it would be another kung-fu laugh, I was really surprised how beautiful it was. I watch a lot of movies and, as a result, I can almost always call how a movie will end up; and if there is a twist, what it will be. Not this movie! The direction is brilliant, the plot is fantastic and the fight is incredibly inventive. If you see this sitting somewhere at a cheap price, take it! If you see it at full price, I would recommend it anyway.
