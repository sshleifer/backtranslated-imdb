Clive Barker of Hellraiser's fame wrote and produced a fun and exciting fantasy horror film. <br /> <br /> The make-up done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It took a great imagination to invent these mutants that lived underground. It was really a pleasure to see the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> It wasn't particularly horrible, given that the worst creature was actually a human serial killer. I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and did a good job in this movie too. Nothing spectacular, but fair. This was Anne Bobby's third film, and she was good too. <br /> <br /> The finale was spectacular and the rednecks got their desserts, like David Cronenberg. Has!
