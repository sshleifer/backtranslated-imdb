People who claim that some of those who show Looney Tunes cartoons are inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something: they were not originally intended for children. They were produced for the cinema, to be shown before feature films, and so they could show everything they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." he has that damn snowman Sylvester who finds Tweety aboard an ocean liner and embarks on the ship to try to catch him. But two things work against Sylvester: the grandmother vehemently protects the canary, and Sylvester easily gets seasick (we don't see him vomiting, but with his green face, they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that!). And then, of course, the seemingly cute Tweety has an ugly streak. <br /> <br /> It's just great to see how these cartoons weren't afraid of doing it all out; whatever they thought they showed, they showed. We have to understand that cartoons should not always be nice entertainment for children. Very funny.
