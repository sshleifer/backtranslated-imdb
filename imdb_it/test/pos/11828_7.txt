I don't think this cartoon was as bad as some might think. Of course, I was only five when he came out. But, I found it very funny at the moment and I would like to take a look today if I had the opportunity. Batman and Robin were voiced by Adam West and Burt Ward was a nice touch, and it gave me a sense of familiarity for me as I was also witnessing the re-runs of the 1960s live action camp show "Batman" at that age. This comic also introduced some new twists that I had forgotten, such as "Bat-Mite", for example. Looking back, I'm sure it would probably have been as annoying as many people think, but at the moment it didn't bother me much. The best I can remember, his voice sounded like a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. Damn, I wonder why? :) Anyway, take a look if you can and you decide. You could be surprised.
