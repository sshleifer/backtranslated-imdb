I saw this theatrical show when it was broadcast on PBS in 1983. At the time I was involved in the local theater and had seen pretty incredible things from the Dell Arte players, but Bill Irwin put me down. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by the way a man of his size (he is rather tall and muscular) could lean into a small box without even a pause for adjustment and move on stage to a run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise. <br /> <br /> The most surprising to me, though, in this performance, was the way he stood up during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. Those who have seen this show will remember that when he came out of the box and collapsed on the floor with the limp body and limbs akimbo, he "pulled himself up" by the head as if it were a rope, and got up not only for his feet, but for a complete ballet point ?? and he did it in a fluid movement, apparently without effort. Just think of the strength, the grace, the balance and the concentration that a series of movements must take to achieve them as he did! Add to his physical ability his strong and credible characterization abilities, and there lies a complete actor / actor. My jaw dropped to motion and my heart broke at the portrait of a puppet who is determined to be something more than a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> As for the unfortunate (yes, "tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in domestic media form, I noticed that many of PBS's works are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes, PBS shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast, but they rarely remain on the market for long. There are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly scientific and historical documentaries; rarely a piece of art remains in print for a long time, assuming it has ever entered VHS / DVD. I don't know why it should be so; Of course, PBS could use the domestic media marketing revenue of their shows, but they don't take much advantage of it. This is a pity. There are many things I saw on PBS that I would like to have, but pieces like "The Regard of Flight" are, I fear, a one-shot, once in a lifetime, never to be repeated on PBS and never be available for purchase of domestic media. This really sucks. I was lucky to have taken it when I did it. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, our local library received a copy of "The Regard of Flight". And yes ?? it was stolen.
