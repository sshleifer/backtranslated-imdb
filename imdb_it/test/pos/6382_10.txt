I saw him at a test screening at Chatsworth a week ago, and I went with a group of my friends. we really enjoyed it. James Franco is amazing and so hot, I would see him just for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also very good and plays a southern girl who is so in love with him that she can't leave her. David Caradine who was in Kill Bill plays a cowboy and he's perfect for that. The story is strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it !!! It's really original, and it's also a lot of fun and everyone laughed a lot but eventually it gets more serious and we all end up crying. I'll see him again with my friends as soon as he comes out, it's really nice !!!!!!!
