This video was my first introduction to Residents and I couldn't stop playing it in the last three days. The images are dynamic and more inventive and technically complex than any I've ever seen on the big screen or small. <br /> <br /> The DVD loses points, however, for the unnecessary addition of new music. The original music of the Residents is different from anything else you have ever heard, and will really make you change your brain in the best possible way. The new music however is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases it is rather negative compared to some of the classic tracks. Furthermore, the incomplete video of Vileness Fats seems VERY incomplete, and I could only understand the plot of the story from a thorough reading of the notes on the record. <br /> <br /> Speaking of notes on the disc, this DVD features many fresh Easter eggs that will probably appeal to longtime Resident fans. Tip: look for the icons on the note pages that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disc is one of the best DVD transfers available. There is practically no observable pixelization, and only a little nervousness in strong points of contrast. <br /> <br /> Congratulations for a first-rate presentation. This record really deserves your attention.
