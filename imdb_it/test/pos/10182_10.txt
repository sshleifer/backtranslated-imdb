I was dragged into this series with the same confidence with which the sea pushed me into its grip. Although it started slowly, I discovered that the realism in painting the ship, the variety of characters and the lively dialogue keep an eye on me. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, to grow and change on this journey and I wanted to be there for that. I was not disappointed. The series has taken you from humor to tragedy and everything that is intermediate, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a wealth of emotional overlap, interaction and expression - relentless and compelling to observe. The movement of the ship added an almost imaginative component to the many scenes, making the characters sick a moment and adding humor to the next. <br /> <br /> Edmund Talbot is a complex character, whose meaning is not to see often. We may know where the captain or Mr. Prettiman is, but they are older men, arranged in their ways. Talbot was young and arrogant, he still learned, he put himself to the test and was put to the test. He struggled to get along with others and made mistakes as a real person, but he had a heart that could be touched, that grew with every difficult experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; it's too rare in movies and on television.
