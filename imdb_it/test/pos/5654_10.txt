A harrowing masterpiece of pure madness and the desperation of war, Fires on the Plain (Nobi) will not be for everyone's tastes: this is a war movie in the truest sense of the word, one that does not resort to flag patriotism or mawkish sentimentality. Nobi cuts in depth, it is ugly, dark and dreary as few things ever made on celluloid will ever be. This is the war behind the guns, without triumphs or heroes, without victories or moral defeats, only a handful of emaciated men and terrible-looking men scattered in a war-ravaged land like the penitents fleeing a great disaster. The characters challenge moral judgment because they are creatures afflicted by great trouble, a pain that does not allow questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Put your will against each other in a battle arena. The loser is simply removed from existence. <br /> <br /> Tamura, a soldier in the Japanese imperial army, is fired from his platoon and ordered to appear at a nearby hospital because of his blood cough and the fact that he didn't like the rest of the platoon. He is told to never come back and commit suicide instead with a hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him. What it does The hospital is nothing but a hut made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he is able to walk, he is fine. It is in that sloppy excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes in the film takes place. Because the area is covered with bombardments by American aircraft, doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods. Moments before the hospital is torn to pieces, the sparse and crippled figures of the sick and wounded crawl out of it in all sorts of postures, dressed in their damn white robes, as if the building were a kind of beast that vomits guts and dirt on the earth. <br /> <br /> This is Nobi's greatest success; the naked and dark representation of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. Soldiers cross a swamp, wade to the knee in the mud, move across the opposite bank and into a field just to discover enemy tanks hidden in the woods, their lights shine like evil eyes as they scan the darkness. A procession of wounded soldiers, dirty and half crazy, crossing a street, falling to the ground to the sound of enemy planes. Buzzards feasting on a pile of corpses. An abandoned village A mad soldier who believes he is Buddha seated under a tree, covered with flies and his own excrement, offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he died. These are the images that Kon Ichikawa evokes for our eyes, ruthless and implacable in their intensity but honest and raw. Nobi is in no hurry to get somewhere. He is happy to follow Tamura's journeys through the war-ravaged land as he tries to reach Palompa's reorganization center and observe the madness and obscenity of war. The film forges the mud of war's horror, slow and thoughtful, just like the characters that follow. The last thirty minutes with Tamura taking refuge with two deserters who feed on "monkey meat" are the closest Nobi who adhere to conventional narratives and are no less powerful for that matter. Surprisingly photographed in black and white, with great cast interpretations and Ichikawa's assured direction, Nobi is not only one of the best war films, but also among the best in Japanese cinema.
