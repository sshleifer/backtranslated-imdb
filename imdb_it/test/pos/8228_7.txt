Do a search by title on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the only film missing in the list you saw. One of 4 films made by Scott RKO during his first film (1947), the others are always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas is just south-west of Dodge City and is a dusty barrel about to explode among the cyclists who drive the longhorns towards Trail Street, the city's main street, and the idlers who feed our bellies. It will take a strong man like Bat Masterson to step between the two groups and bring the city to order. I won't say any more, except that Scott's films usually have only one pretty girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT always played men to whom one could look for their sense of honor, courage, stubbornness and the will to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to a Scott movie with confidence that they would learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN is co-star in this film, playing a good guy for a change. In real life, RYAN was one of many HEROS OF THE WORLD WAR that starred in American films. What a sad thing we have these days. George Clooney teaches our youth that we should sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in Monaco and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 draws their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much effort for the extravagant left. I wonder how all this happens in Liberal, Kansas. After all it was not a dirty word, 150 years ago, when the city was named.
