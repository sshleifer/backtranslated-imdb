I purchased this video on a VCR tape in a store that could be used for US 50 cents. I took some videos that I purchased to sell to others after seeing them considering the cost of 50 cents for rent. This is the only one that will never come back. It is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I don't know if I should call it a circus, dance or both. It is bigger than life itself. They will be able to do it well only for a few short years in their lives. These are the performers for the artists. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster were alive today and had seen them live, they would have been impressed. I would lend it to others to look at it but I know that if I do it I will never take it again.
