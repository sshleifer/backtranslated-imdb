"Saturday Afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's most famous short films, and with good reason. It's one of his funniest and best films. The plot - as it is - is an old staple: a husband caught walking away for a night with a friend and a couple of other girls. It's a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. His slow, ineffective, confused, innocent character has somehow slipped into a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all men must be governed with an iron fist, and that he is only forced to betray her because he cannot say "no" to the exhortations of the slimy Vernon Dent and to the graceful flutter of the girl's eyelashes. <br /> <br /> It is a very adult problem to be pushed on such a helpless and childlike character. Harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't help it. In a good deal of comic affairs, he can't bring himself to say goodbye to the new girlfriend a farewell kiss: he furtively pushes the kiss beneath her and is ashamed to escape his hand as if to punish him. The film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two rebels that Harry Langdon had portrayed for Mack Sennett, with no more plot. Perhaps it was also designed to be a two reeler. It works beautifully, since it gives him all the time he needs to inject the slow reactions and the puzzled looks and half actions in which so much of his comedy lives. <br /> <br /> It is at its best here, and the show is really the curious magic of Harry Langdon and his ability to spin the play almost by nothing. His little half-smile, his appearance as he handles the money he hid under the rug, childish attempts to enter the fight at the end. I think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us, and at the same time, allowing us to understand what Harry doesn't do (like the fact that the the women he warmly brings to his friend to cheer him up after thinking that the date was actually blown up are whores) forces her to realize with a little sadness that we are no longer so innocent. His comedy is equally capable of making us say "Awwww" because it makes us laugh, often at once. <br /> <br /> Here Harry wants to refuse to betray his wife, he wants to tell his wife whose boss and regain power in his relationship, he wants to fight against the two violent men at the end of the film, but he fails to influence the surrounding environment a lot, and sometimes we all feel that way. <br /> <br /> The film is perfectly directed by Langdon's frequent director Harry Edwards; it moves at a fast pace and never freezes while at the same time making time and presenting Harry Langdon's firm and reactive comedy at its best. Vernon Dent, a often foiled one of Langdon, plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy companion in his very effective pairing with Harry. The gags interspersed in a way that gives maximum effect, and Harry gets his version of a Lloyd or Keaton style stunt at the end. Here the comedy is not in Harry's great reactions to the risk of sitting perched between two moving cars, but in his slowness of taking it. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious film and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique talented humorists I've ever seen exist.
