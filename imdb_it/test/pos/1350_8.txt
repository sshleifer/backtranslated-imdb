I had read the film and thought it would be nice, a good Saturday night. I didn't expect anything exceptional, I imagined that it was mostly fluffy, but I hope it's not a bad experience. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and flowed well. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was a pleasure to see. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before, but instead turned away from stereotypes and focused on the wit of the character. It was wonderful to see Jonathan Caouette again, I didn't know what he would do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a true gem, a young actress of great character who hopefully can get more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film that could have used a bit of work, but all in all it is not a bad time at the cinema. My friend described him as a gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite but it's something more. It's a study of the character in what it means to grow up in gays in a small town, the pain is there, but the humor behind that pain (which only age can make clearer) is amplified. I look forward to seeing Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
