Not having read the book, I was more open to the new interpretation that each director gives to their medium (which is film, not "literally" literature reproductions) on this particular film. I was happy that the holocaust that occurred in Russia (and neighboring countries) has finally received some attention. The Nazis were particularly cruel to Russians and Russian Jews. If you read the stories and see the monuments built in Smolensk and in the neighboring regions you will understand this film and why many were silent when they should have spoken. <br /> <br /> It was certainly time to do it and I hope other stories will come out of this. The time has come.
