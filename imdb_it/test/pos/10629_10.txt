At the end of my Cache review, I wrote that I was fascinated by Haneke as a filmmaker. This is what led me to take the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about half an hour ago. <br /> <br /> It was all expressed, here on IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the macabre a twisted pathology that would "create" an individual like Huppert's Erika, who is still looking after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, starting with herself. It has repressed everything that would have freed it from its self-imposed slavery, including, of course, its sexuality, which has literally imploded, to madness, to where it can no longer even begin to understand what a genuine impulse of love would be like. <br /> <br /> This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who has never found the strength to leave his childhood and become a functioning adult. I think this theme refers to all of us - we all aspire to autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, many of which are not even consciously. It also brilliantly deals with the contrast between what one imagines, sexually and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. The character of Huppert gets what he asks during the film, and it's hardly the experience of emancipation he had imagined it to be. <br /> <br /> As for the much-discussed bathroom scene: I really appreciated the way this sequence has all the erotic power possible (for the viewer, I mean) sucked up because of the previous scene, where you put it the glass in the girl's pocket. The moment she is performing her "not to be missed" scene in the bathroom, we have already discovered that she is dangerously disturbed and therefore not a turning point, her little domination session with our poor I think another incredible success of this film is like, halfway, I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading subtitles. It has never happened before, in any foreign film, and I've seen several. <br /> <br /> In this film, like Cache, the ending is not all enclosed in a nice little neat bow, but unlike Cache, at least we get a certain sense of finality, despite the fact that we don't do it too knowing for certain if Huppert's character is alive or dead. Having experienced La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I am, needless to say, more than a little intrigued.
