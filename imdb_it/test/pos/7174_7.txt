On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland is divided between German and Russian. When the German invades the city, the Nazis send the Jews into a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her young sister, houses and hides many Jews in the attic of her home for two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hidden in Silence" is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This film resembles "Rescuers: Stories of Courage" and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, actress Kellie Martin has a strong and powerful character, but is very weak for this role. In many dramatic situations, the expression on his face is not convincing. I've noticed that many users of IMDb liked his performance, but I'm not sure they appreciate his wonderful character or his performance. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ocultos no Medo" ("Hidden in Fear")
