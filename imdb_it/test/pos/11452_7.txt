This is not the bad night of the video demon as there are more than one. In reality, there is only one, but it multiplies. <br /> <br /> After living in Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), she transmits it to the goth girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade) through a long long kiss. /> <br /> Next, we see Linnea showing us her quigley in the bathroom. She shows a lot more since Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he had a little fun. <br /> <br /> Soon, everything will literally go to hell while the bodies fall one after another and are possessed. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two who try to escape. Max is not very helpful, leaving him to Judy to figure out a way out. <br /> <br /> The trick was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept it from being even better was the extreme longevity of the action. <br /> <br /> The old man (Harold Ayer) who appears at the beginning will come back and take his sweets. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley could be the Scream Queen, but Cathy Podewell certainly showed the biggest lungs in this movie.
