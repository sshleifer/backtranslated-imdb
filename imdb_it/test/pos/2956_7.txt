The Lone Ranger was one of my childhood heroes, and I never missed the chance to resume his adventures in the Saturday morning replica during the mid-1950s. But somehow, this film was from me until I had the chance to take it today courtesy of my local library. I was struck by a series of elements throughout the story, because from the beginning you have a new Lone Ranger theme song before listening to the traditional opening used on the TV show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a well-expanded role, even if it takes its share of lumps everywhere, it is beaten and fired more than once. Perhaps the most interesting thing of all, the Ranger actually shoots to kill in a couple of situations, putting his character at odds with the vision created for the TV series that he would never use his weapon to kill, just to hurt or to protect himself and others. <br /> <br /> Besides that, you have a fairly traditional western adventure. The Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe whose members are killed by hooded raiders trying to track down five medallions that together form the key to a fabulous treasure. It is interesting to note that the leader of the villains is an already wealthy woman, disarmingly painted by Noreen Nash. His top henchman is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the villains. The character of Bradford was one of the men shot by the Lone Ranger, which made me think of how many times it could have happened in the TV series. A quick check revealed that he appeared in "The Lone Ranger" for fifteen times, while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. <br /> <br /> What might be more interesting than the picture is the attempt to portray the Indians in a revisionist light at a time when TV and the Western movie were still largely portrayed as an illiterate savage. The character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most revealing in this regard; he is an Indian who has received an education and who has become a doctor, returning to the land of his tribe to satisfy the needs of all his citizens. For the purpose of the story, he had to impersonate a white man to be accepted by local farmers. This was the hardest thing to accept for the plot, as Dr. Rolfe was the nephew of Elder Chief Tomache (John Miljan). No one in history, except Paviva (Lisa Montell), knew that he really was an Indian, it was a sort of stretch for me. I imagine it is possible that he leaves the tribe at an early age, but without the retrospective being enriched, it made no sense to me that no one else in the tribe could know who he was. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I'm so fascinated by this, but after seeing and reviewing over two hundred westerns on this site, I suddenly met three films last month that use a general pull gimmick like the one performed by Tonto Scout in this photo. Roy Trigger by Roy Rogers did a similar stunt in the "Son of Paleface" of 1952, and I took it back in 1958 "The Big Country" from a horse called Old Thunder in that movie. It's a bit of a comic relief in a situation that doesn't normally occur for a horse, and now it makes me curious when the piece could have been made for the first time. I will have to keep watching more old-time westerns. Not to be outdone, Silver had the chance to shine in the photo, making the parade of an Indian child who was being used as a hostage by the bad Brady. <br /> <br /> Speaking of tricks, Clayton Moore borrowed a tactic from the television series when he wore a Southern gentleman's outfit to hunt down the baddies posing as hooded raiders. Whenever he did it in the half hour format, he was always smart enough to hide his real features, usually with a beard as done here. One of the most interesting episodes I remember has to do with the Ranger who plays an actor in the form of Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on a few things I noticed along the way. In one of the first scenes in the opening, an Indian is hit by one of the hooded marauders, and in the foreground, there is blood on his shirt, but no bullet hole. Later in history, Ross Brady and Wilson ride the Indians after kidnapping one of the villains out of jail. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the marauders, but is immediately shown on the verge of escaping on horseback with Wilson.
