"Committed" focuses on Graham as an irrepressible optimist who goes in search of his self-esteemed husband who went in search of himself and which leads to a sort of comic and cheerful odyssey involving a lot of characters and collateral problems. A small fresh, funny and unpredictable film, what "Committed" lacks a story that compensates with good morality and with subtle moral and maxims. If you like this little film, which has received slightly above-average reviews from critics and audiences, you might want to check out Lisa Krueger's famous film "Manny & Lo" (1996). (B)
