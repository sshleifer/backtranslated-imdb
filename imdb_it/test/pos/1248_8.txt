hello, are you looking for a family movie to watch on Friday night? Can't find what you're looking for? I thought it was an extremely fun movie. Good for the whole family. I found out that he had an extraordinarily rare combination of being attractive to both adults and children. It was fantastic, to say the least. Bruce Willis's acting was of a high standard, there was a lot of humor and, on the whole, a great film. In my opinion, it is a must-see film. And I don't think about many movies, believe me when I say it takes a lot for a movie to make me think. It is clear that there was a lot of work by Bruce Willis and the cast to make this film. Excellent story, good acting, and still, overall, a really nice film.
