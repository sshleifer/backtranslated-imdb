This film was a modern scarface. He put me on your toes. This film is one of those rare epic films that make you want a sequel. I particularly liked Damian Chapa, his performance deserved an academic award, which he deserved for his performance in blood in out. The only thing I didn't like was the backstage because it didn't show the intensity of the film, and I would have liked to see less narrated scenes. But the film was fantastic and it's in my top ten of all-time movies. For acting it was good, there wasn't a bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect as well as the whole cast. I can't see how someone wouldn't have this movie, I thought it was great, definitely a must.
