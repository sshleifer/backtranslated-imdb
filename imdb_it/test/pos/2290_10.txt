Redo the Oscars since 1992, and this movie could be named, or even win. He was so good at capturing his era and the two cultures that he belongs to the American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what it means to live here or like then, this movie will show you. As an American, you'll feel like you're tagged for a long Japanese vacation, and by the end of the movie, you'll be a passionate Dragons fan, as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into their baseball, as we did with the our culture in our own game. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a Detroit Tigers slugger who is swapped with dragons, perennial second dynastic Yomuri Giants, Japan's answer to the Yankees. The giants are admired for their success, yet that success also has all the desire to overcome them, something that is rarely done. The Dragons manager recruits Jack as the last piece of the winning puzzle, and we were left with what could have been Gung Ho on a baseball field, but instead it was much more. <br /> <br /> The casting was exceptional: Selleck showed that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can bring a movie as he did his TV show, and the Japanese cast was just as good, up to Mr. Takagi from Die Hard as an image-conscious owner. The other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the manager's daughter), strong and independent, but at the same time a believer in Japanese traditions, in addition to what was imposed on her. She is a suitable and supportive girl for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathetic to Jack for what he feels from her, and a little relieved that he at least knows the man he chose to love. <br /> <br /> The baseball scenes are great, immensely supported by a pre-reputed Dennis Haysbert as another former American homeland and Jack's western mentor. The usual elements out of the water are there, and you can almost hear yourself stumbling along with Jack to enter a country that doesn't speak our language, and doesn't practice our ways, yet it copies everything we do, including our national pastime. one of the funniest scenes occurs when Jack, holding a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned the tradition in Japan where you can get drunk and tell your boss, and cannot be used against you, and exercise that right very humorously. plots and subplots are ordered at the end, but not too neatly, and nothing ends unrealistically. <br /> <br /> Calling it a comedy is misleading: it's a pure drama-comedy, or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to reject it as it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to bring a light film. The situations were fun, but in their place against a much more serious, deep and precisely detailed background that translates into one of the best movies I've ever seen. The cinematography of baseball rivals that of For Love Of The Game, for realism. <br /> <br /> Some say the film is about baseball, or Japan, but most of all it seems to be about the workplace and how people get to work from completely different backgrounds, with different programs, and in somehow they have to put aside their differences for the good of the company, or of the team. <br /> <br /> A truly fantastic film that should never have apologized for itself as it did in theaters.
