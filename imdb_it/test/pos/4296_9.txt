Well, what's wrong with the title "Separate Lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). He is astute, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there is a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film entitled "Separate Lives", which is alluded to here.) <br /> <br /> But the real point is the ethical dilemma of telling lies to different levels than the film probes. OK, it's not a hilarious "in-your-face" title, but then it's not a hilarious in-your-face movie. Please give British films a chance like this. They try to make people think about important things, like here: how far you go to protect your life (even if it's a bit rotten) against an unexpected disaster. Maybe you tell lies. Perhaps you ignore the lies of your loved ones. This can bring many people out. <br /> <br /> American films on this theme are plentiful, but usually go much further involving the use of firearms, which are not part of everyday life here in Europe. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we are not so "exciting" around here, but we do not expect film titles similar to slogans for films that are not intended for a huge audience.
