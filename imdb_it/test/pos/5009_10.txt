I say memories where and when you saw this show because I believe that if Fox gives the Talk Show a chance Spike will be there with Conan in a few years because like Conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be grateful to have his show that adds to humor. <br /> <br /> The funniest pieces Spike has had so far are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners and if you're not up to par and get CFS what it says about you. <br /> <br /> In summary this show is more fun in 25 minutes than SNL in an hour, so let Hope Talk get the attention it deserves like an extra half hour, more money and a band.
