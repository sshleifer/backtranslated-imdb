Like NIGHT STALKER and X-FILES, the show created a fantastic situation and the main characters had to solve it. Unlike these, the heroes were not left in possession of an empty envelope at the end. They usually had tangible results. It was also made clear that the "good guys" were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull out some bad things. Imagination, wit, acting that don't always take themselves too seriously ... I miss them. One of the reasons is that I can't think of too many shows - apart from BANACEK - that has done the best job of capturing the viewer and capturing their attention right away. Writers excelled in creating situations that were extremely unlikely, if not absolutely impossible, to which the characters had to find an explanation. explanations that often led to a 90 degree turn in a clearly unexpected way and, despite everything, still made sense. Too much, I agree with another reviewer that Anabelle's character was a bit underutilized, but when it was on screen, it wasn't just for the eyes. He was quite competent in his own right and stood up to the two male protagonists when he heard the point he was justifying. A rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he were not in the Department, he would work for the KGB or the CIA. He's the kind of coldly efficient and ruthless guy. He knows how the world works and realizes what it can do to get the job done. King? It is clearly a game for him. One on which he excels and which collects ideas for detective / espionage novels that he writes as his apparent "real" work. It's probably the most fun to watch of the three, even if everyone has their moments and often too. I agree that any spin-off series with only his character lacked the interest of the original, however.
