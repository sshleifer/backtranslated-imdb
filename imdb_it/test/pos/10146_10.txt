Some say the pace of this film is a bit slow, but how is it different from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move very deliberately and, as a point, have flashes of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it. This film gives us the right amount of comic relief that makes the suspense scenes even more suspenseful. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema that exists in Hitchcock's collection (the best is probably almost all of the "Rear Window"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock meant that a series of small films fit together without dialogue, in order to visually tell the story. This is, of course, the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as is the sequence of shorter scales at the end of the image. <br /> <br /> There are not many Hitchcock mistakes here, and the acting is superb especially from Doris Day in a rather surprising serious role.
