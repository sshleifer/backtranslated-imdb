I almost didn't see "Hi-De-Hi!" I think it must have been the title that put me off. In those days, the Welsh editions of "The Radio Times" were used only to print titles of certain shows without giving information about what they actually were. 'Hi-De-Hi!' suggested a nasty quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or worse than an inane import in the United States. But I managed to capture a later episode, and I was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. <br /> <br /> As in the case of 'Dad's Army' and 'It Is not Half Hot Mum', Perry relied on personal experiences, in this case the time spent in the Butlins colony. Before economic air travel arrived in the 1960s, these camps sprang up along the British coast, offering entertainment to working-class families and earning millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> (For interest reasons, I worked in one of these fields in the 1980s as a chef - Barry Island, in South Wales - known to all as "Shag Land" for reasons I will not enter !) <br /> <br /> Set in the late 1950s, he started with academician Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) who took the place of Maplin's entertainment manager, a job he couldn't handle . His staff included resident comedian Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his partner Spike (Jeffrey Holland), the miserable punch and Judy the man Mr. Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), the snobby dance dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland), and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc), who has coveted Fairbrother on every occasion. The bubbly Su Pollard stole the show as the cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose ambition was to be a "Yellowcoat" (all the important staff members wore them). A number of sexy girls have also occupied these coats, most notably "Sylvia" by Nikki Kelly and "Betty" statuary by Rikki Howard. We have never seen Joe Maplin, the owner. He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical letters, which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "Hi-De-Hi!" it was the greeting of the campers, usually it met with the equally silly 'Ho-De-Ho! <br /> <br /> A fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized most of the characters from real life. I have always found Bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic, as Archie Rice was the comedian whose big chance never came, reduced to cracking banal gags for the amusement of the drunk late night audience. He took advantage of his position to give himself some benefit, and in a memorable episode Fairbrother's patience broke and he looked at him: "Lies, Ted! All lies!" <br /> <br /> Like any other Perry / Croft series, the cast was excellent, particularly Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's "Gladys" got on my nerves (no wonder Anne Robinson hates the Welsh!), But Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic "Mr.Partridge" and Felix Bowness jockey Fred Qulley are more than compensated. <br /> <br /> The visual gag that everyone remembers is the drunk Mr.Partridge who sees a pantomime horse while riding a real one along the beach. Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to follow him and throw away the banana he was eating! <br /> <br /> With its frothy blend of 1950s nostalgia and cheeky gags, 'Hi-De'Hi' was a big hit for BBC-1 in the 1980s, resulting in increased bookings for Butlins and Pontins. He went downhill when Cadell left to return to the theater. I never took his replacement, the commander of the squadron Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse still, the death of Leslie Dwyer robbed the show of one of his best characters. Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him with "Uncle Sammy". <br /> <br /> The setting of the period occasionally caused problems; in one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to save Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark. The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that time. Yet they looked fantastic in them, so who's complaining? In another, Ted sang the success of Tom Jones "Delilah" to campers. It was not composed (by Les Reed and Barry Mason, incidentally) until 1968. <br /> <br /> Maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last hit was Peggy's (now a Yellowcoat) all alone in the field, jumping in the air and screaming (what else?) 'Hi-De-Hi!'. <br /> <br /> I don't consider it up to the other Perry and Croft shows, but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate a huge public affection, especially because it featured cute characters in a recognizable context. Goodnight campers!
