Without a doubt, the best Burt Reynolds movie ever! Even better than Smokey and the Bandit. This was probably the first real crime thriller of the 1980s and produced the perfect mix of humor, action, mystery and style that is missing in today's films. <br /> <br /> This has it all: a psychotic Henry Silva raised on PCP, $ 1,000 to girls calling for the night, ninja assassins and Burt Reynolds cutting their fingers, one by one, with a butterfly knife . The film is based on the novel by William Diehl who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another favorite of mine ever. It is worth watching this film only to see Henry Silva being shot six times, crashing into a window and falling thirty floors from the top of an Atlanta skyscraper. This is probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history, played by the legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. <br /> <br /> Robinson also starred in "Moke" in Elmore Leonard's movie STICK, with Burt Reynolds. Stick presents another great feat of Dar Robinson. Robinson falls from a Miami apartment building and unloads all six shots from a magnum 44 on his descent. Very interesting stuff. <br /> <br /> SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this film flopped like it did. If Burt had made more films like this, he would have built a better reputation for himself. Show that you are a talented director with Sharky, as well as a talented actor. Burt is supported by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and everyone's favorite villain, Henry Silva. PLEASE remake this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other sexy actors and you have a good movie just waiting to be shot. <br /> <br /> I give him a 9 out of 10
