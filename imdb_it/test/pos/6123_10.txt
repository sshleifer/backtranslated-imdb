I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to John Waters films, because I was too young to watch them. And if you know that John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby, or to other family films, then you have to prepare for Pink Flamingos. <br /> <br /> Explicit sexual acts, incest, an old lady who only eats eggs and non-sanitary acts with chickens are only part of the depravity of this film. The film ends with Divine, 300 lbs of Waters. cross-dressing star eating dog excrement. <br /> <br /> The premise concerns two families: a couple of trailer garbage, which includes Divine and Edith Massey as the egg woman; and the other is a rich and swinging pair. Both families are competing for the title of "Filthiest person alive". Enjoy the best movie of John Waters, but only watch it if you are an individual with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this movie will drive you crazy.
