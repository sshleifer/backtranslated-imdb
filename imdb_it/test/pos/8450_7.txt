"The China Syndrome" has launched an entire series of films on the potentially devastating effects of improper use of nuclear energy, a black cloud of paranoia that would have caught on in America for most of the Reagan years. It is a well-made and effective drama, given an extra punch by its powerful stars, in particular Jack Lemmon who plays a high official of the nuclear power plant suffering from a crisis of conscience. But one cannot help but think that it was the fortuitous timing of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, which occurred only a couple of weeks after the release of this film, which gave it a lasting appeal as a classic of the years 70. As it is watchable, it is certainly not a classic. <br /> <br /> With a red-haired Jane Fonda as a journalist and a bearded Michael Douglas as his cameraman (among other things the film's producer). <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
