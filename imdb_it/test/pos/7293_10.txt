All I have to say is that this film is the bomb. You're crying when you see it. I mean, this is a reminder to everyone how difficult and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days of your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was swept away with a single kiss. Even though I'm still a teenager, this is how I live my life. When I'm with that certain person, everything that was negative in my mind has been erased. So, I give this film a 10 for its sincere message and touching storyline. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein also give a 10 for a pretty face.
