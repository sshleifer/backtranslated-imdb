I really love anything made by Savage Steve Holland, the writer / director of this great movie. See also "Better Off Dead" and "How I Got Into College". Wonderful! In any case, this film is really fun and offers some unexpected things. Where else, if not in this movie, can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend it to anyone looking for some old-fashioned slapstick comedy (George with the turtle raft), not to mention a really well written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the car roof). This film constantly projects unexpected things even after having seen it 100 times like me! To enjoy!
