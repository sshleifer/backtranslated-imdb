I have to admit that maybe I missed some small moments where I didn't pay due attention, but I had enough of the story to agree that it's a great family movie, from director Lionel Jefferies, who played Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Basically it starts with a happy upper-middle class family living in Victorian London. One night the Father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and leaves with them and does not return. They move to a cottage in the country, and here the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, whom I saw for the first time in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits high, with their fascination for the nearby railway. Every day they sway faithfully to the passengers of the running trains, and with courage and vigilance they avoid an accident and become heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. Also played by Dinah Sheridan as Mother / Lady. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins like Albert Perks, William Mervyn as Old Gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 of the 100 Greatest Family Films, and was number 24 of the 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!
