My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a screening for AGLIFF (a film festival). This film was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy, very original and heartfelt, and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the film. Texas is a great state - with lots of small towns - and, of course, a lot of teenagers who grew up as "fat girls". I know that many people will connect to this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were fantastic - they were so good at these roles, it was like the script was written with them in mind. And speaking of the script, it was written very well (very credible), and Ash is a great actor (his facial expressions made me laugh). It's an independent film, but don't be fooled ... It's a good idea! Seeing this caliber of work from such a young person is truly inspiring.
