It was amazing. As a librarian and participant in the Vitality Fund Event of the New York Library Association, on Thursday 18 October, I had the privilege of seeing a preliminary screening of the new film, The Kite Runner. The release of the film was delayed due to concerns over the well-being of the minor actors involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was authorized to go ahead as planned. <br /> <br /> As for the film, I think it was masterfully executed. It struck me a lot, I think, like Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange, although it's a lot less graphic - MUCH less. There is no comparison between the horrific and shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner; only the argument and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I wrote more details about violence and rape of minors and how it was handled on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this movie was fantastic; one of the best movies I've seen. The depiction of the Afghan boys flying with their kite captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject is very serious and the film carries the emotions of the public into that subject without many strident "Hollywood touches" that have ruined other films. Although the overturned pomegranate cart was an obvious symbolism (for me). <br /> <br /> Finally, I must mention the excellence of the soundtrack. The recitation of Rumi's poetry boy while two main characters flee the country during the Russian invasion - in terrifying circumstances - really showed the power of those poems. I urge anyone to ignore the subtitles in that scene as far as possible, and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don't even know which Amir language he is quoting, if his normal Dari Persian dialect is the same original Rumi Persian dialect. Also, please note the sound heard every time a line of kites is cut. I found it a deep and distinctive sound, even though the librarians who were with me didn't notice at all. I can't help wondering if kites actually sound similar when they are "cut", or if they make sense of the vibration / sound experienced by the kite flyer during the competition.
