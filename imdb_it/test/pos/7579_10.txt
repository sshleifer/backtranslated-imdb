I have seen this film a few times and for every vision I still feel the excitement of embarking on a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that prevent the path. It is more than just a desire to find a home; it is the very basic human spirit of finding one's way in the world, of overcoming desperation, of facing the weaknesses of the character that discourages our goals. At the base of these human efforts is the challenge of reconsidering the origin of life. While this film is full of serious ideas, it has just enough comic lines to leave viewers hopeful. It's surprisingly fun. The execution of the plot is excellent! All this is packaged with a visually engaging animation. To be seen. <br /> <br />
