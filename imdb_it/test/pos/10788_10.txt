Talk Radio is obviously, probably not the best known of Stone's films, but don't let this put you off, this film is ready for discovery, I challenge anyone not to be enchanted by it. Together with the best cinema performance of the 1980s by Eric Bogosian, for me (along with JFK) this remains Stone's best moment. Stone doesn't seem to be commenting much these days and hasn't made the director's comment on DVD like any of his other films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill to get a shot like this. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobia of the studio is intense and Champlain's opinions are still crucial topics for today. The "legalize all drugs" speech is powerful and you may agree with it. I think the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don't like to listen to things they don't agree with. Speeches and conversations with listeners are very convincing, even disturbing, a shiver runs down my spine when a madman calls Champlain saying he must rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shocking. The tension sometimes becomes unbearable with a scene when Heavy Metaller Kent becomes obviously, Champlain does not do favors by ridiculing him. Champlain (or should I say Bogosian) is fearless in the film and in the performances, totally mesmerizing, a real pity @ Bogosians other great role was the villain in Under Siege 2 (dear god !!) A th @ scene did not sound real was when The Barry boss Dan (Alec Baldwin) makes him calm down, Barry doesn't seem to be the kind of person who closes the doors and does as he was told, he seemed a bit forced and a clich√©. The scenes outside the studio are criticized for being too formidable, it's true because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allows the viewer to see the beginnings of Champlains, but it doesn't work at all. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close-ups, deep focus, extremely fast cuts, a fantastic 360 set that is used for the breathtaking monologue. He has to see the cinema, makes it rare because it was ignored at the time, but now he is receiving the attention he deserves so much again. A classic th @ should be studied by generations of film students. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for the inventive use of "Bad To The Bone" before T2, a brilliant supporting cast including John C Mcginley (Dr Cox of Scrubs) as the sleazy Stu, Leslie Hope ( 24) as Champlains the girlfriend, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as the seeds and Micheal Wincott who plays three roles (a very underrated actor), the tension between the listeners and Champlain who is very heart-pounding @ times and obviously congratulations to the Bogosian and Stone stars for a fantastic piece of cinema. To enjoy!
