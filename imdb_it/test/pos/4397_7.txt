The Coen brothers have done it again. Three convicts from the depression era (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape from a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of the buried treasure that will fund their new lives. Along the way, they sing on the radio and stars and fugitives become much sought after. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. <br /> <br /> Clooney is as exceptional as the fast and clever Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays her ex-wife. Turturro and Nelson are impeccable impeccable. The cast also includes John Goodman and Charles Durning. <br /> <br /> Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney in "I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow", the song by Soggy Bottom Boys that serves as a model for the soundtrack of bluegrass that also includes Alison Krauss , Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Touch touching, knee slap fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised how relaxed and fun this movie is.
