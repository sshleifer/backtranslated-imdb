The revisitation of a classic story is based on the music of Burt Bacharach and on Hal David's lyrics. The actors seem real people in this fairy tale of the outside world that meets with the mystic Shangra-la. It's a joy to see Bobby Van, whose acting reminds me of the Red Buttons and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to bring gravity into his roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would know? <br /> <br /> The all-star cast of Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this job a caretaker for those of us who love people.
