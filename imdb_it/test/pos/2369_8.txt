I recorded this on Sundance and I had no idea it was a Miike movie. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like the dancer saxophone <br /> <br /> that sounded like an oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew it had to be Miike. <br /> <br /> I lost my initial credits and had to wait until the end of the credits to see Miike's credits. <br /> <br /> So far it hasn't disappointed me yet. Audition, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of the Katakuries were all good films, and now I've discovered that this was the third in a trilogy. <br /> <br /> In addition to Miike and Todd Solendz there is no one who makes interesting films today.
