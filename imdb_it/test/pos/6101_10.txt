*** SPOILER *** *** SPOILER *** Wow, in which situation Joanna found herself. After accidentally running over a child, she goes to ask for help, only to return to the crime scene amidst a group of very angry spectators. Understandably, this is too much for her to handle, and she runs away from the scene. Fortunately the child is not dead, but is seriously injured and in a coma. So the biggest fight in Joanna's life begins: should she be silent or talk? At first he does not, but eventually he realizes that it is torture to live with such a horrible secret. At one point he joins a research team to find the culprit. And little by little a detective begins to question the behavior of this woman. He wants to tell the truth, and she never wanted to run away from the crime scene, but is it worth telling and having the whole city hate you for it? <br /> <br /> The thing about this movie is that you don't choose sides. Joanna is really a good model, even if she made bad choices. You feel for yourself, even if you know what he did is wrong. His journey is a good representation of what any human being could go through if something similar happened to them. <br /> <br /> Margaret Colin is an absolutely brilliant actress. She was fantastic in the TV series Now and Again and starred in films like Independence Day and The Devil's Own. His performance here is so realistic and unforced that he transports us all through the entire film. In the end, I wanted to see more. Lisa Vidal has also provided good support work as a kind and enterprising investigator. <br /> <br /> To conclude, if you want to see a movie that will make you think much later, one that will say "This is reality", so you won't want to miss this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
