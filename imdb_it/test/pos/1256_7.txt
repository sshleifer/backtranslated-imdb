The Kid - At 39 Russell Duritz has a life that most men will envy: he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. But everything has a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and the fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn't pass this movie to Miramax - not because it's particularly bold or edgy, but because it's clearly an adult film. This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign that is clearly aimed at children: it's focused on the "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" trailers (haven't they been gone yet?). But I quibbled. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the material - rather than the typical mid-life crisis that involves a bit pathetic buying a Porsche convertible and behaves like a moron, the character of Willis commits himself some serious introspection and takes stock of his life. His guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at the age of 8 (they never explain how Rusty comes about and frankly, I didn't care). Young Rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in divining the truth - he sums up Russell's work as an image consultant in this way: "Teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they are not ". For a good script to succeed, however, it is necessary for the actors to bring it to life. It's not a problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis has three times ignored W.C. Fields warnings about children or animals protagonists have had a fortune again, comically reconnecting with Breslin, as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance Russell's ruthless traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. Breslin meanwhile gives a dead person on the portrait of a child from everyone's childhood - one that has always been left out for some reason and has been taken into consideration. We also receive two bonus shows: Lily Tomlin is great as Russell's level assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as a charming charming persecutor (I loved her in "Guinevere"). The Kid is charming, heavy, and real. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.
