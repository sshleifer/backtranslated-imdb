This film is hilarious, brilliant and insightful. Although perhaps the story would have worked well by involving almost every ethnic group, the intrinsic Jewishness of the characters gives an additional meaning to the generosity of the wonderful dialogue. There were so many social problems covered in the plot that for that reason alone it would have been worth seeing; -but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread throughout the grateful audience. The mixture of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play their roles with all the pathos and humor that one would expect from the Shakespearean drama that their lives seem to parody. This is a film about the family; - on the often fragile, sometimes invisible, bond of different personalities and lifestyles, first among brothers and parents, and inevitably between the largest family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the film a rhythm and a development that keeps the viewer intrigued up to the final scene. Peter Falk is incredible, as always, in his role as patriarch of the Morris Applebaum family. The strong performances of a refined cast include a surprise guest. Don't miss this movie!
