imagine "24" completely free of censorship, given the free license to explain the situation in every necessary detail and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill / prevent and have an idea of ​​how good this TV series is. People in the United States have known for a long time that Showtime is the new HBO, they are doing much more advanced and powerful shows and this is no exception. The show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeping cell until an attack is attempted, taking on important aspects such as faith, religion, funding, means and needs. For the uninitiated, there is much to learn about the Muslim faith here. Unlike traditional shows such as "24" in which terrorists are just crazy that good guys shoot, their purpose and reasoning are completely examined here. What gives the show greater credibility is the latest technology used by the cell / FBI and the authentic shots in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, no expense is spared to tell the story accurately. The cast is relatively unknown but the acting is superb with the help of a tightly written script that constantly keeps the viewer at the limit with many unexpected twists. This show does not have the merit it deserves and, ironically, it is a bit overwhelming, it must see for anyone interested in this genre
