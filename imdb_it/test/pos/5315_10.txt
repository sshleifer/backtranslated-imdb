I liked, appreciated, I will see this film again because I am sure there are subtleties that I missed. Wonderfully cast, no acting or Clich√© plot. Use a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how the people involved in each relationship are connected (or disconnected) and the perceptions of life, what position each occupies in the relationship, in life and how they deal with confusion, joy, pain and disappointment to discover that things are not how they perceived them. At first I thought there were "observers" and "observed", but it is not so, we are all connected in some way and our perceived separation is only in small degree. I recommend the film to everyone, especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person who breathes.
