I first heard about Commander's Log when I was at the concom for the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels to make TVs on a shoestring budget. I must say that I was very happy when I finally had the chance to see the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarf are inevitable, since even the first seasons of Red Dwarf were shot on a low budget (although the Commander's Log has set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of flight time ), and therefore must compensate for the lack of "eye candy" with good writing and acting. Linden Banks, who plays Petty Officer Blather, does a particularly good job of presenting a serious but clueless character. <br /> <br /> Bowlsby's original idea was that the story was told in two interstitial minutes, shown in other shows during an evening, even if for some reason, Space didn't understand how much it would be It was an interesting idea, and so the interstitials were all presented in a one-hour show, which Space normally showed in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episode 3 (premiered at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (which was previewed at Vancouver's VCON in 2006), but if you are in contact with yours local fan community, can take notice of a screening somewhere near you.
