<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez plays the wonderful HOMEFRONT game and turns it into a compelling movie. <br /> <br /> THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast, all seemingly digging into their characters. The acting here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> The credit must also go to the director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were extremely fluid. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and actually increased the tension. <br /> <br /> Remove all elements of Vietnam from the text, and there are still interesting characters who struggle with the good and evil full range of family dynamics. (A viewer could see this point more clearly by keeping in mind the "Discover the old photo" scene from the beginning while the rest of the film is watched). <br /> <br /> As a film, I found THE WAR AT HOME to be more direct and to the point that I was born on 4 July. A great effort: almost a 10. <br /> <br />
