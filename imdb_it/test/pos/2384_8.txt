fluke. nice to look at. I hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. I really like the location setting with all the New York references. it was interesting how everything happens at the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, although kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. There are a lot of little tricks built into this movie that make it all the better. I think the actress didn't do a great job in her role. casting and directing in this film seem to be stitched together seamlessly and the quality of the footage is pretty impressive. even the film is not without delicate moments, which gives it a pleasant sense of balance.
