The stars and planets must all be in the right alignment, the day that THRILLER was conceived. Michael Jackson's album was killing the charts, John Landis still had a lot of goodwill built from his genre photo "An American Werewolf In London", (not to mention his classic comedies ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS) and the choreographer Michael Peters was creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for music videos of that period. <br /> <br /> Not before or after a single piece of film has illuminated, exploited or underlined the incredible talent of MJ or the more "unearthly" aspects of his character is very similar to THRILLER, the video of most successful (if not officially the first) in the world of long duration, and the most affectionately remembered. Even the most expensive at the moment, but every penny and every small part of the talent behind its creation and execution is up there on the screen. And how would it not be complete without the "rap" of the original song, provided by the deceased, great Vincent Price, to add even more cache to the chills already present? <br /> <br /> The glory days of one of the greatest artists in the world have long since passed, but no one will ever be able to take away the highest achievements of man, of which this is probably the most memorable. If you don't think so, now, remember: Halloween is coming. I won't be a little surprised when, like the other Halloweens before it dates back decades, this one appears on some Saturday Night Creature specials. <br /> <br /> How will next year, and the year after ....
