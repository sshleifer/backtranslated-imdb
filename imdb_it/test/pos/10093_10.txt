If you consider yourself a fan of horror movies, it's likely that you saw Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They are superb and Ring is making its way gently to Hollywood (maybe even Dark Water will soon be adapted?). While Ring is almost 100% pure heart that beats and breaks nerves, a story of two sisters is both nerve break and twist of the mind. <br /> <br /> Together with The Other I consider this Korean film a brilliant and intelligent final horror film. The only flaw in this film is that some consider its first 20 minutes rather slow. It is actually typical of Korean and Japanese films. I consider it carefully planned rather than slow, thinking of it as "a calm moment before the storm". With a thorough introduction to the characters, the imho viewer will be more intimately involved with the character, one of the strengths of Korean and Japanese cinema. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, a story of two sisters do not go overboard with the horrible look. Rather, they let our mind do the intimidating work itself. In this way it is more gaunt and horribly elegant at the same time. I wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood reworked this film after bringing Ring and Rancore / Ju-On (This film is not that good, I consider it 5.5). Not to be missed!
