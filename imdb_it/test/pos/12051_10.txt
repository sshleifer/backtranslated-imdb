The film is a great film. One of the best films of Yash raj. The direction is incredible. The script is brilliant. The story is excellent. He tells of Rahul being obsessed with Kiran, his college friend. psycho who does things like talking to his mother on the phone (however he died 15 years ago) etc. Kirir is engaged to Sunil. Rahul does everything to have her. He also wants to kill Sunil but he survives. He too goes where they are going on their honeymoon. The film is all nes delight.Shahrukh is superb, Juhi is quite good, Sunny is average, Anupham is fine and so is Tanvi, Dalip has done well. The film belongs to Srk.The dialogues are brilliant (those of Shahrukh and much, if not those of comedies and comedies). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodious pieces.
