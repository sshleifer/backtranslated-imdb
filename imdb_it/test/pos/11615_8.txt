Entering this film I understood two things about it. I knew it was a real extreme movie, and I knew it was a bit artistic. Both attract me in turn, but when put together they can be something truly unique. And this was damn right, no doubt, unique. As I said above, it's an artistic film. The way they used an intense sound reminded me a lot of an Aronofsky movie. Visually, I haven't seen anything like it. Cinematography and lighting were very well done. The film takes images and sounds seriously better than anything I've seen in a while. Especially if you consider the experience of these young directors (a couple of 20s), you really have to take your hat off. <br /> <br /> The film is not easy to describe or even to discuss. There is no true story ... could you say that it revolves around the right and left side of the brain and how they control your life? I think. They are four segments, or four ideas animated through visual and auditory extremes. There is a bit of talking and feeling, but it's mostly a non-speaking film. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and rotates on a naked body and an eyeball. Try to guess what happens ?? Mistaken. The second segment is my favorite. It involves a brother and a sister (who looks a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with bigger tits). The brother is crazy and the sister is somehow a whore. I would say that this is the most extreme of all segments and the most well done. The effects of gore in this were fantastic. The third segment revolves around a group of naked people who have sex with mother earth. He is probably considered the weakest in the group, but he is still smart and well done. The fourth segment is probably the strongest in the film and I would say even the deepest. For myself I will have to see it a couple of times to understand what is really said. I know he faces Christianity in a way that will most likely pretend or throw up your mother. Give it a go. <br /> <br /> Cruelty to the subconscious was recommended to me and I am proud to say it is now in my movie collection. It is extreme, violent, bloody, very sexual and surprisingly damn stimulating. The next line I'm about to say has been used in almost every review I've read for this movie. "This film is not for everyone". Now that is not the truth. If you like extreme movies and / or are you just a movie lover who wants to see something different ?? 8 1/2 out of 10
