What can I say about this film that has not been said by all the other comments here, they summarize practically everything, the people who love it love it, the people who hate it ... well, they hate it. This is the cinematic equivalent of Marmite. I have personally taken up every second of it, it is cyclical, claustrophobic, introspective, magical and stands as one of the most unique films ever made. Despite what many have claimed, I believe this is truly a cult film, it is a rough diamond that is just waiting to be discovered, once unearthed it is a fantastic psychedelic vision and an incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable, which is a goal by itself. One of my friends who saw it compared him more to a musical, and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made, he will probably get more out of it to see Head as such. <Br /> <br /> I've always been fond of the Monkees, especially the TV show when it was repeated in the 1980s. My mother recorded Head for me when it was shown on TV late at night, because she knew I liked it, watched it the next day and froze in my memory until I could find a copy on DVD about twenty. years later, what I'd like now is a special edition, it would be fascinating to have a broader view of the making of this masterpiece. We can only hope.
