I would like to waste a moment of your time explaining how I approached this film. First I dismissed the trailers in an unprecedented way because the film seemed to be an unmodified remake of Aliens, which I consider one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to close the film after hearing positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I completely lost the theatrical run. Then I became passionate about Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season, and I found Pitch Black on the phone one night in bed, so I said "oh, why not, at least Claudia Black is in it". I soon recognized Keith David and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (because this should surprise me, I don't know). I was fascinated. I was fascinated for four years. I just watched the movie for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> This is not an art film, not an independent one, and it is not entirely original, but where it fails to break a very new one, it completely manages to provide interesting and realistic characters, a difficult driving action in the midst of a compelling but simple storyline and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with special effects made with taste. Sound too good to be true? Don't believe me, look at it yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would have continued acting in his Riddick-ulous Chronicles (which I also liked, although he recognized his rather huge flaws) and is now a sort of legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and so interesting to watch that it's easy to ignore the fact that he's not only a talented actor, but also an intelligent one. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with audio commentaries, it might just blow you. <br /> <br /> The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship blocked on an unknown planet after a landing accident in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but brilliant and heroic (Mitchell), but is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). That's all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> Although not very original and unlikely, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told and very well executed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think about it for a while, but expect to have fun with this classic modern fantasy action.
