Ah, Hitchcock! It is difficult to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it after THE BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR proves the point. Having admired most of this director's work for many years, I had managed to skip this, perhaps due to the lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as main actors. I was naturally familiar with the climax of the Statue of Liberty to have seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives, but I mistakenly assumed that the story that led to this might not hold my interest. I was wrong! The plot of suspense fills up with bats in a chance encounter between the bad boy Saboteur and the good boy victim of a wrong accusation and continues to follow a series of further casual encounters and narrow escapes. Hitchcock's familiar elements are all there: the innocent wrongly accused of a crime; people are not what they seem to be; dramatic or improbable places that intensify the suspense scene that takes place inside them (an aircraft hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero rushes to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a sumptuous residence, a top floor of a skyscraper, and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty). <br /> <br /> In all it is the humor provided by supportive players, generous junk of the First World War - vintage social commentary, moments of human warmth where suffering people find it inside of them to lend a hand to help a human companion, getting nothing in return ?? in short, there was always a basic humanity in Hitchcock's heart, however horrible the traps were - a sensational cast of supportive players, mainly Otto Kruger as the baddest villain of this part of George Sanders (his credits on Broadway include Noel Coward's male lead LIVING PRIVATE ?? and that says it all) and Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger ?? no relationship with Otto ?? as a prominent widow company involved in the fifth intrigue column (her character foreshadows that of Claude Rains's mother in NOTO). Priscilla Lane does a great job with a difficult role. For most of his early scenes we can't tell if she believes the hero is innocent or guilty and seems to continually change his mind, not get late in the proceedings. It cannot be ascertained if his acting is guilt or if we are destined to remain in a state of uncertainty, but the developments of the plot are so fast, funny and intelligent that we do not really care what he thinks. <br /> <br /> Then there are the special touches of Hitchcock that have nothing to do with the plot. Twice the character of Lane stops to get a change of a quarter ?? once to repay his captors for an ice cream and once again to make a call from a phone booth. Why are these scenes included are someone's hypothesis, perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus increase credibility and suspense? Or maybe to give the public a moment to catch their breath? Some of the characters are exaggerated ?? the garrulous truck driver, the incredibly gentle and confident blind man who lives alone in a perfectly clean forest cabin, the overwhelming human skeleton of political philosophy and other members of the circus caravan that hide the protagonists from their pursuers.
