We watched this movie in my chemistry class, so obviously it had educational value. I thought the film did a great job interweaving the themes of science, moral issues and the personal experiences of the Manhattan project, but it wasn't exactly focused on strong acting. I would recommend this film for those who are inclined to science or interested in the moral issues behind Fat Man and Little Boy, but if the topic of nuclear bombs bores you, don't see it.
