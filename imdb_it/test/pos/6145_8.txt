I, as many patrons of IMDB seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared in the Canadian "Showcase Network". I've been, like many of you, even sucked in and watched the whole movie. At the beginning I was fascinated by the cultured dialogue and the ironic sense of humor of which the film is rich. I was wandering around in a sort of "Kevin Smith meets Killer Films" until the middle of the film when the film really got all the more in-depth and explored its themes ... with a decidedly darker and more intense edge. Far from being taken away from experience, I was taken further. This is not the best film of its kind and it certainly won't have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the most negative reactions to it. But I bought in ... and I enjoyed it immensely. The "flash back" movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well made and the questions raised were human, accessible (in my experience anyway) and interesting. I was very impressed by the film's ability to remain sweet, fun and entertaining while not moving away from controversial topics and a language, a dynamic and a raw emotional situation. This film is a great antidote to many of the schlocks that have permeated the witty / intelligent romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Devote 2 hours to your busy schedule and jump into the world of Wirey ... or you could go and rent "You've Got Mail", because if you like it, you won't like it anyway! Those of us who have done it will be fine without you on our side ...
