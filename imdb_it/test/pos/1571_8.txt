Having worked professionally with runaway girls, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found a friend who had not lent his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age, Mother / Daughter Estrangement, The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged, Who is the Good Samaritan, Tragedy is in Every Life and the many levels or relationships. The flashbacks are significant (when Alice acquires a gun we know that she has a certain familiarity with how to use it) and does not end up in the clich√©. The cast really "sells" their roles. It is a material for adults and the sound is a little too grainy. Allow 15 minutes to attract you.
