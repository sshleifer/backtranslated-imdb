I turned to this movie in the middle of the night and almost jumped to the right. It was just because there was nothing else on what I decided to watch. In the end, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting plot, good characters, a clever script and a brilliant direction make this beautiful movie sit and watch. This was, in fact, the first I had heard of this film, but I would have been happy to have paid to see it at the cinema. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br />
