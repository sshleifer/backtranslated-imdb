Ok, Ghoulies 4 is pretty bad. And actually, it doesn't even have demons. And acting is bad. The plot is stupid. But I forget to mention how fun this movie is. It's so campy, and so ridiculous it's too much fun not to have fun. There are only 2 ghoulies in the movie, and they really don't seem to be related to the Ghoulies in the other movie. But they are pretty funny. And funny thing, that Jonathon Graves returns for that. If you saw the first one, he was a character in this. In my opinion, it is better than the first. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one that is in a grocery store. "Watch out for K-Mart customers!" Watch this if you like bad movies. It's so bad that it's fine. And did I mention that Barbara Alyn Woods is sexy?
