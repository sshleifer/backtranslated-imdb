Over the years I've seen this movie many times since seeing it in "HBO" and now I have a copy on DVD. I must say that it is very memorable and fun meanwhile also interesting and educational. Like any TV fan can refer to the time of the early 90s when it was time to replace Johhny Carson the living TV legend of "The Tonight Show" who will Jay or Dave be? This original HBO film "The Late Shift" remains true to form and very well describes the real events by showing the behind-the-scenes battle between the heads of the NBC and CBS networks and even the ABC that were all fighting for Jay's services. and Dave. The acting makes it seem real, since the real television movie is shown with real people while the actors that portray Leno and Letterman make it seem so real. I haven't read Bill Carter's book, so I don't know if it has remained faithful to the pages, but I really enjoyed this film over the years. From the moment he starts showing CBS entertainment chiefs who watch the Leno sub for Johhny and decide they want to enter the game late at night. Yet, when Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to remain loyal to Leno, but the conflict comes when Letterman wants a crack at 11:30. It was fun to see the weird encounter with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) that makes all the networks want to consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see the scene of Johhny telling Letterman by phone directly to walk from NBC and consider CBS. And from the way Rich Little was as exceptional as Johhny Carson, his performance could not be matched. And many moments of tension were provided by showing the quarrels and the dismissal of Leno's talent manager, Helen, that the heads of NBC pushed him to do. Overall, a great film that shows what TV really is and shows that networks are powerful and hungry for money while showing that it is a ruthless business. Clearly there is no business like the show. Very memorable HBO work and a watch whenever it showed the true story of night wars.
