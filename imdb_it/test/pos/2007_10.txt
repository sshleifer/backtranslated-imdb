Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I've ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes published so far: <br /> <br /> The first episode was even better than I expected and from everything I heard, I expected a lot. I'm very impressed with the actors already. The father was creepy and sounded perfectly. The girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey that emotion. The animation was superb. Cinematography was amazing, every corner of the camera perfectly captures the feel of the scene. The editing was done so well, each scene blended perfectly with the next one. The music has captured the emotions quite well and attracted you into the story. I can't say enough how wonderful this episode was. Surely it stimulates my appetite more! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first! Everything I've said about the first episode continues, only you can see even more of the character's development. I can't wait to finally see episode 3 or the rest of the series. What is being developed is an intriguing story driven by a character with all the traps of a great Hollywood production, but without the pretense. It says so much, with so few words. This series is something you've never seen and perched to become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other word describes it! WOW! Everything I said about previous episodes is true for this, yet it was even better! I don't know how you manage to take something extraordinary and make it even better! The further development of the character shows that it is a piece completely driven by the character. Cinematography excels as always and draws you into pain, fear, hatred and Emily's emotional roller coaster. I can't wait to see episode 4 ... or the rest of the series. You really exceeded yourself! <br /> <br /> As much as I loved the other episodes, episode 4 is the best. I love the progression of the character. I feel like we're really knowing Emily, her pain and her inner struggle. The other topics that I have stated in previous reviews have continued. GREAT cinematography, the script is superb, the actors are right with their portraits and have made the characters their own, and the animation is simply amazing! Another great job by the DbP crew!
