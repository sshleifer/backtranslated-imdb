Paha Maa is a different Finnish film. But the things that make it different are copied abroad. Some storytelling techniques are by Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. The scenes are still shot from different angles. Paha Maa is a good movie, but it's not so nice that the exaggeration says: "Realistic movie, no happy ending and no commercial admissions". Some actors have done a great job. Sulevi Peltola was good as a street vendor of vacuum cleaners. Jasper Pääkkönen also shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame. He's such an overrated actor, he's handsome and likeable, but not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish films, it's worth seeing Paha Maa.
