I cannot argue with other comments about the fact that the plot focuses more on the love story between the characters of Mary Martin and Allan Jones, much like "Showboat", than on Victor Herbert's life. But in the 1930s, would it have been a box office draw? Instead of VH's life, perhaps it should have been VH's music. There is an abundance of this. <br /> <br /> For me, the thrill of the film came almost at the end of the film when Susanna Foster sings "Land of Romance". It's been over a decade since I took this film for the second time in a local "old film" theater. At first the audience was stunned; then he burst into spontaneous applause. I remember the chills that ran up and down my back. My curiosity reminded me of information provided to an investigating public by a local journalist when the film first came out in the late 1930s. "That note hit by Miss Foster was a distant F above C." <br /> <br /> You may not have had four Yma Sumac octaves but the then teenager certainly had a range!
