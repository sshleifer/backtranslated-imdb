This film was my first acquaintance with Chris Cooper's talents. I was deeply impressed by the character he played. I knew, when I saw the film, that bigger things had to come from this talented actor. He plays a Union Captain who, along with a couple of enlisted men, is looking in eastern Kentucky. They happen on the farm of a "Sesech" woman whose husband chose to go to the Confederacy. <br /> <br /> The portrait of eastern Kentucky, and his feelings seriously divided during the war, is very accurate. If you are looking for a war movie with lots of blood and guts, this would not be it. If you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples at war, actually and philosophically, then this is the best study of how divided loyalties influence peoples' interaction in border states during the American Civil War.
