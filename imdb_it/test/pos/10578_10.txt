Having read the book before looking at this adaptation, you would think it would lose some of its thrill. However, the story is so clever that I could never get tired. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine really put their heart into their roles and pulled out most of the characters. I fell in love with history and women again. <br /> <br /> Nice to look at thanks to the direction, settings and costumes. Despite the speed of the television plot, I don't think anything important has been lost during transport. He put me on the edge of my seat for everything with a lot of wonderful moments of trembling in my stomach. We really liked it. This is the kind of television I've been waiting for.
