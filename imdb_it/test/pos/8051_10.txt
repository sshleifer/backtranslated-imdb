The film is the beginning of what really happened in Phenix City. I am a grandson of people who have really lived history. The truth never came to my knowledge. I tried to discover the whole story but the people who lived through it are still afraid to say it. Phenix City is still run by dishonest people. Albert Patterson was not exactly the saint that history wants you to believe. The story was shot in Phenix City. It still has some of the famous sites you see in the movie. Colonal's funeral home still looks the same. But if you're looking for the real Sin City story you have to visit us and find people willing to talk to you about Ma's beachies and kindness. He did not receive the name but for nothing.
