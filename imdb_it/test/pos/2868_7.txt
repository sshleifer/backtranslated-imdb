This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. A mysterious abandoned house, interesting characters, cold blood and a twisted plot. Who could ask for more in a horror movie? It's pretty predictable for most, but then again most of the horrors you can understand within the first 10 minutes, so I won't hold it against you. Music, camera angles and so on are excellent. The sets are well made and very convincing. There was practically no subplot, but being a horror film too many alternative plots just take away what it wanted from a horror anyway ... Being scared ... This makes it quite simple and does just that. If I had to compare it to any other film, I'd say it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Surely a horror lover must see.
