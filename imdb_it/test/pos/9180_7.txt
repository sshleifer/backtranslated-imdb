When you look at romantic comedies, you know what to expect; we've seen enough for many, many years to know how they go. There is a formula, one that almost always generates films that become popular with the general public ... not always in relation to their actual quality. How to play with it and create something more interesting? This film has a suggestion ... and works relatively well. Instead of simply following a leash, we skillfully follow him by helping the unfortunate men, those who lack the attractive fa√ßade that would allow them to reveal the invisible qualities they possess to the women they love. The plot follows Smith as he works on his most difficult case to proclaim himself; Kevin James. Along with his help from James, we also follow Mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want (a particular scene that inspires great respect for the character of Smith is that he meets one of those balls, and puts him in his place ). After seeing Smith help the disaster that is James, we see him with Mendes ... and despite his talent in helping others, he makes a mess ... bad ... with her. Make a wonderful point about love, and how falling in love hits us. For a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids the pitfalls of this (sometimes almost to the limit it feels like a parody of the genre), even if the last scenes have the sweetness and the emotions of this type of film. Whether or not the formula will follow will not be revealed in this review. The pace is pretty good, it never really slows down and rarely moves too fast. The acting is great, as far as practically everyone goes. The characters are well developed and come out as real people. Humor doesn't always work ... there are occasional gags that are performed less than fortunately and one or two lines that seem forced. However, for the most part, the film was fun. I recommend it to anyone who loves romantic comedies and whoever is or has been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a hard time with the last scenes. 7/10
