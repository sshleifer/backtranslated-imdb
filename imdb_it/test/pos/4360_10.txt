Wow, this is a touching story! First I saw "Rescue Dawn". I did not like it. And now I've seen the person, Dieter Dengler, of whom this story was told by Herzog. Very impressive. Deter is a guided human being who has encountered the most contrary emotions in his life on this earth. What an extraordinary life this person has led. His story about the capture of Patet Lao / Vietcong and therefore his suffering is horrible, but what is most impressive is his incredible will to survive. How can he find strength? Obsessively, Dieter is telling us sentences full of sentences about his terrible ordeal during his imprisonment ... he is a great storyteller and Herzog does the justice that this brave man deserves. <br /> <br /> In my opinion. "Little Dieter needs to fly" says it all! leaving nothing to the imagination, thus making "Rescue dawn" a superfluous film. The horror does not become more real than in the words of Dieter Dengler himself. Totally manages to paint the picture.
