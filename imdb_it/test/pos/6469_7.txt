John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. It's at the bottom of the pile. He sees Negro Sidney Poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends, forming a sort of alliance against a bully of a foreman interpreted by Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> As someone who worked in a warehouse myself when I was younger, I can tell you that warehouse fights, complete with shaking boxes and climbing hooks, are as realistic as possible. I've been in fights like myself alone, even though no one was killed. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the widow of Sidney Poitier is a variation of Shakespeare's Shylock "Do I not bleed?" This is an anti-racist film, which was very necessary at the time. <br /> <br /> All three main characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are superb, with Warden the most exceptional of the three.
