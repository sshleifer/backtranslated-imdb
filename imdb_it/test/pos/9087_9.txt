The students of cocky medicine play chicken with a process that simulates death, in an attempt to obtain a (hopefully temporary) vision of the afterlife. Certain twists and turns are a bit out of place, and the acting occasionally goes beyond the lines. But the basic message - about the forgiveness of God and others for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in cinema, and the cast is very very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so effective that, years after seeing it, I still get the thrill to think about it. Highly recommended.
