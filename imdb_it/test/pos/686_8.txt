This is an exhilarating rough diamond. The acting and the plot are not so impressive, but the jokes keep coming. This attracts a lot of flops because at first glance it looks like, well, a bad movie, but it's so extravagant that you can't help but be amused. The quick and light dialogue and the eccentric characters keep going on ... I was particularly fond of Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However, what really stole the show was Richard's little brother, Andrew (Ira Heiden), his keen wailing was somehow appealing. The whole film is shaken.
