Years ago, I didn't like and respect Jimmy Cagney's films almost as much as I did. I noticed that many of Cagney's films made with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. However, the more I watched these films, the more I realized that I was hooked despite these aspects. In fact, now I like them and wait for them! Fans of old Hollywood movies probably understand what I'm saying - teenagers and other young whippersnapper don't! Well, when it comes to entertainment, THE MAYOR OF HELL never gives up from beginning to end. Although the idea of ​​a shady character like Cagney who took over the management of a reform school is ridiculous, and even if all the changes he made seem far-fetched, everything has somehow developed and provided solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> The band of robust thugs was pre-Dead End Kids and in place of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, similar roles were played by Frankie Darrow and Farina. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his roles in the Our Gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of Hollywood's highest paid child actors. All he needed to surrender in return was to be called a bland name and to act like a beautiful stereotypical "nigger". Here, it was actually quite good and the usual black stereotypes are a little more subdued than usual. However, some will shudder at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving Farina and her father, Fred "Snowflake" Toones. With terrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", don't say I didn't warn you. <br /> <br /> Apart from this small complaint and a difficult plot to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. The children do a great job, as does Cagney and Dudley Digges in a very despicable but exciting role as the evil guardian. Also, as an added benefit, you can see the perennial Warner actor, Allen Jenkins, in his first role for the studio.
