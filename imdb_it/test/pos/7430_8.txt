Errol Flynn had a nice present for the comedy that was unfortunately rarely exploited. Given the right material, this film shows that he could have been happily at ease in the style of Cary Grant, kind comedies. Among his various forays into the genre, this is certainly the best. Patti Brady gives a nice interpretation in the childish part and Eleanor Parker simply looks stunning throughout the film. A further advantage is the wonderful Hattie McDaniel who is sadly underutilized in this film - a welcome presence nonetheless. Flynn carries out his comedic tasks in the same simple style that led to his cloak-and-sword roles. The fact that it makes it seem easy is not that it is. A fantastic little family comedy, ideal for the Christmas season or any other time when you feel to be cheered up.
