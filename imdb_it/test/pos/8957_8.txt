I bought this movie from my local blockbuster for 99p and stayed in my video library for at least a year. Then tonight I decided to see it, the film was very different from what I expected and I didn't find any humor in all that I saw is that it was a sad look at people dealing with love affairs and sexual orientation and I have I really see that the psycho killer plot is really right, if not adding tensions at the end of the film. I heard that the person who played the lesbian woman did a great job. I was following her emotions and what was happening around her. Some people have probably seen some of the fun things they do, but I could really put myself in their place, loving someone, but they push you away at every corner, no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very touching film and dealt well with all the different sexualities. I was expecting something like Bound & Gagged: a love story, but this is a very different film. Not for bigots.
