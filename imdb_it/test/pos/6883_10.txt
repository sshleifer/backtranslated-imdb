It is quite simple that those who call this film something "discreet" do not know their cinema. "The Doll Master" creates a sense of terror and suspense rarely seen in films outside of Asia. <br /> <br /> Think of a mixture of "Manga" and "Ringu" in one and that's it. <br /> <br /> First rate acting, first rate direction, first rate set and effects. <br /> <br /> This is right there with the best of Asian horror movies; Ringu, Dark Water and A Story of Two Sisters. <br /> <br /> An absolute must. <br /> <br /> Take it from a guy who knows his movies.
