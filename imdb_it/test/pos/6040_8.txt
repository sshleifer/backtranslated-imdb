Elizabeth Ashley is receiving phone calls from her nephew Michael - she is crying, screaming and asking for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie scared me in 1972 when it aired on ABC. Seeing him again, years later, it works AGAIN. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit slow and predictable, the dead are very quiet and there is a sticky happy ending, but this is a TV movie so you have to give it space Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gazzara is OK and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And those phone calls continue to scare the living lights of me. Actually I had to turn on a light during one of them! <br /> <br /> A scary little television movie. Worth seeing.
