I'm not American, but meatballs still strike me. Perhaps because it is a sweet and sweet film. Watching it again today has made me a bit sentimental for a moment when I really can't put my finger and a place I can't remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs is just a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and everything was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this you probably know what I mean. <br /> <br /> All I can say at the top of what I have already said is that the meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you are American. I guess you know what I mean by this.
