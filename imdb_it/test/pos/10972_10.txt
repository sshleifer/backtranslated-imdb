MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a fantastic film that is both predictable and unpredictable. You know that the characters after discovering that the so-called "Gift of God" was actually a loan, will pay the money and that in the end everyone will be happy, but the way they arrive is not so obvious. Scenes are often fun and occasionally moving as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. The cast of veteran actors is not just a nostalgic journey. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove to be able to play beyond the Riddler, Mother Partridge or Mary Phyllis' friend while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play characters other than those we saw in their TV series. The portrait of Ursula Burton's nun is both moving and fun without fooling the nuns or the church. If you're looking for a movie with an exceptional cast, good music (including a version of Shirley Jones of "The Way You Look Tonight") and an uplifting finale, try it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
