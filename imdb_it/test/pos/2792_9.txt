My wife and I saw this wonderful film tonight because we'll be looking at the Russian Dolls tomorrow and the first one is important to see before the second one. <br /> <br /> We both loved The Spaniah Apartment and will have fun following some of the characters through the early years of their lives, now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both slightly identified the approximate structure of the story because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not completely foreign to our first lives. Our way of life was considerably different but, as in this film, every time you put together young people who pass through the same rings of life of any person in the developed world, they will experience many of the same life situations. <br /> <br /> The collection of people and the personal difficulties they faced were universal and here is the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and so we can enjoy living their lives for a while. This must be one of the great strengths of the film: to allow the viewer to live indirectly the emotional upheavals of the people involved and at the same time remain outside. The viewer can, through that distance, giggle thinking of himself: "I would not have done something stupid" or "I would have avoided that trap". Maybe that's why we go to the movies.
