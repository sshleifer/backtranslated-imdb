Never been kissed by Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely sweet and sometimes rather painful story about a shy woman named Josie Gellar who, however brilliant, is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She is assigned her first important news for the newspaper she works for - to go incognito while a high school student makes friends with the most famous kids and scoops up what's going on in the high school world. The only problem is that Josie has never been popular. The high school was, in fact, a traumatizing experience for her since she was the recipient of a lot of joking and cruel jokes. Josie grabs this assignment, just to "adapt" to get a scoop, what she finds is the main premise of the story. <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is one of those films that is so corny and Schmaltzy sometimes, especially in some scenes at the end, that the limits of credibility are put to the test and that many cynics may not appreciate this film. It is however, very gently done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the adorable and adorable Josie, who breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes it look perfectly realistic. I also liked Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at school. <br /> <br /> Never been kissed he has some really fun moments as Josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. Example: the reggae bar scene. I also liked the appearance of Josie's brother, Rob, who also returns and signs up as a high school student, the way he helps give Josie his "dream" of adapting is finally hilarious. At the same time, as Josie's sad story of her high school years is shown in flashback, it is extremely painful. You don't need to have had high school experiences with Josie to be influenced by his story: Drew is wonderful at making his character a personal connection with the public and we love Josie from the start. <br /> <br /> there are a lot of "bad girls" in 2004, in this movie, but the honest girls were much more aggressive. Never been kissed it becomes a very romantic photo as Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will meet. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was really well done in some areas. The film is trivial in some places yes, the last scene, realistic, does not exist, does this film manipulate your emotions in the most obvious way in Hollywood? Oh yes yes yes small! But it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. The film never preaches, but manages to paint a precise image of how high school was for a select few. I have met people who have had similar experiences with Josie - I have met people very similar to all these characters - I think that many people simply do not know or cannot conceive the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how painful it can be, but it's there. It is not at all realistic. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom, which demonstrates the "sheep mentality" that can exist so prevalently: how Hollywood was made and how many think it is, it was well done and very true. <br /> <br /> I am making a kiss never sounded much heavier than it is, in truth this is a perfect film to choose when you want a sweet feeling good, a moving photo. It is engaging, sweetly recited and only Rufus. I'd say take a look. 8 of 10.
