This pleasantly perverted and extravagant movie from the early 1980s may never reach the surprisingly bent pinnacle of the Moppets movie "Devil Times Five", deeply disturbing and criminally underrated, but it's still an above-average opus killer anyway. <br /> <The streamlined but useful plot focuses on a trio of misfit tykes - two boys and a frightening girl with sparkling eyes, though angelic in appearance - all born during a solar eclipse on June 9, 1970 When the strange antisocial trio, which meets in a restricted and exclusive circle, reaches the age of ten, it suddenly becomes a murderer and declares the season open to the unfortunate, unsuspecting local children of the quiet and slumbering Californian suburb of Meadowvale. The writer / director Ed Hunt, the usual incompetent hack blamed such wonderful unfortunate clunkers as the deliciously addicted "Starship Invasions", the astonishing parody of Jesus Christ vigilant (!) "Alien Warrior", and the sensational fool "The Brain", does a fairly solid and capable job here: the killing scenes are plentiful and reasonably brutal (the arrow gag through the eye is particularly bad), there is a considerable smattering of free nudity and soft-core sex, a good dose of tension is created and maintained in an orderly fashion, some beautiful dolls of dark humor dot the warped chaos, and the surprise ending ends up being truly unsettling. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the cast of the top-drawers further elevates the process to the perfectly watchable and compelling: Jose Ferror as provincial doctor, the future star of the TV series "Jake and the Fatman" Joe Penny in the role of an amateur astrologer, Lori Lethin of The Prey as the babysitter's heroine, Susan Strasberg as a bitch school teacher, "American Ninja", Michael Dudikoff as a chowderhead jock, and Cyril O'Reilly (the solitary misanthropic vampire in the poignant melancholy "Dance of the Damned") as a libidinous teenage boy who is bagged while doing just what he thinks with a naked and sexy girl behind a parked van. Billy Jacoby (who continued to act in the 80s-directed video drums like "Dr. Alien" and "Demonwarp"), Andy Freeman and in particular the adorable Elizabeth Hoy are really gruesome and convincing as the terrible troika of rugrats chilling and evil. And, yes, this is none other than Julie Brown, the comic ottoman that marked a surprise Top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty melody "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun", like the beautiful, vacant, all red-haired red-haired child that makes a long series, totally unrelated, but still unbridled and much appreciated naked striptease while dancing in her bedroom for a rock song with a ringing taste! All in all, this child fits like a robust and satisfying slasher object.
