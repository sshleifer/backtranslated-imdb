An article in the New York Times in March 1947 described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "address the issues of racial and religious prejudice with a more blunt courage than what the public was used to expect." While RKO was producing Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox was signing Gentleman's Agreement, another story about anti-Semitism. RKO competed to defeat Fox's "ballyhooed" image in theaters, releasing Crossfire several months before the Gentleman agreement. In July 1947, RKO projected Crossfire for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. Furthermore, several surveys, which were designed to assess public prejudice, were conducted before and after the film's screenings. Crossfire has received praise and criticism for its representation of anti-Semitism in America and has been the subject of numerous editorials. Crossfire received an Oscar nomination for best film, but lost the deal with Gentleman. He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was named the best social film in Cannes. In December 1947, Ebony magazine, an African-American publication, gave the film its annual award for "improving interracial understanding". I liked this movie. If you have the chance to see it, see it.
