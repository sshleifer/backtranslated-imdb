I enjoyed this film immensely, due to sharp scenes (humorous and ironic, some even "tragic"), credible performances, witty dialogues and a sincere rendering of what it is like or rather can be like being hetero- and / or homosexual and looking for satisfaction of your desires. I am aware of the paradox here: homosexual and heterosexual .... this is something that the film faces in the end, but which it never uses for caricature. if you are as open-minded as people seem to have made that movie, in the end you don't care if the ones in each other's arms are the same sex or not. <br /> <br /> "Mr. blacksmith" from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a seller of gay houses with "strange" appetites here, but it is not the only thing to admire. to enjoy.....
