This film has the appearance of being put together in a few days, a bit like the Outer Space Plan 9. Nevertheless, it is still a classic ranking among my favorite Features Creatures. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS NEXT ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; aka Wolfman, we come to Dr. Edelman's lab looking for a cure for their nocturnal antisocial behavior, like killing people. Meanwhile, Dr. Edelman discovers the body of the Frankenstein monster. Become obsessed with bringing him back to life (a common trait among scientists, mad or not), he clashes with his best judgment, resulting in monsters chaos and madness. One of the classics of the final Universal of his time (Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), evaluates a 10 with this reviewer. Onslow Steven steals the show as a good doctor turned evil after being infected with Dracula's blood and becoming a half werewolf / vampire, coming to a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 min. makes a good punch. A valid addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out of *****
