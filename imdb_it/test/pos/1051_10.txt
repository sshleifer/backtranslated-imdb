"Christmas In Connecticut" is a jewel of a classic Christmas movie. Although less well known than others, it is still a delightful way to spend an evening on vacation. I watch it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is played to perfection by Elizabeth Lane, the single career girl. Long before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies the rising single girl. His New York apartment, and his friendly restaurateur "uncle" around the corner, represent the single girl of the city existence. He doesn't know how to cook yet, he writes a home column for a magazine! <br /> Dennis Morgan is also the perfect cast of our war hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend Christmas in a "real" home. That creates the delicious and crazy story that evolves. It's fun from beginning to end. We should all have an uncle Felix too!
