A young couple - father Ben (solid Charles Bateman), his wife Nicky (the beautiful Ahna Capri) and their daughter KT (the likeable Geri Reischl of "I Dismember Mama") find themselves trapped in a small deserted California town from hysterical madmen. Worse, there is a pernicious satanic cult that kidnaps children for their diabolical purposes. Director Bernard McEveety, working on an unusual and inspired script by William Welch and L.Q. Jones (the director of "Devil Times Five" Sean MacGregor invented the bizarre story), tells the irresistibly strange plot with a slow but steady rhythm and skillfully creates an eoga-booga disturbing, angular and mysterious atmosphere. Strother Martin offers a wonderfully evil and robust performance like Doc Duncan, who is the joyfully sinister leader of the evil sect. The high level cast of the excellent actors qualifies as a considerable resource: Jones as the sheriff, irreverent Sheriff Hillsboro, Alvy Moore as friendly local Toby and Charles Robinson as a proud, devoted priest, priest Jack. The brilliant and glossy widescreen cinematography of John Arthur Morrill, the ghostly soundtrack of Jamie Mendoza-Nava, and the wild and thrilling black mass ritual are all equally to speed. The idea of ​​having toys that come to the murderous life is simply brilliant (the opening scene with a toy tank that becomes real and crush a family in their car is really upsetting). Even the pleasant and ambiguous ending. A pleasantly idiosyncratic and undervalued winner.
