If you like alternative realities, contemplating what is real and what is only a fantasy, this is a cutting-edge thriller that will make you guess and really make you think. Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! I saw him recently at a film festival L.A. and it was by far the best of the group I saw. It helped that it was actually something, unlike the others that were screened. It is very well managed and the value of production is first rate. I would compare it to Jacob's Ladder as he cares about guessing which is the true reality of the world in which we find ourselves. You should definitely try to hunt this movie and if you project at some festival near you, try to check.
