"The English Patient" by Anthony Minghella is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grandiose and of impressive dimensions, yet so profoundly moving in its representation of love and human suffering. During the 1997 Academy Awards, the film was owned by the evening, taking home nine prizes from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep from "The Last Emperor" by Bernardo Bertolucci in 1988. Based on the 1992 Booker Prize winning novel of the author's novel Michael Ondaatje of the same name, 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the story of a badly burned man in the aftermath of World War II. <br /> <br /> During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the remains of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man who seems to suffer from amnesia, he is presumed to be an allied soldier, and is simply called "the English patient". After the war, on the gentle hills of Italy, a kind nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who apparently lost everyone close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to take care of the dying man. Over time, he learns more and more about his "English patient", who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scarred man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to heal from the tragic memories of his past love. Through numerous flashbacks, we learn about Almásy's previous exploits in the Sahara desert and his romantic relationship with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> It is certainly easy to understand why "The English Patient 'was such a success at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film that it blends the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. The Director of photography John Seale captures the landscape to perfection, not since David Lean's magnificent "Lawrence d'Arabia" has a film that shows the desert with so much beauty and magnificence, making particularly good use of the extensive aerial shots from the Almásy plane Even in the most intimate moments of the film, the excellent use of close-ups and lights capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances of all the cast members. <br /> <br /> Long my favorite actor, "The English Patient" could only contain the best performances of Ralph Fiennes and, considering his history includes films like "Schindler's List" and "The Constant Gardener", this is not a complement to take lightly. his count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character, but as we slowly learn to know his past, his pleasing qualities are eroded by his less admirable tendencies towards others. "Property" is one of the main themes of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most, Almásy responds with "Ownership. Being possessed. When you go out, you should forget me." However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine tries to distance herself from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow gives him the right to have her when he wants: "I want to touch you. the things that are mine, that belong to me. "Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonely nurse she fears she loves because of the tragedies that have always hurt those near her . After some time to take care of Almásy alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and suspects that Almásy was the one who betrayed him with the Germans. Hana also carries out a temporary romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb diffuser in the British army. However, due to his past history, Hana fears that involvement with Kip will condemn him to death, especially considering his dangerous line of work. <br /> <br /> At 160 minutes in length, "The English Patient" wonderfully evokes memories of the classic epic romance of antiquity, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The end of the film is heartbreaking and painful, but also uplifting in its own way. While some romantic relationships are doomed from the beginning, others have excellent chances to bring happiness. However, in any case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.
