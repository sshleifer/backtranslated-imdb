this episode is not inconsistent as another person has said. the source agreed to help because he would not keep his word, if you pay attention ... he says that after she (phoebe) agrees to stay down there in hell, "GET TO BE AND BALTHAZOR SO I DON'T HAVE TO CARE YOU IN THE FUTURE". .. and besides, he did not let COLE NOTIFY SISTERS AS I DID EXCHANGE IN ACCEPTANCE OF ACCEPTING THE DEAL, that's why PRIEST DEATH, because it was hit harder than PIPER and on the head, and there was no PHOEBE for call LEO this time, and in the past LEO DECLARED TO BE ALMOST ESSENTIALLY KILLED. pay more attention next time! and there is no "TO CONTINUE ..." after this episode. is the ending of the third season, and in the fourth season they can't show anything PRUE because it holds the "PRUE" rights, so the producers should pay it for whatever they show. this is the last episode in which it is found!
