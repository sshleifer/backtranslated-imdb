Nuri Bilge's 2002 film Ceylan Distant (Uzak) - his third feature film (his first in 1997 in black and white The Little City - Kasaba), is a significant step forward compared to his good but imperfect film of 1999, Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The previous film had potential, but it smelled of a small budget and of an improvised quality in the worst ways: holes in the plot and acting in the amateurs' wood. The success of Clouds Of May at any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a budding director. However, Distant is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great directors like Ingmar Bergman (although his script is not as heavy as the dialogue is just as gloomy, and the misses Bergman's cue for close-ups - his shots are usually long shots for outdoors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigures). Most of the film takes place in the snowy hibernal of Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will probably surprise it), which gives the film a decisive Bernardian touch, as well as remembering one of the desolate snowy urban images of the Krzysztof Kieslowski The Decalogue. Natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog - as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would impose - which makes them even more memorable, while urban landscapes range from quasi-precisionist compositions by Michelangelo Antonioni the cultural hagiography of Woody Allentuno of a bench overlooking the water is a direct quotation (read stolen) from Manhattan, apart from the lack of the Brooklyn bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan also mentions a famous shot of a ship in the port from Tokyo Story of Ozu. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations his art, slightly altering them and keeping them about his film needs ?? Distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling that some viewers will have towards them, but does not describe the film itself, because the scenes remain with a long after the end of the film. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut chases his ex-wife at Istanbul airport, and looks at her with her new husband as they head aboard the plane that will remove her from her life forever. As he watches her, from afar, we see her catch only a glimpse of him looking at her. Will he leave your husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He pulls back behind a column and Nazan just turns his head to his future. Mahmut is his past, and she knows how to move better, keep moving. Mahmut will never understand it. Rarely do they get such moments of insight into themselves of life. That some viewers will get the movie, and that Ceylan gets his powers of creation, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as you move on it. Far, even if at the right length.
