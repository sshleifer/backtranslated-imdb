Both Disney and Bill Paxton have done a great job of conveying a story that is actually based. You don't have to love the game of golf to appreciate the story of a man's struggle to overcome adversity. It could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation involving the competition, even if this seems to be related to the Golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to see a little more depth in each of the main characters, esp. Mr Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his time, the turn of the century America, where the "class lines" are well defined and woe to anyone who deigns to try to rise above his standing "class". I did some historical research and my biggest question was actually satisfied, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are somewhat different from those portrayed in the film, I came up with a feeling of content. I really enjoyed this movie, I think you will too.
