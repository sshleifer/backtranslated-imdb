I saw this film for the first time just over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since then. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself an expert in classical cinema. A real diamond, shiny, raw. <br /> <br /> This jewel of a film revolves around Jon Voight (starring "Conrack") as a young teacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach children about the islands, all in one school. At the beginning, students reveal that they know very little about the world beyond their island. The heart of the film is Conrack who finds inspiration to awaken their young minds in the world around them. Students quickly reward their teacher with an impatience to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that, only a short time before, had been foreign to them. Conrack uses unconventional and intelligent teaching techniques that are, oh a little fun! God forbid. Learning and fun? Together? It cannot be, or so the perpetrators say. To avoid a spoiler, I just have to say that Conrack finds resistance with the chief man ... and the finish is really bittersweet. <br /> <br /> I am a 35-year-old white male with some teaching experience, so I should identify with the main character, Pat Conroy (aka, Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I don't, I identify with black children. As a child, I was sent to school from the other side of the city from 4th to 6th grade, around 1979. These guys in the movie remind me of my classmates back then. Fortunately, in 4th grade like 8 or 9 years, one does not understand racism. All I can remember is that we were all children, playing 4 paintings, kickball, hide-and-seek and relaying. <br /> <br /> This film is very moving. There are delicious and moving moments from beginning to end, without stopping. I found myself many times with tears in my eyes, then suddenly I laughed loudly. It's a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Run away from that winda !!" .... "Sir, if you are ready to accept disgust, I should tell you that that rabbit just did it on his lap" ... "So, you are the white teacher, Mr. Conrack, my great Mr. LOVE Mr. Conrack, a good-looking teacher, a handsome white man. "....." wind 15 mph from the east, small warning, small boats, beware, big boats, ok, don't worry about anything ".. . "not a cook, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a stock grower, but (something Latin) ... this is Latin ... wait!" .... "Conrack sings like a frog ... I sing well, why do you speak?! ". <br /> <br /> It still confuses me that I still don't hear anything about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following. I intend to look for more reviews, comments, background and "making of" curiosities, if they are out there. What amazes me is the acting given by untrained children. One of the children, Mary, I understand that she was an actress, and you can say it. However, other children have a lot of genuine lines and reactions. I wonder how they did it! I imagine that Conrack and Mary have a precise dialogue with which to work while some of the scenes take place in a natural or publicized way. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special film. In my opinion, it is one of the very few films that are so good AND so unknown. Others in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day at Black Rock ('55). I recommend them all. But first, sit in Mr. Conrack's class.
