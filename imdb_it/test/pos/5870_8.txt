This is a thoughtful film that reveals the inequalities of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, the rich and the poor. Robert Shaw does a deserving job in his role as Steven Ledbetter, the kind and correct driver, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) overcome her mental depression in the beginning. However, Steven has many mixed feelings about this lady of the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which is obviously going beyond the boundaries of the society that separates them. <br /> <br /> I have not read anything before this and I only judge the film as I saw it. I consider it a very honest story about the reality of everyday life and the conflict between what we want or expect from life and what we get. It's a nice drama that is worth reviewing.
