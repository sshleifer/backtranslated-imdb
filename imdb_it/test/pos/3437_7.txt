"Jaded" should not be considered an enerotic thriller because sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike films like "Indecent Behavior" or "Friend of the Family". <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not an easy watch as its history is difficult to conceive and is not so common in society. From the beginning of the film, with the first scene, you expect stronger scenes. <br /> <br /> The rape scene was not (in my opinion) a well-created scene. I think the director didn't use the whole camera techniques in the film. That's why it sometimes looks boring and almost boring towards the end. <br /> <br /> Performances are extremely good for all five female characters. These women gave strong, intense but credible performances that demonstrate the dramatic abilities of the actresses. <br /> <br /> Legal concepts have helped a lot to understand the difficulty of the plot because the legal term sodomy is different from a simple rape. From the perspective of Meg's defense, sodomy must be penalized as a rape (a huge degree of crime B) even if it is a different crime. Pat and Alex's defense says that Meg had fun and asked for it. This is where the film becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing certain is that the sex scene fits into the legal definition of a crime. <br /> <br /> Watch "Jaded" if you like legal problems that are not very common in your company. If not, try it because it is a very good and strong drama.
