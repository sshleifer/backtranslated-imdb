Is fantastic! A sick and twisted story of coincidences and deceptions. <br /> <br /> The story is meticulously and ingeniously constructed. It's really a perfect mix: it has everything from suspense to humor and the story is told with a lot of originality ... The film is built like a puzzle that is assembled piece by piece and solves the story ... For the spectator there is a lots of surprises until the end !! I also had a small impression that the director was inspired by a Hitchcock work. I have also seen films before where you see the same event happen from different points of view, but this film goes further. In this film everything is built on what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different position. Every actor in history has his secret and we come to make it in a way that helps to assemble the puzzle .... I especially loved the scenes of dark humor ... which made the whole theater laugh .... This movie is a must see for everyone!
