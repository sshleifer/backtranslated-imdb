This film was full of suspense and fun to watch. Since I'm a fan of this kind of film, I loved it. The premise is a bit scary, but the fact that I didn't rate this 10 was because the film was a bit exaggerated in some areas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: NO ONE could identify this girl? I understand the concept of isolating yourself but I find it hard to believe that SOMEONE-ANYBODY would not have been able to identify this girl as Angela Bennet. It was over the top and so was the scene where WALKED approached someone's desk and started writing. This was overall a really beautiful film, full of suspense and keeping your interest. Dennis Miller was fantastic as Allen, REALLY credible, Bullock was as good as the lonely computer worker that the bad guys underestimated. <br /> <br /> I think the premise of the movie was really different and scary. In today's times who knows what could happen? But some of the most important scenes prevented this film from being a 10.8 out of 10.
