This show has a surprising plot with good and recognizable actors (like the girl from Boston Legal and Boris the Butcher from Snatch). Even the extras and the child, which I thought from advertising, could be a weak link, they surprised me with its capabilities. It's just the little things that the director has to change. As the guy who makes the summary of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode must be fired. Having a narrator tells you what kind of ruins happened to the story. The only other small problem I had is that sometimes it takes too long to do things, but it's not as close as some shows like Prison Break. Does anyone know when they will resume the season ??
