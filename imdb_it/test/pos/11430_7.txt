Based on the novel The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea, in essence the story speaks of the slow friendship that develops between an Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who can be seen as the evil King in Prince Caspian, and was the protagonist in Bella Martha) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They actually set off on the wrong foot, with the first one reproaching him for his imprecise and slow translations of what he wanted to say to a Chinese delegate who had bought defective equipment. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rare these days, and that is to tell potential buyers in advance about the defects and the complexities that their purchase could bring, and since he is disturbed by the fact that the agreement went ahead, he takes time to create a component that can fix things. <br /> <br /> But it also means going to China in search of the elusive machine, which turns out to be well hidden and apparently disappeared without a trace. With Liu Hua's initial reluctant help, they set out on this treasure hunt from one city to another, which takes us to less-seen places in China, away from Beijings and Shanghais, in cities like Wuhan, with industrial bottoms like steel mills and nuclear power plants with their smoke stacks dotting the scenery. Even the mighty Yangtze River makes its appearance. Along the way, the usual symbols of such travelogue-style films come into play, such as learning about culture, ideals, food and, fundamentally, the understanding that the world is without strangers, if only one tries to connect. While some hints of romanticism are suggested between the two protagonists, there has rarely been a controversial point, until it is late in the film (hey, opposites attract, right?) <br /> <br /> In addition to the main industrial plants and factories, We see various kitchen industries, such as staplers working in sweat production environments, and I believe that also Cotton, along with the noodle production. As a film, he provided me with the opportunity to travel without leaving my place to observe and give him the credit for not having judged morally on exploitation and the like. And also the compliments for the film to engage in a dialogue based on the native languages ​​of the characters, rather than (and I will not name the names here) other films / intercultural collaborations in which dialogue is forced - nicknamed and made unnatural, and really annoying. Some might think that the secondary characters are too kind, always opening the arms and doors to a stranger, but I'd like to imagine that maybe in more rural areas, people in general tend to be more sincere, friendly and basically can't get caught in race for success to trample on others, or be trampled on. <br /> <br /> If there is a message to take away from the film, besides the fact that I have said that the world is without strangers, it is a reminder that some of the things that I consider important may not be so for others . Importance is something that places itself on something else, and its bases really depend on how we define the boundaries we set. So, given our limited duration, I think I should reduce myself a little more, live and let live, and sometimes bask in the illusion that ignorance can be bliss.
