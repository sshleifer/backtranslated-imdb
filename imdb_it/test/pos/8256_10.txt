This film is an almost forgotten gem from 1979, although in essence a comedy was based on one of the UK's biggest bank robbers. In fact one of the titles that this film is known includes "caper" so that in its being is an indication of the type of film. One of a group of adorable lipsticks, which are not the violent or psychotic types, who with their cheek and cunning do the greatest job in their lives. To be honest, I don't really know much about the real crime and I can't comment on whether it accurately described the events that took place or the characters involved. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan behaves very well playing PINKY Green and is very credible as a small American-born cheater who seems very comfortable. I have to add that sometimes American actors struggle well with British actors in a film made in England, chemistry is not always there, but this is not a problem for Jordon who fits his role perfectly. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that Jordan himself was probably one of the most undervalued actors of the 70s and 80s and never got the recognition he deserved. He seemed to be stuck in the supporting roles and in the B series films, not a correct representation of his acting ability. He played a corrupt cop in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE, a sadistic assassin in THE MEAN SEASON. In THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS he played a sort of comic character from Gordon Gehco and even in 1980, during the TV show EQUALIZER, he played a good guy. All this demonstrates the versatility of his acting skills as he mixes with the likes of David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this film he effortlessly plays his part as a little swindler the eye for women and immediately take his character and make it way from the beginning. Can't you please Green? ?? see that he really wanted to go straight, but once blackmailed everything seemed like an opportunity not to be missed and in the end he enjoyed the thought of all that money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is the boss and calls the shots, the police inspector was brilliantly played by Richard Johnson who generally played a London detective, but discreet but complete, who clearly loves his work. The other supporting casts don't say too much, but looking at them they were all well-known actors of British characters who often found themselves playing bad guys or cops (it's not ironic). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias do what they have to do and it's nice to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role. <br /> <br /> For some viewers, particularly Americans, it would seem ridiculous that someone with the Greens record can do a maintenance job of all things a bank and come and go when they like. Moreover, the acrobatics that he threw in court after the sentence was not as risky as it might seem, in the 60s and 70s security was not as strong as now. <br /> <br /> the film itself there are a couple of interesting observations. With little time scammers the loot here was too much. There have been other films in which this also occurs, namely THE BRINKS MAT. It is not just the disposal or the hiding place of the loot, but with so many people involved someone will be inattentive, about to chat or simply break once leaning. Moreover, the authorities are harshly hurling local rouges when such a robbery is carried out. Furthermore, they say that there is no honor among the thieves, but Ivan was categorical that PINKY had his shot. You had even looked at his eyes on the dock, if the appearance could kill, a look of total betrayal! How could he have made them all breastfeed after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself a question because this is how scammers can be so stupid? Did Green really think he could safely talk about his suspicion for the second time? Inspector Watford was not entirely deceived by his innocent face and a well-constructed alibi, the whole caper stank of internal work. Also you have to ask yourself why they leave so many clues? A notepad with annotated security numbers, travel brochures for trips abroad, still leaving his telescope around and unusual behavior on the day of the robbery that was out of character. <br /> <br /> With some decent but sensible police work Insp Watford quickly took the measure of Green, picked it up and soon made it sing like a canary. It simply shows how, despite a well thought-out planning, things can be dealt with very quickly, there is never a clean escape for every body, someone is always caught. Although it is worth emphasizing that much of the money has never been recovered. <br /> <br /> All in all a fun movie, interesting shots of London and England in the late 70s, well paced, with a fantastic ending. I highly recommend this especially if you like capers. (Note: I recently bought a DVD but the transfer was obviously taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality, so don't pay too much!)
