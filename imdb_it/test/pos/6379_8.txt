I think it was back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the newspapers that one of the theaters was playing 'teen deviyan'. We decided to go just for the taste without hoping for something big. But we were in for a pleasant surprise. The film was made in 1965, but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and at the forefront of the times. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a raised city looked and acted best. I still remember that feeling of joy when we left the theater after the movie was finished. <br /> <br /> Who thought of this story of a man who falls in love with three very different girls at the same time? No, he doesn't have three times or they deceive them, but he really likes all three for different reasons. One is home, one is an actress and the third is a high-society girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is what the 'One' is for him. What makes the situation worse is that they too are all like him. When things reach an impasse, a hypnotist takes it and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each of them and reaches the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream of his, which is the only color part in an otherwise black-n-white film is the crux of the film, but surprisingly is modified by most of the versions available today. If you want to watch this movie, make sure this part is intact. If you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.
