This mini series is iconic of the Australian spirit. While there may be what are perhaps considered conspicuous inconsistencies, the film portrays a spirit that is unique in Australia and that should be appreciated. If anything, this mini-series demonstrates the Australian sense of humor. The ability to laugh in a supremely ridiculous way. Our willingness to laugh even in the most difficult situations. While much of this series focuses on mateship and how humor can be used as a means of survival, it also has elements of drama that evoke real emotions. The main actors that appear are absolutely sensational and very convincing in their different roles. Capturing the essence of their characters perfectly. This mini series should be mandatory for all Australians.
