I started watching this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something missing on television, especially for shows for children. My five-year-old nephew (like most children) would simply look at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other kind of handicap but after watching Pelswick it seemed to be a normal event for him. Whenever he saw a wheelchair he simply said "Like Pelswick" and went on with what he was originally doing. And yes, the animation is a bit rough, but if you can watch the Simpsons' first season, it's not so bad. The "Genius" is actually an angel who is there to help Pelswick learn the lessons of life. NOT a walk someone else said he could walk a little, I saw every episode and he never walked for my memory, he is a paraplegic who has no armpit feelings (he mentions it in an episode). As for humor, if you can get a copy of the episode "Ntalented", which blares the boy-bands, you will immediately love this show.
