This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner offer performances that hurt, sound good and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story, this is not much spoiler. But I wanted to change the result, even if it's right for the story, because I had already come to take care of these people. I can only think of some short films that have had this effect on me. Beautifully filmed, recited, modified. The high caliber works all around, even with the use of the right sound and / or music to advance the story. The end-of-credit song finished the job, tearing me even more emotions. This is first class from start to finish. Congratulations to the writer / director and everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a movie in the comments section. I promised to do it in exchange for a copy of the DVD. The review could be good or bad, just my honest opinion. This is and is the least I can do. I'm so happy to have seen it.
