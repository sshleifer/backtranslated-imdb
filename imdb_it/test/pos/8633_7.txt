Having read so much negative press on this film over the years, I've always avoided it, but the advent of the public domain DVD encouraged me to finally give it a vision. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was transferred from a poor copy. The modern prequel, shot on colored broth, is blurred and the contrast, non-existent. The faces are occasionally difficult to understand. That said, the current story is fun and Lou presents himself as an established actor, much more than in many children's movies. <br /> <br /> Once the film passes into the story of "Jack", the film switches to "color" and I use that term freely. Most shades are orange or brown. The greens seem particularly ugly. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford in the role of "Polly", the maid of the giant, was a big plus for me, since I really liked her in an "Andy Hardy" appearance. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments attributed to the actual quality of the press, I'm still happy to give this movie a 7. It gave me a lot of laughs and this is more than most of the comedies I've seen decades can be managed. <br /> <br /> One to see if you can.
