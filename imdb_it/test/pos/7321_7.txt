Directed by the younger brother of the great director Leo McCarey, this is a nice short from the Three Stooges, nominated for an Academy Award. Here the henchmen are doctors named Howard, Doctor Fine and Doctor Howard. They are not the brightest doctors but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they deal with duty and humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked this short. It is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though. A joke that is repeated several times always works. The part where the head of the hospital must work is terrifying. To say the other would like to spoil some jokes, so you have to see it alone. Just another purpose apart from the Three marmittoni.
