i hate vampire movies. with that said, this was very interesting to me. I want to emphasize one thing. "bakjwi" literally means bat in Korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see counting Dracula or vampires turning into bats and flying away or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly, so many categorize them as "exceptional". As I watched the film, I realized that the bat theme is more deeply rooted in this film than just creating the vampire-bat connection. <br /> <br /> The duality of human nature = if you've ever read Aesop's fables, there's this fairy tale in which mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just doesn't seem to side with it and try to exploit both sides to your advantage. Mammals and birds discover what this bat has done and banish the bat from their lands at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> the two contradictory sides of human nature are constantly fighting for the entire film ex. the blind priest of sang-hyun, the effort of sang-hyun to satisfy the thirst and his sexual desire, tae-ju that plays both sides, his ordinary boring life against his exciting adventure of vampires, etc. (it won't ruin you too much, you have to watch the movie) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, you call it! <br /> <br /> I feel like many find this movie boring and too long, but this movie is very fresh and new, something I haven't seen yet. I wouldn't say this is the best job in CW Park, but it's mos. def. the strangest to understand and yet intriguing obscure!
