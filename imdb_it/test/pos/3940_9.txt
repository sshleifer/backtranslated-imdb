Exclusively for Coop lovers, even if Clint Eastwood is very strong, even if the discreet presence is a great advantage of this excellent documentary. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.), as a older man, finally as a sick man and near death. After "the end", I didn't feel that I knew the man much better. But I had a great time, reviewing many of the best moments of his films; and my respect for the talented actor and the great professional has increased tenfold. The film shows, very interestingly, how Cooper's career can be paralleled with the evolution of American society before and after the Second World War. Two of the great moments are the times when Cooper must answer for justice on communism in the world of cinema; and when James Stewart (also very large) received an award for Cooper one month before his death. I'm not a dish in tears, but ... that was close! Look at it, if you can: it's really worth it. ... If you love Cooper, that is. Or an old America ...
