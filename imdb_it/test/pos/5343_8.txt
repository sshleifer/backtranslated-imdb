The boys of Aardman have made a fresh, cute and wild adaptation of their short films by Wallace and Gromit to characterize, like the man and his dog, the inventors who seem to have more intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. In this case they invented a machine capable of catching all the rabbits that are eating the crops in a quiet English village. Especially for Mrs. Tottington (or "Totty" for those who are "intimate"), much to the sorrow of Victor Quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trusted gun. Wallace and Gromit seem to succeed with their car, but Wallace has a mix up: a car he made to do more food suddenly crosses over with a rabbit - the curse is on! <br /> <br /> Much of this is the most carefree fun that a children's movie could require, but also its hat to the oldest tradition in the classic cartoon slapstick: Looney Tunes, which in turn is in debt with very silent comedy and vaudeville. Of course, the Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a lot of tricks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. It is never less amazing to see how they use stop motion, even when a joke or a gag could be a bit on the funny side "ho-ho" is not funny "ha-ha" (a tired criticism but I will "I'll say it ) The curse of Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the public, in its twisted and sudden story plunge into its exposure (the story of Golden Bullet is stupid), Park and Box and company never lose sight of the joy in the material br /> <br /> It is blurry and warm and completely off-the-wall for children (even the little ones will love adventures and strange gadgets, like the truck that Wallace and Gromit drive around), and for adults, there are little barbs of funky and absurd tones in the middle of a classic English farce, only (and probably are a minority opinion here) compared to Chicken Run it's a little negligible work - there's less plot that a series of racing gags, and of course many word games that co involve rabbits, monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with ego in their guns like the Fiennes expressed Quartermaine). But when it hits better, it's one of the funniest films of 2005. It makes me smile when it happens on TV.
