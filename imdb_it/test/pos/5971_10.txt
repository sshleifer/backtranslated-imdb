If you have the chance, see this Russian (what should I call them: gems, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War films like this, or The auroras here are quiet, or Proverka na dorogah ... And, immediately after, look to new American war films, or international productions, those with allies and Germans, etc. Or worse, watch Italian war movies. Everything from the west will seem superficial, invented, ridiculous, compared to Russian films. I am incredibly stunned by the quality of the aforementioned Russian war films that I can't find the words to praise enough their overwhelming superiority over Anglo-Saxon war movies.
