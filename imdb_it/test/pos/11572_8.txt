"Tesis", "Open your eyes" and "The others" were proof of the talent and skill of Amenabar as a director, but (in my humble opinion) they were also imperfect films in their attempt to outsmart the public, always offering a round of scrub too, favoring chills at low cost, twists and turns of depth and resonance. Fortunately for everyone, Amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending, focusing on the characters and the emotional bonds that bind them. <br /> <br /> The result is a small miracle of a film, beautifully written, photographed, marked, recited and directed. All those involved in this film offer an exceptional performance, behind and in front of the cameras, with a wonderful cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film an incredible authenticity) to the exquisite Aguirresarobe lensing . <br /> <br /> The film effectively attacks many important issues and emotions, faces the heart and mind with equal power and offers a final blow that stays with you long after the credits are launched. This is a brilliantly realized film that will not only be a landmark in Spanish cinema, but it will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens up abroad (Sony Classics paid a $ 6 million record to distribute it) enter the Oscar race ... There is no way to stop Amenabar ... <br /> <br /> Buen trabajo, Alejandro!
