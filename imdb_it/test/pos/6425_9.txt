A very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is an elegant example of the powerful Italian film production of the 1970s. And Luigi Bazzoni, an underrated director and a visually fantastic 'author'. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints, especially in its sad and dramatic ending! Florinda Bolkan offers an excellent performance, full of nuances and moving sensitivity, managing to portray a dark woman who is not only charming, but also painfully real and tragically lonely. But the cast of everyone is also a pleasure! Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (the mysterious little boy on the beach), the Italian screen legend Caterina Boratto and the beautiful and beautiful movie queen B Evelyn Stewart in the short but disturbing role of the protagonist's friend! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! It is curious to note how incredibly well made films like Footprints have been! The moody and disturbing cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, stylized settings and settings, the obsessive plot of Nicola Piovani and first of all the story, so intense and disturbing, so intelligently stratified and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements, but above all with a soul and a personal vision. I wish films like Footprints weren't forgotten! I wish the films were as perceptive and personal today as they were in the 60s / 70s! And yes ... I want someone to make a digitally remastered widescreen DVD from this little masterpiece soon!
