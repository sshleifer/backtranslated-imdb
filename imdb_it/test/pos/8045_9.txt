This film really shows that the world is too often an unfair place, especially the film world. "The Assignment" has not received any attention on its release and has not been surprisingly flopped at the box office, but when the story is written this film will surely receive a long lost praise. <br /> <br /> Thank God I am surrounded by friends who know what is good for me. Being a movie buff like me, a friend highly recommended "The Assignment", a film I hadn't even heard of. I decided to take a look at what Leonard Maltin gave, and not surprisingly he gave it ** 1/2. Knowing that this is the same degree that gave the classics such as "Alien", "The Usual Suspects" and "The Matrix" (no joke), I knew that its meaning did not mean backside squat jack s ***. So without hesitation I went out and bought it on DVD. This was about 3 years ago and the film is still one of my proudest objects in my DVD collection, despite a cover project that echoes a low-budget mess with Casper Van Dien. <br /> <br /> "The Assignment" is cleverly directed, offering some really intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie, in addition to this it boasts a sometimes brilliant story that you know will be full of shots of unexpected scene. He plays Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances and offers great support from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, both in good shape. <br /> <br /> Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie, many of them don't seem to praise them enough. So what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a fan of action thrillers, you should have bought it, rented it, seen yesterday!
