Certainly not a great show, but it is better than most other sitcoms available at the moment. Remember shows like Married With Children and Roseanne going to places not traditionally treated in sitcoms. Sometimes it's fun even if you ignore the traces of laughter, but it's not hilarious. <br /> <br /> Some characters are quite funny (the gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. This is also one of the few shows in which the soliloquy of the characters (I'm sorry for the slaughtered handwriting) is effectively effective and fun. <br /> <br /> Is it an All in the Family or Seinfeld show? Absolutely not. However, it's definitely better than a show like 'Til Deat (probably the worst TV show of any kind at the moment). <br /> <br /> Oh and mom is not too ugly and Hilary's character is a little hottie.
