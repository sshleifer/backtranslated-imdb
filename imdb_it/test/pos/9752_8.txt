I found this educational film, funny and very moving. I was impressed when I heard about how judge Arbor contributed during his time in Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is very underrated and it's nice to see her again in a Canadian production. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City.) <br /> <br /> Although the plot of this film may not be entirely real, it left me wanting to know more on the word of Arbor. A great movie to inspire young women. <br /> <br /> I say that the film is a "must see".
