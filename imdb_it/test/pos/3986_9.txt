This is a brilliant film. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal plays an agent who can convince anyone to do anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and he talks to his father, who is a rabbi in eating pork (you film lovers might know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is primarily a talent scout and is trying to find a suitable villain for his latest film. After discovering that the whole film has a terrible team, he accidentally falls into a small river. Believing he is dead, some huge hands come out to reach him. Later he thinks he is in heaven. He finds out that he is not, but that he is in a monastery. Believing that God has saved him, he becomes a monk, looking for those who saved him. He later found a 7 foot 7 man, who cast as perfect villain (also Shakespeare recites!). Watch the movie and discover the rest!
