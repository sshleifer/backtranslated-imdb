Hardware Wars is a hilarious 12-minute parody of the original Star Wars movie that was released a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This movie uses home appliances like spaceships and Star Wars-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable laughter. This film has won many film festival awards and was the film that inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie called "Spaceballs". <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
