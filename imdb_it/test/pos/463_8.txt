I just watched this movie at Birmingham's Sidewalk Film Festival, AL, which was actually a really fun festival, and it was swept away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day from a long shot. A school aged prostitute meets with a middle-aged man and tries to end the deep depression together. It is an inner look into the darker parts of human sexuality. The story stems from real life events, torn directly from the headlines. A raw and frank dialogue and a murderous turn to the end. The film contains graphic sexual dialogues and nudity. Definitely not suitable for children. Too depressing for some people's tastes. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though.
