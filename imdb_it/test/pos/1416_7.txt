A short history of time. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, the thoughts they provoke and the man ... brilliant. Yet I had difficulty enjoying this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way in which family members and professors are interviewed feels so unnatural. These members were interviewed on specially constructed sets and were uncomfortable. Mostly, their reports have been interpreted very effectively and directly. The (deliberate) non-inclusion of questions posed manipulates the information provided in a very hard and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is responsible for the interview, but he did a terrible job and with it he took away the visual experience. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is still a fascinating documentary that is worth seeing, if only for the interesting concepts presented.
