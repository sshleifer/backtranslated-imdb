Since there have been so many reviews of this beautiful film, I'll write as a list and try to solve the problems that haven't been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 years old when shooting this film. His character according to the script was in his mid-1920s. Andrews, a very underrated actor, brilliantly played a character who should have been much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredric March, like all BIG actors, sometimes needs to be held back by the director to avoid exaggerated acting. He was attacking the cameras when he was drunk the night after his arrival and also the next morning, when he was checking his lock in the mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was superb in "Laura", "The Ox-Bowl incident", "A Walk in the Sun", "The Purple Heart" and many other films. Why did Fredric March win the Oscar and why was Dana Andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance I've ever seen from a non-actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I realize it was the 40s but Dana Andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the right-wing bigot, became famous years later for playing the sheriff on "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> 7. The southern professor wrote that the film was slow, boring and malfunctioning. The professor is more than likely not informed about classic films. The beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow character studies that avoid swear words, excessive violence and free sex. <br /> <br /> *** I was surprised that zero people out of 3 found my review helpful.
