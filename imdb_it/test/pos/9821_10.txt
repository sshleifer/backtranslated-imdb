A film for a mature and cultured audience ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" in a preliminary screening just before its release in North America. This romantic drama was a real show. I'm sure this story won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's dark premise. But the photo has some very encouraging strengths in his favor. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford's All-time Box Draw ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The Fugitive", "Air Force One," "Patriot Games") is on top to his game as the officer of internal affairs, hard and desperate, Dutch. Ford's very subtle and nuanced performance shows enough the range he can achieve with class and determination to bring the public into his world of loss and betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and a very different kind of film for Harrison Ford to beautify the screen with his action blockbusters. Harrison Ford returns to action next year, first for director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump", "Back To The Future") in the summer 2000 thriller, "What Lies Beneath", and later in the year in Tom Clancy's film adaptation "The Sum Of All Fears". 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third release as CIA's Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> The director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "The Firm", "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this a political adviser to the congresswoman of Scott-Thomas. It is a very strong and energetic portrait for Pollack. Sydney Pollack is not only a talented director, he is also one of the most credible, natural and fascinating actors (see also "Eyes Wide Shut"). <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," The Horse Whisperer ", shows that it is not necessary to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her best films, and offers a performance tremendously elaborate and sweet that works well beyond Ford's tenacity. <br /> <br /> The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving the investigation of Ford's character on police bribery. effective by the actor of "Heat", Dennis Haysbert, who plays the detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in the Dutch police corruption investigation. <br /> <br /> The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful beloved Charles S. Dutton (whose long awaited starring role in the film) goes on to prove himself one of the best leading actors, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals the m update some of his scenes with the wonderful one, a charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of the Pollack thriller is at the top. From Dave Grusin (Pollack, "The Firm"), surreal jazz soundtrack, to Philippe Rousselot ("A River Runs Through It"), sharp photography, to the strong editing that keeps the film cool, despite the unfortunate premise of the film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to all those who appreciate a good yarn of mystery, stimulating storyline, stories animated by the characters and romance in a single solution. This is a fantastic story about betrayal and forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet moving, and certain controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. "Random Hearts" is certainly one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 on ****) or (8.5 on 10.0)
