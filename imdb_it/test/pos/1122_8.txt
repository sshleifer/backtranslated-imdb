This is a decent effort for a B-Movie martial arts actor. Ian Jacklin, a former champion of Kickboxing of the North American crossover weight, is the protagonist and engages well in the action scenes. The muscular Matthias Hues has the chance to add more to his evil Martial Arts character in this film than all his many others and if you're a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film. He immediately starts with the attitude, but soon warms up to the hero and they do "The beast with two backs" in a very elegant way. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are good in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with the added realism of having Benny "The Jet" Urquidez who plays himself as John Larson's ( Jacklin). <br /> <br /> All in all this movie seems to have more storylines than most of its genre so you get more than one story.
