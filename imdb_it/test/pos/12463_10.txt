There is no doubt that this version of Tarzan is the closest to Burroughs' vision. While he gladly collected his copyrights from films produced during his life, he often indicated that they were little more than the bastards of his stories. The ridiculous obsession of the film studios to launch Olympic swimmers like Tarzan was extremely ridiculous. I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky that they didn't set eyes on shots. <br /> <br /> Before this film, the most faithful adaptations were in comics and comics. As satisfying as some of these were, we had to wait seven decades for a director with the integrity to respect the character as it was created.
