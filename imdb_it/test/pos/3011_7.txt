I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How surprised I was! This is a fantastic, beautiful and twisted film that will give your mind a good workout! It's not easy If you only like Police Academy movies, mindless, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep and complex film with influences from films like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with many completely new ideas. Wonderful twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story make this one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Be open and you will love it!
