I had to take this movie, since it didn't arrive where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth it. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint could be seen, as they also worked together in the Harry Potter films. The woman who plays her overbearing and upright mother really convinced me, and how hypocritical she is, I think she did a great job in the role. I just hope we could have seen the sex scene in reality or otherwise. LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination about how it went down. (chuckles) I thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want to see a good movie. Rent this movie. I have to say that Rupert did a really good job and it's good to see he's shooting movies outside of Harry Potter, even though I love him totally like Ron Weasley. The whole cast did a great job and I hope Rupert continues to act outside of Harry Potter to expand his skills!
