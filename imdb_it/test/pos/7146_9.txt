This film was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most incredible scripts ever written. It is well executed, recited and directed. Cinematography is a bit dark for my taste, but I'm sure it would have been. The script is like poetry in parts of the film, I found myself pausing through the film to reflect on the comments I just made on the screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will go through it and add reviews. Well warning though this was a film of 6 fabrics for me. Very moving. Strong performance.
