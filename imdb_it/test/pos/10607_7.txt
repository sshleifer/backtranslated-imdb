If you've ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know they're longer than most movies because of the multiple song and dance sequences (each has a duration of over five minutes). Fortunately, this has fewer songs and choreographies and adapts to the length of the "standard" movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but they tend to advance quickly through the song and the dance parts. I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as big as I hoped, he still had a good amount of time on the screen. And his character was very different from his other roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a good movie. Like most Bollywood films, there is at least one element of controversy / conflict in traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and a happy ending is had by all.
