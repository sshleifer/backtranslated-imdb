The film was fantastic. If you're a fan of Bams, jackass videos, or his Viva la Bam show, you can't help but like yourself. I have some friends who are not fans who liked it, and others who thought it wasn't great. Those who didn't like it were mostly female friends, they didn't really appreciate a bit of the rough humor, which I personally think made the movie so funny. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was shot in Bams' hometown, which includes many of his regularly visited locations. The cast of is composed of all his friends and phone mates, and also includes some pro skateboarders of great name. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with the music of HE. In my opinion, Haggard has everything. A fantastic plot, characters you will never see anywhere else. A lot of great music humor and a cast that was dedicated to the project.
