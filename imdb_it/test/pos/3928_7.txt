I don't think this film deserves the low grade that most will give it. It's one of the best "teen" horror movies I've ever seen; and this is saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to support it, the characters and the plot break countless stereotypes of horror films, and it has nothing to do with other horrible pieces we've been subjected to lately. (A clear example is the unreasonable "Saint Ange".) The first 30-40 minutes could be decidedly boring except for the beginning, although some small errors of light can easily be detected. However, after arriving at the village, the horror - a different and twisted type of horror - begins. <br /> <br /> With the plot and the details, the jokes are minor; the characters are the strong point of this film, since there are so many clich√©s. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are not at all the idiotic types we are used to; even if Dalton could adapt better to this stereotype, he is not the only one to pay for this lack of conscience. Some scenes are really, satisfyingly horrible, recovering moments of tension scattered throughout the film. And, in the end, and although everything is explained decisively, it is easy to see that things will not go so easily to the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> The only errors I can see that do not imply continuity (IE, Carly who does not find his finger cut in the pockets of Bo unaware) is lighting, which is somewhat annoying during the first, boring 30 minutes. Although, due to its texture and effects, everything is drastically and cruelly distorted with the arrival of the main characters in Ambrosia, that small village in the middle of nowhere, so I'll give it. It has been practically said that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a whole house of wax?", "Where do they get the wax from?" These questions would not be raised if people paid more attention to the film. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; their mother worked making real wax figures, and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario in which the unfortunate character of Paris Hilton meets his untimely death is the answer to the second question; what about all the personal objects (cell phones, cars, clothes) of the dead? Using their third brother as a connection to the outside, it is practically questionable that the Sinclair twins should get the money needed to buy the wax, in a type of World War II fashion. <br /> <br /> So aside from that, I think the film deserves much more than it can get and no one should miss the chance to see it. So go see the House of Wax. Right now.
