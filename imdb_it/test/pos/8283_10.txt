This was one of the best movies you could find as a child. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years to 8 years. The story of this film was: Dave is on a business trip to Europe and attacks the boys with Miss Miller. While playing a tour of the world in the 80-day video game, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), run the Chipmunks and Chipettes in an adventure where children have to fly in a balloon all over the world. What they are unaware of is that the "game" is actually a diamond smuggling ring. And when they are found at the airport by criminals, a hunt follows! And that ends up in Klaus and Claudia in prison and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But I warn you now, this is a musical and pretty damn good. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people, I enjoy loving musicals like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Do not Dance and pretty much anything (except My Fair Lady). If you see it, share it with your children (if you have any)!
