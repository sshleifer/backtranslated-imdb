In the interview with Hitchcock's Trittaut, it is evident that the police's fear of Big Al dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a ticket. The note said: "It was bad, imprisoned for an hour". The police are obliged and since then Hitchcock has had a profound fear of being unjustly accused and brought by the police. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is probably one of the best in its "wrongly accused" series. The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. It is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She has always been fascinated by intelligent criminals. <br /> <br /> The opening of Hitchcock is very strong and brings you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines, a famous tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the aspiring criminal. The two boys share a chemistry that in that day and age was probably much more than what the public could chew. Bruno tries to convince Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (without leaving clues), if the victims change. Bruno would kill Guy's wife who would not grant him a divorce and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The reasons are respectively love and money. <br /> <br /> Bruno's performance is designed to be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that was done by accident. In fact, Hitchcock has edited two versions of the film: a US one, a British one. In the American version, the volume of Bruno's seductiveness was lowered a little. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is a very deep film but, above all, this is another excellent Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of an electrifying scene is when Guy goes up the steps to Bruno's father's room. Hitchcock thought that the attention of the public should be distracted at this point so that they would not understand what Guy will find in the room. Hitch treats us of a huge threatening dog at the top of the stairs that provided the necessary distraction. <br /> <br /> The most famous shot of the film occurs during a tennis match. Bruno continued to persecute Guy so that Guy could fulfill his part of the pact (kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all the heads turn back and forth. All but one - Bruno. He's looking straight at Guy with an "I'll get get" smile. <br /> <br /> The ending is another example of suspense. Both men fight for a key test on a carousel that is spinning at full speed. A worker crawls down to get to the checks. When we finally come down from this race and the film ends with Guy demonstrating his innocence, we are left exhausted and without nails (for those of us who still bite their nails!). <br /> <br /> "Foreigners on a train" is easily one of Hitchcock's best "wrongly accused" films. Some attribute it to one of the best villains (Bruno). All in all, the film may seem a little dated, but this is a lesson in the production of a master thriller. I will not abandon Leonardo if he came to teach me Renaissance painting, so you shouldn't either. <br /> <br /> << Review published on FilmDailies.com >>
