I've heard interesting critics about this film. I thought it was a love story, but I wasn't sure what the plot was. So when I finally saw it, I found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex-con Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and the drug addict Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So a love story but probably not what I expected. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Isabel as she struggles to return to society. He doesn't want to go back to his neighborhood and finds himself without a home or place to go. So, while she experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from prison, she meets Rufo, an old acquittal of her who, while at home, had become a drug addict and lived on the streets. Having no place to go, and with no real money or sources of income, he decides to join Rufo in his residence: a covered area on a lonely street. <br /> <br /> The story alone is moving. It explains how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo deepens until the final turn of the film. <br /> <br /> Surely, the film deserves to be seen. Sebastián Haro is splendid in his role as a drug addict. A person able both to be an innocent and tender person and a scum of ruthless street. Only depending on who treats it. I believe his role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I don't believe enough in the role of Isabel Ampudia. Although the film tries to show the bitterness inside her through different scenes, she can't make me believe. It's too sweet and too honest for which one might expect someone to be in the same situation. <br /> <br /> The film tries to show a love in a desperate situation. It's a funny movie. But the feeling I feel when the film ends is that Isabel, with her way of thinking and acting, would never have come to that situation. His role, partly because of the script, partly because of acting is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the ending, which is why I raised my score by one or two points. I liked his bittersweet and the fact that he showed that sometimes the survival instinct is above other spiritual considerations like love. <br /> <br /> In summary, an interesting film, but lacking a punch to be a total "to see".
