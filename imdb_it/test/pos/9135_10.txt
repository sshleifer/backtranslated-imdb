Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I only recently met (I need to see Bob le Flambeur and Le Samourai again to catch them completely), but looking at Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, apparently based on Buddhism) realized that I was looking at how a skilful detective film I had seen in quite some time. Although his film has a dialogue, it is mainly to keep the scenes of the film roll along, adhering to the plot. What kept me alert, even in seemingly trivial scenes / sequences, was the emphasis on character movements, or behavior patterns. Melville has exposed his story, and is careful to take his time to say it (this may seem boring to some, but it seems to work because it puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters / environments on the plot). <br /> <br /> Look anyway at each of the four protagonists: Alain Deleon in the role of Corey (just released from prison, who designed a new robbery), Gian Maria Volonte in the role of Vogel (on the run and fleeing custody by hand, he meets Corey thankfully), Yves Montand as Jansen (an elderly professional with many years of experience with weapons, a friend of Vogel), and Andre Bourvil in the role of Mattei (an experienced investigator, who is looking for Vogel , and on toes with internal affairs). Each of these actors plays their parts with precision, detachment, and each of them has their own types of moments that indicate to the public what their personalities could be as criminals and policemen. The robbery sequence gives little hint, for example, how the cops feel outside a female statue as they go through the halls, or how Jansen pulls out a flask and has only a breath of content (and what a dream this is boy creates). Even Corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. <br /> <br /> How compelling and compelling the story becomes, and how the skills had to make it (through the filmmaker Henri Decae, the editing and the soundtrack by Eric Demarsan), it's the people on the screen who get the charm, in the way they remain faithful to their nature and their ideals. It's not a must-see movie for French fans of the new wave, and modern crime film fans might want to spend 140 minutes immersing themselves in the atmosphere of Melville's work. A sweet piece of film that is still one of my all-time favorites.
