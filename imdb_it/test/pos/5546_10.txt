This is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but unconventional. Cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an oversized castle in the suburbs with a good-looking husband who is not a prince. Find his prince, but he is not so handsome. Instead of a castle, at least initially, he gets a tiny walk-up in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a cast of fully accomplished, if somewhat exaggerated, characters. <br /> <br /> Demme reaches the highest level of film making in my mind. Create a world where I want to move - a Manhattan neighborhood and a street life full of life and community. <br /> <br /> I would like IMDb linked to other reviewers comments. I would like to know what other films the people who have developed this hatred. I'm always looking for lots of laughs and nice places to "live" for at least an hour or so.
