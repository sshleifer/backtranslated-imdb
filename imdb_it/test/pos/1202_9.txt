HAIR's 1979 film musical was loosely based on the infamous 1960s Broadway musical that became famous due to its infamous nude scene. The stage musical is not much more than a group of skits accompanied by some funny musical number; however for the director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers took the basic premise of the game and the score and built a true story to make the show more user friendly "for the big screen. In the film, the naive farmer Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is about to join the army and decides to spend a couple of days in New York where he meets a group of old hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus ) that involved him in a group of crazy mishaps, including the search for a snobbish girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is divided into a series of cartoons ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime, but they are all beautifully photographed with an intelligent use of the locations of New York and musical numbers imaginatively on stage (exceptionally choreographed by the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams lights up the screen as Berger, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie who does his best to convince Claude to relax and acts as the backdrop for a scene by Savage in the role of Claude, who brings an enchanting sweetness to the role of Claude . Annie Golden is a charmer like Jeannie, the pregnant hippy pregnant with Wright or Daco, she doesn't know what his father is and doesn't seem to care. There is an exceptional musical number after another here ... "Aquarius" is a tour through Central Park that includes dancing horses ... Treat Williams interrupts a dinner party in "I Got Life" ... "Black Boys / White Boys "presents the late Nell Carter and Ellen Foley who brings out the ethnic virtues of men and" Easy to be Hard "is a powerful rendering of one of the show's best songs by the original cast member Cheryl Barnes, who plays the former girlfriend and mother of Wright of his son. It is a journey of a beautifully photographed, sung, sung and danced psychedelic film that must be seen and, once seen, will initiate more visions as this dazzling has much to offer to capture everything in one projection.
