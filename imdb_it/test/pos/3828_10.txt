I just thought of adding another observation here. While there are a couple of visual subtitles, in this episode, to the possibility of unspoken feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special moment, physically tender, towards the end. When the Enterprise is reversing its emergency warp speed in an attempt to overcome a possible Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing its head on Jim's compassionate shoulder while they observe the instrument that attacks their impending fate on the main viewer. I thought it was sweet (and Janice, of course, is beautiful!). <br /> <br /> (P.Sof Goof: - Several times, presumably while shooting the phasors, the film shows the photon torpedoes being launched)
