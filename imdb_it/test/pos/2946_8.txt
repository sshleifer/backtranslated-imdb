A fascinating fragment of a documentary about the life of a husband and a wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son. We all like to think that our parents lived a happy life, that their marriages were full of contentment, love and happy memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this is not the case with their families and their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the lens of the camera and the emotional perspective of the son of a family who has just experienced the death of his mother. The son is a documentary filmmaker who filmed his senior family for many years because he claims "posterity". Three months after his mother's death, his father remarries with his long secretary. The suddenness of this event stuns the family and pushes the child to dig into the past lives of his mother and father. What it reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two fairly common people who, like so many of their generation, got married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they discovered they only had to "make do". A wife who has found herself sometimes bitterly alone and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work. She is intellectually, she is a much simpler individual who seems to find most of her pleasures in the quiet solitude of work. They are obviously wrong for each other, this is clear. Yet they attack him for what? Well, that's part of the mystery, they clearly show mutual affection sometimes if ever so much love. You will not find any truly shocking revelation here, apart from the infidelity of both parties, which in large part is what makes this jewel. You really have the feeling that these could be your parents if the circumstances were different and in fact you put a question about the lives of your own parents.
