I knew nothing about this movie before watching it. It seems to be a lesser known youth horror of the 1980s. What struck me were the ways in which they differed from many other films of that era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was the slowness with which this film was created. It does not have the typical configuration of showing the characters that are killed one by one. It takes time to build the story, leaving a little mystery about what could happen. I was almost starting to think that nobody would really get hurt in this movie. But everything leads to the climatic sequence in the last 15 minutes, and then it becomes quite graphic (this was a bad time to have a snack - I almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started). <br /> <br /> The characters also seem slightly more three-dimensional than many of the scary movies for low-cost teenagers. The conversations were mostly of a good standard, in contrast to the exaggerated stereotypes you would expect. For example, the girl who is the famous, snobbish, queen-bee of the clique does not constantly insult everyone, but is able to have doubts and show some consideration for others. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, I felt that this film was a bit original compared to what I expected, and even a little better. He attracted me, kept me interested, and then let me do it. As I said, it's pretty bloody during the finale, but almost for the whole family for the rest of the time. I don't need to own it, but I'm glad I found out.
