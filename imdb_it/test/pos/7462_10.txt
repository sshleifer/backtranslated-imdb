This is a great movie. I read the brief synopsis and was not impressed, but as I watched him (mainly for Caroline Dhavernas) he grew up with me. <br /> <br /> It's a nice change to see a movie where girls / young women are not punished for their sexuality. Girls are given the full license to explore and even the possibility of making mistakes without ridiculous repercussions. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are absolutely hilarious - and many of them are presumably erotic scenes - which were not over the top or in bad taste. The male characters in the film were fantastic - David Boreanaz was as big as the fickle fickle - and what's great is that the movie doesn't make us hate so much. Even the other two younger male characters were good, without being intrusive. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen the girls grow and it's quite empowering to see how they realize their mistakes but eventually move on and continue with their lives rather than dragging their mistakes along their.
