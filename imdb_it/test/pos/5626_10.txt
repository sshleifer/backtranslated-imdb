This documentary is a wonderful example of how fun and surprising a documentary can be, if done so well. The subject, Mark, is intelligent, funny and very motivated, and this story of his personal struggle to live his dreams will be a source of inspiration for anyone who knows what it's like to host an "impossible" dream.
