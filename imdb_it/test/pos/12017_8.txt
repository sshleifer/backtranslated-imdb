This film is a coveted member of my film collection. While not a mainstream film, it is, in my opinion, a very effective film noir in which Eric Roberts is totally undervalued as an actor. (I would call him a much better actor than his sister, Julia, who is overrated, but this is another review ...) Roberts plays the former unlucky reporter with the perfect mix of narrative precision and exhaustion idealism: two ingredients that they are an integral part of any effective film noir. Roberts' first-person narrative improves the quality of the film and leads us to guess the real reason for the crime. <br /> <br /> Set in Palm Springs, everything about the film's setting proceeds slowly as a metaphor for the theme of oppression: Asch (Roberts) is oppressed by his past; the police are oppressed by the rich residents of Palm Springs who treat them as servants; the rich, meanwhile, are oppressed by boredom (look at the classic performance of Johnny Depp as the rich perceptive guy who just wants to be loved ...); the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is further increased by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> There's an audience for this movie if it's looking for a more contemporary version of the film noir. While there are elements of the film that may have been closer, I suggest you take a copy of this film and put it between The Big Sleep and Chinatown in your film library. (The film is based on the book by Arthur Lyons, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Roberts's acting in this, you may want to have a copy of The Ambulance, in which he shows his funniest, lightest side.) BEST LINE IN THE FILM: "Careful? Watch what? I should have asked. Only fools ignore the strange warnings of the caravan ladies."
