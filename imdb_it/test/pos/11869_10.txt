this movie makes me laugh just thinking about it. such a clever comedy! very precise but easy. casting cannot be better. all the actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play their best, and there are no stupid laughs or screams for the whole movie. the levels and progress of the plot work perfectly together and the rhythm flows smoothly. the greatest of all is when the YMCA of the Village People is highlighted, it highlights the importance of the Indian statute that was only briefly reported earlier in the film, which makes the climax more fun and entertaining among many comedies . I give you a tenth above all a lot of times the plays are so undervalued.
