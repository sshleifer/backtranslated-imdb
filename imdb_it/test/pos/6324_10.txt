I recently discovered this fantastic series and can't get enough of Garner's relaxed PI. The shows continuously show excellent levels of writing and episodes of suspense. <br /> <br /> This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a little different. Give up humor in favor of a more serious breakthrough for Rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The mystery is great and its breakup is quite convincing. It is based on a book (I don't remember the name) and could easily have been lengthened in an episode of duration. Garner excels here as Rockford gets tough and really means business. This has a "noir" hint to the hilt, dark lighting and general mood echo the great dark thrillers of the '40s and' 50s. <br /> <br /> Really a good episode in a Class A series. Easily worth a 10.
