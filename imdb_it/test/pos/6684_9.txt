I was really surprised when I saw this film directed by Iain Softley for the first time; differs in many ways from the usual Hollywood mass production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays a mental protector who claims to belong to the planet K-pax who came to Earth from a ray of light, while Dr. Powell played by Jeff Bridges tries to help him solve his disappointments . .. First of all, I have to admit that the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of Prot, always walking on the thin line to convince us that it is real and therefore to ask us if he is delusional or not Some of the gem scenes include one in which Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with Dr. Powell; or the observatory scene where he casually shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to astonished astronomers ... Jeff Bridges on the other hand is the subtle and rational side of this film, and delivers it perfectly. There is another cast of excellent actors (like the convincing interpretation of Saul Williams as Ernie) that really makes this film work. <br /> <br /> K-pax has it all, comedy elements; Science fiction, also a psychological thriller (concerning the identity of the Prot), but above all it can be classified as a moving drama. The main premise of the film is rather complex, but the director never lets himself escape, he always keeps it credible and yet interpretable in two ways. The camera and photography have almost a crucial part here, continuing the main idea of ​​the journey of light, we focus a lot on the play of light-shadows, on lightning - one of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell holds a figure crystal in his office that refracts light beautifully while all the while suspecting that the idea is true? <br /> <br /> Thin and slow, intriguing and pleasant, K-pax is really a jewel to look at, a gentle film that may not be for everyone, but those who see it might fall in love with it.
