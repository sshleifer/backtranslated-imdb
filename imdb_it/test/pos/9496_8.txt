I thought this movie was really good. In the end he ends up showing the spectators, in the end, that Leila should have kept what she had. Leila was tired of her husband Jim, who was more worried about work than for her. He was so involved in his work that he forgot their anniversary. He was also very sloppy. He couldn't take it anymore, so he left to see if he would miss it. The film shows that he misses, he also tries to make up for the night he messed up. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. He ends up finding another man named Schuyler. He looked like the man she always wanted to clean and he noticed her. In the end, she portends when she looks at Schuylers shoes and how she lets her cigar ashes fall to the floor like Jim did the same thing. Jim ends up making a lot of money and cleaning himself. In the end, Leila thinks she should keep her husband because that's all he really wanted and he changed his mind.
