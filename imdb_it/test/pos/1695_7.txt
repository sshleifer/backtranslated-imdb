"The landscape after a battle" opens with the fleeing prisoners on a snowy field full of fences - in rather amusing movements accompanied by Vivaldi Four Seasons. A moving opening. But we learn early enough to get to know these prisoners as a crowd, and when they (even humorous treats) tear apart a living man, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more busy finding books from the rest camp than taking himself care of his neighbor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is set in an American camp where prisoners are not released, in a sort of semi-freedom, semi-field. A perfect set for a study on war crime, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, pain and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> The film makes an important change. The women arrive and with them the film changes light, color and temperament. At the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves of the Holocaust. I think one of the main political themes of the film should be humanity's treatment of Jews during and after the world war, and not just the Nazi exterminations, but humanity lets it happen - and even force them out of Europe afterwards war. On an emotional level, the film speaks of pain and the problem with pain affliction, of how the environment makes pain difficult and of how difficult it is to share pain for people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on a harp, an emotional melody brutally rejected (filmically speaking) by the protagonist. This example brings together an important essence of the style and theme of the film. When it comes to humor, he is as comic as the protagonist constantly loses and finds his glasses in the crowd, in stacks of hay, etc. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to understand Spielberg's respect for Wajda when you see this film. The great light treatment can be compared to Spielberg at best. Grunwald's interlude speaks for itself. Narrativly only brings the film out of the field, but filmatically takes the film to dream and eternity with a profound beauty. However, there is also another scene that I cannot let go without comment. It is the Christian dinner. Undoubtedly ironic, but at the same time profoundly religious, we see the moment of transubstantiation, all fall to their knees, while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic cleric. Her bells are mocking the scene, but they also give her emotion and love. When Nina takes the bread, the sunlight falls on her and the bells ring spherical, it is the climax of the film. <br /> <br /> The main actors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski is the perfect protagonist of Wajda - the mind that reflects doubtfully, unable to put all aspects of his mind and emotions into his life. The beautiful Celinska is with a large body that performs debuting in a character unable to express all her interior in her proud movements. <br /> <br /> Those who try to describe everything are often unable to consider anything. This is what Wajda manages. His films are very moving, profound or beautifully filmed, but they pay attention to the peculiarity of life and society. A moment of joy for one, it is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of pain for the third, a moment of nothingness for the fourth. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons to pay attention to Film Wajdas from this period. The first is the remarkable free expression of a profound political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. The second is the development of a filmic and narrative language that Kusturica has achieved greatness.
