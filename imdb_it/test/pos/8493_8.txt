Let's find out immediately the problem, the film should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant and charming man who led a complex and stimulating life. There was simply no way to adapt to everything - or even touch everything - in a standard length film. That said, the creators of this film have made an admirable (and I'm sure pretty agonizing) work of putting together a film that couldn't tell the whole story, but managed to propose a representative sample of the man and his music. Ray Charles's strengths were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor covered in sugar. We could have wished for another hour to tell him about his life after 1980, but I suppose he would have tended to turn the film into a tribute and, while he would also have allowed the resolution of several things that had remained suspended at the end, in balance I imagine it is been better as presented. <br /> <br /> Now for the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? The wife and I have seen countless films in our years, but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance like Jamie Foxx. The line between actor and character was not blurred, but rather disappeared completely. We had heard a lot of clamor before seeing the film, but it was strange. Foxx was Ray Charles. You didn't watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching Foxx do an exceptional job of portraying Ray Charles - you saw it somehow believing or understanding that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I don't know how else to put it. We were completely speechless. I have to admit that this year we have not seen all the other interpretations for an Oscar, but it doesn't matter. Foxx took him to a higher level, never seen before and I doubt we could see again. I can't think of any other film I've ever seen where a person who plays such a completely and convincingly part has become the person portrayed. We salute you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar has to do with much more than performance, but if you win or not, we want you to know that you did something absolutely in a class by yourself and you should be proud of your unparalleled result. <br /> <br /> PS The music was naturally fantastic. I pointed out to his wife that if there was a moment in the history of music that I wanted to be a witness to, it would have been genesis (in Kansas City, wouldn't it?) By What'd I Say? The film did a great job with it - I just wish I could have been there!
