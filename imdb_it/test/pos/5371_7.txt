Not everyone likes this movie. It's still one of the best "you have to think" movies about Satanism that has ever been done. The fact that he has no cuts or gores jumped into the MTV era every seven minutes is irrelevant. Also, speaking as someone who actually knows the satanists, the spoiler warning! Of the movie in which the Brotherhood exchanges their old bodies with those of preadolescent children, has some really scary scenes. The section in which (second spoiler alarm) Strother Martin orchestrates the transition to the euro is almost hyper-real as it uses very few special effects, a hallmark of this film. McEveety was rarely given a big budget, but it was often effective. It worked also in this case.
