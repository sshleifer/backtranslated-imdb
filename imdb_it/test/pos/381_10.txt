Looking back at Alfred Hitchcock's career, he never fails to surprise how such a brilliant and visionary man can be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary it was for the film industry. It is probably a sign of how Hitchcock was ahead in time, always trying to go further, never ending up with a film made simply for the purpose of entertaining, but always with a deeper and more touching motif in his mind. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's earliest and most underrated successes, is a perfect example of these traits - a fun and suspenseful story, although considered more than 50 years later, yes, but with care and intelligence built today it is a masterpiece in the technique of the film. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the pioneering "suspense thrillers", Strangers on a Train may seem a bit dated in some respects, but retains every sort of superbly elaborate tension as it did in 1951 (perhaps slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting, as well as quick and accurate editing, are what distinguish the film, evoking every possible tension and keeping the attention of the public even in the slowest scenes. If there had ever been any doubt about what a simply masterful director, Hitchcock, was, simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a train should be enough to disavow such feelings; each shot is chosen and built with care, all to guide the plot in a particularly innovative way. Sadly enough, there are some moments in history that are quite out of place enough to divert attention from superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach the bottom of a sewer grid is simply amazing, and the figure of an old stereotypical running under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintended comic relief in what should be the most tense and compelling scene in the film. These are just brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film. <br /> <br /> But what really sets Strangers on a Train apart is the premise of the story. Since the Hollywood movies of the future risk inevitably going down further in the turgid basin of cliché after clichés, it is wonderfully refreshing to see a 50-year-old film with a premise that actually looks intelligent and original. Sure it's pretty simple, but the concept of "murder exchange" is simply one that would not fly in films of today and age, which makes it even more fun to watch; the brilliant screenplay of the film keeps the action flowing at a fast pace, while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the time. One cannot help but notice the deeper themes to which Hitchcock is alluding, especially the concept of "darkness in the heart of humanity", demonstrated by elderly ladies who are fascinated and exalted by the prospect of murder, as well as by the contemptuous attitude of Bruno towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humor (Bruno bursts a child's balloon with his cigarette is priceless), and irony, shooting suspenseful scenes in happy and relaxing environments, like the iconic carnival scenes, to create a atmosphere even more disturbing. It could be a suspense, yes, but ignoring the brain hidden beneath it would simply be unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The antagonist figure of Bruno (tested for the perverse perfection of Robert Walker, sadly in his latest film role, but who easily steals the film from his admired members of the highly talented cast) is undoubtedly what makes Strangers on such a memorable train, as the character is a wonder to behold. Here we have a wicked figure simply superbly elaborate, all the more intriguing as it seems ordinary and unpretentious. Rather than cackling madly and obstructing the hero at all times, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such a casual tone, while keeping a passionate flash in his eyes when he talks about different fashions of killing people. Bruno might seem to represent the "Id", as Freud would say, the inner, darker and uninhibited aspects of humanity. It makes an interesting contrast to the figure of the hero, Guy Haines, and how bland and bland it seems to be, as if he wanted to drive home the prospect that evil is much more interesting and attractive than constantly trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Despite this implicit message, Hitch continues to twist our emotions enough to root Guy every turn for every turn and cheer up every new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It is a testament to the talent of actor Farley Granger that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show, Granger's hero still shows understanding, and continues to command our support even when he is prey to a much less convincing character. Superb support is given by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the cliché and to be a more innovative and complex figure of romantic interest, Kasey Rogers giving an extraordinary performance as Guy's first horribly manipulative and hedonistic wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is much more talented than simply being "the director's daughter" would imply. The superb cast (led by a simply wonderful Walker) really brings the film to life, adding so much more to the film than simply the amazing Hitchcock style. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Strangers on a Train may still seem a little dated to some viewers, but it's still a shock the way it looks modern and appealing to the contemporary audience, considering it was released half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock demonstrates his unparalleled mastery of film tension and technique, and the film's surprisingly original and entertaining premise deserves to be seen. Highly recommended for anyone wishing to embark on a brilliant but superbly fun movie experience! <br /> <br /> -9/10
