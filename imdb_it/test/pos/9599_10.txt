I'm not a footie fan by any means, but I watched this with a friend because there was nothing else on the box at the time (thank goodness). Not only did we laugh from beginning to end, but about a week later in the pub, when we started discussing it, we did a fair show with an uncontrollable laugh. Does that inclined step actually exist ??? I released my e-mail here, so if anyone hears about his future availability or a replay on television, let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on television !!! Even King Leek was good !! another Tim Healy classic
