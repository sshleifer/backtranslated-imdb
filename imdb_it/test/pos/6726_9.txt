It's nice to see that I'm not the only person who remembers this great movie. I have very fond memories of this movie - I seem to vaguely remember when I was about 8 years old and watching TV shows for children after school (anyone Broom Cupboard?). This was the first and last film to scare me - and the images of the boy surrounded by fog on a hill will remain with me forever! Like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a definite ability to capture the attention of adults. The enchanting scenery of Cornwall really makes the film feel isolated - and the "spooky" scenes are simple but very, very effective! I'd like to try to find this movie again - see if it hits home again!
