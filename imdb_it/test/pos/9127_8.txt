LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very beautiful film, even if it suffers a bit because there have already been similar films. In too many ways, the film is reminiscent of previous robbery films like RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. So while director Melville and the actors did a great job, everything looks like a case of Déjà vu. For this reason, I had difficulty giving this excellent film a higher score. <br /> <br /> The only unusual aspect of the film is the way scammers come together. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from the prison and simply meets Corey, a career criminal just out of prison! Both are a good combination, but having them both work in parallel for most of the film until they meet was an intelligent touch. Apart from this, as expected, much of the film is about the meticulous details in the planning and execution of the crime. I also liked the way the film showed scammers so cold and detached - something relatively common in French crime films, but rare among American films up until the last few years. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely well done and worthy of seeing ... if you don't mind that it seems a little repetitive, you'll see a acting, a direction and a lot of tension.
