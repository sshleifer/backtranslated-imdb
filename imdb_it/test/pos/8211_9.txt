All the comments so far on this film are negative, but I have to say that I found "The Net" engaging. Few films can keep me at the edge of my place, but this has been done. Another advantage is that most suspense and action films are full of language, but this has little vulgarity. I found a movie that was fun to watch. I'm a bit biased, being a big fan of Sandra Bullock. *wink*
