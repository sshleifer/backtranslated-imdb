The man who knew too much about 1956 is exceptional entertainment. To those who prefer the 1934 original, I will say that it is faster and faster. However, even if the American version was (we would miss heaven!) A great economic success, I think it brings out the English version from the water. I think this is one of the 10 best results of Hitchcock, not small, considering he has made over 50 films and many of them have been among the greatest of all time. I find so many things to love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, the most loved man in the United States for so many years, does a great job interpreting his ailing father here. He manages to make every movie enjoyable and, working with such a nice character in such a compelling story, he makes me cheer for him very intensely. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes, Doris Day. Despite all the criticisms addressed to her, I think you make her loving wife / mother an extremely sympathetic person. I disagree with the negative remarks towards his character; just because it is sweet and gentle does not mean that it is docile and defenseless. I don't want to ruin anything, but she makes a crucial discovery on her own after her husband has failed. It gives the story a level of warmth that was not right there in the first, and for those who care that this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and deservedly won his Oscar. He elevated the film to another level. <br /> <br /> 3) The sequence of Albert Hall. I don't think it was too long; I think the suspense developed all the time in that terrible crescendo and Hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the killer was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The finish really made me smile; even after the scene above is over, I found the rescue scene exciting and it was good to see the fascinating family again. The last line of the film is very funny. I don't think the film started slowly; Hithcock was trying to make us known and like the McKenna and did a great job. I wasn't a big fan of the guy who played Hank, but I had no problems with him. Since Hank was Ben and Jo's son, he was also very interested; it's not like he's a brat or something. <br /> <br /> I didn't find any major flaws in this film and so many major and minor virtues. Way to go Hitch!
