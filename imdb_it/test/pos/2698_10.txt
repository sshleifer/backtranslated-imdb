Here in Germany "King of Queens" has a great cult status! Almost every teenager (and adult) watches this sitcom. It's really great !! Better than the other hideous American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series, which is still OK, is "Al Bundy"). There was no American sitcom in Europe that was as effective as this really fun show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug and Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest "grandfather" I know, and Victor Williams and (especially) Patton Oswalt as Deacon & Spence are I know the most diverse, but amusing boys. I look at it as often as I can, and I still don't have enough, a good mood!
