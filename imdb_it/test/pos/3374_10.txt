Honestly I would have given this movie a good 7.5, but I clicked on 10 to try to make up for the 5 pages of 1-star imbecile and unjustified comments. This is an interesting story, all the acting goes very well (even Mrs Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning role here, yet it sounds good to her.) The sets are perfect and cinematography is always appropriately creepy . It's a beautiful work of morality and there is * no * reason to explain the origin of the god / being supernatural / alien / whatever "managing the show" is, so I'm glad the film doesn't try. It is really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but quite compelling and summarized quite satisfactorily in the ending. <br /> <br /> Before deciding that this movie is terrible (or actually something under a 7.5), read a few dozen "hate" 1-star reviews that are full of misspellings, lack of punctuation and capital letters and youth criticisms. Perhaps the trailer was misleading or something - I didn't see it - but some of these reviewers apparently expected Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (a reviewer actually compared this film to Saw! How absolutely inappropriate and unrelated!) < Br /> <br /> Seriously, most of these reviews read like you-tube comments - according to these "critics" this film is too confusing but too predictable, there is not enough action, but there is too much to do, too smart but too stupid, explains too much and leaves too much inexplicable ... oh - and apparently is a "life (sic) of time". Consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart. I'm afraid that these 1-star kids didn't understand the phrase "coefficient of altruism" and therefore were absolutely incapable of understanding the premises of the film (although they categorically claimed to have "understood" it just before explaining how confusing it was! two words mean that you will have no problem understanding (and having fun) this movie. I would really like there to be a reputation system for reviewers, so I could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this 1 star movie forever. <br /> <br /> Watch it yourself and enjoy the beautiful presentation of an interesting couple by taking an interesting moral "test" and facing the consequences. It's a good time, in my opinion.
