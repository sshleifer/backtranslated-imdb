An unusual and revisionist western that is worth looking at. Despite a slow start, does the film build? with very little dialogue and no subtitles ?? a portrait of life that is increasingly engaging and intense, almost existential, in the harsh environment of the western desert. The growth of the main characters is worth waiting for, and the strong central cast brings a real sense of desperation to the struggle for ownership of the important horse. What was interesting was a British director. I hope he smiles now: I have the impression that the film was largely ignored by contemporaries; but time makes its usual alchemy, and the hidden gold shines as inevitably must. One note irritated me: revisionism has been brought up to now. Sam Waterston as an Indian? - Assuming he does his part with real emotion and intensity, but really, couldn't an American Indian actor be found to do the job? But her scenes with Caroline Langrishe have an intimacy that contrasts nicely with the immense landscape that surrounds them. <br /> <br /> Forget the big and failed Hollywood versions of the past, men with great minds and whirling music; this is all about a primordial struggle between protagonists who, stripped of all the traps of "ordinary" life, come to understand what it's worth fighting for. Impressive.
