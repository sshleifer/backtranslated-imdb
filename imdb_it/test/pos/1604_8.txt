Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> The film adaptation of Luchino Visconti of the Thomas Mann novel is visually, if not philosophically, true to its source (Britten's work offers a more faithful reading of the Apollonian and Dionysian struggles that they consume the old writer). It is certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story. Venice has never been more beautiful and fascinating, more decadent and effeminate. If you've read the story, it's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives an exceptional performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very few dialogues, he conveys the bitterness, the passion aroused and, finally, the pitiful desire of Aschenbach through facial expressions alone. Bjorn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, Aschenbach's splendid object of desire, has been perfectly chosen. He also plays the part with facial expressions and gestures. The character of Tadzio is fundamental to the story, so every actor in this role must be worthy to inspire passion and desire. Visconti, with his incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And changing Ashenbach from writer to composer based on Gustav Mahler, and then using Mahler's music, especially the 5th Symphony Adagietto, was another brilliant shot. Although I had read Mann's story before the film, Mahler's music and death in Venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. As well as the disturbing images that appear in the film, especially that of Ashenbach who dies on the beach while Tadzio walks slowly towards the sea. <br /> <br /> One day this movie will be released in widescreen DVD format and its visual splendor completely returned to us.
