If someone had nudged me for about 15 minutes in "Ray" and asked what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would have been a time for a blank look. After all, what does this (fictitious) person talk about? That wasn't Jamie Foxx on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances of anyone in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie in the role of Ray is really brilliant. <br /> <br /> The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step in mixing gospel with R & B) died during production. The film about his troubled life is good, not exceptional. Taylor Hackford's directing and James L. White's screenplay follows the worn-out biopic scheme. The talented young man fights adversity, reaches greatness as he self-destructs, then rises from the eaves for a happy ending. The film shows the faults of Charles (heroin abuse, chronic woman, persistent bastard behavior) even if it sucks you with his beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the main women in the life of Ray, a long-suffering wife and his longtime lover. Both actresses correspond to the Foxx step. What takes him to a different level, however, is his deep understanding and the mysterious imitation of the great musician. The whole cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as her stubborn mother and Curtis Armstrong as a music director. The Hackford stars will probably be awarded with trophies and, even better, with leading roles. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of Ray Charles before 'Ray'. Apparently, the film has left a lot (like all biopics), but this image works both as a welcome old-fashioned public and as a dark search for a brilliant / tormented man. For those who whine that Foxx does not sing (as if he somehow diminished his performance), take a walk. No actor can sing like Mr. Charles. You can't have everything. What the talented star does in this photo is the closest to "everything", as we'll probably see for a while.
