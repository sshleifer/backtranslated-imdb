I've been a big fan of Errol Morris since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard that he saved a life. To date, this film is his best work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mix of Stephen Hawking's book of the same title intertwined with human life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends and Hawkings himself. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled; It sounds totally boring, but the whole package is dynamic and challenging. The fusion of life and theories is perfect and completely fun. I was particularly touched by the way they humanize this genius and the omniscient man. If physically impotent, the size and brilliance of Hawking's cut are encapsulated in a real human being who is allowed to laugh and aw at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. Watch it and have fun. And if the studio that owns this image reads this, a 15-year Anniversary edition would be perfect NOW ...
