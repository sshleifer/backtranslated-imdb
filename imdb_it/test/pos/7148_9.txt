This is a wonderful movie ... it's fun, dark, moving, challenging, innocently bad and generally fun around. I don't know I've seen such things before ... "The Rapture", or maybe one of Todd Solondz's nightly "comedies" or even the recent "Teeth" movie come to mind ... but those are all little bitter and bad gems . "Franklin," despite the darkness, manages to have a sincere and pure heart. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to "Low Down Dirty Shame" by John Waters, only this film differs in this actually has a story, and something to say, in addition to the youthful message of Waters "Sex it's not dirty (snicker, nudge-nudge) ". A conservative and repressed family undergoes a drastic change following a car accident and suddenly they are no longer so conservative ... in fact, in the end they are really happy, probably the only people in their city (or maybe the whole world) who they are. Talk about why this would ruin the film; simply, everyone should see it, although of course only the people who are already sold on what the film's optimistic and promising philosophy is always would be. <br /> <br /> Acting is great - only this side is realistic enough to prevent acts from becoming too heavy ... Teresa Willis offers a particularly memorable and courageous performance like a tense mother who emerges like a butterfly when released . Both she and Robertson Dean deserve compliments for their genuinely sincere performances (not to mention frequent and extensive sex and nudity scenes); they transform what could have been a salacious joke that involves a "deviant sexual practice" in a moving, credible and captivating moment. He had the impression that his daughter is a prominent person and someone to watch, perfectly capturing the attitude, the anguish and the logic of a girl of his age. Vince Pavia as the brother "himbo" with a secret is beautiful and functional even if his plot and the way in which everyone reacts is more gratifying than his acting. Mari Blackwell, the best friend in conflict with her mother Franklin, is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone beyond the lines. <br /> <br /> Technically the film looks fantastic, all the bright colors and large -open locales ... it seems that it could have been shot in high definition ... if so, the line has become very thin, it looks like much to the film. There is a lot of talk and a lot of philosophy, which becomes a bit of a preacher (more badly, I imagine to a spectator who does not agree with the politics of the film), but this film says a lot of things that must be said. . If only people would not be afraid to listen and think. The arguments that take place are intelligent and well thought out, primarily by refusing to demonize religious or non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The ending is on the ambiguous side, which I found somewhat disappointing ... I think it would have worked better if the author (as Jay Floyd is, since he produced, wrote and direct) given a more functional epilogue, a sort of solution, but then again, there is probably not one when it comes to putting people with different faiths against each other. However, it was a moving and memorable image that left me speechless - a success. Meanwhile, I'm really happy that Mr. Floyd made this film and I'm looking forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. Check it out.
