When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just saw the last 5 minutes of the movie. And I was really impressed by this. I got pimples and told myself I had to watch this movie. And I did it, and I have to say: this film is fantastic. The songs are fantastic, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this film is one of the most important: "Make love, no war". This film is a true masterpiece. Meanwhile, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I've ever heard. I could almost hear myself join the crowd. All I have to say: "LEAVE THE SUN, LEAVE THE SUN"
