Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower", and finally I did. What a wonderful film - the perfect reproach for a Sunday night / fearing Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really made this film - after all, it was really about her. Real great actors can do anything, and Miss Bergman proves it. It shows us - during a film - a range that few people show in their entire career. The disco scene was as hysterical as it was touching. Although the film drew his obvious conclusion, I found myself rooting for Miss Dickinson as if it were the Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, he did much better (no pun). ;)
