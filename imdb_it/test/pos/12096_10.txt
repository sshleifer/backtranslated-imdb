This film is one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. I reluctantly went with a Turkish friend who advised him. I'm not a very enthusiastic supporter of music documentaries, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman banned for years from singing in Turkey, sings her piece, the theater was in awe. I'd give my all to listen to a CD recording of this disturbing and wonderful song. And she is just one of the many artists interviewed and recorded, talking about their experiences of performing in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I remember the video of Aynur singing in an auditorium, and I try to remember the music while it echoes in the cinema. Congratulations to Faith Akin, the director of this film, and his great idea to capture the many beautiful sounds of a city so cosmopolitan. It would definitely encourage me to visit Istanbul.
