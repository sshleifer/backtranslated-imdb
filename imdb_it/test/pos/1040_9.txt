Has anyone still found a way to buy copies of this series? I see that many people have asked but I don't know if any of them have been successful. It is hard to believe that such a good series cannot be seen by today's people, especially that based on real problems faced by real people during times of tension and excitement in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? Incidentally, I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this website. This is an excellent story of events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today. Many of us saw this series when we were in college or at that time anyway. Now we want to share it with our children ... but can't we? If it were true what would be the good written materials that will transmit the same information?
