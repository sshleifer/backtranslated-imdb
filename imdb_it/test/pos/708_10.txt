The first time I saw this movie I was a child. I was ten years old when he was released but since my family never went to the cinema I saw her on Network TV. I remember seeing him alone ?? and to have cried later. It was only the second film that contained that answer (Rocky was the first) and since then there haven't been many. I can't say why exactly; Larry "Rain" Murphy no longer deserved to win Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Stoic. He didn't need a stopwatch or a freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. He didn't need any other reason. I have a rule today, that when I see this movie late at night on cable television (the only time most people will see it) I have to watch, no matter what I have to do the next morning. Fortunately it does not often sound like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I still have a lot of sleep and I never tire of the story of unrepentant captivity and a man's personal victory.
