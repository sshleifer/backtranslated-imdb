I love a cute and heartfelt movie with a happy ending. This film could be considered a drama, about two characters who realize true love, but the story is so touching and so sweet that in my mind it's a love story. Of course, acting is not so great (you didn't give a 10) but they do the job, and they don't behave exactly (thank god) plus they are cute, but the story is powerful and simply adorable (some of you Violets will suffocate you) !!!!!! it's a great watch for a love story, but if you're homophobic, STAY AWAY! for everyone else, I loved the movie, it's so sweet! I heard his return on a smaller scale ... but with a happy ending .... so have fun !!
