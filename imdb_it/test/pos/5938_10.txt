If you liked the TV series, Diagnosis Murder, you will love the 101 murder. It's nice to see Dick Van Dyke again in a murder. If we're lucky, this will be the start of a TV series or at least a series of films. <br /> <br /> This film has certainly had some great and remarkable actors who have filled the roles. But it didn't look like a "face" movie. It was really a story that led you to make you forget the fame of those on the screen. <br /> <br /> I made a hypothesis on the finale and was pleasantly surprised at the end that I had to look again! This is a must for any mystery enthusiast or lover of Dick Van Dyke!
