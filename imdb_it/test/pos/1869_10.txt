I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I watched it again on DVD. Was I worried if the laughter would come or not? But in some episodes I was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. The essay by Rakesh Bedi (Raja) and Satish Shah is brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is simply bad, but I think he did his job, maybe a better actress could have been used instead of her. This series shows what a good and clean comedy. <br /> <br /> If this series were broadcast this year, I would have given it 9/10 and think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good. 10. I highly recommend this series for watching on DVD.
