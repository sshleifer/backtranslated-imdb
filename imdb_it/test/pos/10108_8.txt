Maybe I'm one of the few avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so exaggerated! Movies like "Ringu" or "The Eye" ?? who are praised all over the world ?? it simply didn't convince me and they seemed more boring than scary. Well, this outspoken opinion does not concern the South Korean gem "A Tale of Two Sisters". This is a fashionable and absolutely complex psychological story that is REALLY done under the skin! The plot, based on a local folk tale, could be a bit too confusing to make this film listed among the greatest hits of all time, but the atmosphere and the construction of tension certainly provoke feelings of great respect. . This is one of those few films that are impossible to label: the events in "Two Sisters" qualify as a curvaceous horror as well as an intense family drama and a profoundly psychological portrait. In addition to a fascinating story, "A Tale of Two Sisters" also has all the great elements that I miss in Asian horror films such as compelling music, good acting and innovative photographic work. The villa where family events take place is brilliantly illustrated as a truly gruesome place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door. Several sequences (such as dinner with relatives or the nocturnal aspect in the girls' room) are practically the maximum of strangeness. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I like to believe I saw my share of ghostly horror. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is a formidable and absolutely not to be missed cinematic adventure for the fanatics of Asian cinema. A small warning for people with little attention, though: this film forces you to keep your eyes and ears focused at all times. It is also a film that requires repeated vision, although no one will ever "understand" it for 100%.
