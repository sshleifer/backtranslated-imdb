The video opens with a scene from a horror film, in which a man proposes to his girlfriend. He begins to tell her that he is "different". As the full moon rises, it turns into a werewolf. Then he pursues her through the woods, and just before attacking, we are taken inside the cinema. Inside the theater there are Michael and his girlfriend. She's too scared to look again, so they leave. As they leave the theater, he starts teasing her. ("It's near midnight, something evil is lurking in the darkness ...") Michael then sings and dances his way along the road with his girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's ability with the camera. He never acts "aware" of his presence, as many other artists do. As they pass through the cemetery, the graves begin to open ... Once they arrive in an alley, they are faced with a horde of undead. So let's see the face of Michael's girl horror. Who wouldn't look with horror if their date turned into a zombie? Yes, he becomes one of the undead. (One very bright and brilliant, though.) He and his fellow zombies then start what could be the best-known dance choreography of any music video. To tell you more give the ending. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video of all time! You don't want to lose it! I give him a 10/10. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains at the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks a little poor by today's standards.)
