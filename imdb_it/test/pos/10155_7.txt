This isn't one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, though I have to admit it's still pretty good. Among the things I really liked was the presence of Jimmy Stewart (who always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary-looking killer (who looks like a skeleton with only a thin layer of skin stretched over him ). Although it cost a lot of money to the studio, I didn't particularly like Doris Day in the film - he seemed to cry a lot and chirp "Que Sera" like a fullback. Yes, I know he should have been singing that way, but this forever made me hate this song. Sorry. <br /> <br /> The other complaint, although minor, that I had about the film was that it was a bit "too shiny" and "Hollywood". The original version (also made by Hitchcock) seemed much more gritty and mushy - and this added to the frightening atmosphere.
