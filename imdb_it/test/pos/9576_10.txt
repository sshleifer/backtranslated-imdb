This is the only Christopher Guest film that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for pure entertainment value, but somehow it never comes close to recognition. The plot surrounds the competitors - the dogs - and their owners as they venture into the competitive dog world ... OK, it's a dog show. The owners are really characters, as they should be to be so attached to their dogs. This is really all there is to it, but this makes it quite fun. <br /> <br /> You would never be able to convince me that a mock-u-mentary on dog shows would be fun before capturing the hilarious scene in which Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's home on TV. .. but this is really all you need to convert any doubt. Spinal Tap was an endless hilarity, a joke after a joke, while Best in Show had a few more pauses (and by that I mean 3 minutes at the PLUS where something incredibly funny is not possible), but the big laughs are even bigger . <br /> <br /> The casting in this is fantastic and even the typical out of place in, films in general Parker Posey does a good job. In fact, his haul to Ed Begley Jr. and a pet shop owner on a lost toy is probably the funniest gag in the film. <br /> <br /> What is incredible about this film for me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, as simple as it was, around these great jokes, so that in reality it seemed that it had a direction. I imagine there is a freedom in having such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is pretty well done here and the characters are rarely exaggerated. The realism of what they seem pathetic to the stranger is what makes it more fun than Mighty Wind or an irregular Guffman. Actually, I occasionally encounter wierdos like this. If you like the things of Guest, you should absolutely have this.
