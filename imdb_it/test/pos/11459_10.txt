I have to say. This is easily one of my FAVORITE movies to watch on Halloween. The Halloween party, the horrible acting, the guy dressed like and extra from Miami Vice. GREAT GREAT GREAT !!! <br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a huge place in my heart for the horror films of the 80s at random and this has stretched and pulled the strings of my heart. I always pass this movie to Blockbuster and always laughing at the cover of the box. Now every weekend I took a movie that I had never seen before ... a weekend was Angelas. It seemed like he'd been kidding me for months. So I brought it home, put it and spent most of the film under the blanket. For me it was terrifying and disgusting. And not just acting! Some of the things they invented for this film were AMAZING. I can honestly say that the best part for me was watching Suzanne (played by a fellow Taiwanese) stick a tube of lipstick in her nipple. It was random and I loved it. Watching the creepy Angela FLOAT through the corridors and hearing her creepy demon voice was enough to make me WAKE ALL NIGHT! <br /> <br /> It is not one of the smartest or best interpreted horror films. But its 80s cheese and has all the elements you need. Creepy Goth Kid, Virgin, Slut, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad Acting, oh, and did I mention Naked Girls? All the elements were there and were put together in such a way as to create one of my favorite movies. Congratulations to the directors.
