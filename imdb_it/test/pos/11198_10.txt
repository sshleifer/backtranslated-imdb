The only complaint I heard about this film was slowness. However, perhaps this is the point. The two characters clash relentlessly and the slow accumulation of tension between them produces anxiety. Intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialogue bring tension to a point where an otherwise normal topic upsets the public. Istanbul and the suburbs are dreamy, captivating landscapes, and the plot is thrilling - not in that "look, the hero blew up another car and is now flying with his bike", anyway. I shivered down my spine as the characters moved in and out of their spheres and watched the fog enveloping Istanbul.
