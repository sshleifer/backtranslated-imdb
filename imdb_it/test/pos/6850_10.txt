Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this crime. Her sex appeal, her heritage and her sexy southern accent make this film revolving. But the film has so many "other" things to make it almost a modern classic. Simon Baker's performance for one thing. Really that of a great actor. Til Schweiger is so perfect that I wonder why he's not a huge "crossover" star. Gil Bellows completes this team of motels and literally steals this show. The neckline of other Gugino easily the best interpretation of the film. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so extraordinarily brilliant ... I can't even describe it. Excellent chemistry. <br /> <br /> Music is so powerful and eclectic as to be a character in and of itself. It is wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> People might say he is influenced by Tarantino ... I disagree. It is clearly unique and intelligent in its own right. Sebastian Gutierrez does a great job of directing this twisted film and underestimating a lot of scenes that have left me wavering. The finish is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. All in all a lovely film that, for me, is the very definition of what a good movie should be.
