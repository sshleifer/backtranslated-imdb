George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. No one mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From the sparkling comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Rib" "Holiday" Psycho melodramas "Gaslight" "A Double Life" a great semi-western "Heller in Pink Tights" not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Travel with my Aunt "He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness to see the "rich and famous" glow of the old master still very evident. Candice Bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian that was about to become. Jacqueline Bisset is a return to the times of Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner intervene, making fun of each other, promising something spectacular that will materialize in 1989 with "Apartment Zero", Meg Ryan, since Bergen's daughter is already Meg Ryan . As tired of the formula, it remains a Cukor film and for what I collect one of Almodovar's favorite films.
