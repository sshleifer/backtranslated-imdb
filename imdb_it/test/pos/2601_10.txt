Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. Not sure which season it is and Bunny and Duck claim that the aid doesn't count. Although Bugs proves to be the smartest one more time by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when he finishes, he makes his trademark. Daffy freaks out and asks for the rabbit to be killed. Even if Elmer is too stupid, he is hopelessly in love with the bunny thing. Elmer is really the fault of all this. If he weren't so stupid, he'd know that REALLY is the duck season and he blows up Daffy. But poor old Daff cannot believe in the absolute absurdity of the situation. His cruel plans of bad direction were foiled by Elmer's stupidity. Daffy is so shocked that he comes home with Elmer to blow himself up in his living room. Poor Daff. <br /> <br /> Poor Daff. He commands!
