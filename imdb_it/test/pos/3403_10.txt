I absolutely loved this film as a child and I still do it as an adult. To say that it is also a euphemism. My sister, my brother and I watched it for a year in our grandparents' house during the Christmas holidays. They had recorded it from the TV. Our parents were happy that they kept us busy for one night, but they thought we would get tired of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not like that! We have become hypnotized. They couldn't have come off if they tried. It has become an appreciated annual tradition. We liked everything: the weather, the love story, the battle scenes, the bad guys, etc. <br /> <br /> Come on, who can resist hating the psychic Bent with his constant SIR !? Classic! Also, who can happily resist when Justin falls off the balcony ?! What a triumphant moment! I have always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can make me cry a little. This film is incredibly moving and I challenge anyone to follow him to the end. It's worth it !!
