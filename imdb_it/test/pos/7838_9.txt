I just saw a couple of episodes of "Eleventh Hour", but I have to say that they were enough to impress me. This series is so awesome and interesting ... I'll definitely follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to say that acting is top notch. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian the scientist - credibly and coldly, and makes the public believe in the character. Other characters, such as Rachel, are also believable and, although sometimes they are a bit cold - due to the way the series is shot - they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories told by this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw is about cloning and a man who was trying to clone humans. The way the episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart - kept following the clues and saving people was surprising. Also, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad it could be. <br /> <br /> However, I think this is a good television program. I just hope it continues like this - interesting, stimulating and with good acting. Even if it is filmed in a cold way - small lightning, cold photography, many close-ups - it never ceases to be interesting. Highly recommendable.
