I'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie like that. He is grainy, poorly written, bleached, often ridiculous, and in many places mindlessly boring (the person I was watching with sleeping twice.) Yet there is something in this film that fascinates me, even if I'm not sure what; perhaps the character of Sam, a huge former patient who was lobotimized by the former chief doctor and who is continually sucking an ice pudding, or the wonderfully interpreted medical chief (I forgot his name). <br /> <br /> However, look at it and form your personal opinion; has one of the biggest endings I've seen in the movie.
