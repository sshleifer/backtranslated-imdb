The first words spoken by Garbo in this 1930 film electrified the audience and became part of the Hollywood legend. Garbo had become a star in his first American film, The Torrent, in 1926. And the public waited until this film to see if Garbo could make the switch to talkies. You did it. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky and Renee Adoree fell on the streets because of their accents, Garbo sailed for another decade. Despite the seasonality of this film, Garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great Marie Dressler as Marthy. The two big stars exchange dirty looks and sharp words as they measure each other while they drink a few drinks and set the tone for the rest of the film. Garbo was 25; Dressler was 60 years old. Charles Bickford is OK as Matt, and George F. Marion is as good as Old Chris. Marion originated this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the silent version of 1923 with Blanche Sweet. This game by Eugene O'Neill is a true classic, but, strangely, it has never been filmed. Anna Christie is one of Garbo's greatest interpretations. And despite the seasonality of the film and the gloom of the story, it is truly a marvel. See this for Garbo and Dressler!
