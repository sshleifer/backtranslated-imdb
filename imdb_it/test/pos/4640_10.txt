Still fun after all these years. Midnight Madness is good entertainment for all ages. Introduced by Michael J Fox as a typical 15-year problem producer. Melio and Blaylak are by far the funniest characters and Leon is perfectly chosen as a wierdo game master. The budding love story between Adam and the girl could not have been a healthy one any more. Fagabeefe !!!!
