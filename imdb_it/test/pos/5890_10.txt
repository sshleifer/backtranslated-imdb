World War II veterans return home and find it difficult to adapt to civilian life. This superb film is directed by Wyler and beautifully shot by the famous cinematographer Toland. Despite its nearly three hours in length, it doesn't drag for a minute. Sherwood's script features very human characters and a great dialogue. Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man who fights to make ends meet. Equally good is Wright as a young woman in love, Mayo as Andrews' stuck wife and real life veteran Russell as a man who lost both hands. However, the best accolades go to March and Loy as a long-time married couple who have to face challenges while reclaiming each other.
