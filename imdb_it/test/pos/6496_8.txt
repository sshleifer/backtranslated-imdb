Every review I've read so far seems to have lost a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for the accent and pronounces it just like he did for the Nordists in other comedies. The Scottish accent modifies the emphasis and rhythm of language and profoundly influences what is said and how it is taken. So listen again and notice the difference. The game is well done and the rhythm of words is much better than that provided by people who use good, polite and well-spoken English. I am reminded of the time when a teacher at a Leicester school, unconsciously, asked me, at age 14, to read a piece by Walter Scott that had been written in the tone of the Border. I come from the border and when I read it as it should be read it made all the difference.
