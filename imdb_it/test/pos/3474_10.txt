Damien O'Donnell has a good resume and in this film he manages a very sensitive subject with sensitivity but he can't turn the film into schmalz. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie, it's funny with a sad bit and makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now - FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> Acting is excellent, and Dublin has a leading role. This film will change the way you see people with disabilities and will also give you a very fun evening at the cinema. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
