.... but at the same time part of you is thinking "Am I ready for what I'm about to see?" <br /> <br /> In the end, you're happy to have seen it. I was, at least. Jackass Number Two has twice the laughter and twice the action. Some stunts will leave you breathless. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe this year too. <br /> <br /> The entire cast returns, plus some like Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I don't think any of the cast members have had a dull moment. Each aerobatics was fun or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was just as fun as the first, and the ending was interestingly hilarious; the cast performs a musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to watch with your friends. Stay during the credits, there are some pretty fun moments. One is about Luke Wilson.
