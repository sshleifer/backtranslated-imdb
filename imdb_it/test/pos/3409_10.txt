"North & South" the television miniseries is what the "Rich Man, Poor Man" (the first mini-television series) was in the '70s. <br /> <br /> It is a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy by writer John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades preceding the years of the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the civil war - North against South. The intertwined stories evolve around the families of Hazards (the "North" in the title) and the Mains and their two central figures of George and Orry forming a friendship as they undertake their training at West Point in 1842. <br /> <br /> "North and South" is a wonderful historical timeline and as they are grown (and wiser!) I am very interested in knowing the contrasting attitudes of controversial aspects such as "Slavery" and "Abolitionists", and how these attitudes originated. <br /> <br /> The series also describes a great development of characterization when we get to know friends and enemies in the lives of George and Orry and also the women who stole their hearts from young men. This aspect of history also reveals a romantic story set against the turbulent background of the American civil war. <br /> <br /> "North & South", along with "Rich Man, Poor Man" has been overshadowed since 1977 by "Roots" as the greatest mini series of all time. However, it approaches the second / third and shares the same type of timelines and themes as "Roots". But don't let it escape, even if it's just to see the great scenery, costumes and cast of all the stars including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. <br /> <br /> The series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to real historical events and it is a pity that the Emmys and Golden Globes did not honor many more actors and actresses for their portraits. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two virtual protagonists currently unknown, turn into compelling performances such as Orry Main and George Hazard respectively. However, it is the compelling performance of Kirstie Alley as the sister of George Abolitionist, Virgilia, who steals the show many times. Furthermore, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are the delicious villains of the piece you love to hate. <br /> <br /> "North & South" Books 1 and 2 are now available on two sets of DVDs.
