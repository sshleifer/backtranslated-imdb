I think the basic idea of ​​every film is to entertain or inform. If you want information you are watching real life movies and historical films. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Hitch entertained me? Yes, he did. Ok, the formula is standard. The boy meets the girl or in this case the boys meet the girls. They find themselves together to fall and then come back together. However the way it happened in this film was refreshing. I particularly liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. Allegra Albert's romance was a delight to play, most of the REAL men are shy when it comes to courting the woman of their dreams and if I had Hitch's advice I'd probably put my wife on the altar in half the time. the first comment on this film that seemed to suggest that this film was played safely and well have had some more laughs. I tend to disagree there are so many laughs that you can put in a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. In addition to relationships, there are important moments. All in all I found Hitch quite funny, the actors did a good job (I'll watch them in other movies) and Hitch is a movie I'm very happy to have in my DVD collection.
