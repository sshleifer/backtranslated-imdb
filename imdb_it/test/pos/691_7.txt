If you are in the midst of a fierce war and it is not yet clear that you will come out on top, among the things you will be dealing with is keeping up the morale of civilians ... to show that our troops have the courage, enterprise and dedication to overcome all adversity in a noble cause. And that's exactly what director Anthony Asquith provided to the British with the 1943 naval war movie, We Dive at Dawn. After over 60 years, it is not surprising that some of the films are dated. It doesn't help that class stereotypes that help define men enlisted by officers can be strident. Here, as in so many other British war films, men always have thick regional accents of the working class while the officers speak with cultured fluency that would put them at ease in the best institutions of the British ruling class. In this film, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the Sea Tiger submarine, is intelligent, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, fun with his peers, ready to make a decision. And it helps that he's lucky. His men are nice, for the most part, competent in their work and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the film getting to know these people while they are on vacation, after which things get quickly tense. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his divers are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They just lose the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads for the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides that the Sea Tiger will go after, through the minefields, the anti-sub networks and with the real risk of not having enough fuel to return to the starting base. After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger releases six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it has done its job. After a clever subterfuge, Taylor overcomes a couple of German destroyers but then realizes that there is not enough fuel. He plans to sink his submarine and surrender when, at the very last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who had been grumpy and lonely and speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal village that was been a filing fuel. He thinks it could still be for the Germans. The last third of the film is an unleashed action sequence, as the crew of the sub tries to keep the Germans at bay long enough to pump enough fuel to bring the marine tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda film, so don't expect it to fail. And did the sea tiger actually knock down Brandenburg? Are the men reunited with their wives and girlfriends? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and little son who let him smile for once? Has Freddie Taylor finally had the chance to use all those feminine names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, such as One of Our Aircraft Missing by Powell's and Pressburger and The 49th Parallel, are still standing for today's vision because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious stenographic clichés. Others, such as We Dive at Dawn, were made with a sufficient number of clichés which, by observing, we must remind ourselves of how bad the time in which the film was made was. However, Asquith can create a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The sea tiger that made its way through a subnet was tense. The stalking of Brandenburg and the tracing necessary for the launch of the torpedo were realistic; John Mill's absurd attitude as he prepared to attack was well managed. The fake preparations to make the Sea Tiger look like it had been destroyed by depth charges were so realistic, both inside and out, as one could hope for, and the battle for fuel storage was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-made and well-made example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> John Mills, it's worth noting, has had a long, long career. Especially in the fifties, he played a number of serious films that look back to those days of World War II. It had the quality of showing the grit, the joy and the perseverance, but also of being reliable, a man of which England could be proud while fighting the war. Top-billed in this film was Eric Portman, an excellent actor with a unique voice and the ability to give such cool looks that you'd like to wear a sweater. All the subtitles are very busy in the playful but rigid mode, but Portman handles a certain complexity for his character. Mills and Portman have done great jobs working together on this film.
