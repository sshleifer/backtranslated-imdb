it's a movie to watch on TV and only once .. I mean, it's good, but it's a bit too long and the plot is so famous, it's not very original but it's not boring. the best thing about the film is the performances, Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon are great actresses and in this film they did a great job. I give him a 7.
