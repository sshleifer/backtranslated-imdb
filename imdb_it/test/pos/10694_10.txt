This is an action-packed film that makes me feel very calm and relaxed whenever I see it. The film (apart from its conclusion) shows that in the face of extreme probabilities, it is still possible to prevail. <br /> <br /> This film is very refreshing and will probably be banned at any time. Get a copy of it before the thought police burn up any copies they can find. They don't want you to have hope for the future, or you think you have a chance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if Political Correctness could not suppress it, this would be an excellent film to be released on DVD. Such a version could contain interviews with the writer and the director and related goodies. I'm sure he would sell some copies, and I'd be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Mincka
