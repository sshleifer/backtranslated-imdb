This film is so different from anything you've seen before. It is an honest and chilling account of the battle of an entire family with a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> 'The Closer She Gets' is shot in a very unique style. Craig Oulette films in a very different way ... using different angles and points of view, in what I find is a very captivating way (perhaps because of his experience with photographic works). <br /> <br /> His style gives such a clear image not only of what the patient is facing, but also of what her loved ones have to do. <br /> <br /> A very sad film, but extremely interesting and unique. One would certainly recommend watching.
