Even a decade later "Frontline" aired on ABC, as far as I can tell, "news" programs still use the same tricks again and again. From time to time, "Today Tonight" and "A Current Affair" hide behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, yet they feed on nothing but tired stories about weight loss and shady dealers, shameless network promotions and senseless celebrity pieces of red. Having often been subjected to that void without fun between "The Simpsons" at 6:00 pm and "Sale of the Century" (or "Temptation") at 7:00 PM, I was all too aware of the little tricks these shows would use to attract votes. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, four rising comedians ?? Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner ?? they were also too aware of all this, and they turned their frustrations into one of the most wickedly hilarious media satires you'll ever see on television. The four entertainers had already met the comedic success, their previous most memorable television experience on "The Late Show", the brilliant Saturday night variety show that lasted for two seasons from 1992 to 1993, and also fellow comedians Mick Molloy, Tony Martin, Jason Stephens and Judith Lucy. <br /> <br /> "Frontline" boasts a collection of colorful characters, each with its own distinct and bizarre personality. The current show is directed by Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), a well-groomed, ambitious, pretentious and obtuse narcissist. Does Mike work under the illusion that the show is serving a vital role for the company ?? it is always adamant that "they maintain their journalistic integrity" ?? and its executive producers stood out in convincing him to believe it. Mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people; sometimes it occurs to him that he is brought to the nose, but usually this thought is erased by appeals to vanity or promises of a promotion. <br /> <br /> Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is the elderly female journalist on the show. She is constantly worried about her appearance and her public profile and, if the voices are to be believed, she has had a romantic bond with almost all existing male celebrities. Another equally amoral reporter, Marty Di Stasio, is played by Tiriel Mora, who memorably interpreted the inept lawyer Dennis Denuto in the classic Australian comedy, "The Castle". Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is the Line Producer on the show, and the single shining beacon of morality on the set of "Frontline". Then there is the very entertaining weatherman, Geoffrey Salter (Santo Cilauro), Mike's best friend and confidant. Geoff makes a living by always accepting Mike's opinion, and laughing out loud at his jokes before admitting he doesn't get them. <br /> <br /> For each of the three series of shows, we are treated to a different EP, executive producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), who unfortunately passed away in 1995, runs the program during Season 1. He has a decent set of morals, and is always courteous to his employees, and yet he is more than willing to put these favors aside of high valuations. Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives on the set of Season 2, a tough-nosed, smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to tighten Mike; the last episode of season two, when Mike finally gets the better of him, is a classic moment. Graeme "Prowsey" Prowse (Steve Bisley), EP for the third season, is rude, unpleasant and shamelessly sexist. It is therefore noteworthy that in the end he gets to like him. <br /> <br /> With its cast of distinctive and exaggerated characters, "Frontline" enjoys a lot of satirizing current affairs programs and their questionable methods of getting votes. Many of the episodes have been shot quickly and at low cost, often implementing many story ideas from recent real life situations, but this has never really diminished the actuality of the show for ten years. The famous cameos come in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances including Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and Jon English. Pay attention to the exhilarating aspect of Harry Shearer in the episode "Changing the face of current affairs" of the second season, interpreting Larry Hadges, an American hired by the network to reform the show. <br /> <br /> Especially in the third season, I noticed that "Frontline" boasted an extremely gritty form of black humor, unusual for such a light comedy show. Brooke really funny moments that are surreptitiously corrupt to abort, kill from a crazy madman and betray Mike betraying the hopes and dreams of his best friend, only to be told he is a good friend. The last minute of the series ?? minus a scene added during the credits, which was probably added if a fourth season were to be produced ?? it was probably the biggest, the blackest ending of a comedy series I've seen before. <br /> <br /> Below is a very indicative list of my first five "Frontline" favorite episodes, but, don't make mistakes, every single half hour is an absolutely hilarious and incisive satire. <br /> <br /> 1) "The Siege" (Season 1) <br /> <br /> 2) "Give 'him enough rope" (Season 2) <br /> <br /> 3) " Addicted to Fame "(Season 3) <br /> <br /> 4)" Basic Instincts "(Season 2) <br /> <br /> 5)" Add sex and mix "(Season 1)
