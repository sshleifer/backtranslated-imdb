There is a great danger when you watch a film that has had such a profound impact on you the first time, that 20 years later, it will not retain the same magic as before. I have to admit that I didn't expect it to be as beautiful as I remembered it but to be pleasantly surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as I remember it when I was 12 years old. This film has a certain kind of brilliance that not many films possess. It's compelling, it's brilliantly acted and, above all, it makes me feel like a child again and there aren't many things that can do it. The albums of John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden in this film are 1st class and I had forgotten how good they were until now. I urge any parent of teenagers to sit and watch this and see if it has the same effect on them as it did with me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10.
