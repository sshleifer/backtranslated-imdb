I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The film contained many different places. I really liked it when Ann Hampton realized she couldn't make her love with Rhett. And when Scarlett and Ann, where together and Ann apologize for taking Rhett and Scarlett, they just told her not to worry about her taking it back. He had a beautiful story he told. You can't just compare it to GWTW. He has only so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT and GWTW! Of course, don't forget to have a handkerchief at hand.
