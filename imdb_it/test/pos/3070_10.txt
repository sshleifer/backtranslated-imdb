SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Mel did it. From the opening credits to the end credits, this film has straight laughter. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comic force. Cary Eewes brings the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills when the plot is pulled by Robin Hood. From the beginning this film proclaims that there is no need to be taken seriously. If you take a time machine and give thoughts to the characters of today's antics, you will get this movie. What makes this film special? Throughout the film we see blinken and acuhu walking side by side becoming great friends as Robin Hood's helpers. But Blinken is never told or fails to understand that he is black, until the crowd says "a black sheriff", Blinken replies "It's black". This is a timeless scene. Simple one of the most interesting films of our time.
