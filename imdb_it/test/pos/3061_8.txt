This film has to come out on DVD because it's the only way I'll buy it. I thought it was so funny because there wasn't a real plot for it. It didn't have to be a winning movie at the Oscar. I appreciate those movies. Cary Elwes was a very nice Robin Hood. I can't even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good. Anyway peace out !!!!
