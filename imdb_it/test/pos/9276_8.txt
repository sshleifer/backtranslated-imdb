I suspect that there are several cuts in this show that go around. The copy I saw focused heavily on Joe's erotic films and referred to his passing horror production. There are numerous X-rated films presented in their X-rated glory and EMMANUELLE'S legendary "snuff" movie in AMERICA (breasts cut off) has a generous time for the screen. <br /> <br /> The interviews with the nicest Joe are informative and candid. He is a modest and unpretentious gentleman and discusses his interest in the shocking public, because he wanted to mix erotic with horror and how he could have been responsible for one of his artists who turned into gay. <br /> <br /> His friendship and the working relationship with the Indonesian beauty of Laura Gemser is moving, as is his indifferent attitude to hardcore shooting. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato personifies an incredible period in continental cinema that has now passed. It's nice to see a documentary dedicated to him and his excellent and unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
