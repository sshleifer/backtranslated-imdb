OK ... the movie (like Segal's latest films) goes one more time "throw them down, kick them in the groin, shoot them in the face, take revenge on the bad guys for hurting my sister's cousin." Seagal stuff was for a bit '. Geepers, Steven started thinking and using his dollars to make movies with real ideas. SAFE .... there is a lot of action in this film, but also a bit of thought and heart. It's not an Oscar movie, but it's worth it, unless the viewer is so prey to brain violence that it hurts to have to think for more than a second. Well worth a rental..or two !!
