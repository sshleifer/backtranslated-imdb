This film is a perfect example of Barkers' film gifts for the horror / monster genre. I thought this film did a great job of preserving the feel and appearance of the novel and comics (or, actually, the comics may have come second, I forgot). This film was made for Barker fans. It helps to read the book in advance, but it is not so important if you can follow a movie. I have seen anyone out of the question this film, read the book, then review the film. You could find a new respect for the film. I came to this movie with a big fan of Barker and, after reading the book previously, I loved the movie instantly. There are great cameos, makeup, writing, directing, etc. In this film. This movie does something that most monster / horror movies fail miserably, show the monsters. They are there in color, not hidden in the shadows and occupy most of the time on the screen. Unlike other films that use fast cuts or plays of light to hide the creature, this film celebrates the grotesque and puts them in the foreground as good guys. Two thumbs up Clive. We are waiting for the thief of all time :)
