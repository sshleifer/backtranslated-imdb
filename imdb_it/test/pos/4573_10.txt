The idiocracy felt like Mike Judge took my views on the company and included them in the film. In fact, the film is a social commentary. It almost seems like a documentary sometimes. Luke Wilson did a good job playing a boring middle joe (as in most of his films). The Corsican Idiocracy was an extreme of the current state of society. But this is what makes most comedies fun, an extreme of any situation. Fiction is not very different from reality. <br /> <br /> With children who praise the materialistic culture of hip-hop and are proud to be ignorant. When people feel useless in life, they reproduce. Giving them a purpose in the world. And it just seems that the worst people reproduce more. I can understand how others don't like it. Most jokes about second-grade bathroom humor don't help. Not much different from a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> The ideocracy throws away all logic (for good reason), logic, reason. Mike Judges' return was a knockout.
