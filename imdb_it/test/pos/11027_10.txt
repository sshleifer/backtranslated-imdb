I saw this film in 75 and this film was a kind of mental openness to me about how important it is to take care of Natur and Wild's life. When I got a dog in 1983, I called it TRUSKA (in the movie ... Avakun's dog) to never forget this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, I have a copy of this movie, but it is in Portuguese and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (I recorded almost 20 years ago and in fast SLP. so the quality is not so good ..) <br /> <br /> If someone wants a copy ... I'll try to convert to DVD and can I send you OK? <br /> <br /> Ot's a great movie and I agree that it is a movie to always watch. <br /> <br /> Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
