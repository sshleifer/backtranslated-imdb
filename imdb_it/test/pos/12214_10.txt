I don't think that sixty percent of the voters voted this show as ten now how the hell is the score of a five point out of eight impossible I don't understand, it's totally pathetic I mean how. however the show is beautiful the story is fantastic and the characters are interesting, surely a ten out of ten for my part I think the creatures are fantastic have a good look and I would like to have a great nimrod great show I hope there is a second series as a lot went unanswered in the first season and when it's nimrod it will get bigger as the rest of the creatures are huge, again because the rating is so low when the grades were so high <br /> <br /> 10/10
