This is an example of what film school teachers would call a good debut film. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerrilla warfare, nothing set (only abandoned buildings) and perhaps an empty hospital wing. Moreover, even the black and white film was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low cost rather than for the film effect, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was as incredible as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you. An economic film, well thought out and cheap. <br /> <br /> Released in 1983, this would have been accomplished shortly before the art of spectacular loose change was perfected by the Hollywood film production engine and the creation of films was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and more needy than the right people in the right places compared to today's Internet-enabled world, so Luc Besson would have had to do a lot of negotiation and promise to achieve this, which makes the final product even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> But, once again, the French film industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know that Luc Besson is Belgian, but the film is a French production) and was the source of many Hollywood remakes. <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, it is that the cover image on the DVD (and perhaps the original sales poster) has no resemblance to any film and seems to be a rather bizarre image rather than representative of any of the movements The themes of E - at first glance, seems to be a man in post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but at the second inspection he reveals a man in armor with a spear on an office chair with his legs on a desk in a reclining, self-confident posture. This never happens in the movie once. <br /> <br /> It is a black and white film, zero dialogue, physical acting, narrow scenes and brilliant actors that make this film worth adding to your private film collection. A superb film.
