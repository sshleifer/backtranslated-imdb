This film had everything I needed in a movie: - Women, skateboards, violence, music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk !!! the artwork and camera effects in this film are amazing. The music in this film is the best I've ever heard in other films. Every track goes so well with its scene. I thought the acting was really good considering that none of the Bams members had ever been in the drama films. Although the whole concept of the film is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren) who is sleeping with Hellboy behind him is a predictable and ancient story. The way in which the play is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and the gas tank, Raab Stesso, Dunn breaking bottles behind the wawas and all the scenes of Don Vito. This movie is a must see!
