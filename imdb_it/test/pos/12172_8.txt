First of all, I come from Monaco, where this film takes place, and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including the stupid dialect! I know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the film was just an assembly of their already known lines, but it is not! Jokes have evolved through history and make sense in their own special way. But if you absolutely don't like Erkan and Stefan, the hands of this movie. Everyone else - it's worth seeing!
