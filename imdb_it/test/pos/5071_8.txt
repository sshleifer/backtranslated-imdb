CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) arrives to see his first secret interrogation when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of having contact with a well-known terrorist bomb manufacturer. Anwar's wife (Witherspoon) is frantic about where her husband is. <br /> <br /> Do you not only hate yourself when a movie title sends you to a dictionary? I must have an old edition because this Rendition is not a piece of music. No, it's the way the government legally takes a resident or citizen somewhere to question him and possibly use some torture to get the information he wants. <br /> <br /> While watching this film, I recalled a similar plot on the Crossing Jordan TV show (now offline), and I expect we will see even more of these plots. It is inevitable The events of 911 are the catalysts. <br /> <br /> This is difficult to look at because we don't like to see people being tortured and our government is not telling the truth about things. We like the idea that whatever happens or happens, we can go somewhere to find the answers, but when that door is closed to us, we are really lost and hopeless like Anwar's wife. <br /> <br /> Everyone's performances were first class and it is possible that we can see more of Igai Naor (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because it looks and can act like Telly Savalas. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Gender: No, Nude: No, Language: Yes
