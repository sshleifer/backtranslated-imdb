WARNING: potential Spoilers in sight! <br /> <br /> "Steven Spielberg presents Tiny Toon Adventures" has always been one of my favorite cartoons that grow (heck, it still is). And this film perfectly captures everything I love about the show and puts it in complete form. <br /> <br /> Beautifully animated by the Shinsa studio of Tokyo Movie (WB has outsourced every project of "Tiny Toons", and this was the best studio to manage the show), the film starts at the end of the school year of Acme Looniversity, the famous cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny (without relationship) and their teenage peers learn from the masters of animated madness, looney Tunes. After the final bell, the film is divided into five different plots. Buster engages Babs in a water fire fight that culminates with an explosive dam and a tidal wave, sending Buster, Babs and Elmyra Byron's dog downstream on an inverted picnic table in search of adventures in the deep south. Plucky Duck talks with Hamton Pig and his family to let him come with them to Happy World, "The happiest place in the Western hemisphere", but he has to endure a terrible car ride and the threat of a chainsaw-armed hitchhiker. Elmyra's Furball cat finally escapes, but she is not discouraged ... not when there are many "aminals" to play with at the Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume dedicates her summer to kick out her heartbreaker, movie star Johnny Pew, in the hope of getting an autograph. Of course, the hotel in which it is located is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon founds a preaching booth on the Acme Acres runway ... and lets her mind her day off when Fowlmouth takes her to watch the horror movie "Skunkophobia". <br /> <br /> All these stories the lines are frankly hilarious and some overlap at the end. The only complaint I have with this film is that it does not make full use of Tiny Toons' roster - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie have only one scene, Gogo Dodo appears only at the beginning and end of the film, and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper are nowhere to be found. However, they are excusable flaws in an otherwise perfect movie. This film is quite rare today, since it is over 12 years old and has never been released on DVD as far as I know, but I highly recommend tracking it down - whoever is a fan of Warner Bros. animation, classic or contemporary, NEEDS to watch this movie
