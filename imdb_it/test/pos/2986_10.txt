An extraordinary film, which highlighted all the feelings I felt when I was much, much younger. I loved it and the music of Elton John. I remember seeing in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I never knew anyone else who saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams that inspired me from decades ago never left me, and reviewing the film recently made me all hurry back, I confess, however, that my children (at 20 ) have never had a similar emotional charge. A generational thing? <br /> <br /> Why isn't it on DVD?
