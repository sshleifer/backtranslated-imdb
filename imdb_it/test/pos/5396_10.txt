Some might think that Imaginary Heroes is a film exactly like "Igby Goes Down", but it is not. In Imaginary Heroes, the director makes us feel for the Travis family and for the people around them. <br /> <br /> The film itself is fantastic and the acting is extremely well done. Weaver's and Hirsch's acting is believable and helps make the film what it is. The actors, the director / screenwriter, Dan Harris, have made a film that many people should see. I don't think this is just another kid movie, it's a film about a family and their problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 10/10 because I think it is not the best film, that no film can be, but it is as close as possible to perfect.
