I saw this film for the first time at the Istanbul Film Festival in 1994. It was so beautiful that I brought two friends with me and went to see him again the same week. The characters are very well interpreted and the humor here and there is surprising. It's definitely a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes make you feel that you are watching an episode of Friends with much more sophisticated lines. I guess I'll put it in my VCR and watch it again tonight ...
