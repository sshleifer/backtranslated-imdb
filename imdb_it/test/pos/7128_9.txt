This innovative film is truly a work of art. I went to the screening at the congress in Indiana with very low expectations, having already seen 2 other "gamer" films in the title (both were so bad that at the end of the second I had torn off my eyes with my straw and a coiled paperclip that I found between the seat cushions). But from the opening credits "Dorkness" made me. The setting of the temperate northwest has been the backdrop to the drama surrounding the frustrated game master, Lodge (masterfully played by Nathan Rice) and his group of misfit friends who put aside the real-life dramas they face every day to deal with fantastic dramas in the environment Lodge provides them. After the first scene (set in the fantasy world in which they live) they are violently repulsed in the world in which they desperately try to escape. This has had so many comparisons with my life that I was moved to tears. Rice's acting is of such an incredible caliber that I really believed in the first 20 minutes of the film that he was really a twenty year old male suffering from frustration, male baldness and an annoying group of "friends" who can't understand concepts like right and wrong . Lodge's friends are of some note here: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job, apart from the lodge. Yet he seems to gravitate socially towards Gary, the youngest of the group. This seems only slightly strange in the beginning, until you realize that Gary is, in effect, a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his "fantastic" world. This dichotomy serves, not to confuse, but to inform and raise the public about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint is that the actors portraying Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) seem to play the characters sometimes to laugh, as if they had been informed that they were acting in a comedy instead of a hard hit action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of Lodge's diverse team. the tension is always high when it is on the screen, both when he passionately argues about his beliefs at Lodge or when he shows his fantastic Martial Arts skills like "Silence" his fantasy character. Or even when he suddenly turns around to face the audience and you reflexively respond to the audience to avoid being struck by his fantastic chin. Lewis illuminates the screen regardless of what he is doing and I hope to see more in the future. Once the action starts in this movie, it doesn't close. drama and action come together so perfectly that sometimes you can tell whether you are in the middle of a frantic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment. Truly a thrill of epic proportions, I would recommend "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" as a visual display for those who love cinema. It's almost worth losing sight of. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Deedlenick
