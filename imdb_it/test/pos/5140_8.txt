I took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and appealed to all of us. I agree with the other post, the Wilson boy worked a thankless script in a great minor character. It's nice to have a movie for a certain demographic age (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in middle schools. You had to love how well Jimmy Buffet was a good teacher. He kept us awake adults. The level of authority of the children in question has been kept reasonable. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. rebel. The setting and the music were beautiful. Overall, if you liked Holes, this is very similar.
