Being a big fan of horror, especially of Asian horror, I saw a lot of movies, but this is great. Why? It has a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror films). The actors did a good job. It looks like a real documentary film (even if it isn't). It doesn't get boring for a moment. The director skillfully combines the plot with the acts of a certain Japanese magical cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but it is still credible). It reminded me of the equally important film "Forbidden Siren". For me the only annoying thing about the film was the Hori character, the psychic, but this is subjective. <br /> I recommend this movie to all quality horror fans. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
