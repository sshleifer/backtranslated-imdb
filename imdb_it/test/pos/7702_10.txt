A great suspense thriller, acting is top notch and the plot makes you think. This well executed and direct film is based on a true story and is worth it, while Joe Penny is very well played and Ann Gillian is as convincing as her worried and terrified sister. Joe still shows that his acting ability is surprising and the ending well done. It is worth looking at, I hope they repeat it soon on any channel, I will definitely record it. For Penny and Gillian fans it's worth it. Rent it if you can still try to buy it. Perfect thriller of the early nineties, watch this movie <br /> <br /> is fantastic.
