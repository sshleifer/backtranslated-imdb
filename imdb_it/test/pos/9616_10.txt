As a fan of Kung Fu movies, I have to say this is one of the best I've ever seen. Of course, there is nothing special about the plot, but the man makes it fun. Like most movies like that. This film is full of action and does not dream of its viewers. It's so damn funny when I watch that I have a smile on my face all the time. This also has an impact on films of the future like Kill Bill. (Many of Kill Bill's sound effects come from this film, for example.) This is an essential vision for all viewers known in Kung Fu. The open form to close this film is full of struggles that are really among the best I've seen in the genre. There are a few Kung Fu movies out there that measure themselves with the pure magic and entertainment of this movie. So if you're looking for a great Kung Fu movie, check this out for sure.
