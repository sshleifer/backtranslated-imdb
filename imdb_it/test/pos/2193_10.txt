I saw my videotape last night for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances as compelling as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course, was the master of Sweeney's role; there is never a touch of sweetness in his determination to take revenge on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex representation, like Mrs Lovett. He realized that Sondheim wanted this role to be something of a "comic" counterpart to Sweeney; and even brings a bit of tenderness in his courtship of Sweeney and his education to the boy Tobias. For those with long memories, this performance returns to his debut performance in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; long before Murder, He wrote. Only a year ago I saw the musical at the Lyric Opera in Chicago. with the current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others have commented on the operatic quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works best with actors who can at least manage vocal lines, rather than with opera singers who have limited acting skills. As a final note, I praise the artist who played Tobias. with his loyalties and confusion about what is happening around him. It seemed appropriate that he had practically the last word.
