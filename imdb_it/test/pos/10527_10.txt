Great adaptation of Christie's novel. Surprising attention to authentic details of the period for the time (Many films of the mid-70s and early 80s that try to make the 20s, beginning of the 30s for my taste, so they foresaw the worst here, and they were glad they turned out to be wrong) The costumes and set designs are very well done. Did I really like this production ?? largely thanks to the lovely interpretation of Francesca Annis of a carefree, young lady "Frankie" and the charming Bobbie by James Warwick. The pair would continue to play Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is funny as some contemporary book critics have compared Frankie and Bobby to his first Tommy & Tuppence characters. The supporting characters were equally well made ?? the sublime Mrs. Rivington (played by Miss Marple as Joan H.) and "Badger" is perfectly interpreted as the post of the First World War, "Tipo Bertie Wooster".
