Jewel Thief is * THE * Bollywood crime thriller, and why shouldn't it be? It is directed by the greatest exponent of Indian cinema thriller Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could see this film for one of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br /> <br /> 1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 RD Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri lyrics <br /> <br /> Even if Jewel Thief is not a James Bond movie, it certainly has the obliged girls. Helen, Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos). But our sauv√© Vinay (Dev Anand) is everything but Bond. It is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story almost always leads to confusion as we do. He also flirted with Anju (Tanuja) trying to hit his romantic nerve, only to be employed in his father's shop. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand could have a double role - well, I don't want to ruin your movie, otherwise I would have told you. This is what most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store and there is a robbery when he should be at work - even if he isn't, or at least he has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did it, it's Dev Anand as 'Vijay' the person who claims to be or is 'Amar' someone we haven't seen yet, but many people claim it's his appearance. Shalu (Vyjayanthimala) arrives who claims to be her boyfriend, in a tense situation Dev Anand must prove to be Vinay and not Amar. While everyone wonders if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, he is asked to take off his socks. Amar is told that he has 6 digits on one of his feet. As we watch in suspense the events that are about to unfold Dev Anand even finds time to joke. <br /> <br /> The brothers of real life, director Vijay Anand and actor Dev Anand, have many films among them, not the best of them, but certainly the best in Crime Thriller. <br /> <br /> There are moments of Hitchcock's North By Northwest, but the films are very different. Except for the confusion over who is who, a perfidious female protagonist and many journeys, there is not much similarity. Dev Anand could very well be Amar besides being Vijay. People have seen it, they identify it wherever he goes. There are too many people for whom this is a fraud. In the end Vinay thinks it's better to take Amar with him to find out what the truth is, and it's a sad mistake. He immerses himself too much, only to be saved from the twists of the cinema. <br /> <br /> When I watched the film as a child I was not at all amused, the ending completely confused me. Even now there are parts on the ending that I don't like, but I'd still recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Even as a child I enjoyed the songs that this film has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a decidedly mocassed song in the voice of Kishor Kumar. I could hear Rulake gaya ... all day. Ditto for 'Aasmaan ke neeche' which is set 'under the skies' of Gangtok (at least the plot suggests it). 'Raat akeli hai' among the sexiest song that will come out of Hindi cinema with Tanuja as the seductress. 'Meri taraf dekho' - Helen's cabaret and we 'look at it'. 'Hothon pe ...' - now, there could be a better thriller than a song of this. As the song progresses, we are more tense than we have ever been and the words "hidden in Shalu's lips" are added to it.
