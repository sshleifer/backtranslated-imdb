LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among the submariners as renegade and nonconformist (* known to the reader: Maverick does not mean "Tom Cruise". Maverick means "nonconformist".), Actually he is an intelligence agent of his Vice Admiral submarine fleet. The vice-admiral is worried about our old Russian friends who host shipyard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Libya, North Korea or Iraq would like to get their hands on this child and put a nuclear warhead in the port of Norfolk or in Mayport, Florida. And this was 6-7 years before 9/11. <br /> <br /> The Admiral assigns Dodge to take command of a World War II diesel submarine and mounts an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO, a top of the line fast attack sub. Dodge takes the lead and in no time he lashes the bears of bad news .. err, I mean his lovely group of extravagant warrior submarines. Despite having "welcome aboard" tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and loyal commander, does not choose favorites and delegates authority responsibly. US NAVY could not have invented a more refined piece of recruitment propaganda than this gem little appreciated by the "Police Academy" creator.
