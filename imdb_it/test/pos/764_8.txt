I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written film with a group of great actors. It was fun and showed that Rupert Grint could play more of his best-known character than Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and the great acting of everyone else made this film very nice. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I imagine he can be called "assistant" to Evie, a retired actress. In the beginning, it's just a way to make some money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben get out of his shell a little and makes him have fun and be happy with himself, and in the end they both seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a Rupert Grint fan or not, this movie is really fun with some really cool moments. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.
