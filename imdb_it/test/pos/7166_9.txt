This was a wonderful little film that was really creative and fun - something you see too rarely in movies. The film begins in Russia immediately after the fall of the communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone. Dirty cities, criminality and lack of housing still afflict the poor residents of St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> In this scene of squalor and uncertainty comes an idealistic music master. He is among those without a home and FINALLY receives a letter from the government telling him that he has a tiny room in a nearby apartment. When it arrives, the place is a disaster but people seem friendly enough, so everyone has a nice party. In the middle of the night, they are awakened by an elderly lady who comes out of the giant wardrobe of the room (I was half waiting for Lucy and the other guys from THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE to come out, but they didn't do it). They are too shocked to do anything at first, but they soon decide to investigate. Instead of being just a wardrobe, the wardrobe opens in Paris! The way residents of the apartment respond to this magical door is truly intriguing. Some, like the music teacher, are thrilled and amazed. Most others are more pragmatic and deal mainly with looting everything from Paris before the gateway closes once and for all! These Russian thieves are horrible people - greedy, coarse and crude but deep - VERY DEEP - they are hearts of gold. I like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the verge of capitalism. At first, they go wild grabbing everything they can and only later reveal a bit of depth - but mostly they act like guests in THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The film has many twists and is both fun and mesmerizing. The only downside is that due to harsh language and a nude scene (although very funny), this is not a children's movie. This is a real shame, because with some minor changes, this may have been a great family movie.
