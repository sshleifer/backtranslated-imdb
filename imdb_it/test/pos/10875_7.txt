Movies about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfers. <br /> <br /> I took it in an art cinema here in America in 1981. Technically I was still a teenager (I was 19) so I was interested to see how Australian teenagers worked. Script essay there is nothing new here. Show the usual teenage adventures that deal with dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what would have happened before, but I was never bored. What I found interesting is that, despite the accent and some changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers are not very different from American teenagers. They had many of the same difficulties and difficulties. This was also based on a book by a real surfer girl and her real life adventures and (I heard) was a faithful adaptation of it. The acting was OK but the actors were attractive and this was well done and quite interesting. So this is not an unseen masterpiece, but a fairly accurate portrait of what it means to be a teenager and try to be with popular children. I give him a 7.
