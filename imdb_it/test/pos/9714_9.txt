It seems that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say "Maha Go Go Go" .... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... pronounced maa - ka "... <br /> <br /> I grew up with this series in the early 1970s here in Los Angeles in the late MOLTO channel 56 ... First there was Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy), dating back to 1963 on the old KHJ TV. Astro Boy it was the first example of anime on TV that we got in the US I was a kid of souls and I followed it until the end of the 80s when, at that point, it would become a series of ill-animated "talking heads" ", a phenomenon that has only gotten worse." Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As for "Speed ​​Racer", I really liked the basics, the POV shots, the cinematographic aspects of the action from alive cleverly adopted for animation ... This was quite typical of most Japanese anime then ... Graphic Graphics Graphics! Take note sometimes of how obviously the s erie was inspired by the movie "Grand Prix" by Stanley Kramer (1966), in particular the American credits ... <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I have the original comics from which the series is based, so I know of which I speak. <br /> <br /> What were we doing animation-wise as well as crap like Johnny Quest? ..... the same old stuff we've been doing since the 1920s ... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I think the real problem I had / had with the way the anime was / is shown on American TV is the ax work done on scripts, credits, etc. to "sanitize" them for the American public ... I will not go to other programs since we are talking about "Speed ​​here. <br /> <br /> Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here, since he was 99% responsible for the rewrites of the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and the goofs of Trans / Lux (Think Felix the Cat and the mighty Hercules - oy vey!) They took one elegant and very sophisticated show and have taken it to the level of Sesame Street Think of "Cruncher Bloch", "Forthebird Company", "Skull Duggery" ... If I keep throwing up. <br /> <br /> This series dates back to 40-odd years ago, but I, at the time, was sharp enough to feel insulted by the exhaustion of this and other Japanese programs ... I mean, it's obvious when someone is killed but they remove it or ignore ........ Pleeeeeze! <br /> <br /> Good show - originally, unfortunately all the most recent incarnations of the series they have that aspect of "made in Korea" CRAPPY, not to mention being a nauseating "pc" in content. Even the Japanese outsource their animation now .. <br /> <br /> Try looking at the original Japanese opening on YouTube sometimes ... It gives me chills to the spine ..... If only .. .... Oh good.
