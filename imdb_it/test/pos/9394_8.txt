Hmmmm. I'm rather at a loss here. I mean, I know I liked the bed of death, I know I will spread the gospel of the death bed to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you're reading this, I urge you to see the bed of death, but I can't really say why Perhaps this is the secret of its charm. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, a little. There is this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases and anything else that comes close to you) by sucking them into its mattress full of digestive fluid. Among his almost limitless powers, Bed has the ability to maintain the spirit of Aubrey Beardsley trapped behind an image to observe and narrate the events of the film. Several people end up in Bed's abandoned villa (Bed's habit of eating everything that moves has given the place an unpleasant reputation), and it lies down for sex, or a nap, or because they don't feel well and come eaten, sometimes before having dream dreams. And in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between Beardsley, Bed's mom (you had to be there), and Bed. <br /> <br /> It sounds pretty simple, when I put it this way, doesn't it? well, except for the part of Aubrey Beardsley. But something feels constantly off-kilter, and the story seems to slip sleepily from one scene to another, even when indulging in cheap laughter or strange blood effects. Imagine Bunel crossed with Bergman, then left to soak in a large tub by Herschell Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story goes from horror, to fable, to comedy, to existential meditation, without breaking the pace - an incredible achievement for a student film without a budget shot in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> All in all, a stunning little film that, most likely, no review can ever do completely justice. Watch it for you.
