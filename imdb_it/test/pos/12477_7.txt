Should we take the opening shot like a strange frame ??? I suppose we have to. In any case two women are behind a closing umbrella, they walk upstairs to the talent agency and we go with them ... and then they will never see each other again. Ok, how come I do NOT INSIDE the place, on the piano, or even outside with the SOUND of the piano, then track in and over, to the Hitchcock ??? So I guess Clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal way to follow a part of post-war society: especially as he uses a song similar to Citizen Kane = cut into about five pieces to show the singing lady traveling from the talent agency to to his first roses and the applause of his debut in Vaudeville. After that we are relentless observers of more or less disgusting details of a defeated country that emerges from its war by tearing apart its ragged knees. And no one has ever handled the little disgust better than Clouzot. In fact, it's a pity that he never tried Sartre's Nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes always makes us slightly sick. .... okay, okay, I'm grossly exaggerating, be content with a general feeling of much of the film. Look carefully, in fact, and you will even see one of the policemen taking his nose. And in how many movies someone has ever done it. Then there's a very strong nose that blows a little in front of the lesbian photographer from the main cop, and realizes that she literally doesn't blink or raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in contiguity, apparently, until you can practically smell every scene, besides seeing it and hearing it. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, others here have treated them in a much more detailed way than me. But forget the mystery here: this is the last McGuffin. Clouzot is interested in the real murderer like those two women who come out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and never see each other again. From the beginning to the end all he wanted to do was follow a group of people around, even if not particularly interesting, and say, here he looks at the spasm of this woman, that man who hitches his pants in all their insignificance, years and years before Tina Turner sang that we didn't need another hero. <br /> <br /> Even the forced lightness of the finish gets grimly in a crumbling part of Paris, and a rather cold apartment with bare walls. With only couples they love each other to see them through, as if to say that there must be two or three million like you in the whole city, working your fingers every day for a little love at night. <br /> <br /> From this it was only a short step to Wages of Fear and the height of despair. <br /> <br /> They don't even know how to make films like this in the United States. Besides, they didn't even know much in France, much less now. The relentless detail of the gesture makes even the neorealists of Italy look like bad psychologists. Which I think Clouzot is a kind of speeding Rosselini. <br /> <br /> Absurdly funny, this movie. The only flaw, it seems to me, and as has been pointed out by another spectator, the protagonist woman is not entirely right. All the others in the film are almost perfectly expressed.
