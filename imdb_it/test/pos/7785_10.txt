In my opinion, a film can be evaluated based on the number of "best scenes" there are. There are probably at least 80-90 scenes in the whole film that is probably considered "the best" by someone or another. <br /> <br /> This film is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who called him ahead of time, probably because he was bombed at the box office. However, I think that every generation can relate to this film and have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I am personally happy that Mahmood is also part of the film. His role is not that 'meaty', however it is nice to see that he is part of the cast in the funniest Hindi movie ever.
