I managed to record THE DION BROTHERS, out of the TV show, (with commercials), in the early 1980s. I have lent it to many friends, all of whom agree that it is one of the best "bandit" films ever made. One day, as I walked into my New York apartment, I saw Stacy Keach shoot a scene for her TV series, Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to chat, and I told him how much I liked THE DION BROS, and I considered it a pure classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable cinematic experiences of his career. He was very friendly and sincere, and I was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan. This is a classic that must be on DVD.
