I'm not sure how it could have been better, so I gave a 10. The acting was excellent - the main woman was so HOT - the guy who played Darwyn was a smoldering and thoughtful character who showed the inner turmoil he suffered death of the truck driver is an example) in an excellent way. The plot was believable and the length of the series was right (for example, I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As an Englishman, I tend to think of Yanks as a gungo. The Los Angeles police were in their ill-advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were positively portrayed. My main thought on programs like this (and also the excellent 24) is - could it happen? Would happen? Is it happening now? Maybe, probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it wouldn't seem. <br /> <br /> In summary - If you haven't seen this, make sure you do it.
