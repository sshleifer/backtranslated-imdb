When I was in seventh grade (in 1977), I was asked to read the novel that this was based on my English studies. I remember being very touched and excited when a TV version came out a year later. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol was a popular television actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the successful TV series "Family". It was clear that she had the range and the ability to do this part. I remember it as a bit "stiff" sometimes, but above all it does a good job. Bring the movie well. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is fantastic like the maid who seems to be the only one in the family who seems really interested in her. Barbara Barrie is also a somewhat frightened and a bit neurotic mother, as is the young Robin Lively (who will eventually appear as the black widow Lana Milford in "Twin Peaks") as the sweet younger sister who appears to be at the center of affection parents. Bruce Davidson is also appropriately attractive as the German soldier of the title <br /> <br /> The best performance, however, belongs to Michael Constantine. It is really powerful and deserved more recognition than it had at the time. The bitterness and coldness it expresses make the scenes in which it appears difficult to look at, but make it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter. Costantino gives everything to the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. <br /> <br /> The film differs from the book only in a few small ways. It's wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope it is released again on video or DVD. <br /> <br />
