This could be my favorite so bad that it's a fantastic movie of all time. like many pre-adolescent children of the 80s, repeating the vision of revenge of the ninja generated a ninja phase of my childhood. I thought of Sho k. he was bad then. Jet Li could take it with both legs in a cast! This film has crossover crowds that include flashdance, the exorcist and Lee Van Cleef Ninja's TV show. ugh. but as a friend of mine he says that anyone who can get a good movie made it a genius to make a movie that starts with a ninja survivor of 17 shotguns long enough to take over the body of an arobics instructor for revenge. Wow. While previous commentators have said that the sword flew out of the closet on the rope, no one has yet faced the powerful love scene. Where the sexy protagonist cop takes off his shirt to reveal a parrot mane. The fun never ends. Rent this !!!!!!
