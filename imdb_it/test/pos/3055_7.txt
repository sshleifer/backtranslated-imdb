The film is not halved as much as people want you to believe it to be. <br /> <br /> What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because he is the last of Laurel and Hardy together and is not the best? Or is it because of Laurel & Hardy's lack of regular customers? Or why is it not produced by Hal Roach studios or 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> Certainly true that this film is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel & Hardy and bring them in the 50s. It is also true that the film is far from their best, but honestly, the film still has fun, making this film even far from their worst. Not the most "goodbye" movie imaginable, but still a fun and suitable farewell. Both retire from the movies after completing this. <br /> <br /> The film still features some moments of slapstick and the chemistry between Laurel and Hardy is obviously still very present. It also makes this film better than most of their films together since the 1940s. Rather a surprise that the slapstick humor still works great, since the times of slapstick comedy were over, since the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The story may not be as fun as it may have been and it has too many sidekicks and characters, with the result that the film loses focus on kids sometimes. A pity, because they are still the ones who bring and really make the film. <br /> <br /> Sad to see in what poor shape Stan Laurel was at the time of making this film. He looked really sick and old, which of course was him too. He was already over 60 years old. But after an operation he recovered completely and lived for another 15 years, before he died in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> A fun, even if not perfect goodbye to the boys, Laurel & Hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous, quality, fun movies that are still seen and loved by people around the world world. <br /> <br /> 7/10
