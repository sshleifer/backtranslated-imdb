Christopher Nolan brought his goals in Seguito in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he pulled out something that reminded me of the kind of great little "poverty" films like Ullmer directed in the 1940s. Only this time, he is able to create touches of homage - things like black and white photography (a given due to the budget of a string of shoes but also essential for the dark cracks in which these characters live) and the casting of the actors (John Doe lead, the disgusting male counterpart, and the beautiful-in-a-wide femme fatale manner) - while maintaining the indie underground in the 90s where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in places and music and all this could be possible. And even Nolan, in the film noir, puts together a clever plot, perhaps even more than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology that took place through an enriched plot looking at the past centimeter after centimeter, here the non-linear structure aims to show how far someone like Bill can pass through a dark path like Cobb , only in an environment where keeping your toes is not for someone who is not really twisted and in Cobb's deeper mind games. <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story, and entering it I wasn't even sure where it would lead, if it could be some sort of stream of consciousness to Slacker wing where Nolan would have taken his character along a British urban character to another. But the establishment of the links between Bill and Cobb is done quickly and excellently, as we see when Cobb approaches Bill at the bar to ask him what's going on after him, he says almost everything we need to know about both: that, and the first robbery with which he carries it forward. What appears to be a good result on the horizon is actually all a great set-up by Cobb and his lady (simply called 'The Blonde', perhaps an obvious tribute to noir, but because it steals). But this is revealed in a way that really made me guess, since the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much about why, but about how. The density is made even more important by the fact that the actors understand their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely conceal his "deep" ideas about what is really the pleasure of a robbery, and Theobald with the demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but he is smarter in that naive way that he has no chance in a humid environment like this; Russell also makes it too easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage to shake her head. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Nolan is also at stake with his cameraman style, holding nothing in what does not add atmosphere and suspense, with fades in / out not too fast to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the "this-could-carry-anywhere" logic of the script. He follows it in the form of a hand as if he knew where his limits are, and yet he is fantastic in maintaining the essentials: close-ups when necessary (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror) and a techno quite simple track that never takes away. Sometimes, as mentioned, the dividing line between seeing something in the news and seeing something that is eternal like a solid history of foals of low-level criminals with mental games and moral ambiguity is never entirely clear, which for me it is practically irresistible in its dark way. In a nutshell, this is one of the great business cards I've seen from a director in recent years and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other works can hope to discover. Or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid-fire and big-gun mainstream dogs (even in independent films) is a brilliant 71 minutes.
