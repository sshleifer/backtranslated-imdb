Writer / director John Milius takes an incident little known in American history and wildly extrapolates himself in all the right ways. The result is a tale of great adventure that showcases two of its stars in memorable and larger roles in life: Sean Connery as the sheikh Arab sheikh with an inexplicable Scottish brogue, and Brian Keith as president Theodore Roosevelt, an itch for the possibility to put that "big stick" of good use. <br /> <br /> Unmeasurably aided by the glorious widescreen cinematography of Billy Williams and the magnificent soundtrack of the ever-reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this initial effort seemed the precursor of a talent to be classified with contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg. Although Milius offered tempting glimpses of his ability in the screenplays of JEREMIAH JOHNSON and APOCALYPSE NOW, his career seemed to have taken a downward turn not long after he started directing, ending up basically on Dreck as CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN. <br /> <br /> Here he hopes he will find his way again.
