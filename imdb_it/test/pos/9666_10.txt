Looking back to that year 2002, when "Furia" was created, the announcer chants of today's new generation in Romania are easily recognized. <br /> <br /> The main qualities of "Fury" are in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a very professional development, as well as a cast of excellent actors. All four main roles are admirably performed, both in depth and randomness: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu have confirmed, since then, being two of our best performers today, Dorina Chiriac follows them closely, and Adrian Tuli, a non-professional ( in real life, a cemetery manager!) plays Gabonu, it was a true revelation! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the direction of Radu Muntean is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of "a fateful night" and an inescapable destiny. You can easily overcome the few clumsy and even moments of failure, as time has shown that it was only the uncertainties inherent in a debut, never repeated in his subsequent films: "Hârtia va fi albastrâ" and "Boogie".
