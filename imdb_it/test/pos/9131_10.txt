you loved The shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, Oldboy .... And I guarantee you will still love this. is a brilliant thriller. The story is so simple yet so compelling. keeps you at the edge of your seat until the end. slow moving scenes, simple music adds more perfection to the film. it's so genuine. the performance is first class in the direction of the sequences ... they are too perfect ... if I could put it among the 10 best thrillers ever made. The funniest thriller I've seen in a while ... ***** / ***** my vote helps me move this film to the first 250 <br /> <br /> that you will love it .. .
