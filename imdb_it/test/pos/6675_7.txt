Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a psychiatric hospital patient who claims to be from a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges), tries to help him as he tries to understand Prot and find out if it really comes from K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This film does not really fall into any particular genre. A big part of K-PAX is the drama / science fiction, another fantasy part, more, add to this a bit of comedy and start to understand what K-PAX is. The plot (as shown above) is not too complicated or profound, but still offers some twists that could still surprise you as they did with me. No film or special effects accompany this film, and there is no need to have them, the music in the film is still great. A techno soundtrack and a fantastic piece of piano make K-PAX shocking and makes certain scenes intriguing. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is the heart of the film and plays a very convincing foreigner (Prot) from the planet K-PAX, emotional with great facial expressions, Spacey does a great job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, who helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges is also excellent on his part. Ponti and Spacey adapt very well and, after all, they have both had a lot of experience. Dr. Powell's wife is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays his part well, demonstrating the frustration of losing his husband and so dedicated to his patient. Alfe Woodard plays Claudia Villars, Dr. Powell's colleague, we don't really see Claudia too much, but overall she performs well. <br /> <br /> K-PAX is classified as PG-13 for "a sequence of violent images and short language and sensuality", and this covers it. As for the "violent images", we don't see too much. Some people have a lot of blood on them, but that's all. The language is as follows: 1 word "f" (wow, just one!), 11 "s" words, and some uses of the Lord's name in vain. Not really bad. The "sensuality" part is since Prot explains to Dr. Powell how playback on K-PAX works, nothing terrible, just something about it seems "to have your crazy people in a vise". Not too bad in terms of content for a PG-13 film, it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, K-PAX is not a bad movie. It won't stun you, but it's fun and fun to watch. It has some fun parts, sad parts, really sad parts and, well, you know what I mean. It's a story about a psychiatric hospital patient, what do you expect? All in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can relax and relax, K-PAX is a well made film. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you've seen this movie before, enjoy it and plan to get the DVD, I highly recommend it. It has a lot of extras to watch, and also an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10
