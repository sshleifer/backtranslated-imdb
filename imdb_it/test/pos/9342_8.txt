Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) must be the biggest video ever made. Friend, you have zombies, cold blood and a catchy melody, what else can you ask for. John Landis mixed elements from Night of the Living Dead and American Werewolf in London and this video came out. What begins as a beautiful evening for a young couple turns into a date from hell, literally. You have zombie dancers, a werewolf in a funky jacket and Vincent Price "rapping". A nice video for a song that everyone in the neighborhood has marked. <br /> <br /> I have to give this a high recommendation because it must be the best music video ever made. There hasn't been another like this. <br /> <br /> Watch "making of Thriller". The documentary contains some "interesting" things.
