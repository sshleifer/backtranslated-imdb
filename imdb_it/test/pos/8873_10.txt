In a very nice spin on Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead an unpleasant life: Larry's ex-wife got rich by publishing a book she wrote and Owen has the most bossy mother imaginable . When Larry tells Owen to calm down by watching "Strangers on a Train", Owen has the idea that they should do cross-killings as in the movie. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> How the idea of ​​"Throwing mum out of the train" came to me I'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. There is no boring moment in it. And that ending was a hoot. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is a witch as much as she is in "The Goonies". A modern classic.
