This film bombed at the box office and in the vote here, but I loved it. A measure of the value of a film is how much you can still remember after 25 years. I won't bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes, even a good story and a great casting. Inept thieves are a hoot. Watch it and judge if it ever arrives at TCM.
