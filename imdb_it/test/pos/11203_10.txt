Following the collapse of Yesilcam (Turkey's response to Hollywood) in the mid-1990s, few but the most cautious observers could have predicted such a recent turn in the Turkish film industry, probably based on the work of former photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. br /> <br /> Uzak is the director's third feature film and forms a sort of trilogy with his two previous photos (Kasaba and Clouds of May), following similar themes and techniques. The film finds Mahmoud, a commercial photographer, who lives alone in a small apartment in Istanbul visited only occasionally by his abrupt and married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, left his village at home after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job. The younger man stays with Mahmoud as he searches in vain for work in the city, drinking in the cafes and nervously observing the young women that he never approaches. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is translated as "Distante" and the film beautifully illustrates every possible connotation of the word; Yusuf's physical distance from his home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him and the generational distance between the two men. <br /> <br /> Ceylan's films rarely contain intense dramas, but allow rich and complete characters to develop from within tightly framed static shots. He plays the role of director, producer, writer, director of photography and co-editor, and he plays relatives and friends in many of the roles. One might expect that such a limited and isolated approach to film production would lead to films that are difficult to infiltrate and connect with most viewers, making Uzak's undisputed humanity even more impressive. <br /> <br /> Ceylan is, however, a better cinematographic formalist than playwright, taking control from old masters of film language like Ozu and Tarkovsky. After seeing Uzak, I can think of a few more suited to the task.
