IN THE LINE OF FIRE, in my opinion, it is an excellent action film / drama / thriller, full of suspense and cutting edge! I thought agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and agent Raines (Rene Russo) were comfortable with the clothing they wore during the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to play with Frank on the phone. He looked good in the tuxedo he was wearing towards the end of the film, though. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between agent Horrigan and agent Raines. Before concluding, I would like to say that the whole cast and crew did an exceptional job, I loved the setting and I've never had enough. Now, in conclusion, all of you Clint Eastwood fans who have not seen this thrilling, cutting-edge action movie / drama / thriller, are highly recommended.
