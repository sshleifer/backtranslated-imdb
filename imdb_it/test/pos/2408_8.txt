I've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it. For those of you who love martial arts and overcome internal conflicts, this is a worthy choice. After seeing this film, I wanted to be a more productive member of society because I could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl seeking acceptance and who needed a path to follow. Of course, Mr. Miyagi always provides his wise advice. 2 inches up!
