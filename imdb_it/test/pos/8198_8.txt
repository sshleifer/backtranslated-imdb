This is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. What makes it interesting is the tragic ruin of the king and all the intrigues of the palace that happen around him. It reminded me of "King Lear" and some of Shakespeare's other comedies. <br /> <br /> The king begins with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under a ruler and to stop all arguments so that people can prosper and lead a better life. He and his childhood love, beautifully interpreted by Li Gong, devise a pattern that pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom to recruit a murderer to kill the king, thus giving him an excuse to go to war. But while she is away, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and revels. <br /> <br /> There are numerous side plots that keep the action going. There is the Marquis, who pretends to be stupid and crazy, but who is really very intelligent and wants to become king himself. He fathers two sons with the king's mother and manages to keep it a secret for years. Then there is the prime minister, a political rival to the king, who turns out to be really his father. <br /> <br /> The killer is a complex character himself. A skilled swordsman and murderer, he is undergoing a reform when the king's lover comes to recruit him. He wants nothing more from killing, but in the end he is conquered by Li Gong (who wouldn't?) When he sees how cruel and cruel the king has become. <br /> <br /> Some spectacular cinemas, especially the battle scenes that are performed on a grand scale, as they said, a cast of thousands of people, literally. The acting is OK, nothing special. It's an interesting story, even if at more than two and a half hours it pushes to the limit. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
