The shadows breathe the smell of the streets of New York like no film before it. This kick-off of Cassavetes directing is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a renewal in American cinema. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it urges you to watch Cassavetes' first work in a double film with another debut, Godard's About souffl√©. Both films have shaped the film production of their countries over decades and both have a particular lightness and swagger that was rarely achieved by those directors in their careers. <br /> <br /> Shadows tells of three African-American brothers, Ben (Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Hurd). The plot is set in the New York jazz environment and the driving rhythms of the soundtrack play a fundamental role for the feverish atmosphere, sometimes almost dreamlike, which attracts the whole film. Not much happens in the plot. The daily life of the three brothers is defined by problems in the love relationship or in their work, but on both levels normality is deceiving. Without gestural moralism, Cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and private life. It was, with regard to the cinematographic representation of racism, a revolutionary film in the United States. <br /> <br /> This film also owes much to the performance of the three main actors who were all almost completely unknown before. Above all, Ben Carruthers established with his energetic portrait the image of a new self-conception of young urban blacks in America, an image that characterizes the Spike Lee films of the 80s and 90s. Evidently, none of these three actors, no doubt extremely talented, was able to start a great career later. Hollywood was not and is not ready to ethnically expand its star system, which is why Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers later found small artistic niches on TV and independent films. <br /> <br /> Maybe Shadows is one of the least "beautiful" movies ever shot, and one of the most beautiful at the same time; a film of shadows and spaces, with a camera that merely looks at the flow of life in crowded street corners, in bars, in hotel lobbies, in apartments, inducing a fascinating walk through the lively streets of New York.
