Jennifer Egan's novel was brought to the screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a film that, based on some comments from the contributors of this forum, seems like a bad proposal, but in reality it is much better than we think. <Br /> <br /> This is a story of two sisters who loved each other very much. Faith, the proud and happy hippy girl, brings her younger sister, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe clearly loves Faith; when the eldest decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf to Europe for a summer vacation at Berkley, she promises she will send Phoebe a postcard every day. Faith does it, until the cards stop entering and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them that Faith died in tragic circumstances. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can't forget Faith. That's why, after a few years, he decides to take the same path taken by his older sister. He picks up papers from Faith and visits every place, starting in Amsterdam, then moving on to Paris and wants to finish the trip to Portugal, where Faith met his premature death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, Phoebe connects with Wolf, who is no longer a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf, try to convince Phoebe to leave her journey and go home; he suspects that Wolf has the key to solving the mystery, and as he is about to leave for Portugal, he makes a discovery when he finds an image that clearly contradicts Wolf's version he told Phoebe. She feels guilty and, against her girlfriend's wishes, decides to accompany Phoebe to the city where Faith died. The story changes at this point and we go back to flashback to what Faith lived in Europe and what happened in her last days. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "The Invisible Circus" is the performances of the principals, something to which Mr. Brooks must take the credit. The big surprise is the Cameron Diaz range, which, like Faith, seems to select light comic parts, when it is capable enough to do good dramatic work under the right director. Jordana Brewster is seen as the oldest Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. It is an extraordinary beauty with what appears to be a naturalness for acting. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and proves he is also capable of making a more serious drama. Sweet Camilla Belle plays the young Phoebe quite convincingly. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls. <br /> <br /> European locations are magnificently photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also enhanced by the soundtrack by Nick Laird-Clowes and the original song by Petra Haden. Elizabeth Kling has treated with great elegance. Ultimately, this film shows Adam Brooks in great shape as he sets the tone for the adaptation of the novel and is rewarded by having the right cast doing miracles for him.
