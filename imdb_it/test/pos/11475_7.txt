From frame number 1 do you know that the good guy in a suit and tie is doomed ?? He has no luck ("Sorte Nula"), or so he believes with that music on the car radio, and the questionable speech of his best friend and partner in the company that is taking him to unknown places through a desert road. Alberto simply wanted to be left alone, to take a flight abroad the next day, with ?? well, someone let us guess. <br /> <br /> Does the film go very far? which you will find soon ?? to a closing scene with the man listening to the same music in a taxi to the airport. In the middle, a number of lucky people found different ways to get out of history, some dying, some being born, others falling into anguished anguish. Is he really doomed this time ?? Or is he? The film is a sort of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata who left only the sound recording and special effects to other competent people. Those who generally reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear vocal recordings, must look for other arguments to criticize this time. The car accident (it's not about spoilers, the film is too smart for THAT) makes for a great scene, and apparently was done with cheap equipment. (The United States takes note: you can save a dollar or two by hiding the competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> The rest was done by Fragata, from the script to the dialogue, from the work with the camera to editing. If a part of the dialogue has been pronounced, then he must congratulate again for the direction and for the casting with mostly inexperienced actors. A large number of untold parts are attributed, but most of these people have been used for the music video and its implementation, widely used in the movie's promotional trailer. Does the cast have a dozen actors and actresses, including ten relevant people and a huge number of relationships? which are revealed step by step, in an electrifying and suspenseful way, which reminds the best genre authors. "Alfred Hitchcock" (qv) and "Claude Chabrol" (qv) come to mind, from the cat-and-mouse game between the director and his audience, and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and a comedy to Portuguese-speaking speakers and, if the film gets a decent translation of its colloquial dialogue, to all those who enjoy these genres abroad.
