No matter how much it hurts me to say this, the film is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews here on IMDb, but I was expecting a lot more ... <br /> <br /> Sure, the idea is good, the violent scenes and the shooting are exceptional, the imagination of genius Dario is breathtaking, but the film is "dirty" with a couple of errors that I find unforgivable. First of all, I'm one of the few people who feels that Heavy Metal music reproduced in the most intense scenes tears the atmosphere apart ??? With a different kind of music (Goblin ????) during the "needle" scenes, it would have been intense SOOOO! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys every possibility of tension ... Secondly, the final killing scene and the last moments of the film are simply stupid and uninspired. I don't mean "amateur", because I love Silver movies. The ending left me blank. Talk about a final impression! This is not exactly what happens in most of Dario's films! Although, certainly, Suspiria also suffers from a hasty ending (even though most is brilliant) .... <br /> <br /> In short, watch this film, try to make the most of its good points, but be prepared even for some villains. This is NOT a perfect movie with ANY medium.
