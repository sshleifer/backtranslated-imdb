"The belief in the Great Other as an invisible power structure that exists in the Real is the most synthetic definition of paranoia". ?? Slavoj Zizek <br /> <br /> This is a review of "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman", two films by director John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang brought the "conspiracy thriller" to Hollywood, the genre only blossomed between the late 60s and 70s, with films like "The Parallax View", "Z" , "Marathon Man", "Capricorn One", "The Manchurian Candidate", "Three Days of Condor" and "All The President's Men". It was the era of Vietnam and Watergate, the deeply suspicious public of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> The genre remained quiet in the 1980s and early 1990s, until the "X Files" TV series came to life. With slogans like "The Truth Is Out There" and "Trust No One", the series has laid a world of vast government conspiracies and plots, the common man at the mercy of all the ways of ridiculously elaborated schemes. The only way out of the maze? "Fight the future!" as the slogan of the final season of the proclaimed series. Apparently, it was our duty to escape through the maze of information, discover an elusive "truth" that ensured our freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend ended with the Internet boom, conspiracy thrillers are now giving way to "documentaries on conspiracy". The Internet generation has shot independent documentaries such as "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist", while in the mainstream Michael Moore has tickled the audience with things like "Fahrenheit 9/11". All these documentaries believed in a "secret order", a cabal of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They struggle to create a mono-myth, linking various hidden conspiracies and agendas into a single, all-encompassing narrative that explains the purpose, point and future of everything. <br /> <br /> This need to "streamline narratives", to make them more "efficient", is reflected in the scientific community, which fights to create a "Theory of Great Unification" and finally a "Theory of Everything", combining everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity in a gigantic and all-encompassing formula. /> <br /> So, in the end, the "conspiracy thriller" is rooted in the man's desire to have control. The modern subject is one who openly shows cynicism towards official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an invisible Other that pulls the strings). This apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is closely related to the end of the Great Other. His disappearance forces us to build an Other of the Other (conspiracy) to escape the unbearable freedom of its causes of loss. Conversely, there is no need to take Big Other seriously if we believe in an Other of the Other. We are therefore authorized to show cynicism and belief in equal measure. <br /> <br /> Man tries to assert control over a rebellious universe, to create a kind of paternal babysitter (be it God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation for violence / conspiracy / murder / war etc.) which provides meaning and symbolic order. The Great Other provides reassurance to the believer. It is a "life choice", similar to religion, in which its place in the world depends on pure irrationality. <br /> <br /> The problem with most of the "conspiracy thrillers", from the innocent days of Hitchcock's "Topaz" to modern dishes like "The Da Vinci Code", is twofold. First, they are not unfair in suggesting that something is "wrong" between "elite" or "better people", but they are wrong in identifying and personalizing social, collective and systemic processes, an approach that implies that it is only a matter of personal morality rather than social structures. Secondly, and above all, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the Great Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order that pulls the strings. <br /> <br /> Some modern "thriller conspiracies" ("Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz" etc.) They recognize it, with their networks of lies, accidents, truths and half untraceable truths, nothing ever adding, nothing ever makes sense, the real and the hyperreal, the truth and the desire, all blurred, with no identifiable zero point, but these are mostly films of intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> Compared to these modern "conspiracy thrillers", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman" are decidedly archaic. "Marathon Man" is a university student (Dustin Hoffman) who gets involved in the business of his older brother (Roy Scheider), who unfortunately has to deal with spies, guns, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. Scheider is suave, Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger impresses us with some sharp images (the revelation of the Eiffel tower is amazing), but the most interesting thing about the film is the way the various lines of the plot do not intersect until now. . Even then, it still takes half an hour for things to make sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a cliché clash between the bad guy and the good guy, all perfectly solved and explained. <br /> <br /> "The hawk and the snowman" is a little more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works in a civil defense contractor and smuggling information from his office and into the hands of Penn, a small drug dealer who has no problem selling to the KGB. Penn does it strictly for the money, while Hutton is disillusioned by the US government (especially his attempt to depose the leader of Australia) and then sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and espionage games. In other words, the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The hawk and the snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> <br /> In addition to a bizarre car accident and its final cliché, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller, with many clean scenes. "The Falcon and the Snowman" is even better, Penn turns into a memorable performance.
