This was the third time I tried watching this movie. The previous two times, I found the start so disgustingly sweet and "schmaltzy" that I just stopped watching. However, now that I'm a little older and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch the whole movie and was very surprised to see that I really liked it a little. So, I watch the movie in much the same way I would watch swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (ie around 21-22 degrees Celsius for all those metric lovers out there). Of course, at the beginning the water is terribly cold and shocking, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you will get used to it - so resist the urge to jump out immediately !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a long exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by a cope Patti Brady. Some may find the conversations very nice and engaging, even if others may find them a bit difficult to take because these moments are so damn damn harmful! In a way, it was a wonderful performance by Flynn because it's hard to imagine him in real life having children or acting at home, especially that he wanted to be loyal to a woman in this movie - now WHAT IS WAITING FOR !! NEVER GIVE GOODBYE about the divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. Since both love each other as well as their lispy child, it seems a foregone conclusion that they will bind once again to the node. However, there are some serious problems on their way: Lucille Watson (who plays her usual over-bearing character and mother-in-law), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, he's Errol Flynn and he's divorced, so you have to expect him to have a DIFFERENT girl) and a marine (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> Not unexpectedly, all this is resolved in the end and everyone lives happily ever after. However, despite being formidable and predictable, the film is a winner because it is so fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, is very good at romantic comedy and is very fun to watch. Moreover, the film has the always chewing scene Cuddles Sakall - it's so damn cute and sweet that it's perfect in this kind of movie. And, despite the sweetness, the film is quite well written. The bottom line is that the film is FUN. <br /> <br /> So my recommendation is that you watch this movie and force yourself not to vomit on the painfully sweet aspects of the movie. Once this is overcome, the rest of the film is an image that deserves your time.
