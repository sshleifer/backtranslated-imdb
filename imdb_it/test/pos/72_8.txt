Even a naughty Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and that's not bad! In fact it's quite fun. In reality it is a fascinating study on the attempt to manipulate the character of a star. <br /> <br /> To break Julie's "two good shoes mold", she plays a German spy actress / British musical actress. Later, he continued his career in the film S.O.B. and plays a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not-so-pretty girls usually under the direction of Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly problematic. It is difficult to feel for his character because he is a German spy. We want to love Julie, but she's on the wrong side of the law. This is probably why this film failed. Julie as a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? Our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? <br /> <br /> The novel seems to happen overnight and comes from nowhere. But it doesn't matter, it's a musical and has Jullie. Oh, and did I mention that there is also Hunky Hunky? <br /> <br /> Julie gives a wonderful performance that no fan of musical comedies should not miss. Great WW 1 Songs and beautiful songs by Mancini. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film has holes in the plot and sometimes doesn't seem logical. For example, because Julie and her uncle are suddenly chased by the Germans when she was spying on them a minute ago. <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? Musical numbers are fun and exciting. The extraordinarily gorgeous costumes and scenery. Cinematography is clear enough. <br /> <br /> He has the annoying idiotic detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his films. (Yawn) <br /> <br /> But Julie is desperately trying to change her image. (You can imagine a dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: "Blake we have to change image". <br /> <br /> Blake: "I'll make you a German spy, then we'll take your clothes off in another movie and then play a disguised as another film, they will not recognize you, it will be the death of Maria Von Trapp "<br /> <br /> Fascinating study on the change of an image. Wonderful Julie, the musical comedy fans Much more fun than Star!
