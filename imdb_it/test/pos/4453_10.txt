The cult director Lucio Fulci is probably the most famous for his zombie films of the 80s that earned him his legitimate reputation as "Godfather of Gore". Fulci's most important film, however, dates back to 1972 and, although it is decidedly gritty and violent, it is not as gory as many of his other films. "Don't Donico Un Donald" alias. "Do not Torture A Duckling" from 1972 is not only Fulci's biggest film, this alluring and absolutely brilliant Yellow is one of the highlights of the genre. The extraordinary atmosphere and the enticing suspense, the great setting of Sizilian, the intriguing story, the brilliant performances or the intense moments of pure shock - I don't know what to praise more than this naive Yellow! "Do not Torture A Duckling" really offers cinematic perfection in every aspect, which makes it an absolute masterpiece of Italian horror cinema. <br /> <br /> Unlike other yellows, they are not seductive beauty queens who are killed by one, but kids who fall victim to a killer in the wild. Bodies of kids are found in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately looking for the killer, the small town is practically full of strange people, and the city's inhabitants are screaming for a culprit ... <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly suspenseful and uncompromising from the beginning, with a gritty, dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal. The recitations are among the best in Italian horror cinema. Tomas Milian (one of my favorite actors of all time) is excellent in the lead, like the journalist Andrea Martinelli who is investigating crimes. The sexy Barbara Bouchet offers both special effects and brilliant performance. Equally exceptional shows come from Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, who is absolutely brilliant in her role. The soundtrack by Riz Ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere, and the film is ingeniously filmed in fascinating Sicilian landscapes. Although not as gory as many other Fulci films, this film is decidedly gritty and uncompromising in its violence, with some incredibly brutal scenes. <br /> <br /> "Do not Torture A Duckling" has everything that Horror requires. It is not as easy to grasp as most of Fulci's other films, but I assure you that the research will bear fruit. Any Horror fan MUST see this favorite of mine, and I highly recommend all true movie lovers in general not to lose it. A masterpiece!
