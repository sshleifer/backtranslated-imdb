(the description of the mood of the film can be considered as a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact) <br /> <br /> Fantastic ... <br /> <br /> It is for my interest particularly for dystopias and utopias? It's for the atmosphere of the film. Or is there still some magic? If yes, it is certainly the most human ... <br /> <br /> This film is, without a doubt, extremely artistic / artificial (depending on taste). I can imagine most of the people who hate watching slow movies (and those of Tsai Ming Liang (which I didn't enjoy other times) are one of the slowest I know), suffering during the film. Yes, people are unable to slow down and pass the time - and look at it without feeling that they are wasting it. Can you take this piece as a torture or as a therapy ... <br /> <br /> The argument on the surface? Lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - next to each other - but not really together? People are tired, sick of something and unable to describe it - they simply don't want to meet, touch, talk, confront each other ... as if they had disappeared. The large building seems empty and the falling rain constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside. And sometimes it must be something abnormal, unexpected, an unwanted decay like a hole in the cement floor - that allows us to reach out. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to look at it is this: Don't examine the inner world of the characters - consider the entire space of the film to be inside yourself. And ask: why is he there? Where could these depressive states and moods come from? Is there a place for them, do they have the right to be here? And look for the answers (if you need them) between the walls and the halls of the block - instead of inside an almost transparent mind of a man. <br /> <br /> The key to understanding is not to understand - to let a film borrow us - as an object of study - within itself - and in the end bring us safely back to our more colorful and "reality" normal". <br /> <br /> So, perhaps, you will reach - like me - the feeling of real hope, possible, not pathetic, that in the core we are still human ... and this state of mind can help a lot to live in this world.
