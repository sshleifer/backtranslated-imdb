If "Love Me Tonight" is "the musical for people who do not like musicals", it must be said that "The Gay Desperado" is definitely not a musical for people who do not like opera. In fact - although apparently based on a comic operetta - it is not a real musical, but a story of a smuggled bandit with unrelated interpolated arias to show the voice of a character; and what a voice it is. <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, like the young singer Chivo who joins the bandit troop to get a place on the radio (no, the storyline doesn't make much sense later or ...), has a glorious gold tenor whose style is not dated one day from the time it was recorded. The trills and bad words of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a past fashion, but it is very easy to imagine Chivo chirping "Nessun Dorma" to a World Cup audience and at the top of the process charts. Unfortunately, while she has a captivating smile and a decent dramatic range, she is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time. The result is that the rather hectic film proceeds to a thrill whenever Chivo puts a hand on his chest and starts to declaim, and the spectator's tolerance for the audience probably depends on his appreciation for the opera performance. > <br /> In addition to this drawback, the film is a pleasant wide-ranging satire on the conventions of Hollywood and the stereotype of the Mexican bandit in particular, which achieves the vital goal of all these parodies in making its characters quite engaging in the their right to maintain the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise have become obsolete. The bandit chief and his helper have the traditional double-act relationship, there is an enigmatic beggar with a carved teak face, and a lively heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who performs the generic "you say you hate me but you really love me "routine with a refreshing touch. <br /> <br /> Overall the film is fun and quite funny, and I feel I have earned the value of my money - but there is no denying that musical interludes, while admirable in their own way, introduces serious stimulation problems .
