The minutiae of what is involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best robbery films. Then there is the robbery itself, a merman with no words and thirty minutes that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the most pronounced example of the disgrace of cinema among thieves when things start to fall apart spectacularly, and we have what is unquestionably the biggest of all the kidnapping films. <br /> <br /> This was a hard and not very sentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and is today just as hard and not very sentimental. (Shows some brutal angularities of Dassin's previous "Brute Force"). There is not a flaccid moment or a duff performance throughout the film and Dassin captures the environment of squalid clubs and Parisian back roads like no other and the last passage through Paris from a dying man is one of the most iconic sequences of closing any movie. A classic.
