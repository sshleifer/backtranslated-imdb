What a great movie! Unfortunately, since 1947, the script of the film could not have followed the book from which it was adapted, but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle at that time. <br /> <br /> I thought of everything the performances were exceptional, as well as the script, the direction, the brilliant black and white cinematography, the music and the atmosphere of film noir. <br /> <br /> I understand that in 1947 the film could not portray racism against blacks or prejudices against homosexuals. (Robert Young's account of the prejudice against the Irish grandfather who endured this racism 100 years ago was rather lame, but the times dictated that the film avoided further examination of racism.) <br /> <br /> I have have an observation and a question to ask the viewer: 1. You noticed that Robert Young did not point his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan who was running fast in the dark and Young fired from an upper window in the dark without aiming ? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40, the timeline would not be logical. If the grandfather was killed 50 years ago, the time frame would be realistic.
