Excellent episode, showed that Dean not only tastes good by choosing Cassie for his girlfriend, but also shows that he has a heart and can only love a woman, and is not just a boy who loves and leaves! Aweso and episode. Applaud this. I just hope they somehow get back to Cassie's relationship next season (if there's a next season ??) I'd like to see her return to their "supernatural" lives, especially Dean's. I also like the fact that he chose an African American woman to be the special woman in his life who got away with it somehow. I hope they don't ruin it and end up when the episode ends. The girl who played Cassie was really an observation and it was nice to see the WB expand into what we all see in everyday life: the interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable (finally!)
