No film could ever do justice to Faulkner's command of the English language. but they did a good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly the way I imagined it in the book, as was Chick. What the film couldn't really think of was how Beauchamp didn't like the black people either, because he was equally stubborn. Not that it's a bad thing, but from my approach to the book that was his attitude to the world (yet, I had the impression that it was the racism of the white society that started it and poured into the black society, up to become this his attitude towards everyone). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is that you can see Yoknapatawpha County (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the film was shot when Faulkner was alive and writing) . Today it doesn't look very different. For this reason, the film deserves to be seen considering that it was shot in Faulkner's yard. A real must see for Faulkner fans.
