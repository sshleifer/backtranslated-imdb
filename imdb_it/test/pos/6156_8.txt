A surprisingly beautiful film. Wonderfully designed, beautifully directed, beautifully acted, beautifully acted and beautifully photographed ..... cinematography is nothing short of splendid. It is a war movie, but it is epic in its purpose and mixes romance, tragedy and comedy in a story that is as harrowing as it is provocative.
