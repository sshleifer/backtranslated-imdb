I saw Anatomy when it came out and I bought it recently and the 2003 sequel and while I watch many foreign films in various genres, you certainly have to watch movies in their original language. Not only is it annoying to know that the voices don't belong to the actors, but they always seem cheerful, as the whole movie is a big commercial toothpaste commercial or something like that. It makes an otherwise awesome film look horrible and I've had to convert many of my friends who used to think foreign films aren't as good as those in North America - not "pretty Hollywood". Moreover, their translation is never right, it's too literal and ruins the atmosphere of the film, even if it's basically saying the same thing. I saw Anatomy alone the other week in German, then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and he didn't want to lose parts when he couldn't see the subtitles because he was writing. 30 minutes and asked me to let him finish his work and then start the film with subtitles. He loved it! Both films are fantastic as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
