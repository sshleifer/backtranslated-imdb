When we are young, we all select an ideal occupation for ourselves: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc. While most of us grow from our pipe dreams, the protagonist of American Movie, Mark, still has to let go of his (and even at the age of thirty): to become an acclaimed and rich director. Despite the fact that Murphy's law will not leave Mark alone and something always seems to go wrong, Mark is able to persevere in every episode of deterrence with an even greater push to achieve his goals. His desire to be a director thus controls his character who sees any person or thing in his life as something to be exploited to reach the goal. While I have noticed that other IMDB commentators are licking about Mark's selfishness, I think it's an almost justified type of selfishness because for Mark, not becoming a famous director equates to death. He talks incessantly about leaving a sort of mark on the world, and sees cinema as a way to do it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately every viewer of this film soon takes up the fact that Mark has no chance of ever realizing his dream. Are you aware of this? No, not in the slightest, and none of his family or friends wants to let him enter into secrecy (in reality, some of them also believe in him). Strangely though, the disappointing future that the viewer feels is sure that it will happen because Mark does not hinder the ability to find humor in the film. This is a very very funny documentary. Most of the laughs come from when Mark is shooting the scenes for "Coven". There is a scene where an actor must have a head that breaks a closet, and it doesn't work. Another scene has old Uncle Bill from Mark who tells some lines to the camera; needless to say, after 20 shots of a lot of somersaults and stumbling tails, Bill finally decides to have enough. A lot of humor comes sadly from Mark himself. His script, which seems to be considered worthy of a Pulitzer, is ridiculously bad: "It's all right, all right, there's something to live for, Jesus told me." <br /> <br /> "American Movie" is, contrary to what people might think, a documentary that anyone can enjoy (even though my sister, who was watching some scenes, seemed to think it was definitely bizarre). The fact that Chris Smith can successfully bring a movie that inspires both sadness from Mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with Bill (who unfortunately disappeared before the film was released) says a lot about him. I wonder how the dreamer Mark considers this documentary. Does he realize that he throws him in a bad light? Or that set to show him like a madman in many scenes in the movie? Or do you see it as something that will be shown before your A & E Biography segment? It's an intriguing theme of wonder, and I hope the latter will come true for him one day. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
