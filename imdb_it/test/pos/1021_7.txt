A pleasant film, without a doubt, and very evocative both of his age and of that very particular phase of the "rites of passage" of every boy. But I have to say that after reading the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperate. The whole thing revolves around the most striking mixture in the history of school plays. The idea that the charlatan would never have been chosen to play not just one of only three rounds, but a womanizer, is laughable. And without that, nada. The sub-plots had no relation whatsoever I could see in the main plot - they could all be removed in their entirety without in any way influencing the main plot - which certainly suggests a fundamental flaw. When all your sub-frames seem to be padding, you know that a central idea is extending beyond its limits. Nevertheless, it is a benign film with the heart in the right place, there are some good performances, and one has the feeling that all the participants involved felt deflated to the final "cut"! That good feeling permeates the film. And this must count for something. An imperfect film quite good. 7 out of 10.
