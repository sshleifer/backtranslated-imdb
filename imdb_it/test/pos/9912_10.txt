Of all the episodes of all the series, this is the closest to the original Roddenberry principle. According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK, in Roddenberry's writer's guide to his writers, he states that any alien creature, no matter how horribly ugly, impossible to believe, benign or malicious, MUST hold an appearance of humanity that watching TV public can empathize with and / or relate to. Devil In The Dark's HORTA, which looks like nothing more than a large cow dung mucus, is a mother who protects her children, those ball-shaped silicon nodules that miners continue to find in the passageways of mine and destroy, because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my favorite episodes ever, if only for that!
