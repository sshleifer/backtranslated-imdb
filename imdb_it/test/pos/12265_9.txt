I'm sitting around the movie lists and I really don't see anything I want to see. My appetite continues to say "Something like BROADCAST news". It's what I want. Something smart and fun, with ideas for adults and great acting and writing, and a directorial style that does not draw attention to itself. This could be the best interpretation of Hurt (it's this or THE BIG CHILL, in my opinion): as eccentric, Hurt is intelligent, and to play a non-intelligent person without being sure - the wink winks - the audience knows - the wink winks - - Hey, I'm not stupid ... well, it's nice to act right there. Hunter is perfect for notes and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Excellent, great job. <br /> <br />
