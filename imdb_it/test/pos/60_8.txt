The main reason for looking at this photo is to enjoy the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her extraordinary presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter who, without constraints. This actress clearly shows a range that is surprising. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing together this illustrious cast of some of the best actors of Black Americans. This group of ensembles under his strict direction helps to create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place. <br /> <br /> Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson had not written his wonderful comedy. Working with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they opened the show in a way that evokes a not too distant past in which a child lives under the influence of Mrs. Crosby, when her parents are not around take care of him. Mrs. Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben; in a sense, it represents his reward for losing his daughter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some of the characters, since the action focuses exclusively on improving the relationship between Tata and young Ruben, played with so much charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin, who is natural. The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice on the narration that is sometimes intrusive, as it does not clarify, or justify what you are seeing. Frankly, only by observing the interaction of the players is it self explanatory. <br /> <br /> In the background there is always music. No matter what hard times these people are going through, but Nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mrs Merkerson, other noteworthy performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the rising stars of the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest. <br /> <br /> Ms. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In "Lackawanna Blues", he clearly demonstrates that he can do everything he wants for his enormous talent and charisma.
