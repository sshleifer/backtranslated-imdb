All the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come. You have the stellar cast - Michael Douglas in an unusual "free spirit" role that practically launched his film career, Fonda who plays his typical outspoken woman who does his part for the woman, and Jack Lemmon who has always shown of show us a man with a crisis of confidence. Give them a hot argument that big deals are duplicates, and this is encouraging for a kick-off, but having life that imitates art so soon is a marketing man's dream. <br /> <br /> The script is extraordinarily tense, intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of prolonged tension brought into play by the director as our three protagonists run to beat time. If you like "whistle blowing" dramas, then this is not quite as good as "The Insider", but the whole is more than quite nervous.
