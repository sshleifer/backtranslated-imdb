This is one of the best action movies I've seen. Geena's portrait of the tough as nails, 'Charly' / kind mother 'Sam', was superb and Samuel L Jackson just makes you laugh all the way through, with his classic linings. Sure, there were some holes in the real story, but this hectic movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> I heard that Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam / Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident in her role as a mother in the recent film "Stuart Little". Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, sweet little Yvonne Zima and newcomers, sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film accentuates the growing tendency of a strong female character and the diversion far from the traditional male / female stereotypes, given that Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) launch themselves from one disaster to another. <br /> <br /> While I and many others have loved this film, it is fair to say that there will always be people who do not do it and that is fine - everyone, to their own. I highly recommend this movie to action fans, for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action.
