Chris Smith's American Movie is an in-depth examination of the American dream. The film focuses on Mark Borchardt, an independent filmmaker from Wisconsin. Mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had a hi8 camera out of focus. The film follows Mark through his attempt to make the film of his dreams, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as Mark goes through Northwestern pre-production and later his short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, Mark says "Sounds too much like the oven") he has in plan to use to raise funds to complete Northwestern. The intuition and humor of this film are on a par with Roger and Me, the great film by Michael Moore. I saw it for the first time in a chaotic screening of the Sundance Film Festival which highlighted the spirit of the film - a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the film, hit seven people and caused a delay twenty-five minutes; in the middle of the film the sound started to flutter and the projector had to be stopped to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned out. Despite the delays, the public passed the film and gave a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this beautiful film, which is worth going through an infernal screening.
