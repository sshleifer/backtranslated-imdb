Chris Farley and David Spade have only made three films together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but this was really the "Citizen Kane" of their pairings. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the resigned heir of an auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires Richard Hayden (David Spade) to look after him. Big Tom marries a "ten" (Bo Derek), so everything must be in order. After Big Tom suddenly dies, Tommy and Richard must try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From that moment on, the film is practically an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: make a mess of everything. <br /> <br /> When this movie was released in theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He quickly realized that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Lowe were hiding something. But you can completely ignore it and just enjoy Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is safe around his stomach, and hell has no anger like his carefree attitude. The scene in which the machines are set on fire and, later, the deer scene, creates a real brawl. Chris Farley and David Spade were really John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their era. It is a pleasure to always be able to think of "Fat guy in a small coat" several times.
