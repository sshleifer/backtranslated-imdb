Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It's fun and interesting. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) shows that he was not lying and went to Los Angeles to pick up the paper from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Together with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), he spoils his life since Marty won't call Jason's dad and he'll say he wrote the newspaper! Yet everything turns out good and it's a good movie to watch!
