The documentaries in which sons and daughters try to understand a parent and, through the process, their lives are not so rare. Also the results that reflect the lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unambiguous search for revenge advertised for innumerable past, real and fantasized wounds are not rare. What is unusual is a brilliant, honest and compelling portrait of a fascinating parent and "My architect: a child's journey" is a rare achievement. Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face hopelessly and brutally marked by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia where the talented young man loved art and music. He soon fell in love with the buildings and decided that only an architect's career would respond to his creative abilities. <br /> <br /> Kahn became an architect but, as this film demonstrates, it took a long time before it attracted the attention of leaders in his field. One architect suggests that he was a victim of the "yellow belt" that anti-Semitism, which along with partiality towards women, has long been a disreputable aspect of the American architectural profession. <br /> <br /> When he got the warning, he was seen, clearly accurately, as a self-confident prophet of work, who exclaims irremovable demands that his vision and only his vision be realized. This inflexibility was the reason why, while drawing wonderful projects for many buildings, he only built a few. The interview with an elderly gentleman who dismissed Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and entered the city is exhilarating. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher and some of the vast archive images here show him with his students, his firm but passionate voice, their respectful and intense looks. <br /> <br /> Many architects were interviewed by the director, writer and collaborator of the project Nathaniel Kahn, the only child architect. Some are famous all over the world - I. M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and the still active nonagenarian, Philip Johnson. Their comments depict a vivid image of this idealist, but ultimately a financially failed designer of buildings that merged castles, fortresses, and grand buildings from past centuries into plans for the present. Kahn's buildings are shown, among the most impressive are the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, California. For me his style has a neo-romantic air suffocated by too much empty space that rejects rather than attracts human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was no longer the story of his father, the architect. For many years Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of which produced a daughter, the other a son. Kahn often visited his son at his mother's home, but at the end of an evening mother and son would take Kahn back to the spouses' home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know this unusual set of relationships, but it doesn't seem to be marked by what was certainly a strange relationship for a child. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a young boy, Louis Kahn died of a violent heart attack in the men's room of New York's Pennsylvania Station after returning from India where he had launched one of his massive plans, another which was never built. At that point his Philadelphia firm had at least $ 500,000 in debt and if he had been on a trip to the federal bankruptcy court he was probably on the move. <br /> <br /> Kahn has left several monumental structures whose government is clearly building the largest in Bangladesh. A crying local architect greets Kahn for creating a building where democracy could (and hopefully) prosper . <br /> <br /> Architect Moshe Safdie states that there may have been something appropriate in Kahn's suffering in a deadly heart attack at a train station given his incessant world tour. I disagree: it is sadly ironic that Kahn must die in the faceless replacement of one of America's authentic architectural gems, the old Pennsylvania Station, destroyed to make way for a sterile replacement without character and without the continuation of civic memory . <br /> <br /> There are a number of emotional moments filmed during the journey of the young Kahn, even with his stepsisters and his mother, but they are sincere and moving, not rude and staged. Architectural historians will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as an imperfect but very iconoclastic man and ultimately private. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
