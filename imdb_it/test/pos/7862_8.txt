It took me years to finally capture this gem of a movie and it was worth it. In almost all of his films, Clint always plays the hero. Be a hero, anti-hero hero or avenger. In this film he is pure bad and interprets it well. <br /> <br /> As a wounded Union soldier, he is taken to a confederate school by students and teachers to heal. Soon after she starts seducing the ladies, regardless of their age and some are quite young. He also plays on their jealousies and puts them against each other. In the end you are never so happy to see a terrible death die for Clint. <br /> <br /> This is what makes this movie a jewel. Clint has never made any other film like this and after watching this movie you wish you had. He plays the role of the villain so well that you ask why he never made films like this again. It also explains why the film is not seen very often. Most people don't want to see Clint as the villain and with Dirty Harry being released soon after this movie has become a hidden gem. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan you have to do it to yourself to watch this movie. Maybe you won't like what you see but you won't forget it soon.
