Bachelor Swinging Matthau, a successful dentist, is tightening his blonde lover Hawn, after telling her that he is a married man with three children. After attempting suicide, Matthau decides to become responsible and marry the girl. Concerned that she will be a "burglar", Hawn's bright eyes want to meet his wife and explain everything to her. Matthau employs his faithful nurse Bergman to be a wife and at that moment things get really complicated. <br /> <br /> A farcical comedy with irresistible cues often hits the mark but is not credible for a second. The script asks us to believe that we men are such one-dimensional bullshit that it's really incredible. But maybe this comedy doesn't need to be analyzed too deeply, sit down and enjoy the increasingly fun Matthau, the ever-charming Bergman and novice Hawn, who basically created the blonde girl role here.
