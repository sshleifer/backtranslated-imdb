I love movies that involve you. A film that leaves you really weak when it's finished and this type of film is rare. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways to write and portray different characters on the screen. This film has a cutting edge touch. A main cast for such a low budget. Why a Man with this talent and charisma (not to mention sex appeal in ways that go beyond most other actors) can do it with so little money to work with ????? These actors really believe in his script and in Raw's talent as a director, screenwriter and actor. I am so happy to know that a genius of this modern day is out there, letting the passion for art guide him and lead us as an audience with him. Damian, I've heard of you through so many different circles and not let the jealous people of this world come to you. Martin gets this, Fellini has it and you will always understand it. Fire and passion in you are what we love to watch on the screen. Thank you for being different and having the courage to write as you do. You're a unique director, don't listen to empty ships.
