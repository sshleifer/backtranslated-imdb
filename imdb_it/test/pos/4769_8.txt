I can't see it too many times, it's full of real enthusiasm and intelligence that Mickey Mouse has had in his first 30 years. Nowadays, Mickey is a smart little whiner when compared to this. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the finale where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. The animation is very beautiful and even if the Willie steamboat has no dialogue, the music is enough for this. <br /> <br /> IMHO if this bit doesn't deserve 10/10 then any comic book not just because it's true classic, but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch.
