Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), called Ale in short, works in a repair shop for car-body shops in what has become known as the Iron Triangle, an unstoppable stretch of twenty blocks of used car yards and car repair shops near Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. Here customers do not wonder if the parts come from stolen cars or because they are able to receive such large discounts, they simply put down their money and hope that everything is going up. The squalid suburbs like these are not highlighted in tourist guides, but the Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani highlights them in Chop Shop, a powerful independent film that received much affection last year in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. Following his acclaimed "Man Push Cart", Bahrani spent a year and a half in the place that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as in the "Great Gatsby" as "the valley of the ashes". <br /> <br /> Despite its depiction of squalor, Chop Shop is not a work of social criticism but, like Hector Babenco's Pixote, a poignant study of the character in which the survival of a boy is bought at the price of his innocence. Filmed on location in Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani makes you feel like you're there, sweating in a hot and humid New York summer with all its noise and chaos. The film focuses on the charming 12-year-old, street-smart Ale, who lives on the edge without any support or supervision from an adult other than his boss (Rob Sowulski), the real owner of the Iron Triangle garage. Polanco's performance is crude and a little ragged, but he fully deserved the standing ovation he received at the premiere of the film at Cannes along with the embrace of the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. <br /> <br /> Tightened in a small room above the garage together with his sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), 16, who works by dispensing food from a cart for lunch, Ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts with he takes care of. While dreaming of owning his food service van, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that can make the "top of the heap" is another dented fender. In this environment, Ale and Isi use all the means necessary to keep their heads above water while their mutual love remains constant and they still laugh and play the childhood that was never theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams From My Father", the change could come later when their eyes stop laughing and closed something inside. Meanwhile, Ale completes his earnings by selling chocolate bars in the crowded metropolitan New York with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing bootleg DVDs on street corners, while Isi does tricks for truckers to save enough money for buy the rusty $ 4500 van in which they hope to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Despite Ale being a "good boy", he is not on the theft of bags and hubcaps in the Shea Stadium parking lot, events observed by Bahrani's camera without judgment. In Chop Shop, Bahrani provided a convincing antidote to the lost success stories produced by the Hollywood dream factory, and gave us a film of extraordinary naturalism and respect for his characters, similar in many ways to the great Italian neo-realist films and the recent Iranian works by Kiarostami, Panahi and others. While the result of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani makes sure that we notice a gigantic billboard at Shea Stadium that reads "Make dreams", leaving us with the suggestion that, in Rumi's phrase, "the drum of the realization of that promise is beating "
