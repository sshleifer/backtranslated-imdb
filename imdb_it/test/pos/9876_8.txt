This was a really cool Halloween movie. I wasn't thrilled with Thorn's theory, but it's still a good movie. I enjoyed seeing Tommy Doyle again but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died soon after the shoot. The film had a REALLY wicked director who didn't turn the series upside down, from what I felt was badly treated to Donald, and he didn't want Danielle Harris to return as Jamie. It's like he's just trying to take down the movie, but I still liked it. There have been many cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the Producers Cut that offers over 40 minutes. never before scenes. With those scenes it turns into a completely new film. Check it if you have the chance.
