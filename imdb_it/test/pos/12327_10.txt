This is my favorite movie of all time. And I always think of it as John Huston's requiem. <br /> <br /> I must have seen it at least 20 times and I never get tired. The mood, the script, the singing, the dinner, is like being invited to someone's home and watching events and not being able to participate even if you want ... It's a rare treasure, this film and I can't write enough praise for this. <br /> <br /> It is an incredibly good cast, with some faces of Abbey Theater and also the wonderful tenor voice of Frank Patterson. The poetry of Lady Gregory played in the film is one of the most moving ever written. The scene of Anjelica walking down the stairs while listening to the song is one of the best performances seen in the film. I cry every time I see it..for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We all had the love lost at an early age and cried for our hopeful young youth. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann has starred in too few films for my taste, adored stage work and adhered to it, and it is our loss that we no longer have his performances in films as he does with this delicate role of expression and the portrait of a deep love for his wife that will never be returned and transmits such an inner sadness in knowing it. <br /> <br /> If you want your films to be action and plot avoided, there's really no beginning, half or just finish a lens on the characters at a dinner in Dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and shades of personalities portrayed so beautifully. <br /> <br /> Good for all those involved in this production. 10 out of 10.
