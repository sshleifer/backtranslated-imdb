Highly recommended for all those who enjoy watching movies. Great acting, perfectly surreal surreal humor, required prison, so much representation of the male condition. Even the music is apt. I think the artist is "Dip" but he is not sure. The short loop of the title credit song in the DVD menu is well synchronized and sounds like Slint. (one thing to know is that IMDb maintains a ridiculous policy of a MINIMUM comment length based on, not CHARACTERS, WORDS, but rather LINES. Measuring the quality and quantity of posts based on LINES in the bold UNICODE and flexible, web-based typography, it's like smoke poles).!
