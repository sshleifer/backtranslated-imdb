I remember seeing this movie at the theater and appreciating it. I happened to stumble over it last month's fear and looked at it again and found it better with age. First of all for those of you who describe it as' 80s cheese if you compare it objectively with horror films of the last twenty years, if compared quite well with films in its unique horror subtitle that I would call action / horror as opposed to psychological horror as "The Shining" or "the exorcist". <br /> <br /> Furthermore, for its budget, this film really delivers the goods (or in this case bad). The film actually has a character development and gives enough history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door. The film also has several hilarious one-liners and gives the appropriate mood that should have a nasty scary horror movie. If you compare NOD with large-scale contemporary horror films like "I am legend" (Vincent Price's version was much better) this movie really stands out. Modern horror films have become almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or developmental character and are completely predictable. The special effects dominate these films from beginning to end and the characters are in 24k plastic. If this is the 80s horror cheese, I'll get over 95% of the current rumors in the genre. <br /> <br /> On a final note, seeing NOD reminded me of the beautiful Jill Terashita and I wonder why she didn't see him in more horror movies or anything. Jill on the strange possibility that you read this - I think you are wonderful and you should have been on other films. Finally, if you like action horror movies you will probably like this a lot.
