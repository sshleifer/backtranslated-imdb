A large bed possessed by a demon eats people, among other things. I'm not making it up. <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and not officially released until the DVD in 2003, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a film whose plot is impossible to describe. You probably know this thanks to the excellent parody of Patton Oswalt, as well as the essential book by Stephen Throwers "Nightmare USA". As you look at it, you wonder what follows <br /> <br /> - Who is George Berry, and what drugs did he smoke / inject / sniff before writing and directing this movie? <br /> <br /> - Is this a horror comedy? A combination of a horror film and an art film? Was a strange joke attracted by the public? <br /> <br /> - What the hell am I looking at? <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" really challenges every explanation. I know, that term is abused, but it couldn't be more true than it is here. This truly beggar description. It's a horror comedy as well as a horror / art hybrid movie. But the whole thing is so surreal, it must be seen. The score sounds like the electronic bits of an old Candlemass album, the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the film sometimes looks like a movie by Jesus Franco - that is, if his films were intentionally funny . <br /> <br /> In the end, there is no correct way to describe this film. The Lord knows I tried, but in reality few films are strange, unique or upsetting like this. Look at it ... but you have been warned. This is also the only film that George Berry has ever made. He certainly left his mark on the genre of exploitation with this, I'll tell you a lot.
