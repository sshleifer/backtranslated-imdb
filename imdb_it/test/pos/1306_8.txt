Definitely worth renting! Have fun for the family. My 4 and 5 year old children (and me) loved it. He kept them at the edge of their seats. I advise parents to sit down with their youngest children to watch this, because it can be quite suspenseful for them. It's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your kids, and so this is a rare find. Some acting / realism is sometimes not right there, or maybe it's a bit trivial, but children don't seem to notice or care about it, they love it. The parts are predictable, but other parts are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The film has nothing scary / disturbing, so I doubt it will give children nightmares. Encourage children to dream, which is something we need to encourage and encourage more in our children. Rent and be blessed!
