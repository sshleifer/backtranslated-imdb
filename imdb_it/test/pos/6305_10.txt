Perhaps my vote should have been a 9, but the film absolutely amazed me seeing it the first time and my last vision confirmed my initial belief. Elegant yes, every scene has a panoramic view, extraordinary corners with a perfect sound side that accompanies them. <br /> <br /> Highlight the great acting of Toni Servillo, especially with one of Olivia Magnani's most beautiful and fascinating women, and a nice storyline and you'll end up seeing this little masterpiece over and over again. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrentinos next film "L'Amico De Famiglia", which is competing in recent years at the Cannes Film Festival, will be eagerly awaited.
