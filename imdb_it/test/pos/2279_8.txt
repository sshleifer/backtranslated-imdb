This film has had less attention than "League of Their Own", perhaps because it has only a "name" star. But while women's women's baseball was only eight years old, the existence in the Midwestern city, Japanese baseball is a vastly larger entity, both in financial underwriting and in popular support. Only this would make it the best movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the facts of Japan-ball life: the cheered regiment, the deference to the referees, the pressure of the owners of the companies on the managers, the extreme conservatism of the game - and no welcome hot dog player. <br /> <br /> It also touches the isolation that every gai-jin - but above all an American athlete, not the most experienced people in foreign cultures - feels to live in Dai Nippon. And the Japanese, for their part, are not at ease with foreigners and they show it in various ways ("the strike zone of the gai-jin", an American player complains, "bigger than a Buick"). <br /> <br /> The script may not have won any prizes, once again playing on the theme "redemption from the improved game", but I found it much more enjoyable to watch than the "League". Definitely recommended for those who want to see another corner on this great sport.
