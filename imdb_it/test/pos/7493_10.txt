This film is hard to beat. It follows the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but still manages to overcome its unique style. The cast is fantastic, the script is fantastic, and things like the odd (Pulp Fiction-esque) time sequencing are done brilliantly. I particularly like the way the images provided in the flashback vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time. When he is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool, but when he is the memory of the hero everything is cheeky and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie - and so I'm extremely annoyed to find it I can't buy it anywhere!
