This film aims to do something very special, it also aims to not do certain things. In short, it has a defined premeditated trajectory - to address the idea of ​​facing death (with very few choices and all bad ones) as serious and real rather than casual or amusing. In search of that realism he avoided certain conventions such as arcs of an obvious nature and love. It's not about the characters as much as the human condition. No matter what the actors would do ... what would you do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open Water may have been a starting idea for this film, but it goes much further. Unlike that movie, it doesn't fool the public in the end when you find out that there aren't any sharks to talk about. This has a real monster, not just the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated stand. He also has good production values, given what these very enterprising filmmakers had to work with. And again in contrast to that other film it has an exhilarating and brilliantly rendered action at its peak. And let's not forget, we should say "dazzling", the presence on the screen of his youngest star. It could be quite a discovery.
