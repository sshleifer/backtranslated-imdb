A brilliant horror film. Absolutely creepy and very scary. The Thing is a remake of John Carpenter, but please don't be put off by this movie. It's simply brilliant. The beginning of the film sees the alien spaceship plummeting towards Earth centuries before mankind traveled the planet with an explosion that unleashed the film's title in a striking white and blue which indicates "WHAT". One of the best opening titles for a horror film ever. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors who play the team of twelve men of science is a joy to see and the locations for the setting of their Antarctic station are visually impressive on widescreen DVDs. It must have been great at the cinema. I'm sorry not to see it on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is as excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of men trying to fight a monstrous form that changes the monstrosities that have infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrifying scenes of paranoia and tension over who infected it. My favorite scene in the whole movie must be when Macready tests all those who are still alive for the infection, it's tense, scary and finally spectacular. I also like it because it's fun. <br /> <br /> A special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his incredible make-up effects and the ever-changing shape of the alien's shape. If he didn't get an Oscar for the best visual effects at the time, he would have to do it damn well. This is also questionable as to whether it is John Carpenter's greatest film ... it is certainly a macabre masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flaming heroes fighting in the form of changing towers of blood and slime. <br /> <br /> Absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten.
