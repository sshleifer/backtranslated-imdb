Josie is a journalist in a newspaper who is in charge of returning to high school when she is 17 years old. . <br /> <br /> As she is there, she remembers some really horrible things that happened to her the first time she was in Highschool as we see in the flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> In the flashback they show that (little spoiler) Josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was chosen a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he's taking her to the dance, only during the night dance as he leaves his house slammed in his asshole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (someone will find it so hard to look so ugly and make you feel hot in Josie). <br /> <br /> I didn't find this movie so funny but there were really fun things in the office scenes that were much more fun than anything that happened at school. <br /> <br /> This film had a perfect happy ending, because it brought tears to my mother's and my sister's eyes. The acting in this film was not exceptional, it was good for most of the film, there is some acting in parts of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 7 out of 10.
