Seeing this movie always reminds me of what I remember being summer, God! a long time ago. The whole scene involving the "overnight stay", from the canoe procession to the end of the journey, is precious, and the story of Tripper on the homicidal maniac is an urban legend since my youth. A very funny film, made many times better by the terrible sequels that followed.
