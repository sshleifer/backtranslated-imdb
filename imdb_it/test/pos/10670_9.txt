This film was one of my favorites and is intertwined with the Christmas holidays for me for two reasons: (1) growing in the 60s, everything was related to space from advertising to television programs and even Father Christmas found himself in spaceships during this was; and (2) I saw this movie during a Christmas shopping trip when I was ten years old and brought back fascinating memories of my favorite TV shows when I was even younger ("Supercar", Fireball XL5 "and" Stingray ",) So, I'm a little biased when it comes to this film for personal reasons. <br /> <br /> That said, as a long-time film student, this is mainly a film for Gerry Anderson fans (and Barry Gray, oh that wonderful soundtrack!) While the casual observer of the film will be sent back by the vision of the future-from the past (digging those wild machines, commercial planes, clothes, etc.) And the so-called "plot" that will make you moan someone, however, if you can look beyond the post "2001: A Space Odyssey", you want to make a science fiction movie with a "distant" plot, and if you like fanciful effects, then you will enjoy this gem of an era in which the man had just walked on the moon and the people watched still has the stars with wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down on the trivial traps of the present 21st century.
