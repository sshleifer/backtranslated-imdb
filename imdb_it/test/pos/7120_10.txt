There are few films that deal with things that I consider myself an expert, this is. <br /> <br /> After a few years of Fantasy Role Playing we broke up, I wouldn't leave without a sense of shame for what I had become: an idiot. <br /> <br /> You see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> First create a character fairly and die after the first attack. <br /> <br /> So help the constitution a bit, and while you're at it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity? This in turn nullifies the master of the game who does not know how to deal with this invincible band. And after a while the players get bored too, so they start creating more and more exotic racing combinations, no matter how ridiculous it is. <br /> <br /> I created a Druedain warrior monk, yes, not so far from the film. <br /> <br /> And it's not all to say about the destructiveness of the intrinsic dynamics of this diabolical game (think about the hunt for experience points), but watch the film, show everything - and of course the stupidity of its most basic premises. <br /> <br /> For this purpose, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. I don't understand exactly why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the smith has none. But once it became one, it had to be mapped into the flow of the game, that is: it had to be made lethal, at least indirectly. The search for fun never ends and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not exactly a professional production, but I haven't seen a better satire for centuries.
