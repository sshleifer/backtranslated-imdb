OZ is an old TV series released by HBO. Show life in a security prison called Oswald, but the main plot is centered on Emerald City, which is one of the prison levels. <br /> <br /> Oz has an incredible storyline and an exceptional cast! There are many characters and almost all of them are very interesting. Basically they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilians, blacks, Aryans, gays, Latinos and many others who do not have a specific group, but treat many others like Ryan O'Reily (The Irish). <br /> <br /> The plot is very well built, there are a lot of conspiracies inside, a lot of power struggle. But all this is not only exposed in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and intelligent, nothing happens without a reason, everything is connected and very interesting to guess! I really love this series and who wants to see something intelligent, very well produced with an excellent cast and performance, MUST see OZ!
