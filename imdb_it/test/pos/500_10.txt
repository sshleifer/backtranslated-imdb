This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked it much more than X-men. In reality, this film is a sort of cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out first. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is not a superhero without emotions. Furthermore, this film is not sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Surely the comics are mainly for children, but I like them a little more in my films. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would like to say a storm to make it more realistic. This comic adaptation also has something that many don't. A good fight in the end between the bad guy and the good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman films have had a very good final fight.
