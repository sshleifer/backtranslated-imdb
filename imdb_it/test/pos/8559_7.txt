H.O.T.S. it's not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a precursor to many classic 80s college / frat cult films like REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY'S and a post-cursor to the world-famous ANIMAL HOUSE. A good time if you dig a lot of big Playboy-type chicks from the 70s / 80s and a crap slapped comedy - but nothing remarkable if you want to use it as barrel material ... <br /> <br /> HOTS is an "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts fighting against the popular and fashionable girls of Pi. This has jokes, an aunt Jemima house keeper, and even an overheated robot that makes it relatively fun to see if the tits are your "thing" ... <br /> <br /> Well ... I like tits so much ( or probably more ...) like the next one - but with all the bad sh! t I've seen, I couldn't help but want some hardcore scenes to make this really useful. I knew it wouldn't happen, but I still want H.O.T.S. he had a little more sex and a little less cheeze. Not quite as remarkable as NERDS, PORKY'S, or ANIMAL HOUSE, but it's worth taking a look at the fans of those types of movies ... 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS .. and I forgot - this one has consumed the shower -rag Danny Bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside of his "reality show" ...
