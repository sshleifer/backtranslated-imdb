Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing films like "Funny Games". This time he adopted Elfriede Jelineks "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably his best work so far. Jelinek always writes about violent behavior in families, and especially about the repression of women in a patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Viennese Consevatory. He still lives with his mother (Annie Giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (already a hint of something strange). Erika angers her students the same way she is bullied by her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but simply refuses to sleep with him. He wants to play with her, but he's disgusted. Reluctantly it follows its rules, which means disaster for both. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear image language, everything is shot in an almost spartan way, so the complex characters and the story are improved. /> <br /> People who don't know Austria very well may not realize how essential the setting for the story is. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard) suffers from the coldness and ease of Austrian families and societies. The Austrians (at least the people of Vienna) are often unable to articulate their pains, desires, suppress their emotions, so often there is not enough love, affection and closeness in their families. In a society where it is most important to show a perfect facade to society (even if this means protecting crimes within families as Erika and her mother protect Walters' rape of Erika to avoid a scandal) rather than face Your Emotional Problems Probably Not It I wonder if Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, they only have time that they share some emotions, she is very violent and not at all loving. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with the desires of violence, so that she can finally release some feelings. But she doesn't have anyone who really wants to talk about her emotions, so in the end she has to stab herself to alleviate her inner pain. <br /> <br /> Isabelle Huppert shows her best interpretation of her career (and also of most other actresses). With an unkempt face one often sees only a hint of emotion on his face, a quick smile, a look with his eyes. And in the end his pain is masterfully shown without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also have powerful performances, but the film belongs to Huppert.
