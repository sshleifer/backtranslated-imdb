When this movie came out, I saw Geena Davis play only feminine and soft roles ... This film was anything but tender and feminine. Big lines, great action ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too violent for children, but if you and your significant other are trying to agree on a movie, try this in size. Go Geena! Go Geena!
