I agree with what Mallicka.b said. The film is portrayed in a way that seems to be a sort of denigration of the original content. Emotions are not transmitted correctly. I imagine a couple of not-so-good shows contributed to his mediocrity. From my point of view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of his scenes, he seems a bit lustful, which is ultimately not what the film should have been about. I also noticed some over-acting in some of his scenes. I am a harsh critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can't help it; sorry for that thing. 'Raincoat' was a good film by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed.
