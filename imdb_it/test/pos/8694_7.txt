This film appears from time to time on the ABC in Australia at 3 am. <br /> <br /> Start with the scene of a bus accident in London. <br /> <br /> the films have flashbacks of each character as the film progresses, in addition to the expired Big Ben photography that reoccurs, to symbolize what events occurred thirteen hours ago, until the bus crash. <br /> <br /> It took me a while to figure it out, but still it was fun. <br /> <br /> If Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino met and made a film, this could be the result - because of the flashbacks and small stories that intertwine, and the dead. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of the main characters, as it's been a while since I've seen it, but a rare jewel.
