There is much more complexity in the plot of this wonderful film that stimulates thought rather than infidelity and the cover-up of responsibility for the accident. I was struck by the apparent initial goodness of the husband Wilkinson who wanted the driver, when he thought it was Everett, revealed to the police, and the change of heart (and morale) when he learned he was his wife. Besides, he was really good, and / or he was trying to redeem himself, allowing her to go with Rupert. Then, things changed and SHE decided that the right to do was to admit that she hit him. Above all the theme of redemption (for the incident - for infidelity - in its strange and imperfect way) is the strongest in the care of Watson's patient for Everett. I think that's why he took this effort. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, The End of the Affair come to mind. I love it.
