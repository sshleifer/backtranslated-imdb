This film was very nice and totally childish. My grandchildren have seen it without interruption since they got it, and as a result I saw it almost 4 times to the end. I just can not get enough. CGI images are fantastic to watch, humor is good and ballet performances are excellent. Even if the plot has some holes, no girl will notice them and, as an adult, the film is so fascinating that hardly anyone realizes it. Keep in mind that this is a Barbie movie and, though at times, as far as I'm concerned, in my experience, this is up to the high standards that other Barbie princess movies have set for it. I would recommend it to anyone who has a child who has always wanted to be a princess. It also teaches a good lesson. Each one is special and different in its own way, and everyone can make a difference.
