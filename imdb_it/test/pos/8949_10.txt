This film is one of the most fun I've seen in years. A film that deals with death and funerals without being depressing or irreverent. Christopher Walken supplies much of the comedy in this fascinating love story and I couldn't breathe to laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> I saw the film premiered, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but applauded. I'm telling all my friends to see him arrive in the United States. I definitely plan to review it at the theater and buy it on DVD as soon as it is available.
