This is probably my favorite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! It always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is only something that is surprising, difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> It seems that some or all of the episodes also synchronize with the music albums. Here are some examples. (The episodes start again when they finish - but DO NOT play the end credits until the end, but always play the opening titles. With most episodes the album is played once and the episodes are played twice, but some go beyond.) <br /> <br /> RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BOB Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 "Double bogey" Kid A / OK Computer (the episode is played at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 'Saturn' Kid A / Meddle / Shot Of Love <br /> <br /> 2.19 'World without Alex' Kid A / Wish You Were Here / Pablo Honey (the episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> There are clues in the episodes that tell you which albums to sync . Kid A can sync with EVERY episode!
