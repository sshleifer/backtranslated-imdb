I'm a big fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these movies. The Assignment is based on a true story, which has been embellished for the big screen, and really takes you on a fun run. The film has an exceptional cast, with Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Naval officer Quinn is reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance meeting with Kingsley who believes that Quinn is the famous terrorist Carlos the Sciacallo. Since Quinn looks a lot like Carlos, Sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the capture or death of the terrorist. <br /> <br /> The training sequences are fantastic. Quinn is really being tested by Kingsley and Sutherland, having to resist the attacks of remote controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food every day, being drugged with a hallucinogen. He also needs to learn how to make love with a woman like Carlos would. <br /> <br /> The film has some great action scenes with Quinn evading allies because they believe it is Carlos and in his final mission when he is killing the jackal Throughout the film, Quinn has to struggle with the new personality which it achieved compared to its own. Will he remain ruthless and free like Carlos or will he return once again in the life of a good husband and father? <br /> <br /> If you like the espionage genre, this is a must see. The action is used only to advance the plot of this thriller; no free explosion or combat scenes. Rated 10 out of 10 stars.
