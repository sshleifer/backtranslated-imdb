Finally I managed to get a copy of Dario Argento's Opera, and I tell you ... it was time! It was the last Silver movie I hadn't seen yet and I'm a fan of most of his work. I think most of his work is extremely important for the horror genre, but some of his films tend to disappoint (like Phenomenon). But the idea of ​​Opera's plot has always fascinated me and it turned out that I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and was fascinated by this movie for the first minute until the last one. Of all the Argento films, Opera went straight to the top and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see that too. <br /> <br /> The screenplay and the idea-plot of Opera is quite simple. Especially compared to the previous Silver Phenomena movie that had too many ideas in it, and ended up being a mess. The plot of the Opera is disturbing and chilling but at the same time it is an excellent satirical comment - almost a parody - towards the opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the beautiful Cristina Marsillach) is haunted by a horrible sadistic assassin. During each massacre he commits, he forces Betty to look at his actions with wide eyes. There are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them, they are torn to pieces. *** END SPOILER ***. To this simple but effective idea, Argento adds many horrible elements such as crows, the classic piece (and curse) of MacBeth and the whole atmosphere of opera and music. Above all the presence of creepy crows are and added value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds have a lot of mystery around them, and even Dario Argento knows it. <br /> <br /> Violence and blood are very well presented in Opera and this is what makes this a true Silver picture. Its best in my opinion with Deep Red as a close second. I certainly hope to recommend this film to many people among you. Especially for fans of the horror business (Italian), this is an absolute must! Favorite "Rewind" -scene: Silver shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty's friend gets hit in the eyes as he tries to see who's in front of the door.
