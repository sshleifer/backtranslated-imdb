<br /> <br /> SPOILER IN THIS REVIEW <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is yet another example of a common affliction of many modern films; starts on a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory has been erased regains consciousness of itself - and the initial setup is addictive but then it seems that writers do not know very well where to go and the whole thing always goes down more confused and / or crazy, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was fine, but promised to be much better. The bad guys are extraordinarily insignificant, and even Jackson's comedian's turn seems more like his pre-Pulp Fiction days; it seems that Harlin, as at Cutthroat Island, has made every effort so that no one could overshadow his then wife. His character is by far the best in the film and this makes you feel even more frustrated that they haven't been able to do anything better with it. <br /> <br /> However, there is still something in this film that for me distinguishes it from the Hollywood shareholder and places it above the average, if not all. It's something very subtle I can't put my finger on; it is a disturbing, cold, dark, even sickly limit, a nightmare and unreal feeling, a decadent air, an evil vein, which continues to appear in various ways. It is in the dark reddish photograph and the almost permanent night in which the characters live, in Samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, in his fierce eyes and smile every time he is about to kill a man or when he announces how he will enjoy watching his nemesis you die with the daughter you listen to, it's in Mitch's return at the wheel of a car while he shoots so much blood from his mouth that he can barely speak ... I don't know, it's an atmosphere, something I can't define but it gives me the creeps (a little) and that makes this film still strangely intriguing to me.
