Lackawana Blues An impressive HBO film about a beautiful woman who has made her home a home for several characters. Touching, alive, entrancing - a fantastic mix of sounds and stories - based on a true story with an All-Star cast. One capsule of the time on ..... <br /> <br /> you get the point and no you are not on the payola for the HBO crew - I would like to throw myself around more superlatives but I'm about to leave. DVD extras include a deleted scene, a featurette and a comment. The funniest part of the featurette was the "star" lighting they used during the interview with executive producer Halle Berry .. <br /> <br /> Seriously OK - good times A
