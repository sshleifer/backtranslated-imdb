I am originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this film was the exploitation that was done to that boy. They told his life story and never had a centavo of that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through this lifestyle in Brazil. Sad ... but this is the world we live in. It's about making money without saving lives. The question is: where is Fernando today? Most likely ... dead. We tend to want to live in this "life full of Disney's fantasy bubbles". When someone approaches the plate to help ... the highest power comes and says, "What do I get from this? Where is my cut?" - I wish people's conscience spoke!
