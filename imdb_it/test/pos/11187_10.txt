A group of evil businessmen must demolish a building to build a huge complex, but they cannot remove the tenants. Tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs collide until the film ends with one of the funniest fights ever! The red-haired guy who does 'eeeeehhhh' every time he throws a punch and the other who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, just to be beaten by the camera, makes this vision essential if you like to laugh rather than film than with them.
