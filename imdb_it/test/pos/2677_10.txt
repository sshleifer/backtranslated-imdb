This show is fantastic! I love every episode. Carrie is a spitfire and Doug is a lovable and sometimes a moron. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carrie's Boss add a nice finishing touch to the show, tying all the funny moments, peeing in the pants. In one of the seasons, Doug tries to get Carrie drunk, because she's prettier when she's drunk. Nice husband, right? Carrie isn't much better, when her boss needs an IPS driver to testify in a small case about her job, Carrie hesitates, because she sees Doug as a slob and doesn't want him to embarrass her, so he hires Doug's friend . Wife of the year But, who I think to be more fun is Arthur at random. It's hilarious, hilarious and angry. Hey, you would be too if you were to live in a basement where mold has a strange smell and makes you dizzy. This show is fun, and if you haven't seen it yet, you haven't lived!
