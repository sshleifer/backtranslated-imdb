On New Year's Eve, the tuberculosis sister of the Salvation Army Edit (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her on her deathbed. Meanwhile, the alcoholic David is telling the other two drunkards in the cemetery the legend of the Phantom Coach and his coachman: according to legend, the last sinner to die in the turn of the new year becomes the soul collector, who gathers souls in his coach. When David refuses to visit Edit, his friends argue with him, they fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of last year. George revisits parts of David's hateful life and in flashbacks, shows how David was bad and selfish. <br /> <br /> "Körkarlen" is an impressive and elegant silent film, with magnificent special effects (for a 1921 film). The characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated and there is a strange and inexplicable situation when Sister Edit says she loves David Holm. Why should an enlightened woman love a despicable man who has wasted his life corrupting other people? Despite being religiously dated in our day, in the end it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Carroça Fantasma" ("The Phantom Coach")
