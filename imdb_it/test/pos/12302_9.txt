John Huston, actor and director known for the most solid voices like "The Misfits" and "African Queen", directs his daughter, Angelica Huston, in what was to be his last film. In fact, the film was released after Huston's death. Based on the novel of the same name by James Joyce, "The Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 in Dublin. Huston, his cast and screenwriters, including his son Tony, have created a jewel in a movie. The novella is among Joyce's most beautiful works (besides being the only film). The film is a tribute to the genius of Huston. He took a small, beautiful story and made a small and beautiful film. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (even if "shine" is too flashy, a word too flashy to describe their silent and sober performance). "The Dead" reflects the Huston family's love for Ireland and is, in its own way, a final film suitable for a legend.
