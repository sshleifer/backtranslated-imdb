Imagine this. Someone makes a film about the Columbine or Virginia technological massacre, only the film is directed by the guy who made it home alone (I know he's not just naked with me) and sees Sean Astin out of Goonies !! imagine that the terrorists are overwhelmed by buckets of water on top of half-open doors and marbles and this is why you have to see the movie. unfortunately he does not go all the way having the skateboard lying on the floor for the wicked Mexicans to stumble but halfway you have to give it over 7 for that but not a 9 because it hasn't become crazy enough. Too bad, he seemed to be a comedian, deserving of cult status
