When I look at a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm looking at something that's been well thought out, run smoothly and bold enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I find myself complaining about the level of comedy generally produced. TV and movies are so constantly full of easy and condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence on a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the "benefit" of the study notes or the substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem. The producers and network suits must turn to Travis Davis' out there for material and stop awarding offers to people simply because their resume or agent can ask them to do so. Boy-Next-Door has, hopefully, gained the attention of the right people to facilitate more work from Davis. It's really fun and very well done!
