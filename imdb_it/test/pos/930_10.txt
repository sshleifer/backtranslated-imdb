Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet in England, but it seems that she is growing ever farther as the film progresses. One night, after refusing a pass made by his colleague, he hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and returns it to its owner, a retired hostile judge who is living as a hermit and interceptor, listening to the conversations of all his neighbors. He becomes fascinated by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games. A conversation that the two listen to is extremely important, however, the conversation between a young man who will soon be a judge and his wife, whom we discover is parallel to the life of the man who is listening to them. As we find out more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then he continues his story, and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same destiny. Valentine doesn't know how his life, this meeting and the fate of the young judge intertwine together. His hitting the dog that day seemed to be destiny, a divine sacrifice of the dog for its owner, allowing Valentino to be the savior of the young judge, who is walking the same path as his dear friend, to prevent him from having such a a gloomy future, full of solitude and solitude. It seems that the old man's dream comes true, after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> An INCREDIBLE final for the BEST trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. His use of the colors of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies I've ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are fantastic. Usually meaning with a slight pause or delayed focus in a scene, see if you can spot some. I have to mention this and it is a great SPOILER, I loved the ending, as all the characters in the three films were the survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching him on TV, solidifying the his happiness for the suffering he has to deal with for so many years. I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, a great way to end an incredible movie and trilogy! I recommend it for ALL those who love movies, movies, anything ... A work of art! 10 out of 10 for both the film and the trilogy.
