If you enjoyed this movie, be sure to check out the others directed by Hrebejk - you're ready for a surprise. This unfortunately is not the best, but it is still millions of times better than an average film of mainstream cinema. Explore relationships, particularly offensive ones, has some strong and sweet moments and fantastic acting. Some inconsistencies in the plot, clich√©s and empty moments ruin the overall effect. To the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I don't see this film becoming a Czech blockbuster. These people are rather spoiled by their filmmakers {take a look also at Sverak, Gedeon} and this is a little behind.
