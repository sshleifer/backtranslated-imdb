I have only reviewed some episodes of this series on very poor VHS tapes on which I recorded the series. I'm glad I did, though. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on the children's books of Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the eight-year title (Sarah Polley). He has fun with friends and family and gets in trouble just like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are quite good. "Mystery Meal" drives me crazy like a vegan, but it's fun to see parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue! And every episode that mentions Godzilla Versus The Smog Monster twice can't be all bad. I like Ramona's "Bad Day" even more. Although it is discouraging to see Ramona traverse a hard day, she imagines revenge on her friend Howie's uncle (a pre-Psi Barclay Hope factor), who always teases her. "The Perfect Day" is also good. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona's sister. I swear I saw it on something else, but IMDb lists nothing besides this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every shitty show done on DVD these days except something I'd really like to buy? An injustice if there ever was one!
