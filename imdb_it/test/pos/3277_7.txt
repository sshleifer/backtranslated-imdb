A good old western flight-and-revenge, given a touch and a touch of gravity, injecting a small black social story into the plot. Led by Mario Van Peebles, who does it well, the band of misfits escaping from Bigwig of Billy Zane's (apparently unstoppable) army all recover well, their adventures plausible but amusing and exciting. There are some beautiful moody flashback scenes that create the hero's character and background, a nice shoot-out when our heroes defend the city from the greedy white-land robbers, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad in this humorous and powerful enough western .
