Chucky is back ... and now is! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a small spell of Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this episode, the field is back. This has been the most macabre of this series so far. It has some twists and some good action scenes. <br /> <br /> This was by far the most fun in the series, and successfully, if not intentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror and horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It will be a blast! <br /> <br /> "Jesus, the music scene has ended since I died!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We needed lightness, as the doll thing is getting old. The added comic element and the best action scenes bring this level to the quality of the first, when the idea was fresh and new. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the devil :.
