James Stewart plays Dr. Ben McKenna, who, with his wife and son, are tourists in an Arab city. They are caught in the middle of a murder scene. The victim whispers something in Dr. McKenna's ear, and is told to do something. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, his son is kidnapped. The kidnappers turn out to be a man and a woman he knew, but the woman is a little softer than the man. <br /> <br /> The song, "Que, Sera, Sera" (Whatever we will be, we "ll be," is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie. <br /> <br /> The wife of Stewart of Doris Day plays and sings the song mentioned above. Her performance is worthy of an Oscar, not even nominated. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
