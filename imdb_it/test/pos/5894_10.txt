Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals and made unconditional by enemies who demanded tons and tons of radiation, this was the substance of evoking the US victory in World War II !! The celebration of Times Square and all the other United States suggests a national zenith !!! America is in the upper right corner !! one thing, a distressing and painfully perverse thing ... The adaptation period !! .. The actual celebration is over when the bottle of champagne is over ... Now everyone needs to go on with their lives ... just a problem though .. They have to get new lives ... the old lives are disappeared forever ... Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile fa√ßade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water !! All the characters in the film are challenged by primary doubts and unable to mask a fiction about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it wasn't true !!! Once sergeants, generals and their wives, daughters and sons and practically all the other Americans touched by the Second World War, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of the Second World War and what they realized and denied, nobody was the same! ! For now, social and moral issues had an interest in the service of themselves ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start all over again !! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have married Virginia Mayo in the first place !!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware that she is constructively selfish !! But, not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and thinks that all those around him are as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to do it !! <br /> <br /> The reason why this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending has been reached in the hardest way, once everyone has recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world, the tragedy World War II was recognized and the things that were emotionally torn pieces were taken into consideration, and treated accordingly !! Frederick March and Myrna Loy must return to chapter one of their marriage, Homer informed his new bride about what it takes to marry him (ie half the time, he will feel like a nurse) and the involvement of Thresa Wright with Dana Andrews means that his entry into adulthood was partly responsible for breaking a marriage ... This amounts to learning how to drive a car to get a driving license in Indianapolis 500 ... The characters in the movie are the typical Americans of the post-war period in which they are stalled by the abrupt awakening of coercive changes in their lives ... Happiness is no longer allowed the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic ... now it is a question of formidable conditions and good victories on evil because of the less bad choice !! ... World War II simply didn't happen !! From now on it will dominate the social models of American life !!! <br /> <br /> The aggregate catastrophe of the Second World War also reflected the feelings of human personal inadequacy of most Americans !! I loved this movie and so the AFI, probably for the reason that highlighted issues that were once unjustifiably taboo !! .. In conclusion, watch this movie !! Nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and / or readjustment, coping with your life when you are affected by a disability and simply acting in a human way are constantly portrayed in movies and on television today, HOWEVER !! this is 1946 !! Very new for Americans so .... REMEMBER THAT !! Director William Wyler illustrated how the Americans feel about the consequences of the Second World War in the days when the film industry left him with a hand tied behind his back !!! Take it into consideration and you will probably realize how sensational this movie has been !!
