I absolutely love this show !!!!!!!, Its improved version of the simpsons is basically fox (cau'se let the simpsons be very dry if you are over 9. It's political, irrational and irresistible Whoever says they don't like, he is lying, there is a character for everyone: Peter, Stewie and Quagmire are my favorite Peter because he is rude, unpleasant and doesn't give a damn about his incredible intelligence and how he hits you with something that an adult would say when an adult would say when the less you expect it. And the quagmire because one of the guilty pleasures is dirty jokes. It is also an episode for everyone If you are the political type, Mr. Griffin goes to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3) If you like more than sexual and physical humor, there is an impossible emission (VOL.2 SEASON 3.) Or if you like any other kind of humor, there's damn Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2). Basically what I'm saying is that when you watch this show there is a humor that divide the parts for everyone. GIGGITY GOOOOO!
