stuey unger was a card game legend. was quoted in an interview as saying, "One day, I suppose it's possible for someone to be a better No Limit Hold'em player than me. I doubt it, but it could happen, but, I swear, I don't show it as someone he could never play better than me. "there is a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so incredible that you could have cropped it in 'X-Men' as a showcase for the super power of a superhero. it's amazing how this man was. <br /> <br /> I have some small problems with this movie. As obscure as the film was, stuey's real life was darker. Pro todd brunson said: "During the last World Series of poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and we talked about Stu. Mike told us how he could barely talk, he didn't shower from weeks and as his fingers were burned black from a crack. "in the film, Michael Imperioli seemed too healthy to be fed up in the last years of his life. when stuey won his last wsop it looked like a skeleton, but let's face it, this production lacked both the time and the "deniro" to make that kind of transformation. my other problem was that I wish there were more poker games, with real hands and situations. of course he could have bored the average poker enthusiast, but it would have been nice for the tough ones. pity that the film was not 6 hours or more. <br /> <br /> I saw the film with 3 non-poker players and they all had a great time. just like you don't have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy Gibson's "patriot", you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem. I can't wait for the DVD. (8 of 10)
