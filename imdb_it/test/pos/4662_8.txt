Well, I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister, Carol. Carol and I played the "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We didn't have to prepare much for the fat part, which came with us, and well and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first major film and we had a lot of fun doing it. We were 21 and we lived about an hour and a half from The Disney Studio in Burbank and Hollywood, California. We grew up watching TV and probably the first generation of key-kids. Twenty years later, we still have a lot of fun and we are still "heavy" or what is politically correct these days. We no longer pursue acting, but we have been advised to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown, in southern California, and I am in the field of Information Technology in Georgia. I have a prejudice, but I thought the film was nice, clean and fun. We knew it was not a masterpiece or an Oscar candidate, however, it was and still is a film that the whole family can watch and enjoy together. It's nice not to worry if your kids can watch a video without having to quickly advance some parts. And no one was out when it was released on video as I was with Carol. Carol found it at Kmart for $ 6.99! This is a cheap way to capture your memories and share them with others. <br /> <br /> Kind regards, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The Thompson Twins
