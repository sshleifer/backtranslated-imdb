This Washington thriller is superbly done and of a high level directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen with screenwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years, so maybe tends his roses). The film has Clint Eastwood in the role of an elderly secret service agent and John Malkovich in the role of a vengeful killer who pits himself against each other in a massive test of will and ingenuity, in which the life of the President is at stake . The useless secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost make the president disappear, which is an authentic touch. This film was made when Eastwood and Malkovich were on top. Eastwood has probably never done a better job than he does here, and it's all so easy for the old professional. There are some wonderful sound effects of him that puff and puff as he runs beside the car of the President as a bodyguard, for which he is too old. I wonder if anyone else has noticed the humor of those noises that have been added. My "guardian angel", whose name is Vigil, has enjoyed this movie even more than me, but bodyguards are very important. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls in love with Eastwood, since she is so obvious but so talented, and shines. The tension is stretched to every inch of the way in this story, and Eastwood's psychological struggles to redeem himself from a previous failure of protection are magnificently demonstrated by his typical sober acting. With Eastwood, if you raise an eyebrow a millimeter, be careful! Of course, he is the master of super-cool. Malkovich has the opportunity to indulge in all the creepiness he could wish for in the paranoid character he interprets, and captures man's central vanity to perfection. How beautiful?
