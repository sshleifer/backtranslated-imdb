Don't they make movies like this anymore ?? although some may say it's a good thing. Although this was among the first films to be classified as Disney's PG, it has more of the impression of G's films made in the 1970s (ie "Freaky Friday", "The Greatest Athlete") than the PG movies that came out in the early 80s (ie "Watcher in the Woods", "Tron", "Something was evil this way"). Because of Disney's support, "Midnight Madness" obviously had a large budget. A huge cast and lots of different places go to prove it. But laziness, a crazy treasure hunt and a spectacular visual style were not enough to save the film from being a huge flop ... A box office failure, most of us were introduced to the HBO film in the first months ?? 1980s, at the time when the same films were shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait, they still do it!). Essentially HBO did for this film what CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz" ?? have created a huge cult audience for a sugary mega-flop .... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes this film "bad" is that there are too many characters and very few of them are made of meat out ?? Eddie Deezen's "team" doesn't even have names! The blue team, although they are the bad guys, is the most eye-catching and has the most jobs put into their characters (except the girl, who can't act and doesn't have enough to do). Harold, played to perfection by Stephen Furst, is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film. The other leading figure is Melzo, played with tons of charm by today's director Andy Tennant. Although then-Dr. Pepper spokesman David Naughton should have been the star, his character often proves to be unpleasant, particularly when he clashed with his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. While everyone has favorite characters, I don't think anyone who loves the film can disagree with the fact that Furst and Fox are the only two characters that you really learn about. <br /> <br /> Despite the many flaws and bad actors in the film (many of whom have fallen from the face of the earth after this film) it still works because the actors seemed to enjoy themselves - and the fun on the set is fun on the screen. Come on, that college student doesn't dream of wandering around in a tub of beer and which zoftig girl doesn't dream of stealing the show from the local discotech ... um ... I think today she would be at a rave. .. Campy, a clean game for all those who were young in the 70s and 80s, it is right that this has finally got the huge video release it deserves. But where the hell is the widescreen version of the DVD with the comment, the trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco?
