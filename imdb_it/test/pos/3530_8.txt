September 29, 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation for horror films. This was the date on which BBC1 broadcast (for the only time I'm aware of it) the unbelievable shocking 1981 by Jeff Lieberman, Just Before Dawn, and impressed me enormously. Almost twenty years later, I am pleased to announce that I finally got my hands on the special Shriek Show / Media Blasters two-disc edition, and it's just as disturbing and disturbing as I remember it, if not more. <br /> <br /> The plot, as usual for genre films (and this was Lieberman's first film as a "director for hire", although he removed at least all the mumbo-jumbo of cult of the snakes of the religious sect from the script), is a bit thin - five likeable twenty-year-olds (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in a couple of narrow and insecure tight steps) venture into the dense forests of Oregon to make a place in camping and to check a piece of land was left as a legacy to one of them. But Just Before Dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because Lieberman wastes no time in showing us how unbalanced things are on this particular piece of mountain, with a complete innocent skewered and a truck of a drunken preacher pushed down a hill and swallowed by flames within minutes of the beginning of the film. The youngsters enter the picture in a snappy Winnebago, Blondie's "Heart of glass" that beats on the soundtrack and before you can say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" they slammed an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the maniac heavily responsible for the opening catastrophes. Forest ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that things will go wrong if they go further, but they will go on with the journey anyway, refusing to give the preacher a ride, even if he is understandably scared with no brains and eventually launched miles from field from anywhere. Needless to say, things are going downhill from here. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not short of bloody horror and well-managed action scenes, the best moments for me are those in which Lieberman lets out his camera, long and slow, with seemingly blows harmless to fun-loving children who wander in the desert, or simply let them settle for a while in the dense, imposing woods that invade people. Makes Oregon's exteriors as threatening and threatening as Kubrick made the spacious interiors of the Overlook Hotels in the Shining, and Brad Fiedel's soundtrack (underestimating the horribly distorted racket that runs over titles) remains the intruder's right side, emphasizing the rapidly escalating threat with subtlety and style. There are a lot of surprises along the way, he nods to Deliverance with the discovery of a backwood girl and his extravagant and disturbing family, and a truly bizarre killing technique deployed just before the end of the film. I won't ruin it for you. I've said enough. <br /> <br /> Enough because this underrated horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult object instead of an indispensable success it is difficult to ascertain, but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come - it deserves to be.
