This film deserves a 20/10 if I could give it. "THE HOLLOW" is a great novel by Hercule Poirot and the twist ends with most people. I am delighted that this film has remained faithful to the novel. There was no major difference I could identify. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier in the novel. The acting was superb and the music, as usual, was of an incredible quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is also perfect in their respective roles. In no other film I've seen so far has Poirot been portrayed so brilliantly! An affectionate greeting to the producers: they made a film that I and many others will appreciate for a long time to come!
