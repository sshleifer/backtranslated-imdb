This was really a nice surprise. I was awake last night and couldn't fall asleep. Not thinking about it seriously, I turned on my TV and HBO was on, and this movie had just started. Fortunately I saw everything and I am very happy to have done it. Because this film was very good. The actors were well expressed and did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson performed well, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. This film made me realize that he is a good actor. Brian Keith was as good as his father, as Trey Wilson played the Colonel (this was the last role of Trey Wilson before his untimely death. Too bad, he was a quality actor and looked like a good guy). Even Jobeth Williams did a good job as Kristofferson's American wife. As for directing, I had no idea that Franklin J. Schaffner was the director until I read the review in Leonard Maltin's Guide to the Movies (this was the last film I ever made). Now I understand why this film was so beautiful. Schaffner also directed Patton, a truly fantastic film (I didn't see his other great film, Papillon). As I watched "Welcome Home," I said to myself, "this director really knows what he's doing," not knowing that Schaffner had directed him. There is a really beautiful scene in a Thai orphan shelter, enough to bring tears to my eyes. Not only was he oriented in a sensitive way, but he was also directed in a very cheap and tense way. There is nothing wasted in Schaffner's effort. The script was one of the reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The writer does not weigh down the actors with too many lines. It was written in a very simple but very effective way. It just shows you that a lot can be said in a few words. This film also made me proud to be an American, at the same time as he showed you how beautiful ALL people are.
