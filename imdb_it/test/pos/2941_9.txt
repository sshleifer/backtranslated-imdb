Yes, I'm ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively DEVINE !!! It's so fun, and I have the absolute best time watching it. Since Cycle 1 it has been fantastic, and I have not noticed a ruin in its glory ALL ALL.Tyra Banks as you know is the host, and however fabulous it is, there are also other judges and co-hosts like J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. The main point of the show is for every girl invited to become the next top America model, she has to make her way to the top by completing and winning photo shoot competitions. It looks great already it's not like that, and let me tell you it's GREAT !!!! It's great to look at all the different types of photos taken by the girls, and each one is different, fresh and bold. All those who hate this show, have no idea, and I'll tell you that this show will be for a long time, so TRUST IT !!!
