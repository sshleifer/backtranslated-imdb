One of Chaplin's longest films to date, Burlesque on Carmen is an intelligent and surprisingly complex parody of what was then the famous story of "Prosper Merimee" on "Carmen". I was a bit confused about the difference between the Burlesque IMDb list of 1915 on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the execution time I assume it was the 1915 version I saw, since the 1916 version is a full 20 minutes more, and from what I've read, these are 20 minutes unnecessary and not impressive. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it is clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date, starting from a long history, told through intrasitoli, about the tragic story of love of Carmen. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies ("A band that put the GYP in Gypsy."), to seduce a Spanish officer so that they can carry out the smuggling operation. He is an intelligent band of Chaplinian criminals, whose leader, Lillas Pastia, "spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking he would be offered a job in politics". <br /> <br /> In a side note, I saw some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's previous works, but probably none quite as obvious as this. Towards the beginning of the film, while the Gypsy band is traveling, there is a scene where mules and women are charging, and a title explains that "mules are those with long ears". In case you couldn't tell, I guess. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose, the unhappy official who must be seduced by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and lover of women". Not really a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubts about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms. And, of course, he didn't have to act to be a lover of women. <br /> <br /> What is different here, of course, is its shiny military uniform and its disciplinary manner with a straight back, interspersed, of course with some of its traditional moves. It strikes me as a boy in a position of authority, who struggles to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exercising a rough and stolid aspect. <br /> <br /> Carmen soon enters ("Loved by all the men under 96"), and she immediately starts flirting with Charlie. I must say that for much of the film, it is surprisingly true to the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, capable of evoking a jealous passion that I have never seen from him. There is at least one scene where it's really a bit scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has some nice gags in the film, like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fights towards the end. Even his boyish charm and the role of a soldier are certainly a winning combination, even if there is another strange acrobatics that involves a group of men that pushes a big door back and forth that was not very effective at the beginning , but he kept going back and forth, probably about five times longer than it was worth. Although it was interesting to note that when it finally fell it was clearly revealed as a cinematographic object. I always appreciate these glimpses of old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is the strongest part. It has a striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but just when you think that Chaplin will conduct a great thematic experiment diverging away from his traditional style, there is a hilarious twist that is like Chaplin vintage like anything I've ever seen. Good job!
