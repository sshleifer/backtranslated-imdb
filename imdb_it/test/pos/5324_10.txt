Each role, up to the smallest, was chosen and interpreted with bravado. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary Jena Malone has never made a false step. Her two co-stars are the same as her in this film. Ryan Gosling could be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives his best performance to date. This is a thought and a conversation that causes a film that should be seen by teenagers and young adults. You will think and talk about this movie for days. Highly recommended.
