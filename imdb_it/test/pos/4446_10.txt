Do not Torture a Duckling is an absolutely stunning yellow diversion for Lucio Fulci. Unlike other heavyweight subgenres such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci takes a decidedly gritty, grounded and socially perceptive approach to the yellow narrative of this film. There is nothing fascinating in the murders of children and borderline pedophilia (a brave subplot for 1972) that is happening here, and Fulci wisely shoots with a staid and dismal eye, avoiding the flash, melodrama and directorial histrionics . The acts are punctuated by burning and instantly captivating pieces that are further strengthened by Fulci's strident sense of realism? the scene of the deeply disquieting "witch that kills" in particular, with its bald brutality, looks like a sniffing film. The composer Riz Ortolani holds these scenes full of carnage with fierce bursts of reverberating strings. <br /> <br /> The film is crowned by a simultaneous lyrical and violent conclusion in which theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition clash. It is a deeply effective ending that has the ability to leave the viewer in a confused and unarmed torpor. <br /> <br /> Fulci could not have chosen a better location for this film. Not torturing a duckling was photographed in and around the ancient city of Matera, Italy. While Matera continues to modernize until today (highlighted by the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial one), it is grappling with its UNESCO sponsored reputation as a repository for mysterious Paleolithic ghosts. The anxieties of the real life of the Materans are reflected by the characters in the film, who, wearing their Christianity on their sleeves, frantically face any tradition of exotic fringe (or witchcraft) that moves away from the norm. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Matera was also used as a substitute for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ. If anything, this adds even more power to Fulci's message. Catholic guilt and macabre killings are such a resonant combination.
