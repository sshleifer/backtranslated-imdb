I love this movie. I saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so my sister could watch it. This movie is so funny. There are two times I was laughing so hard that my sides hurt. I didn't expect to see such a funny movie; I really wanted to see him just because there was Laura Fraser. I saw it for the first time in Titus, which is also a fantastic film. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers have already said, too many people expect a moving film. You're not going to take it. What you get is humor, eye candy and the ability to ask yourself exactly what your perfect companion would be if you could create them. You can also ask yourself how it would be blocked in the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A hilarious sequence involves Justine seeing herself first as a naked man. I was going to pieces. <br /> <br /> I swear, this film is the most imaginative kid movie I've ever seen and is now my favorite. <br /> <br /> Just remember why the movies were originally created; as entertainment not philosophy in motion. Remember this and you'll have a blast watching virtual sexuality.
