Blademaster is definitely a memorable item in the Swords and Sorcery movie category. I found the Blademaster together with Quest for the Mighty Sword in a second-hand shop frequented by people with mental handicaps and I was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. Credible sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful warrior, Mila make this watch fun. Some problems, however, there were many details in the plot that did not fit, like cavemen for one. I didn't understand their purpose. Moreover, this film could have really benefited from some other monsters. The snake was beautiful, but I think he borrowed a little from Conan. However, any primitive type of film in which someone ends up with a hanglider is OK on my part (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Ator is beautiful! Oh, and someone was reminded of Gallager by the bad guy or is it just me? I give the blademaster at 7/10
