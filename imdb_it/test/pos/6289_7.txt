This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should see. O.K., is the only one I've ever seen, and I think I've made good choices. Normally I find Shore's shtick a little tired, but it's very funny in this movie. Actually, the script is pretty funny, and Shore doesn't overwhelm other actors with his ... what do you call it? Buffonata? However, this is a funny film, if ultimately forgettable. --Frink-3
