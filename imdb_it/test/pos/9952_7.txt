William Shakespeare's Venice merchant portrays 16th century Venice. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish lender who plots revenge on a Catholic who has looked down on him. The film is a slow plot at the beginning that accumulates during the two more hours. The film looks very good and believed to his characters, particularly Pacino. When it is heard that Pacino plays a Jew, one might think that it would not work by watching the previous roles of Pacino's mobster-type movie. Nevertheless it works very well, you have to give credit to the costume designers and film directors. The appearance of all the characters is well suited to the time period in which the game takes place. The costumes seem to be the Renaissance aspect that one could imagine. <br /> <br /> The film shows a very anti-Semitic atmosphere. From the first minute to the last it is shown how Catholics try to take advantage of the Jews in every possible way, to the point of keeping them locked up in "ghettos" and not allowing them to perform regular jobs. Compared to The Passion of Christ, another recent film that people believed to be very anti-Semitic, Merchant of Venice makes the Passion seem like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted to take revenge for the mistreatment that the Jews had received. Even the location shots seem very current and the view is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film, making it only much more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic because the ugly is usually shown around Jews and the beauty around Catholics. <br /> <br /> Although the film clearly seeks to have a serious aura in certain parts, you add some humor to the action. The oh so serious process between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) enter the process and decide who will be the winner and the loser. This in itself might not be fun, but seeing that they were women dressed in disguise as men could be pretty funny. The entire cross dress scene, irresistible as it may have been probably even more memorable, pointed out to the make-up artists and director Michael Radford that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized. The director could also have seen in the fact that women are talking through their regular voices instead of trying to look like men, which partly takes the stage but doesn't kill it completely. <br /> <br /> Overall the film gets a 7 out of 10
