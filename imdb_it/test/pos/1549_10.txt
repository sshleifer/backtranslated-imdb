In the 1960s, this sad study by Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most illustrious and respected British filmmakers of all time. At that point, I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the underprivileged, and I was very impressed with the film's aesthetics, its free style, its austere color cinematography and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also very surprised to find that Terence Stamp (which had become a celebrity, thanks to "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") had so little time on screen. Although 20th Century Fox has released "Poor Cow" in Panama, Loach has not remained in mainstream cinema (which hardly is this film) and I have lost contact with his films. I just heard about his successes, "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I reached it in the 1980s. The beautiful song by Donovan's title, among other things, is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
