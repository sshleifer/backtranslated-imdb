I Sell the Dead is a great horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. This has advantages and disadvantages. The film's 85 minutes are child's play and the film is full of bits that are sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes bloody, sometimes all three at once, but the individual pieces are much better than the sum of the parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The story, as it stands, follows the professional thief Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden), Arthur's criminal partner, just lost his head for murder and Arthur left one night before his own head was missing for the same crime. Arthur insists he is innocent of murder, but there are many other crimes he is willing to confess when he is corrupted with Irish Whiskey by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman). <br /> <br /> Since the film is a series of anecdotes of tombs confessed by Arthur, it becomes a sort of horror anthology - a series of disconnected stories, all connected by a similar cast (Arthur and Willie) and a similar theme (robbery tombs). Like most horror anthologies, there is no coherent mythology, because all mythologies are true and occur simultaneously even when they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably wasn't helpful to see that I saw this movie the same night as Trick 'Treat, a horror anthology that avoids all the traps I sell the Sell The Dead. Actually, Trick 'r Treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unitary and coherent story than I Sell The Dead, which wants to be a united story. <br /> <br /> The other problem with the film (and I recognize that this is a crazy madness) is the way the film plays fast and free with history. Grimes is killed with a guillotine. We may be able to stretch a point and say that he was killed by a Scottish girl, a precursor of the French guillotine, but the Scottish girl was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set a hundred years after the mention of Burke and Hare and were executed for murder in 1829. The tomb stole as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the Anatomy Act (1832), so the film must take place before then. <br /> <br /> I know that bringing this up is the height of historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all kinds of dead, undead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy, to convince the public to suspend disbelief is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy of. And it's not like the story of tomb robbers or corpse snatchers or resurrectionists (call them what you like) is a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that director Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the story, especially the beautiful pieces. For example, when Grimes first hires Arthur as an apprentice, he explains correctly to Arthur that as resurrectionists, they do not steal clothes from the dead, because stealing bodies is a crime, punishable by a small fine, while stealing clothes is a crime punishable deportation or perhaps even death. So you would expect Wille and Arthur to tear the body out at this point (and for the rest of the film) but obviously they don't. You could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script, but not when the writer and director are the same person. <br /> <br /> My point is not that there should have been a lot of corpses stripped in the film, my point is that if you're going to come up with this weirdness in the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law no matter how foolish it is, then you have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion, even if it means that Willie and Arthur end up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip off his clothes and put them back in the empty coffin, so they don't come deported for stealing the body's clothes, otherwise don't raise the issue at all. <br /> <br /> Historical nerdiness aside, I Sell The Dead is worth a rent like a light but fun horror film that could have been much more.
