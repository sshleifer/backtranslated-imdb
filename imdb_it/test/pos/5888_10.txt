In a successful film like this, it is difficult to identify a single factor. All departments work in perfect union to create one of the most moving human dramas ever to be staged. <br /> <br /> Production is a tribute to the efforts of ensembles of writers, producers, actors and crew members. To name just a few, the magnificent Hugo Friedhofer soundtrack is a subliminal marvel, Greg Toland's subtle but surprising photography and William Wyler's incredibly effective direction all combine with an ideal cast to create an American classic. <br /> <br /> The DVD version is a special surprise to see. What a pleasure to see "The best years of our life" so beautifully preserved for generations to come and have fun.
