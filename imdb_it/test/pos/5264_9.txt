This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson shine in this romantic comedy. One is a manager who re-evaluates life based on expectations of his death within a year. The other is a playboy who is tired of the young women who dig gold and look for a relationship with a mature and vital woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, use microwave popcorn, curled up with your honey and get ready for a party.
