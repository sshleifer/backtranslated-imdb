This film easily rivals the emotional strength, dramatic impact and top performance of "12 Angry Men". I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I hadn't heard it before. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the rhythm, interaction and development of the characters as well as some clever photographic works surrounding the character, Estevez sounds all suggest a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw on Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle despair and escape; a variation on his character in "A Play In The Fields Of The Lord". She is irritating and at the same time you can empathize with her. <br /> <br /> There are some moments when I feel that the plot slows down a touch and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend seem almost written for another movie, Estevez looks like another character all together. But these are small complaints. <br /> <br /> This film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who has lived through these experiences. I consider it 8 on a difficult 10. <br /> <br />
