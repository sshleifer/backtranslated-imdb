A western for everything. As the character in the film starring Glenn Ford says, "No, I don't want to fight, but I'll do it if he's forced with me." This film is about being smart, strong and fighting for their beliefs. With courage, never stop fighting for what you feel is right. Great action and fast pace. It's nice to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an old westerner. Glenn Ford lives up to its western image. The extremely entertaining film includes a non-military strategic war. Obviously it is violent, as the title states, but not too graphic like in computer-generated films of the era. These are mainly strong personality clashes.
