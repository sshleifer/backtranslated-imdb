During the Second World War in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers are starving, dying, becoming weak and becoming increasingly mad. A small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, eventually resorted to cannibalism. This film perfectly portrays the madness that surpasses people in extreme conditions. There are some humorous parts in this film, but most are just a very slow and realistic film. Follow these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and eventually death. A very interesting film, which shows the death and horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.
