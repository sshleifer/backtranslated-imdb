A surprisingly good film made in the wake of the Exorcist concerning a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she went to a sanctified church to restore a life to life size and a life like a crucified man. The piece was Christ and the two thieves, yet Christ was long sold out. The problem begins when the figure is removed from the cross and seems to come to life and seduce the woman. From that moment on, it becomes a battle for the soul of girls. Disturbing, scary and much better than you think the movie works because its cast sells decidedly adult events. It helps that these are real people who are imperfect, so it is easier to relate to them. I really enjoyed this movie and, seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade, I was shocked at how beautiful it is. Certainly better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles makes it seem.
