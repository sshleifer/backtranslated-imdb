I'm not very interested in reality shows, but this is great because in the end the viewer gets something useful in addition to entertainment. I have no children, but SuperNanny lessons will be of great help when (and if) I will ever do it! My only complaint is that the show has been watered down since it was in the United States. I prefer the English version, with the most severe approach of the nanny. Is it just me or someone else to find the American version a bit soft ... now is the "kinder, gentler" nanny? I guess Yanks needs a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine quit after all ?! Still, there's nothing wrong with a happy happy ending, isn't it?
