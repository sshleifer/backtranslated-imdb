This movie is fantastic. You will NEVER laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's ... yes, it's ... A BOOB! This film becomes more fun to the second - like when the character of Jackie Chan eventually dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet as treasha! Congratulations if you buy or rent this. You will never give it back, in my opinion. I didn't do it and since then I haven't found it in a store. I saw this movie once and I fell in love with Kung-Fu action movies forever. If you are looking for a fantastic movie in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects ... this is NOT the film. If you're looking for laughter and timeless wonder, take this for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.
