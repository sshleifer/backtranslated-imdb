Ok, so I love stupid movies. If you like silly sci-fi movies, the best movies, or if you're a Mr. Bruce Campbell fan, I'd go see this movie. This film is all I wanted it to be. Being a fan of the best films, this is in line with expectations. Whenever I thought of myself "this movie would be the most exciting and best movie ever if * blank * could happen ..." then, just as I thought, * blank * would have happened. It's a fantastic stupid 'b'-movie. If you're a Campbell fan, I'd say "watch it", bring your friends, laugh at it. It is funny. It's not classic, or anything, but if it's on TV a few nights, watch it. For me, it has become a film that I would have filed under "indulgent films". Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day at work, I could go home to watch (this list also includes "Harold and Kumar go to the white castle", "army of darkness" and "Intolerable cruelty") <br / > <br /> If you feel a film over the top, wonderfully a bit ugly, look at this. otherwise, rent "Bubba Ho-tep"
