... I saw this film when it was first released in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember every black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, disturbing, those furtive attacks through that dark passage in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight with each other by their captors, the last battle with the discovery of the cart with the Gatling in it firing away, the last battle between Peck and the boss, and the happy ending that allows me to catch my breath. I haven't seen him since, and I don't know if it would be a good idea to see him again today, it was a fabulous moment for the boy I was.
