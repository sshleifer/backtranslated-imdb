I have always believed that a film whose plot is centered on a virtual reality video game never sounds like something special but eXistenZ has shown that I could not have been more wrong. This film is incredible and, although very funny, offers much more. From beginning to end, this movie conceptualizes you to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can't make a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this since he does so much. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; the way it is written and the way it is directed is truly unique in its style and can only be a good thing. Cronenberg made a clear target with this film and this was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease. His predilection for the grotesque is not so predominant in this film, as in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but there are still some elements such as game shells and the way they are facts that can make the audience startle. As for his previous work, eXistenZ is more a combination of Videodrome and a less violent Scanner, a truly fantastic combination. The setting of the film in a not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the cinematic environment and also allowed him to visualize more concepts, allowing a less inhibited writing. It was important that the film didn't get too confusing and Cronenberg avoided it very well by keeping things relatively simple. Also, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he knew how to do it much better than that. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ boasts a cast of very talented actors and they all behave very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the best performance of the game designer who spends more time outside reality than it does. Leigh is sexy and influential in her role as Allegra and she gets really involved in the role. The emotional range it shows in the film is particularly impressive, making it completely credible (if you can believe in something). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in fear of his implant character. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra touch. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great supporting actors who add further depth to the film with very colorful performances. The cast of the film is not huge but eXistenZ certainly has the ethic of "quality is better than quantity" that works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being fun and challenging, eXistenZ touches on social issues like control and loss of self. This further demonstrates the film as an intellectual ship and could also explain why it was not a big Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer and even if it is not for everyone, those who love the work of Cronenberg or those who love science fiction will be almost certain that they will appreciate this film. It is one of those films that must be looked at with an open mind but it is really something special.
