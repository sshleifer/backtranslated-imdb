Warning - this film has some surprisingly graphic images and should never be seen by children. <br /> <br /> The artist this story is about was in fact a refined Korean painter who had risen from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also an idiot in so many ways. Part of that was the artistic temperament and what might have seemed annoying was just its demanding nature when it came to art. But at other times he was simply a drunken asshole, especially when he was about to become a great artist. Towards the end of the film, his being annoying, abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished. While this did not make him a particularly nice man, it is important to capture him in a film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. <br /> <br /> I found the film as fascinating and loved as the real works of the artists were shown during the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really hope I can show it to my students (I teach at a school for the arts), but I can't because there's only too much material for adults. Yes, there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (especially the younger ones) is when he, .... hmmm, ... I don't think that IMDb allows me to describe what happened, but it was a lot graph and involves body fluids. Not just an unpleasant and disgusting scene that does NOT need to be seen, but a reason to prevent young people from watching this otherwise wonderful film. It is a pity.
