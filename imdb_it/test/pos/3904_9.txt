I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved watching everything she played in Elizabeth Montgomery. This film was (and still is) a real surprise - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, like her performance as the victim of rape in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderer in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden. Her performance in The Victim as Kate, a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a murderer after her is brilliant. If you like thrilling suspense thrillers, this is a movie that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end. Another great performance that deserves to be mentioned is that of Eileen Heckhart who plays the mysterious and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately like most Miss Montgomery films, The Victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although it was released on VHS some years ago, it is a rarity these days. I was lucky to have recorded it when it was shown on television about ten years ago and so I have a nice copy of this great film. A must see!
