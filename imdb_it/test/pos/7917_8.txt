"Alexander Nevsky" marked the return of the director Sergei Eisenstein to cinema after a period of exile, and what he produced is a bald propaganda film that proclaims Russia's superiority over Germany. <br /> <br /> There is a small plot: the Russians join together to fight the Germans; Russia wins The film is actually an extended montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed with some moments of German brutality (like a rather shocking scene showing German soldiers throwing Russian children on a fiery fire). This was Eisenstein's first sound film, and it is clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. In fact, this movie really looks more like a silent movie with some added sound. There are some dialogue scenes, but they sit rather lifeless on the screen, and the rhythm is all turned off, as if the actors weren't actually on the set together at the same time they were filming them. Eisenstein primarily uses sound as an excuse to overlay an exciting Prokofiev score throughout the process, and indeed, this is one of the film's greatest advantages. <br /> <br /> Say what you want about Eisenstein's ability (or lack) to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for the maximum effect, and "Alexander Nevsky" on all shines through its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Vote: A
