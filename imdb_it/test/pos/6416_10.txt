In the last days of the year 1999, most of all in Taiwan died. A strange plague has devastated the island. Presumably spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like insects. In the end, they die. The Hole takes place in a dilapidated condominium (which is particularly well done, congratulations to the production designer!). His two protagonists live right above and below each other. The woman is downstairs and the pipes above her apartment are losing fiercely, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. Call a plumber to go check, and accidentally make a hole in the man's apartment floor. The two have never met before, and come into contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> The script is quite brilliant. Few films are at the same time so funny, while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially the feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. Like many other directors in Taiwan, he uses a lot of long takes. But unlike, for example, of Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai does not use them excessively. In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen them used better. They are always effective and never boring. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and a great one at that. In the best scenes of the film - which is saying something, considering how good all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are completely choreographed, often with reserve dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius, Tsai has these elaborate numbers taking place in the dilapidated building, the signs of apocalypse and decay not hidden. This provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity. <br /> <br /> The Hole is a film that asks to be seen. It should be a cult classic, if nothing else. Before going to see this, I was told that it was a decent film, but probably the least good of Tsai Ming-liang. Well, if it's true, I can't wait to see another one! 10/10.
