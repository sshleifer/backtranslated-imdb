Being 15 myself I had a lot of fun with this movie !! I referred to the character of Ann August more than he would have been. My mother is not as eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This film is perfect as far as aspects are concerned, and the performances of Natalie and Susan are so closely related that it's the best double on the screen I've seen in years. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this film to anyone who hopes to leave. Because there are many people out there who will want to be "Anywhere But Here", including me! and if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or your mother. It is the tears that mix all around you the most !!
