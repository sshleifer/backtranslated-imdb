This is a very funny and well acted movie. It's fun and sometimes fun. The finish is a bit disappointing, since it tries to wrap everything in a too clean package. The film is remembered for its priceless cartoons: the scenography by Jane Austen, the camping trip as an example. B & H does not attempt to reflect the predominant attitudes towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most characters accept sexual diversity enough. In this sense it is a joyful vacation by the homophobic society. And it's a celebration of flexibility, a loosening of rigid sexual categories - perhaps a happy omen of things to come.
