Although it is unlikely to compare to other science fiction giants like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD GENDER, LIFEFORCE functions as a totally bizarre fusion of science fiction and horror elements. Somehow, despite the dialogue that comes close to the ridiculous and the acting that does the same, it manages to work because of some very different elements. <br /> <br /> Freely inspired by Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires", this film by director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission aboard the space British shuttle Churchill to study Halley's comet. Led by an American commander (Steve Railsback), they discover an alien spaceship in the comet's coma. And when they investigate inside the spaceship, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats. Later, the Churchill reaches Earth orbit, but no response is given by radio calls issued from the mission's base, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is launched to meet with Churchill, but finds the entire ship destroyed by fire - all but the alien beings encased in a glass that, far from being untouched by fire, seem absolutely perfect. The aliens are bought back on Earth ... and this is where the unbelievable happens. <br /> <br /> These space vampires flee from the Space Research Center and, instead of draining blood victims through bite wounds, suck their victims' life force totally out of them. One of these is Space Girl, a completely naked vampire played by Mathilda May. Railsback, Churchill's only survivor, is bought by the head of the SRC (Frank Finlay) and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to keep track of May, who is in telepathic contact with him. Soon, however, vampires turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; people are dehydrated or turned into zombies, and NATO's threat to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large. Railsback finally reaches May and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal saber. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly disjointed, undoubtedly uneven, but still to watch, LIFEFORCE, despite the frequent inconsistency of the script and its acting, takes advantage of some extraordinary and lifeless special effects by John Dykstra (STAR WARS), some of the best ever seen. The other element of work, and it is surprising, is the incredible orchestral soundtrack by Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian in the same way as John Williams for STAR WARS - and Mancini, like Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra, for boot! <br /> <br /> Largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if nothing else, should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre. There had never been a movie like before, and surely there will be nothing like that anymore.
