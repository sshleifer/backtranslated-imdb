I've seen this movie so many times, it's so beautiful. Perhaps because I can relate to Tittas' way of life is the reason why. Not everyone would find it to their taste. Furthermore, my Italien is improving after each viewing. Are they a sad case? Thank you Mr. Sorrentino. I look forward to your next film. Even though I haven't seen the movie in the cinema, I have the DVD and would encourage anyone to buy it. Extras with special features are only worth the price. The amount of time a director devotes to making a film is rarely appreciated, the extras on the DVD offer an excellent view of making a film. As for the story of the film, I am a prejudice. I happened to excite him to all my friends, but as I said before, I am referring a lot to the main character who is a loner in a situation of his choice. The mafia in Sicily uses Titta to launder their money in a Swiss bank. He owes them for having cost them millions of dollars ago in a stock deal that went wrong. Loves kills.
