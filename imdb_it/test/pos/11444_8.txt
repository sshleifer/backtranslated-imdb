I saw "Night of the Demons 2" before seeing "Night of the Demons". Unfortunately, my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the following, but not the first. Looney, eh? Now, I think all the horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you would prefer The Cheesecake Facotory (or any other more expensive restaurant you prefer), but you can't help but want only cheap things. <br /> <br /> Night of the Demons has it all: your innocent, sexy, follows the rules chicka-dee, your token black guy, who surprisingly is not killed. You're a slutty girl, you're a slut, you're a dark girl or a boy, a rubber ball, bad sets for a haunted house, bad acting and a lot of useless nudity. Isn't this stuff great? I mean, I know that in the depths of my heart of film it was pretty bad, but it was a bad blow to the horror movies. Horror fans should have fun and dig! <br /> <br /> 8/10
