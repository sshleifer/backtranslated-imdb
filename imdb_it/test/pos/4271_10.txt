I saw this film in a small projection. Although he has a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast have helped make this a little gem of a movie. It is April 8, 1994, each of the characters is in their "mid-20s" and pursues a sort of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when he learns of the suicide of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. They quickly take the inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. This is where the film shoots and serves a series of funny and emotional scenes. Highlights include: a visit to the tomb of Jimi Hendirx, Kurt Cobain's original childhood home and a bonfire singing together. An honest and original job.
