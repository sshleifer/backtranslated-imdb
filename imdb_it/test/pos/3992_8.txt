Quite right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message that this film could address to all of you. And the message is sad. He says it is very difficult to do everything that is surprising or perhaps even brilliant without having to obey the governments, the establishments and the other VIPs in this world. And even if you try, you may not be able to stand it. This is the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> A great film by this wonderful Korean director. Please see if you have an opportunity.
