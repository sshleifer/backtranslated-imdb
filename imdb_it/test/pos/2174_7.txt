First, let me confess that I haven't read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I direct my quibbles unjustly to the editor and editor. My experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not as an obscurantist. This is certainly a film worthy of note, but in the end it remains a baffled one. The colonel was a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own purposes (or for which beyond himself); or the Colonel was not a fraud, but used as told by the lawyer; or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest colonel? The director and / or publisher seem to me to have deliberately obscured these questions, which do not seem Balzac, the realist. At the same time, the film does a great job in outlining the characters, if not their motivations, and the cast and production are superb. That opening battlefield scene is destined to haunt one's dreams. Yet one wonders the too common inclination among contemporary directors to favor ambiguity above all else. Weren't the problems and motivations of all these characters complicated enough for Yves Angelo?
