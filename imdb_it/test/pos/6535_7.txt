Aaron Carter plays the pop star (J.D. McQueen) in this film (surprise surprise). This is a typical movie in which the protagonist (Jane) has a big crush on JD McQueen the pop star (as well as many other girls) but is the lucky one who spends her days with JD and forms a relationship with him is more like a fantasy . The J.D. he has to go to a public school to keep his math degree high to do his summer tour. The problem is that the J.D. he's not good at math. Find the smartest person in school (Jane) to teach him. Jane tutor and falls in love with J.D. J.D. in return he falls in love with pure, but J.D. gets ruined and has to fix everything to win the girl and take the summer tour. The film certainly deserves to be seen. Aaron will be a great actor !!!
