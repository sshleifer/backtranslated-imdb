Personally, I liked TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me about it, so I rented it and looked at it. Is fantastic! The music, the acting, the plot punctuate the emotion, everything ... well, except for a secondary fact. Absolutely no loyalty towards books. I saw this film before Interview with the Vampire and before I knew that the books existed, so I was shocked to find out how many people actually hated the movie. I immediately understood that the fans of the book were not at all happy with the infidelity, not wanting to be hypocritical (I hate Harry Potter films because of the lack of loyalty in the books) I remained silent. In the end I took "The Vampire Lestat" and I immediately understood why everyone hated it. It's completely different (The movie Queen of the Damned is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the Damned"). But I've always loved the movie since I saw it before reading any of the books. So if you haven't seen this movie or read the book, look at the movie first or you will hate it. If you read the book, then you have every right to hate this movie.
