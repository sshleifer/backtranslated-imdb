The fact that this film failed at the box office and is still struggling for the recognition it deserves today is a great pity - but somewhat somewhat appropriate. The commercial suicide that the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on the screen. To brutally destroy their carefully constructed image as a healthy American alternative to the Beatles is brave to the point of being reckless, as is the admission of being nothing more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (literally ) in their own artificiality. The television series of the Monkees was not so conventional, but HEAD is absolutely devoid of plot ... although in the end there is actually a kind of circular logic. Unregulated by an authentic plot, the surreal sequence of events is sometimes hilarious and rather disturbing. The greatest irony is that the Monkees actually signed their death sentence as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak. Their exploration in psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack of HEAD (all the songs are memorably intertwined in the film), which is one of the reference albums of the 1960s. The Monkees have begun to disintegrate after the box office failure of this film, but HEAD is a noble legacy.
