Tiny Toons: how I spent my holidays, it has always been my favorite animated film and I have loved it since I saw it when I was 7 or in all, now I am almost seventeen and I still love this wonderful artwork .. <br /> <br /> I really like the idea of ​​how we keep track of what each of them did on their vacation, and there were really some funny quotes that made me really laugh ... <br /> <br /> In this film you will never get bored and once you see it you will want 2 c again and again, because believe me it is really wonderful and is suitable for all ages ..
