I have no words to really describe this series. <br /> <br /> The premise behind this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality who ends up spinning a team of extravagants in her interpretation of the world, which after all was a Haruhi creation, since she wants a world with aliens, espers and time travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world driven by repetitive anime series and non-innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> The characters are well developed and you will end up loving them, some less than others. The word to describe the work of animation does not exist, since "excellent" would be really insufficient to describe how it was done. There are many fun situations that will make you smile or put you in deep thoughts. Don't give in to the impression of the first episode, since this is just the tip of the iceberg, since the novels are still to come. <br /> <br /> The only problem is due to the lack of chronological order in the episodes, but you can solve the problem, right? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Unquestionably, one of the best series of 2006.
