Under the sure guidance of F. Gary Gray, "Italian Job" never loses its grip on being cool and fun. Although the material is reworked and media, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfactorily good. The tone could easily have been much heavier, considering the plot of revenge of the murder, but F. Gary Gray maintains the light tone of good humor, snappy dialogues and pulsating music. It is a pleasure to see these "bad guys" form a great bond and cling to each other through deception and murder, never forgetting to have fun. This is 7/10.
