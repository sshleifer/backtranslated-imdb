The Hollow is a mysterious murder that offers everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and, of course, from Poirot. It is set in a country house during a weekend. As always, all guests are suspects and it's up to Poirot to find out the truth. With films like this it's always better not to give too far so I'll stop here. What I loved in "Hollow" was that it is a mystery the old way. For example, when Poirot arrives, everyone is around the body. Everyone seems to be the culprits. There is that suspicious look and the atmosphere is perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a wonderful time to make assumptions about who did it, how and why and maybe even be surprised in the end. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you've had a pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. As a curiosity, Edward Hardwicke played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see it after a few years. Suchet is as amazing as ever and fortunately is on screen most of the time. <br /> <br /> I discovered who the killer was but it is still not predictable and is also very credible. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, a great film and as always a pleasure. <br /> <br />
