I just finished watching Following and thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I'm going to watch it again with the director's comment and then again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this film because of my interest in Christopher Nolan Memento's most recent film. The following has some similarities; this film was probably Memento's project. Even the music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> Taking the film in black and white gives it a mysterious appearance. History and dialogue are really good. The actors' performance is credible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this film on a very low budget. I look forward to your next Insomnia release, a big budget movie with my favorite actor Al Pacino.
