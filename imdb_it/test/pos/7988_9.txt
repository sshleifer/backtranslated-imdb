When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it would be less exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, add Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is a decidedly darker movie than Batman. There are more villains here, fewer dark comedies in many aspects and more nerve problems. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenario is decidedly more depressing than the first, every detail up to the time of the year. This film follows the same comic format that we learned to love in the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Now for the performances. Michael Keaton returns fortunately as Batman / Bruce Wayne. It was exceptional in the first film and equally in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need more! Danny DeVito played an award-winning performance of The Penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever paired with a superhero movie. You hate him so much, but at the same time you feel it so bad for him. And he explains it to the last detail, making it even more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. It also has a good amount of history. Christopher Walken did not disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judicious, selfish CEO of the power company. Fortunately, Michael Gough also returns as the lovely Alfred, and he was equally good. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I believe he has never been in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> With many twists and secondary plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original. /> <br /> 9/10
