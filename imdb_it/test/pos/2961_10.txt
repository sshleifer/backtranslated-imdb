When I was in the United States, I was about 7 or 8 years old, I always woke up early, just to watch it, along with a lot of other cartoons like HootKloot, The Road Runner Show, The Pink Panther. But this was perhaps one of the most memorable and fun animated works out there, and I still find it very funny today, I'll never forget the episodes, like the one where two aardvarks were fighting for the can of chocolate pudding and ants? or the one in which the aardvark is trying to reach the island where all the ants are, and my favorite, the one in which the ant, aardvark and a dog end up in an animal hospital, which would later be the base of a similar Looney Toon cartoon with Sylvester, Tweety and the bulldog. This is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there where anyone would like to see again, I would do it. An excellent series.
