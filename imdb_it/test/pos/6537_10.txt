This film led me to cry. I must say that if I didn't have a beautiful husband at home, I would ask this beautiful work of art to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterly performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes quick and witty dialogues that only promote the genius of Carter's performance. Kyle is quite gay, but his performance was nothing less than spectacular. It is also very beautiful and pretty. I'm thinking of asking him for a date and giving him a sweet goodnight gift.;) <br /> <br /> If you'd like to discuss this movie in the future, contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Class Vassar of 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
