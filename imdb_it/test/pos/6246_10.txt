"Tourist Trap" is a really spooky low-budget horror movie that will surely please horror fans. It contains an extremely strange atmosphere and there are some rather disturbing moments of terror and total fear. Some scenes are definitely bizarre for example there is a scene in which Chuck Connors sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts conversing with him before his head falls. There is very little blood, but the violence is strong enough for PG horror movies. The mannequins seem very sinister and the climax is horrifying. David Schmoeller has returned to making many other genre films including "Crawlspace", "Puppet Master" and "Netherworld". Still "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror movie, so if you want to be scared off by this little gem a look. <br /> <br /> Nominal PG for short nudity, violence and obscenity.
