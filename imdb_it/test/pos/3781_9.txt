Chaplin enters the trenches of the First World War in this lively comedy that never detracts from the horrors of war. Rain, mud, explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely unaware of all of them. He's in France for one thing: fighting the Germans, something he does with incredible success. <br /> <br /> It almost seems like an extended trip for the ego for Chaplin - very funny, for that - until the last minute when it rises to a new level of intensity and everything makes sense. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what all soldiers dream of before going to war.
