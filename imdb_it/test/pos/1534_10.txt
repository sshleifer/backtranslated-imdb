Even the trailer for this film makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset by intense material! The best performances by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, no doubt. This terrible tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture its citizens for ANY reason, whether they are anarchists or children's book writers, will reduce you to the bone. I saw it when it first came out in 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares me today. It is happening now. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMDb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review. IMDb may want to get a GRIP! Some of us are a little more concise about writing opinions.
