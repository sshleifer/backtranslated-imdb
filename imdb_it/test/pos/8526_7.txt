When I first saw it on tape, about 10 years after it was released, I thought it was one of the best James Bond movies. However, after seeing him again around the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit overrated just because the critics were so happy to see Sean Connery finish his 12-year break from playing Bond who didn't dare to criticize the film. I guess I was disappointed with the ending. After investing two hours in the film, you expect a less exciting and more satisfying ending. And it could be the finicky, but I was disappointed not to see regular actors in secondary roles like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there was a lot of unique action scenes, particularly at the beginning, and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the most intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked like the "nice guy next door". He wasn't your normal Bond villain. <br /> <br /> This film had a lot of "skins" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger starring, without ever being an actress known for hiding his figure. The language was very docile, but most of the James Bond films are pretty good in that department. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a "just" Bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in, doesn't mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have shown that they can also play the role well.
