Like almost everyone, I am familiar with the music of Ray Charles. Who has not listened to "Georgia ON My Mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some of the other wonderful songs featured in this film. But about Ray Charles's life, I was sadly ignorant until I looked at him. I must say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life. His performance was powerful, up to the ways and inflections of the voice. The film also offered a blunt account of some of the trials and tribulations that Charles faced throughout his life, and with some demons from the past who persecuted him into adulthood. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the film was the scene of heroin extraction, which was painfully realistic. The film portrays Charles's growing awareness and involvement in the civil rights movement, culminating in his refusal to play in front of a segregated audience in Georgia, which led to the ban on performing in the state. His drug addiction and marital affairs are also well documented. The film revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child: not allowing anyone or anything to turn you into a cripple. "The point is that the drugs did just that, and to honor his mother's memory, he had to beat them. There's not much here about his last life and career after breaking his heroin habit, but until then , this is really powerful stuff.
