This film is a little slow at the beginning, for about the first 10 minutes or so. But once you enter, you can't turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are great at acting. You would never be able to guess who the killer is. I gave this movie at 9, because in some parts Adam Beach needs to talk a bit so you can hear what he's saying. <br /> <br /> 9/10
