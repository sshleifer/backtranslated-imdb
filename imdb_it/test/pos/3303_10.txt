The best of everything. What is the best of all? It's different for everyone, but for most of us it's love. But unfortunately not everyone knows where or who to look for true love. This story passes the entire search for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes, "we are the captains of our ships", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. Once these choices are made, we must live with them. As we look at this story and see these women making choices that will most likely change their lives forever, we wonder, will we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? Who knows?
