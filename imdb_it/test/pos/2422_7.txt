I was 19 when I first saw this film in the theater. I have a vivid memory of a different ending. Not completely different but significant. I just saw the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess the following can't be called a spoiler, since it never happened. The ending I remember was that the boy was hiding in the completely naked house, Frances Austen found him easily enough and after confronting him, slowly sank to his knees and fell on him from the camera. Only his face was in the frame and it was quite obvious that he was letting it happen, even if against his will. But nothing like that appeared in the film. Sandy Dennis was 32 when he made this film, Michael Burns was 22 years old. In the film, he complains to his sister that Frances does too big a deal for sex. Yes? Well, then, then you sleep with her boyfriend and end it. WTF?
