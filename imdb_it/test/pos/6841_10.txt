Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are a DELIGHT in this sexy caper. This film is smart, on-board entertainment for adults, and what a relief it is these days of predictable cartoons. Great music and work with the camera add to the fun this puzzle set in New Orleans. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
