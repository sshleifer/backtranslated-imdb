The book is better than the film mainly because of the prose of the writer Ondatje. Before seeing this film, someone who had seen it told me that the love depicted in this film is not real. After seeing this film, I can see how his suspension of disbelief in this regard could have distracted other viewers as well. Frankly, some of the intense demonstrations of love were ridiculous and seem to be on the edge of parody. But in the end, everyone should realize that this is a great art message. It is not about love at all, but uses "love" to dialectically reveal human division or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred. It concerns misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that presumably separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this film is when the hero or the anti-hero asks for help for his beached lover in the desert is ignored and ignored for the reasons shown in that scene. This film also speaks of hope and forgiveness, the hope embodied in the interracial relationship between the resuming character of Binoche and the Indian minesweeper (echoed in the companion-companion relationship of the Sikh with his white colleague who ends up dying senseless) and forgiveness incarnated in Caravaggio the first character hunt and then forced out of what he thinks will be the confessions of the hero for his "crimes" of war (betrayal of the country). I think the film could have been made even better than it is. I don't know if a more realistic representation of the circumstances of love would have made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film is not about realistic romantic love, like the people behind it. artwork or film implies in an initial scene when the final lovers meet for the first time. The hero talks about how a new car, a broken car, a fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrasing) it's still just a car, no matter what adjective you put yourself in front of. She replies, but the love of parents, platonic love, romantic love, etc. They are very different types of love. This is ironic because this film is about the love that all humans should want, which is the love of peace (or peace) (not the materialistic things that are usually the real reasons for wars, embodied in something that many of us want "cars", "we say." Otherwise, we might get stuck dying in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall paintings / swimmer drawings, which suggests that the seas and waters that support life "They were once there, they almost disappeared. I believe" The English Patient "won the Oscar for these great messages, not specifically for its representation of romantic love. The prizes tend to go that way. The hero relationship and heroin was necessary to attract the attention of the public, unfortunately this vision of love can be antiquated in the age of divorce and so many individuals who are unable to stay together on so many levels, so ridiculous verses ions of myth love is difficult to obtain, even in daydreams, that the love of cinema has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The film may not be up to what people expect, but a movie of 7 out of 10 is worth seeing, regardless.
