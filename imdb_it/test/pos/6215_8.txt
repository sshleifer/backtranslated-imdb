In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic children's shows I grew up on. Seymour was a large, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of huge teeth that almost divided his head, I remember wearing a variety of shades of Elton John. <br /> <br /> He "played" the piano, and had a man who looked at Jesus in a white tuxedo, sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then they would do a song about it. <br /> <br /> I don't remember much else except the opening theme, Seymour and the Hippie. <br /> <br /> No one else knows it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel of the Magic Garden (another show of psychedelic children if there ever was one.) People always talk about the effects of the music and the films of the 70s of LSD, but it seems that even children's scriptwriters have taken a dose.
