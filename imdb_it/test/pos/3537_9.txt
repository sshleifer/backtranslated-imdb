Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more creepy; another bloodshed and very graphic details (a little too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was particularly impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weaknesses in the cast of you). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen in years. Although it was scheduled for the BBC in three parts, I saw the Messiah on video in one shot. A point of criticism; the bad guy's motivation was not very convincing.
