Great simply great! The West Coast got "Dirty" Harry Callahan, the east coast took Sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "Sharky's Machine" and I loved every minute. Playing as a nonconformist cop in Atlanta, GA is just what everyone wants. Instead of being suspended, he is sent to the deputy team. Like in Dirty Harry's movies or in any other detective movie, the captain will always be the jerk. When I was a child, I was curious about what "Sharky's Machine" meant. Well, I knew who played Sharky, I wonder what his car was. It was his group of fellow cops. After discovering the murder, he does everything to find the culprit. When it turns out to be a big crowd boss, Sharky doesn't play. When he succeeds in rescuing the other prostitute, Sharky fights hard and well despite having lost a finger against the thug. And I also like the part where the villain is ejected from the building through a glass plate. That was the BOMB! "Street Life" by Randy Crawford has really put the film in the right mood, and the film itself is really a great success for me, ALWAYS! Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
