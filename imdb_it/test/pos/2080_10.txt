I saw several Hamlets and taught comedy. As I watch Jacobi, I am tempted to think he is as smart as Hamlet, so alive is in every nuance of this character's ingenuity. Deepens, rather than resolves, every enigma concerning the character of Hamlet. Light up line by line, word by word, illuminating the light in this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we shudder at the horror that Hamlet feels for his betrayal - much more than any other actor - because Jacobi feels the pain more deeply than anyone else. And we shudder at Hamlet's betrayals, because Jacobi is not afraid of the baseness with which Hamlet can descend. In short, Jacobi gives us Hamlet in full, and Hamlet in full is the greatest figure in literature. That's why I'm satisfied that Jacobi's Hamlet is the best performance an actor has seen.
