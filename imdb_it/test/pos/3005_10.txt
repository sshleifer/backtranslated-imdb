This show was not only a great human drama, but portrayed racism in this country in a crude way, too loyal to life. When a show can be so witty and fun yet so moving and educational all at once, this is television in its highest form. The acting was phenomenal. The writing was exceptional. Not only did the show portray race relationships in a direct way that seems unparalleled by any other television series, but its ability to represent this topic as it existed in the 1960s, alongside how it existed at the beginning of the 21st century, strongly demonstrates the ways in which we have changed and, unfortunately, the many other ways that we do not have.
