I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go to school and refused to go with my parents. Just looking at the trailer seemed stupid to me, anyway. One of my friends wanted to take me to the cinema that day and offered me two choices, "The Dukes Of Hazzard" or "Wallace And Gromit: The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit". It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time was running out. I had to choose "Few" appeared on the screen as in a few remaining tickets. The moment we had to get in line and take our ticket, only one of us could enter. I desperately wanted Nicholas to go see it. But he forced me. I folded my arms and was very moody and disappointed that I was going to see this childishness. I walked in, sitting in the only place that was available and prepared for the movie! I must say that I was very surprised that I sat in that MASTERPIECE! It was amazing. I don't know what I was complaining about. The Clay Animation was by far the best I've ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit that interrupts and crashes a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years. Basically the Anti Pest Control protects the people who compete in the vegetable competition. Anti Pesto known as Wallace And Gromit (who is responsible for this activity) tries to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. I won't say anymore It's too good to say. I must admit that the whole idea of ​​a Were-Rabbit is incredible and extremely childish, but Nick Park adds substance to what makes everyone love. I mean, there won't be a 10 foot bunny in the wild and surely there won't be 8 foot werewolves as mentioned in "Dog Soldiers". So again, rabbits and werewolves are not real creatures. But in both cases, it worked very well. <br /> <br /> Even the jokes were bigger. The children will not take a few jokes. It goes far above their heads. There were a lot of English jokes in there. If you love British humor, this is the movie for you. I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the film is incredibly well done. The direction and pace were absolutely ... GREAT! I recommend it to fans of the old Wallace And Gromit shorts (and no, I haven't seen them yet), and I recommend it to fans who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2 and, most importantly, I recommend it to people who like Clay Animation, a good crack film! 10/10
