I agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. Here are some fragments of dialogue: <br /> <br /> Raisuli (Sean Connery) at Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "See the man at the well, how he draws water? When a bucket is empty, the others fill It is so with the world: at the moment you are full of power, but you are overturning it, to no avail, and Islam is devouring the drops that fall from your bucket. "<br /> <br /> Raisuli: The British have paid a lot well in the past. Pedecar: Well, you won't have your way with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have his head for this. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This President Roosevelt - would he have tried to take it alone? Pedecar: He would certainly do it! He is a man of determination and a strong moral fiber. It doesn't kidnap women and children! Raisuli: what kind of gun do you use? Pedecaris: A Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester. Winchester. I have no knowledge of this gun. Pedecar: you will do it. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. A little blind and reckless at times, but brave beyond doubt. Oh, and another trait goes with all the precedents. Reporter: And that, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: solitude. The bear lives his life alone. Indomitable. Unconquered. But always alone. He has no real allies, only enemies - but none of them is as big as he is. Reporter: do you think this could be an American trait? Teddy Roosevelt: Certainly. The world would never love us. He could respect us. It could also grow to fear us. But he will never love us. Because we have too much audacity. And we are also a little blind and reckless at times.
