Critics and the public have practically deepened this film, but in reality I didn't think it was too bad! Even the critics who usually agree think it's crap, and usually scorn the PG "horror movies". So this means one of two things: either (1) I'm too easily satisfied, and my taste in movies has decreased over the years, or (2) 'When a Stranger Calls' is not as horrible as it is made out to be. Now, to be honest, some of the criticisms of the film are true - there isn't much character development, and not much happens in history. But man alive, how much did you expect from a movie about a babysitter being persecuted? Cut it a little fun! As a former babysitter who watched this movie late at night with the lights off, I can safely say that the stalker guy was a creepy mofo! Who knows? I guess things like that make me shiver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit I enjoyed watching it, and I don't care how big a minority that puts me in ;;)
