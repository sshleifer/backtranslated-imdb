The first time I saw this film was when I was four. I remember loving him and all that concerned him. 13 years later, I am 17 and decided to watch it about a month ago, because I am attending a class in the 60s at school. I really didn't know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw him, but I was completely amazed. The actors were fantastic, the music was so funny, and now I find myself singing along with each song. Treat Williams is as great as Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except at the end, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the drafteo of Oklahoma who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is as adorable as the rich and fair girl who eventually rebels against her education and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is as adorable as Jeannie, the pregnant girl but still pretty and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are as good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's girlfriend, has an extraordinary voice. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this film, however, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are almost never shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny dive scene?). It seems that their relationship is very weak, and by the end of the film we should believe we are madly in love, based only on the few meetings they have had. I also see that many people who write reviews here are troubled by the PG evaluation of this film. Personally I would increase the rating to a PG-13, just because there is some drug use ... but I remember that in 1979, PG-13 didn't exist. I don't think nudity is bad at all, it's not sexual at all (actually, there's really no sex in this movie), and it's just to show the childish innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity is not considered as something bad, and I don't see why it's here in the United States. Anyway, I give this film a high score, and I'm glad it was done then, because in today's madly "politically correct" world, they wouldn't even have thought of creating it, and even if they did, it would be a very "watered down", and I'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is an undervalued film that is certainly worth checking out.
