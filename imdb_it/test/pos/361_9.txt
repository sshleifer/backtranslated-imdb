The scene of the first murder is one of the best murders in the history of cinema (almost as good as the Psycho shower scene) and Robert Walker's acting is fantastic. A psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders. This is the story and this film is very good, but there is a problem: because it is not the boy Haines who goes to <br /> <br /> in the first place.4 / 5
