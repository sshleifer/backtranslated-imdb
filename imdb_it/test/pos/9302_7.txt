This is a strange and compelling film. The argument, concerning the atomic bombs created in Los Alamos, in the United States and used in Japan during the latter part of World War II, is enormous and, of course, deeply disturbing. The plot of the film addresses a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to endure much of the creative tension. I had never seen the film, or was very interested in it, I must admit, until I read the book "Smoking in bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson". Robinson wrote the story and the script. I think the film was better than I expected by reading Robinson's point of view in conversations, but I can see how he thought he was derailed. I think Paul Newman is good enough, but somehow he is basically uncomfortable. It's too Hollywood. At one point, a big, bad-looking guy breaks into Newman's office and has such an amazing presence, I immediately thought he should play the character played by Newman. The other protagonist, who plays the chief scientist, is also quite good, but somehow not brilliant enough to represent the enormous anguish that accompanies the part: the immense responsibility for the creation of a definitive machine of death and destruction. One of the most effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. It interacts in a strange way and, in the end, it is the character whose destiny really hits home and that made me think very vividly about the fate of over 200,000 Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
