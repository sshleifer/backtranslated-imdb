This show came to Canada via PBS in the mid-90s and, really, I really enjoyed it then. Even after 10 years watching the various news networks, I can't help thinking about the cynical manipulation going on in the name of the charts and the various "show ponies" that we all see on TV as depicted in various Frontline episodes. The scripts are rigorously written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of them is cluttered with idiotic laughter. There's a lot of fun stuff here that is really well executed and we don't need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh. I don't understand why this show never took off in North America like a real gem! I was really excited to see the DVDs available, even though they are in PAL format. I thought about tearing them from my computer and then looking at the converted files. I took the opportunity and ordered it from the ABC ?? 6 to 8 weeks later, I had all 3 seasons. Even better it worked with my NTSC DVD player. I suspect that any player purchased in the last 2 years has had xvid / divx play. Big things! 10 years later the episodes all hold up really well! You don't need to know anything about Australian politics to get humor as everything will be familiar to the Western public. My wife and I celebrated 10 days on the front lines and we are still giggling weeks after seeing all 39 episodes
