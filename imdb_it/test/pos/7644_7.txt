I saw this movie on HBO and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The director did a great job. I found myself totally absorbed in this film once it started. Norman Reedus's performances are fantastic. I expect a more chilling film on his part. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that on certain occasions I wanted to take the gun from Norman and shoot that snake girl. Hehe. I like movies when innocent-looking girls play tricks on men. The ending was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This movie is full of twists. You expect this, but something else happens. <br /> <br /> At first, the massive images cut the scenes were really painful to the eyes. <br /> <br /> Even if it was not shown when Norman Reedus changed the notes? Or am I standing next to the fridge. :)
