Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think that Paul Schrader is the greatest writer of all time, but I don't really like the films he directed on what I saw (except for this and Affliction), but this is a fantastic, disturbing and highly Studio of the three-dimensional character. Following is the life of Yukio Mishima, the most famous writer in Japan, who combines the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of them in a very artistic way. The acting is exceptional, as is photography and a perfect soundtrack by Philip Glass. Although confusing the first view, this is one of the few films that gets richer with each vision. A true underrated gem of a movie.
