One of the last MGM classics came out in the last years of World War II, it's the movie that made young Elizabeth Taylor a star. He had made some films as a child actress before National Velvet, but when he was released, he was insured. Ironically enough biologically it would have grown quite quickly after National Velvet was out and his next fight as an actress would have been to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as an innocent little Velvet Brown who loved her horse from jumping. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how it would work because hedge horses must have blood confirmations and Pis are an untreated topic in National Velvet. All we know is that he is a reckless and unpredictable horse in the hands of Reginald Owen and after getting free and causing considerable damage, Owen gets rid of him for a nominal price for the local butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> At the same time that these things are happening, Mickey Rooney arrives wandering in the life of the Brown family composed by Crisp, his wife Anne Revere and their daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor and their little brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who is now on the open road and heads for the Brown family where his father was a former horse trainer for the family of Anne Revere. It is he who sees the potential of the Pi (short for pirate) as a hedge hunter and it is Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to let it pass. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in National Velvet. The good book says that you must have faith as a child and you have to save it. Contains Rooney, to trust the heart and abilities of the Pi and leave yourself a little alone. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won the award for Best Supporting Actress for National Velvet. She is a very wise mother who has hidden the depths that the public doesn't suspect. It turns out that in his youth he had a taste of fame and glory as he swam for the English Channel and his cash prize, saved all these years, gives it to his daughter. That scene is probably what made her win the Oscar. National Velvet has also won another Academy Award for film editing. <br /> <br /> Over 60 years after its debut, National Velvet, like a family classic, has lost nothing. His representation of life between the world wars in Britain is still a standout. And National Velvet has launched a legend of the film. I can't do much better than this.
