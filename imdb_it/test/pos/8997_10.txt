This film made me a rugby fan and coach Larry Gelwix. The characters in the story slipped and fell before they started growing as they fought in incredibly strong conflicts. Those were understandable and completely credible. Like life, there were no easy answers to the problems everyone faces. Superb actors and an excellent script gave life to this true story. I wish there were more movies like this. These days, I look almost exclusively, it is worth real stories because they are generally much more interesting than fiction. Furthermore, this is inspirational and teaches us not to give up anyone too fast.
