This film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to do: FAMILY entertainment, which means something that is enjoyable for people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit can be appreciated by everyone, from small children who love colors and cute bunnies to grandparents who understand the references of adults. <br /> <br /> This film has good direction like any other I've ever seen, and I mean literally. It's also full of tiny moods, and every scene has so many humorous details in the background that I'll have to buy it, if only to read all the signs and flyers in the world of W & G. <br /> <br /> I'm going to see this movie at least twice more in theaters, so buy it on DVD. You should also see it.
