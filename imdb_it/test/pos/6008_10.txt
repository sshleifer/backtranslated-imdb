Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although his background was mostly comedy, he shows here that he can do the drama just as well or maybe even better (although there is a lot of humor in this). Hard to turn a blind eye to his American accent, especially since his character should be English, but that's just a small thing. <br /> <br /> All the bad guys are equally well expressed: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O 'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that many of them are small or giant, they are 100% credible in everything they do and their motivations are very clear for example the incessant suspicion of Gulliver's Lilliputians, Grildrig the hatred of his (dwarf) giant to usurp his position as court jester, the attempt of dr. Bates to drive Gulliver crazy so he can marry Mary. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is as big as Mary Gulliver (another 17th century English character with an American accent but it doesn't matter). He is a deeply troubled character because he waited nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does, he talks about small people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element in the story, is a very credible character. <br /> <br /> The special effects are breathtaking, especially considering that it was shot on a television scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking in a city full of 6 inch tall people. <br /> <br /> Also cameos are great: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement Danson's superb acting skills. <br /> <br /> The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element of history on the satirical side of things: a society of talking horses that do not possess any of the vices that humans have while the Yahoos are primitive humans and disgusting that mate strongly and name their leader according to how disgusting he is. The study by Gulliver and Mistress is also very well done and shows the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gulliver's Travels" by far and one of the best mini series ever.
