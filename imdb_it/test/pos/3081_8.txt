Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I saw him recently because I just became a fan of Cary Elwes, and that's one of his main roles. Some moments really drove me crazy! I didn't expect you to know it, it was so funny, Even the second time you fell off the chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley, Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't be fooled by the name , it's very big! Lol) and all the others! <br /> <br /> There were a few moments, of course, the film tried to create a comic scene, but you don't necessarily have to laugh, .... but OK. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart have appeared together in a film, both have worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww. Definitely worth watching, really fun!
