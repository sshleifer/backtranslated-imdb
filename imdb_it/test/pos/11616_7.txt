Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is a strange movie! Presumably a vision of the human mind, Subconscious Cruelty includes four macabre and bizarre extreme stories. The first segment, entitled Ovarian Eyeball, is actually just a warm up, but it's good as it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect from the next three segments. He simply sees a naked woman lying on a table, while another woman cuts her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball! I have no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes the visceral vision. The following story is the best of the group and takes up the theme of incest's "old favorite movie". The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He is disgusted by her pregnancy - yet he still wants to have sex with her, and of course he gets his way. This story stands out for the monotonous narrative and "matter of fact", as well as for the ending - which does not fail to provide shocks. This segment is well acted, well taken up and easily the culminating point of Subconscious Cruelty. <br /> <br /> Of course, the next two sections are not as good as the second; so the only way from there is down, but director Karim Hussain still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends. It does not do so immediately, however, since the third segment is the weakest in the film and simply sees that many people have sex with the ground. It is very surreal and therefore memorable for the same reason; but there doesn't seem to be much sense and I was in the mood for something a little more morbid after the second section. The film ends at the top, however, while I'm not entirely sure what the point is: the final segment features the best images in the film. This segment focuses on religion, and certainly it is not for anyone who values ​​it! The director Karim Hussain has achieved something here - since while this collection of four "extreme" stories do not merge into a complete whole, the film seems almost tasteful as it is shot so eloquently and captivating. It seems that the director has imitated the respected surreal director Luis Buñuel, albeit with blood, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he didn't do a bad job. Not for everyone, but definitely worth a look at extreme fanatics!
