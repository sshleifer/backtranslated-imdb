The film opens in an English club full of men full of men in leather chairs smoking cigars. This is the world of Denistoun. A messenger hands him a small box that opens to find a pair of gold earrings. The site of the earrings triggers a reminiscence of the time spent in the company of the gypsies. The rest of the film is a flashback. <br /> <br /> Golden Earrings has long been my favorite and is probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against his usual type. Here it is dark, earthy and not in the least mysterious. Instead of a femme fatale, she is a tower of strength and vigorously intends to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and reach his goal. To make sure he is a really convincing gypsy, he pierces his ears and puts on his dead lover's gold earrings. With her clothes and a little fat, she turns him from an English gentlemanly effect to a wild and sexy man. <br /> <br /> When I was little I heard the song "Golden earrings" that is sung in the film. I think the melody is buzzed a little by Dietrich. / There is a story that gypsies know to be true / that when your love wears gold earrings / she belongs to you.
