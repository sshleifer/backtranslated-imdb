Love and war happened on the other side of the iron curtain and looking at each other badly, love was as strong as in the West and war was often more intense (should I say more realistic?). <br /> <br /> This film talks as much about war and love as about the Soviet thaw of Mr K.'s era. It also reminds us that the best war films were not necessarily made in the 1990s with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of dollars spent on special effects and marketed actors. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic of Soviet cinema and an exceptional picture of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
