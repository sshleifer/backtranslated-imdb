I really liked the movie "JOE". It has really become a cult classic in some age groups. <br /> <br /> The producer of this film is a personal friend of mine. It's my stepons father-in-law. He lives in the western part of Manhattan and has a bungalow. in Southampton, Long Island. His son-in-law lives next to his Bungalow. <br /> <br /> Currently, it produces nothing, but delights in a deal with HBO movies. <br /> <br /> As a person, Mr. Gil is a true gentleman and I hope he would continue in the move production business.
