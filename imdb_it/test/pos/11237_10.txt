I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Basically 2 guys are competing in a club to collect girls in 3 different scenarios. They mix the scenarios for each show so it's not the same every time. The group of 4 judges is not afraid to call people or admit it when it recognizes the game. They will break down what the guy did wrong and what they did right. Some competitors are weak, some are strong but what happens is always fun. If you are a boy coming out, you can relate. I saw a weak game, I saw a strong game, and this show is real. No doubt.
