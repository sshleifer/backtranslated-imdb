My Father The Hero was my favorite movie when I was Younger. It's Andr√©, a divorced Frenchman who wants to take his lovely daughter (katharine heigl) on vacation, hoping to get close to her, but of course Nicole is not so easy to get along, she has just started puberty, I guess, she is angry and hurt by the fact that her father has never been there for her and decides to give him a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets nice Ben, and picks up a wild story about her and her father, the whole island gets involved and the film turns into a hilarious wild entertainment movie.
