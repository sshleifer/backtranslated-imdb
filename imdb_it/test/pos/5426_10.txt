This film is all about humans. This film has been my favorite short of all time for years. <br /> <br /> Aren't the easiest things to make life so much more interesting ?! We humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, we take care of each other a moment - we invent the most beautiful and incredible machines to kill as many people as possible with minimum effort the next. In our short lives, we destroy our world, each other and often, our lives, which we spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we have destroyed. Sometimes, there's nothing left to fix! <br /> <br /> This film can entertain, educate and even help us understand what's wrong with our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The ending is too optimistic. I'm scared. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Condie's mind and what makes it happen with it! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
