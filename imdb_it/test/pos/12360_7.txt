Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this rigid and existentialist film on expiation, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the most desolate moments of the human condition. He is the protagonist of David Holm, who does not behave well, who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to have to negotiate for his soul with the driver of the ghost carriage: death. <br /> <br /> Unlike many silent films during the period, the film is almost absent with over-acting scenes. The rhythm becomes boring with his overly familiar Dickensian narrative. However, looking at the film in retrospect and compared to others of his time, it is a very bold and unique film. The public of the time was not exposed to such arguments, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic and accompanied by double-exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. It's a really terrifying and scary movie for young people. <br /> <br /> Watching the film, it is easy to see the subsequent influences of this film on the Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes are on display here. Sjostrom, of course, later starred in Bergman's masterpiece on alienation and solitude: wild Strawberries. This would have been the final performance of Sjostrom as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
