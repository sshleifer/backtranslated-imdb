This is a very visual film. By this I mean that the dialogue is scarce, almost to the point of being a silent film for some very long shots, starting with the initial shot. <br /> <br /> Silences, however, are interrupted by an extraordinary sound that ranges from discordant jokes, detached from a disturbing mix of violins and interspersed with voices that sound like dreams. It is a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the first images is a man walking along a road, so concerned about his interest in a curvy woman, who walks on a lamppost: one of the consequences of love and a metaphor of what is in the shop ... <br /> <br /> A long time ago, another movie ?? Love Story (1970) - said that love should never say that you are sorry. This story transpires this idea in many ways, starting with the main character, Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a luxurious hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, week after week, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoying the world that passes, his cigarettes, his coffee, his loneliness ?? and he's been doing it for ten years. He sits down, observes, and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you will discover when you see this little masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> Love is explored in another way, in a direct counterpoint to solitude and the reserved nature of Titta: two elderly residents of the hotel are still in love, but the man wants to die in a spectacular way when his moment arrives, while his long suffering wife scolds him for having cheated at cards with the other guests, one of whom is Titta. Now, Titta knows their quarrels, their love, the betrayal of the man, his apologies to his wife and his whining. Such as? In a surprising and black-comic way ... one of those surprise activities I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But this is not a comedy, in reality, even if it touches on the idea of ​​human comedy in a Balzachian sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. That decision had been made for Titta ten years earlier, when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel. He occasionally keeps in touch, and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up) and the pain in his voice speaks in great quantity. But there's more to it than just pain ... <br /> <br /> A life like Titta's would seem obviously boring, and in reality it is from many perspectives. It is only when we learn what is hiding under its almost mortal aspect, however, that the horror of its situation strikes the viewer between the eyes. But not before knowing that the female bartender, Sofia (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Titta and does everything to tease Titta's interest in her. <br /> <br /> And that's when things start to unravel Titta: eventually she succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers, once again, the consequences of love. Ironically, in doing so, he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life, and in a spectacular way. <br /> <br /> I know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic; but to put it another way, it would ruin the film and the plot for you. If you like Italian cinema ?? I love it! ?? I urge you to see this. The acting is superb; the soundtrack makes the spine freeze; the camera work is really innovative; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I'll see this movie again, and again ...
