This film was adapted from the famous sutra of Journey to the West where a monk with his three students tries to find a long lost book regarding the teaching of the Buddha. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend, it nevertheless managed to create a humorous scene full of romance and fun. <br /> <br /> This true objective of this film revolves around the monk who was first saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. One of his students, the God of the Apes, managed to get him out of the battle just in time, but in turn he was captured by demons and thrown into a dragon's deep gorge, locked up in that particular prison. > <br /> The monk woke up in a small village where he found Mei Yan (the so-called ugly snake daughter) who fell in love with him at first sight. Although ugly, he did not let his appearance be set aside to reach him. However, a search for the rescue of his three students soon turns out to be full of obstacles and each one turned out to be worse than Mei Yan after the monk. Problems increasingly insinuate themselves and this is the point where conflicts between relationships get worse. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story would be left to you, but suffice it to say that this film does not describe the typical plot of the book, it is more for those who want to look for a funny and light image of what they really mean Journey to the West and the obstacles of love. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the whole summary could be described with one word, and this is love. The monk went to show the Heavenly Doors, the Heavenly Palace and the Buddha himself as love can overcome even the worst fear of all and considered suitable as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of higher powers. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully created and entertaining act awaits those who buy this ticket. Of course there would have been no regrets, at least on my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same movie.
