This film is almost unknown, but it is very good. In a solitary Danish city, two old sisters live recalling a very distant youth, when, due to a rigorous puritan education, they had to refuse happiness. Solitary, therefore, living in a dignified austerity, until Babette arrives, flying from Paris, frightened by the horror of war. In a short time, she will be able to transform the goodness and love she received when she arrived. A good lottery prize allows you to organize a large banquet, following the best rules of French gastronomy. All neighborhoods are invited (all fanatically Puritans). They accept, but you must not show any trace of pleasure or fun, as it would be a sin. However, the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat, which become seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends in a very heartfelt happiness, even if quiet. Love among humans has awakened. The miracle of raising human kindness due to the pleasure of sense has begun. The film is surprisingly good, but it's not for everyone. During most of the film, nothing happens, everything is so peaceful and so peaceful that, in many minutes, you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the city. But, as the film develops, it becomes more precious, when Babette wins the lottery prize (after 30 minutes of film), the show begins. The author is able, with a perfect direction, to show us how Babette prepares the banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), all told in a quiet and delicious way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. Then, as the banquet passes, the quality in showing us how the mood of all the eaters changes because of the meal, only with the first shots, with impressed scenes one after another is simply surprising. Moreover, the touch with colors and photography is excellent, almost every scene in the film is like a photo, so the work is involved there. If you are able to admire a good cinema and are able to understand that sometimes the way to tell you something rather than what is said is more important, this is your movie. If you like good meals and love good food, you will probably feel amused, as most of the film's feelings will be familiar to you. An absolutely deserved Oscar. The only problem is the slowness in creating the story, but I can forgive it (I hope everyone too)
