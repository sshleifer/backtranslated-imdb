Although this production has received a number of poor reviews, it actually holds up quite well for its age. Also note that it is not a BBC program, it was simply licensed to them by Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen collection was distributed on DVD. <br /> <br /> So how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel? The most well-known version of these times is the 1995 film with Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. That film was obviously shorter but a good snapshot of the story - the previous version, with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles, had four hours to tell the story and moved at a slower pace. <br /> <br /> Firbank is a good ten for his role, but he is very good - Marshall is as good as Wentworth, a disappointed and bitter man for interference. And contributing people are hidden in the cast - Michael Culver, later seen in Cadfael, as Harvill; Richard Vernon, later seen in Hitchhikers' Galactic Guide, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, first in Coronation Street, as Mrs Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that the hairstyles are a bit annoying, and that the costumes are horrible! However, this should not detract from an extremely pleasant Austen adaptation.
