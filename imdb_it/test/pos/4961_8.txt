Be a D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been looking for this movie for quite some time. I recently rented the video and found it very funny. He had some really funny scenes. The dysfunctional life of some characters was disturbing, but I think the film also showed that it is possible to keep life on track or put it back on track if it was derailed.
