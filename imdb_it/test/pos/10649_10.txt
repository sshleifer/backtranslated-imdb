Eisenstien's "Potempkin" (Bronenosets Potyomkin) is one of the best films ever made and perhaps the best of the silent era. Eisenstien was a pioneer of the film form and his use of photomontage has influenced the films to date. The footage from the Odessa Steps massacre is as powerful today as it was when it was first seen more than 70 years ago. DO NOT miss the chance to see this movie!
