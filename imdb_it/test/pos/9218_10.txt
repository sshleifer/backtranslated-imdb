This was the first film I've ever seen in theater alone. I was 7 years old and to this day is one of my favorite films. It is pure smoked cheese. The cartoon was marketed to young girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each color of the rainbow, with their special animals, "sprite" and even a talking rainbow horse. Typical of the time period, every show concerned the way in which hope, solidarity and magic can make "all the best". <br /> <br /> The film is about the arrival of spring, when all the light and color returns to the world, but this time it is not happening just for our adorable hero. A spoiled princess plots to overcome the soul lightgiver (and implicated life giver) of the universe, which seems to be a giant diamond, for its devious purposes, with no regard for reality, and now Rainbow and her new friends Orin, Onyx and Chris must save the universe. Like I said before, it's poor, but it's cute, and it's exactly like all the other cartoons of that time, like the movies CareBear, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal and the Smurfs. All films created to sell dolls to children. And it works. :)
