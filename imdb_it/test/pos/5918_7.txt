Biographical account of the life of Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly non-stop solo across the Atlantic in 1927, aboard his plane the Spirit of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> Despite not being among the best films of the director Billy Wilder he boasts some very impressive production values, especially for a film made 50 years ago. The story is well told and the performances are also good, though not exceptional. <br /> <br /> A limiting factor on the script is that Lindbergh flew alone and without a radio, which means he has no one to talk to. This required some different narrative techniques, such as inner monologues, talking to a domestic fly and occasional bouts of talking to oneself, especially once fatigue was exhausted. Furthermore, in order to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight, it is interspersed with the flashbacks of his life and the methodical preparations for the flight. Charles Lindbergh was a great hero of his era, but his controversial beliefs would have contaminated his legacy in some way. Despite this he continued to contribute to the aeronautical sector and collaborated as a civil aviation consultant for the US effort in World War II. Jimmy Stewart certainly had the background for his portrait of Lindbergh. He reached the rank of colonel in US aviation during World War II and while in the post-war reserves he would reach the rank of brigadier general.
