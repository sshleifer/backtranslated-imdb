I have it on VHS, but it's not a perfect copy since I've watched it 2 or 3 times a year since 1999. I'm also afraid that "she indoors" will throw it out in the annual VHS purge. <br /> <br /> Me and my brother (the late 30s we still laugh at the carryover in this fantastic show. Tim Healys Lucky Cup Hat and telling the apprentice that YOU CANNOT DO ANYONE (shooting, passing, etc. ) and it turns out to be Peter Beardsley As a Leeds fan, I have to laugh about Bostock's blank dossier before the cup final (or he said S ** t?) <br /> <br /> The reason I joined line today was that my Bro wants it for Christmas then ITV, please, bring it on DVD, from The UnderFelt Men !!
