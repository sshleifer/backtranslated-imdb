Stanwyck to his villain, the best, Robinson is the same - like ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes, strong use of position, color and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of archive material in the stampede scene? <br /> <br /> Ford is as reliable as ever and Foster is as strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's the villain's movie. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith is a surprisingly charming villain like Stanwyck's lover, and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer. <br /> <br /> Watch it for the value of the field.
