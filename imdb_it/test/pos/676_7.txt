We are in a small town, a family widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to take care of her home. Soon she begins to regret it as Ryan becomes irregular from hour to hour, it seems that she is the guest of a dangerous schizophrenic, and now he is unable to escape from his home. <br /> <br /> Attention, My Lovely is adapted from The story and the game by Mel Dinelli (The Spiral Staircase) entitled "The Man". Practically a one-set film and a two-character film, the film boasts two great central performances and offers an interesting interpretation of mental illness. But one should not be deceived by thinking that it is a violent and unnerving image, because it is not. It is clear from the start that Howard Wilton of Ryan is a dangerously worried man, but this is a different kind of "danger" film. One that casts a shadow over psychosis and therefore makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination, they also did the excellent, and much better, On Dangerous Ground that same year. So, with both actors clearly at ease together, it highlights a story of finely tuned characters all based on the borders of a house, king: prison. Ryan is especially strong when his character enters and leaves the madness, with some powerful scenes and sometimes causing fear and sometimes with deep understanding. Harry Horner's direction is safe (he really doesn't have to do much more than let his actors run with him) and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains some intelligent and impactful visual touches. With one that involves the immensely memorable Christmas tree baubles. Failing a bit between being mediocre and great, be careful, My Lovely has had enough to make it a recommendation for borderline and easy-to-follow film noir fans. For fans of Robert Ryan, it's an essential vision, oh yes, and then some. 7/10
