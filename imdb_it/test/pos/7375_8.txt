I saw this movie late at night on a free-to-air channel, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Being a fan of the horror film, I often watch these midnight movies during school holidays. Most often, the horror films shown in this period are generally large lamers. "Campfire Tales" certainly does not fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is basically an anthology of tales based freely on famous urban legends. They are put together with a setting that involves teenagers who tell these stories around a bonfire. This bonfire environment has a mysterious texture in it. However, this particular story is weak and confusing, obviously used mainly to set up other ghostly tales. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this film (four if you count 'The Hook' in the beginning), this is really spooky and well done. I particularly appreciated the third story ('The Locket') which involves a boy whose motorcycle breaks down in front of a mysterious family. This particular story works well to really scare you with the sudden flashbacks of the history of the house. In addition to this, the ending of the story will completely upset you! Even the first story ("Honeymoon") was very disturbing, although the second story ("People can lick too much") was rather lacking. <br /> <br /> Being a veteran of horror movies, I usually don't get mad. This film has certainly done that job well! What I particularly liked about this film is the fact that it is divided into three short films. This means that the film will not spend more than an hour in character development and establishment before the real bloodshed begins. This makes "Campfire Tales" perfect for sleepwalkers, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a creepy and crunchy horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once. It's definitely better than the crap you will often find in theaters these days (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... yeah!). Find a copy and look at it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
