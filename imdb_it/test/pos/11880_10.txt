Critters 4 is a good movie. A little twist for the series as it takes place in space, not in an earthly community. Good effects and acting make this film a must see. I would recommend it to Horror / Sci-Fi fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
