Directed by Michael Curtiz, Four Daughters is made up of four musically gifted sisters, their suitors and their father, a minor conductor. Sardinian, quick talking Mickey Borden is John Garfield in the role that made him an instant star. The film also sees Claude Piove as Adam Lemp and sisters Lane, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla, and Gale Page as his lively daughters. The final scene takes place in the living room of Lemps. Cigarette hanging on his lips, Borden plays one of his compositions. Ann Lemp of Priscilla Lane tells him that the piece is beautiful. But he says: "Stinks". He continues: "It does not have a beginning or an end, only a means". Ann urges him to create a beginning and an end. Borden replies: "For what? Destinies are against me." They threw a coin - I am poor, I am rich, but they threw a two-headed coin. "The public loved the way Garfield, in his harsh city voice, said he stinks. That scene created the character of Garfield as the eternal outsider Four Daughters is a slice of Americana with Garfield, in a compelling performance that provides more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
