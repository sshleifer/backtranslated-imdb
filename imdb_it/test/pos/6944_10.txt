After touring the world, I realized that in Australia there is really one thing that other countries have: history. Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia was not founded after a war, did not have a civil war and most of its political history is rather boring! Nothing "big" has happened to mark a sort of turning point in the history of Australia .... until the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the governor general of Australia - John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are Australians, you can skip this section and move on to the next one. This is for the benefit of non-Australian onlookers! Australia was colonized by the British. Over time, it became clear that Australia was able to stand alone. As a result, the United Kingdom has granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. Australia's law and policy would no longer be provided directly by the British; rather, Australia would be run by full Australians, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on are largely modeled on the British system. This shift has been codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution legitimately establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no rights law), they are two "pro-crown" sections that have been included and remain there until today. These are more or less considered the "reserve powers of the Crown (king / queen of Great Britain)". The first group of sections concerns the creation of the office of the Governor General. In short, the governor general is considered the queen's main representative in Australia and is described as the "executive" branch of the Australian government. When a law is approved by the Australian parliament, the constitution states that it becomes law only when it is signed by the governor general. As such, General Govenor is considered by some to be nothing more than a rubber stamp that performs an archaic and useless constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. In theory, the governor-general can refuse to sign a law approved by the Australian parliament if he deems it appropriate. For example, if parliament passed a law that allows the police to kill any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course), the GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the country. However, this power is theoretical and (to date) has never been exercised. By "convention" (which is the watchword of the events leading to the dismissal), the Governor General acts virtually at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes the law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor General to sign it, he will, almost always without asking questions. In fact, by "convention" the Governor General acts in accordance with the advice given to him by the Prime Minister of the day (and only by the Prime Minister). The second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that government ministers are in charge of "pleasure" of the Governor General. Now the events of 1975 - dealt with in this film - have given rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is in any way "sorry" with the government and / or the Prime Minister, it would seem that this section allows him to legally dismiss the government (which happened in 1975 ... hence the title of the film "the dismissal"). If "Governor General's pleasure" can be interpreted as "the unlimited right to dismiss" is a controversial point although this has led to rather heated exchanges among Australians at that time - especially considering that the governor general is not elected by the Australian people. <br /> <br /> Now that this basic aspect is out of the way, let's go back to discussing the film. It was well done The rhythm was patient, but it didn't drag at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. He did not dramatize the events excessively and, above all, did not present his point of view from a political perspective. On the contrary, I felt it was fair and balanced, even though the concluding text before the credits indicates that the filmmakers probably did not approve of the Governor General's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I wouldn't describe the film in general as a bias in one direction or another. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, it was practically perfect. Filmmakers have certainly done their homework and clearly read the books and writings of all the major stakeholders. There were a number of finer details that were somehow skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and eventually had little impact on the 1975 events, so they lose them for that. Furthermore, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-war era of Vietnam, but Noyce practically removed it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was glad that the film attempted to raise individual policies on both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental about them. Furthermore, anything that we have grown up, such as Connor's pipeline, has had great relevance to the story. The filmmakers realized that their job was to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal and not to present political support or opposition in relation to policies and points of view. This was clever because it meant that the film cannot be accused of misrepresenting one party's policies. <br /> <br /> The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that occurred in Australia in its short life. I'm glad it was crystallized in celluloid. Essential vision for any Australian.
