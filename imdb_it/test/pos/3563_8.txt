A band of bandits led by the clever, ruthless, ruthless Monetero (a perfectly impressive performance by Gilbert Roland) steals 300,000 dollars of gold coins during a daring train robbery. But the unreliable member Bahunda (a fun turn of Jose Torres) makes out with the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda is killed before he can tell Monetero where he hid the loot. So Monetero must join forces with the cunning, enigmatic enigmatic bounty hunter The Stranger (played smoothly by the handsome George Hilton) and the corrupt banker Clayton (a delightful and mischievous portrait of 50 Eddie "Kookie" Burns teen idol) ) to find the coins. Skillfully directed by Enzo G. Castellari, with an intelligent, complex and intricate script by Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, a jokingly amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with a happy and greedy abandonment), a one score, wise, lively score by Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, a lot of moving and crackling thrilling shots, a mischievously subtle sense of self-deprecating humor, a constant rhythm and a real surprise of a surprise In the end, this dizzying feature often hilarious it makes you think of a message inspired by "The good, the bad and the bad" by Sergio Leone. Among the beautiful secondary parts, the lustful Stefanie Careddu, the ardent friend of Monetero's gal, Marisol, Ivano Staccioli in the role of a hard-nosed army captain, and Gerard Herter in the role of the wasted Lawrence Blackman stand out. Immensely fun and enjoyable entertainment.
