I neglected this film when I went to the cinema but then curiosity took me and I decided to take a look. I loved it !!! The film begins with Judy and Jay heading for a Halloween party at the abandoned funeral home Hull House. Then we meet other characters, Angela and Suzzanne (the hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. Then, of course, they start to party and when they are really in the mood they decide to do a seance that wakes up a demon. The demon owns Angela and she starts the macabre slaughter. They will survive the Demon Night. <br /> <br /> The film was overall fantastic. The gore was fine but the nudity provided by Linnea Quigley (ROTLD Trash) once again shoves it. I've never been a fan of him and never will be.
