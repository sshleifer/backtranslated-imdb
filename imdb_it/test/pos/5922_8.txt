Billy Wilder continues his film series during the 1950s with a biographical film on Charles Lindbergh, the young American pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindbergh, and while it may be a bit too old for the part, it still carries the sincere warmth and security needed, in addition to its typical and characteristic goodness that makes it an iconic movie star. Wilder directs firmly, balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh met when he decided to accept this challenge. Certainly not his best work by Stewart, but it is a jewel of a film. Raise your spirit with the plane and make you proud of being an American. Overall, it's just good.
