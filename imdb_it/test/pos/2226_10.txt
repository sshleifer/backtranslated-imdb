I saw this movie in a theater while I was on vacation at Pablo CO. I had just left my biomedical engineering job in a hospital. I consider the script an exaggeration of the real kind of things that happens in hospitals. <br /> <br /> Idiots who value production don't get the result and probably have never been hospitalized. And it never worked in one for sure. Billy Jack (same time) was very badly produced, but he had a significant social comment and it was a very nice film with a real social message. <br /> <br /> I have been looking for this film since then this is the first site I found where it is mentioned.
