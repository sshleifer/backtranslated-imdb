When this appeared at the Seattle Int'l Film Fest, I was the only person standing, applauding and applauding. The rest of the crowd whistled or fell silent. It is a small well-interpreted film that reaches in depth the reality of the humanity of a young gay. It is a real man; and does not play with the insipid muscular "homosexual" who passes through the non-pornographic gay cinema genre (and this is why so many contemporary gay movies are so boring) This film is Intense Passsion and Great Tragedy. The acting, the direction and the cinematography are fantastic; everything keeps the film clobophobic, tense and passionate. Don't miss this if you can find it.
