Flipper is a beautiful moving film for the whole family. Obviously it's not a great film, Free Willy seems much better almost in every component of film production. Perhaps, sometimes it becomes a bit naive, and the script and script are not the best part of the film, but it's a funny film with good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood proves once again to be an incredibly talented and undervalued actor. He manages to make the bad movie manageable, okay movie - good, good - great and great movie becomes all the classic time. Paul Hogan's performance was also very good and perfectly suited to his role. As I said above, the whole cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best parts. So Flipper is a perfect way if you want to see a beautiful, sweet and fun movie. If you like that you get sick and tired of the modern Hollywood trash, full of sex, violence, vulgarity and obscenity, you'd probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> My vote: 7.7 out of 10. Feel free to send me any of my comments and posts here. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for my bad English.
