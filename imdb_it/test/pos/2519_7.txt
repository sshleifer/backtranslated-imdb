Although "The Beginning" showed that we are still getting "classic" x files, Drive showed that X-Files would explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser on Drive, with the shooting of the camera. It was an interesting transition from TV to real events. I would have liked it even more if they had kept the cameras to get the news for the whole teaser and not cut inside the car. After watching this episode live in 1998, I thought, "Am I on the right channel?" That first Scully autopsy flooded me with big words I don't understand. I think he learned his lesson to ALWAYS wear a mask before doing an autopsy. Silly Scully! What is the agreement with the lighting in the autopsy laboratory? It's dark like a grave in there! How should they see what they're doing in there? Assistant director Kersh gets his first lines in this episode. I didn't lose love for that man. It is the third recurring character in a line that is introduced that you love to hate, the first two are Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I imagine the producers felt that there was too much love for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some pain and incite our ire as a fan. I love the quarantine outfits worn by Scully and her team with the fantastic helmet-shaped bulbs. Boy. It's really smoky or foggy in the night of northern Nevada. Can we say the word "effect"? Drive is an interesting episode, but looking at route 36 on my US atlas, Mulder could never maintain a speed of 70-100 MPH on that road. If it had been on I-80, the highway, maybe. But no way on a highway with so many curves. All the shots inside the car seemed very authentic. Great job by Rob Bowman. It doesn't look like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of landscapes passing in front of a car window on a stage. This was a funny episode, but some of the inaccuracies prevent it from being a great episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so hold on for a quick run!
