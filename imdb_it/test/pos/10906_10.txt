Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the plot is interesting and the script is OK. A little too simplistic as a gay coming out story was so positive when it is usually not so positive. Then again, it's fiction. :) All in all a fun romp. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was the "inside-joke" aspect. Since the target audience was probably heterosexual, he might not get the gay "stuff" in the context of the story. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed an aspect of his acting ability that writers sometimes fail to take into consideration when suggesting a part to Kline. <br /> <br /> This hit the mark.
