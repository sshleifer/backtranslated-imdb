This film from what I remember was a fantastic film! I saw it on television when I was 11 and I couldn't remember the title. If I remember correctly, I think it was a special for a Christmas TV movie. One of my friends at work and I was discussing it several years ago, but none of us remembered the title. But we remembered almost the whole movie. No one else at work remembered ever seeing it! Thank God, someone on a TV movie site responded to my post! Now I have the fun task of finding a copy! It's amazing what you can remember as a child, but this film is definitely living in my mind ... even after 28 years. And I think I only saw him once. Maybe because I was the big sister of my family, or maybe because I worked as a nanny and worked in day care centers, which I stayed with for so long. Regardless of the real reason, it remained one of the films I really wanted to see lately !!! If anyone knows where to watch it online or has a copy, let us know. I would love to see it again !!!! Thanks a lot! Seriously, I tried posting this and it says that my comment isn't long enough. So, apparently I have to type more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is Peter Billingsley's sister who starred in A Christmas Story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea where to find it, I would really appreciate it.
