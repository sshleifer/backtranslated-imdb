Today we live in sad times, in which it seems that every comedy film and television series is painfully little amusing and inflicted with poor, raw or poor humor. Most people don't know what it really means to laugh at comedy, and these people desperately need to watch "Throw mum off the train". I say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, from beginning to end. Comedy is so unpredictable and distorted enough to make us laugh out loud many times. Don't be fooled by the plot of the murder. The plot is not serious enough to make us worry or worry about what will happen. The story involves a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying and grumpy mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar in a role that was completely flawless in my opinion) and does so by killing Billy Crystal's wife, whom Crystal wanted died for stealing his novel. I don't want to ruin the jokes and the gags in this movie, but all I can say is that you have to watch this movie if you want to laugh. An urgent and sincerely rhythm, a real surprise for comedy lovers and the type of film you don't see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
