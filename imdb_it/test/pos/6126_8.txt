What is there to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It is beyond criticism or even explanations because in reality it does not aspire to be like any other film you have seen. You will take it or you will not, you will laugh at it or you will raise your eyes in disgust (or both). John Waters is a strange filmmaker (who describes him in a mild way), mixing innocent and childish humor with outrageously offensive moments destined for ... well, who knows what his intentions were. It's like a form of assault, even if it's fun. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes Waters humor so contagious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that may seem alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalries that make up the plot of "Pink Flamingos ". Surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the issue at stake was not the title of "The Filthiest Person Alive". What makes the film's compelling vision for me is the way in which Waters creates dizzying and autonomous environments and does not let you immediately get involved in the joke. The people in his films are completely in tune with each other. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that he doesn't want to take her to town because Crackers is taking his "friend" out of the trailer, Babs reacts with a smirk and tells her, in a hint of conspiracy, "That the little shed is just PERFECT ... "At this point, we still don't know that Crackers is going to bring his" friend "to the shed to push live chickens on her naked body while Cotton looks orgasmically through a window, but this strangeness is totally common and understood by the characters from the fictitious degenerate world that Waters creates. <br /> <br /> Another example would be the conversation between the girls in the basement and Channing, the devoted butler of the Marbles. The first time we see them, Waters cuts sharply from a scene in Connie's welcoming office in Channing that goes down to the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very alive and stripped. Susan is not a crouched victim, but is furious and offensive to Channing, leaping to her feet to launch a verbal attack on her full-scale jailer. Both have a strange understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so intimidated by her abduction as violently insulted and rightly furious. He doesn't give up a second while Channing is at his sight, and the two scenes that show their delirious lines are two of the highlights of the film. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers break into the house of the Marbles and discover their crimes of keeping the abducted women in their cellar, they represent the total lack of support that Divino and his family have for the mark of depravity that the Marbles are seconding- "There is something with which Divino is not familiar, a corruption conceived by his new rivals, and she despises her." Also, while the kidnapping doesn't look like something Divine would think twice about, she is outraged by the fact that the girls are kept there and frees them happily, savoring the revenge that Channing takes on. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the specter of dirt, Waters occasionally reminds us of the line that separates his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. The first time we see Connie, she is downplaying a minor character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. Cookies, on the other hand, react with an exhilarating evaluation of the title of Divino as the "dirtiest person alive", revealing that she also lives in this world of insanity and unspoken madness. <br /> <br /> We must also say something about the way players are in contact with their respective roles, in particular Divine, who does not lose a note. Not once did he hesitate in the ridiculous dress and character he was given, and take "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or strangeness. People really believed that Divine was like that in real life, and it's easy to see why, because while you're watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who did it. Since they are really doing the scandalous things in the script, you start thinking that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary. <br /> <br /> But even more, "Pink Flamingos" is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you. Even if its shock value has mostly disappeared for me now (I say above all because the scene of a ** hole and the chicken scene startle me anyway), I still find this film exhilarating and habit forming.
