I laughed my ass for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finneity was. Why have I never heard of Dan Finnerty? He is hysterical and his reserve singers too. They make all these feminine songs that we would never want to hear a new experience. They blow up these songs. This was on Bravo last night. Why isn't this Dan guy like "ultra famous"? Beautiful voice! Charisma to burn! It shocked me with this show! I just read on the internet that he was once a member of "Stomp", I guess there's nothing he can't do. I saw "Stomp" in a UCLA theater years ago and those guys were great. This show last night was done by Dreamworks! Does that mean Spielberg did this? Why don't they play this Dan Finnerty in a movie. There was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera cut the audience, everyone was so involved, singing or dancing. The whole show had this incredible energy. My only complaint was that it was no longer long, but looking back, when you see how much energy put out those guys, I guess it would be impossible for any human being to perform with such enthusiasm for over an hour. I loved this show!
