For once, a Barbie movie is good. I'm 18 and embarrassed to say so, but I'm fond of these films. I hated Barbie when I was younger, but the movies I love. The thrill is so cute and I fell in love with him. He's as cute as the polar bear and totally in love with Aiden. Oh man, I'm in love with Shiver. I love the determination of Annika not to give up hope and, eventually, it works. I love this movie and I hope they will be good others. Barbie & Swan Lake is another brilliant film. I would recommend this film to children of all ages (even children) because the film is so beautiful and I am hard to please. Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus is a film that is enchanting and exciting.
