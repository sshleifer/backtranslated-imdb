This is yet another western of an avid baron of cattle who tries to push small farmers and farmers. It was all done before and after. But The Violent Men is something special. <br /> <br /> What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck who plays the role of the fox as he often did in his later films. She is married to the lame Edward G. Robinson who is the cattle baron here, but Robinson is paralyzed and there is some indication that his injuries may have left him powerless. It doesn't matter to Barbara, whose needs are met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. This doesn't fit well either with Dianne Foster, who is the daughter of Robinson and Stanwyck, or Lita Milan who is Keith's Mexican girl. <br /> <br /> The infidelity subplot almost takes the place of the film, but Glenn Ford as the small breeder who is a Civil War veteran who came west for his health manages to keep his here. It is in every inch the quiet western hero that people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect those famous words of Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth: "I'm a peaceful man". It would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men. <br /> <br /> The fifties was the age of the adult western, the themes were entering horse works that had not been explored before. The following year Glenn Ford would have made another western, Jubal, one of his best that also explores infidelity as part of the plot. <br /> <br /> There is enough traditional Western material in The Violent Men and much for those who are addicted to soap operas too.
