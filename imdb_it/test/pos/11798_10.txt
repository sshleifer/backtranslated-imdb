I had never heard of this film when it was given to me to translate, so I didn't know what to expect. I checked on IMDb and became curious. It didn't take long to realize that this was a gem. Exceptional shows, great history, and is both well directed and well written. It is difficult to compare it to other films, but "Stand by me" comes to mind, although it has many differences compared to "The cure" as similarities. The story of an extraordinary friendship between boys, as well as dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this film and "Stand by me". In addition to this, "The cure" is a beautiful film in its own right, which deserves wider recognition. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also fun. I can't think of a single thing that bothers me. Having said that, I don't want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but rather that I enjoyed it immensely, it was very touched and would not change anything in it. I won't go into a detailed description of the plot / story, partly because it would be too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site. In closing, I can only say: wonderful film, see it if you have the chance.
