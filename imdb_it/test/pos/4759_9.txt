I was born in 1968 with not much guidance from parents as far as I saw on TV (as a child in the 70s). I've always loved this movie (and the French Connection) and I've always tried to capture it when it was turned on (by checking the TV guide on Sunday in advance). I bought it on DVD a few years ago and I've seen it twice since then and I have to say that I STILL LOVE IT !!!! Roy S. was a great actor of the '70s (Jaws is one of my favorites of all time, Marathon Man, etc.) And even if the 7-ups are not a movie worthy of the Oscars, they put you in a moment place (NY, early 70s, as well as French Connection) and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of cop life at that time. And yes, car chase is one of the best of all time.
