This is one of my favorite movies EVER ... I've seen it about a million times and I would never have refused the opportunity to watch it again. In fact, I like it so much that I REALLY wanted to check out the resort where it was shot during my next vacation ... does anyone know what it's called? If so, write to me !!! I saw this movie for the first time when it was released for the first time and I was Nikki's age and for a long time I bothered my father by taking me somewhere because obviously I expected the same thing to happen to me! It's just an incredible scenery and a lovely puppy-love story. This is a must for DVD collectors!
