Well, first of all - I'm a big fan of horror movies, but anyway - I'm pretty sick of all those damn American horror movies. They are all of the same thing: blood and violence. It's not even creepy. Well, there's nothing wrong with blood and everything else - it doesn't even bother me - but that's not what makes a movie scary! That's why I find this movie funny - it's fun to see a satire making fun of the "main US horror" concept. American sketches / blood films, they are not supposed to be scary, just funny. All right. But when they suppose they are "disturbing", for the most part it becomes pathetic. However, there are some great American horror films (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it's the same thing. That's why this film was a real relief. Evil And it's not just a cult movie: it's a classic! I can't wait until master director Anders Jacobsson makes another damn splatter movie! Until I have to look at Evil Ed again - and again - and again! But I don't care - it's such a great movie!
