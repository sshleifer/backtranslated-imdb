Ok, when it comes to conspiracies, this film is anything but credible and even a little silly. And yet, despite its many deficiencies, the film manages to work - provided you turn off your brain and let yourself enjoy the laziness of all this. If you can't, you probably won't like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> In one of the strangest plots of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a boy who lives near the Arctic Circle in a wireless station. How exactly he arrived at a remote outpost is uncertain, but in this very, very lonely and isolated existence comes a constant series of guests - even though years had passed since he had seen anyone but the Eskimos. <br /> <br /> First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. They're supposed to be going to Montreal - how they got that far from nothing is incredible! Reginald is a stuffy and boring individual who is really worried about Montgomery, since Robert hasn't seen a woman in a long time and Owen seems in constant terror that Montgomery is out to steal Loy for himself. As for Montgomery, this is EXACTLY what its plans are! For a long time, you never understand why Loy is engaged to Owen - since he is as attractive as soaked bread. <br /> <br /> Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love, but this is all in vain when, out of the blue, Montgomery's old girlfriend comes to announce that she is there to marry him !! Considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him, Montgomery naturally assumed that the report was over - but the sudden arrival of the blind and annoying girlfriend is enough to destroy the plans that Loy and Montgomery were making. <br /> <br /> How this is solved is something that you can simply see for yourself. As for the film, the plot is very stupid and invented - I can't defend it. But it's also pretty fun and fascinating and I see this movie as a wacky comedy that is just a step or two under contemporary films like BRINGING UP BABY. Silly, light but also very charming. It is worth seeing, although it is not particularly credible.
