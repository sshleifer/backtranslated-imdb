These guys are excellent and all they bring to the public is first class. The musicality of this band is incredible and we should all be very grateful to live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Take this DVD and you will have a great time !! Recently I was able to see these incredible musicians playing in Houston, Texas, and it was wiped out. I haven't missed a show since the electric windows and I have to say they are better than ever. Everyone should embrace these kids and teach others what true musicality is! There will never be a trio so tight and well put back into our lives. Let us hope and pray that they will not retire soon!
