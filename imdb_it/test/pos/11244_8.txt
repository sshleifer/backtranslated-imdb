This is a great show despite many negative user reviews. The purpose of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two boys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is to watch the two males try to reach their goal. <br /> <br /> Some seem to hate the show for various reasons, but I think they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to collect chicks. Well, it's not, it's a comedy show, and the key point is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't look at it. If you don't like the whole club thing, don't watch it. If you don't like socializing don't look at it. This show is a comedy show. If you're watching others, pick up the girls, well, it doesn't make you laugh, so don't watch it. If you're so disappointed with yourself after seeing this show and realizing that you don't have a chance to "tease" girls, there's no reason to hate the show, just don't watch it!
