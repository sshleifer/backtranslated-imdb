This movie was fun from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out loud for the whole movie !! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, Will and Grace's girlfriend) and Tanya the manicure (Debi Mazar). They had the best jokes, the best attitudes, etc. Jada Pinkett played a very funny lesbian, she played it really well and was very convincing. The only negative thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters weren't so funny even though the film focused around them ........ All in all, this is a great movie to watch and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a movie for girls all over!). To enjoy!!!
