I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame, everyone is real. No cardboard heroes or cold, omnipotent and known characters. <br /> <br /> I have read many other spectators who complain about the morality of Anne and James who will keep his love for her, despite her betraying him, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her. <br /> <br /> She was a heavily suppressed woman, her actions were unplanned: once she started to free herself she was confused and made many mistakes. But so it is in real life, when you gain freedom you are likely to make mistakes (especially at the starting point). <br /> <br /> Was it a bit too ungrateful? Could be. But we must remember that he is running with his feet for the first time. He knows that James, after all, is a good man, perhaps a little too rigid, serious and work-centered; but he also feels the urge to live life as itself. <br /> <br /> Do you blame him more than he? I think not. <br /> <br /> But the change that happens in their lives generates some changes. <br /> <br /> James instead of letting his wife get out of his life (as others have suggested as the right choice) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for better. He begins to understand that what was superficially OK (his marriage) was actually a control game he played on his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story with characters who have an excessively emotional and precarious nature (ie the usual Latin American or Italian jealous clich√©), this is a story of men and women who use both heart and brain . <br /> <br /> It can be very painful but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you are likely to forgive him and let him go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, criminally passionate, possessive and mentally unstable individual. <br /> <br /> A really beautiful film. The last scene, when James - despite all the things that happened before - accompanies Anne to the train station is really moving: she is free and has understood what freedom means for a person. <br /> <br /> Guido
