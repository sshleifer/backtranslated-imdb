I saw this movie in the early 1970s and was hypnotized by Judy Geeson. For me it captured the clandestine nature of Rod Steigers' uncontrollable obsession with the extremely sexy young hitch hitch, played by Geeson. <br /> <br /> You can't help but feel a little sorry for his wife, brilliantly played by Claire Fioritura. I was really disappointed to see that the original cut could have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on DVD. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone who has seen the film, and it is a strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three main interpretations of the character, and I would have liked to have seen it again, if only for a purely nostalgic reason. <br /> <br /> Going back in time, around 35 years. <br /> <br /> A true classic.
