Outside, this film is better thanks to Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is just as good as the 1982 version. In a sense, the 1999 version is better because it is more up to date ( a decade compared to the age of 27. The actors in this film were fantastic, like Terry Kinney (McManus of HBO "Oz") like James Daly and Tony Shalhoub (USA's Monk) and Gary Sinise (CSI: NY) Obvilubuly, the dialogue was changed for the contemporary public, most of the writing remained the same, there were things that weren't in the 1982 version that gave this a dramatic boost and comedy, but in the end, this film was just as great at that of 1982. Wise character: Vincent D'onofrio who plays Phil Romano was excellent, better than Paul Sorvino.It is a match between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney in terms of James As for George, I would like to commend Shalhoub and, between Martin Sheen and Sinsise as T om, I would say that Sinise wins.
