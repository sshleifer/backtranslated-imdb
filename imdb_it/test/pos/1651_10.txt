Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the images of Melville's crime (particularly Bob le Flameur and one point Le Cercle Rouge) of being totally focused on the story and the character and making sure that not one word is spoken he needs, and was ahead of his time. Ionically, he still has a sort of professionalism among his characters, a sort of respect (if not for himself or for others, a kind of duty) that resonates well in post-war France. His actors bring faces for these characters who say "we know what these guys are talking about", and from there the story starts. Maybe it's because I have a weakness for robbery photos, especially where we only see the nuts and bolts (err, real physical side) of how a shot is taken out. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with how the current robbery is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast (eg Snatch), or done in ways we've seen too many times in the past. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to practically create a silent film of a robbery, including sound effects. The tension that accumulates in this scene may not exceed what Melville had in "Rouge", but at his own level he reaches his greatness and his momentum, and equally important originality of what has been done before. There are some close-ups kept, for example, while the safe is in the process of cracking, which mark some of the best I've seen from France at the time. Another advantage for the film, apart from the new wave touch of larval cinema, which in the end makes it a little more modern, is that the story works so well and in a different way. It becomes completely about the character in the points, and then continues with the chills. The last ten to fifteen minutes are miraculously right; as with another classic robbery, the Asphalt Jungle, it is not even the last stop that matters, but all about how far we will overcome the call of duty, putting humanism above greed. <br /> <br /> You almost wonder all the euphoria of the camera flying high-speed trees with the machine that could simply make it. Dassin has a very funny and intuitive film of its kind here, with even a small musical number.
