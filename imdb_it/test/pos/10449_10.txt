What looks like a ho-hum Porky's imitation turns out to be a touching film about being young and in love. <br /> <br /> The story concerns three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their hours after school looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in the city, Gary falls madly in love with her. <br /> <br /> The film moves from being a seedy sex movie to an examination of adolescent insecurities. It's fun and sad at the same time. He never completely gives in that formula of the love story that seems important in every film. You know the boy meets the girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy returns in the final formula. This formula is put aside after the boy meets the girl. Perhaps this is why I liked the film so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is particularly good and the ending is a real tear-jerk. It could also be one of the most realistic endings I've ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
