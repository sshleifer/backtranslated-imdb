I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I don't count the super bug budget, nor the Batman's plot) <br /> <br /> A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Demolitionist, take this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It's the same movie in both movies) <br /> <br /> If you don't have it, then let me explain ... a cop's father is killed and she seeks revenge. The black dress is fastened (a sexy catwomanish and skimpy outfit that looks absolutely exceptional on Joan Severance) and shows off to throw some booty. <br /> <br /> It's a fun, action-packed movie, be it, you could. I don't want kids to see it ... without first examining it to see if you approve of the graphic scene Severance has in it. Which in my opinion was a bonus (okay, give it an extra star <ghigno>)
