This film is too good for words. He is incredibly beautiful, funny and true to life. You only know from watching this that the person who wrote this DEFENSE felt the way Jip and his friends make the film. At some point it was my life and I would have trusted myself to go home to look at Human Traffic all night before I could even think of going to bed. I think you like it so much with the characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this film would not be for older people over the age of 16 to 22 I think. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film and it will tear you to pieces. It has no particular plot. The general idea is a weekend in the lives of the older kids in London and how they behave. The places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD, it doesn't matter, just watch it, you have to have it !!!
