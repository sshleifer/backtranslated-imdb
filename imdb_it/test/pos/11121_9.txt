I saw Fame when it came out. This is the high school class of 1980, coinciding with my graduation year. I saw the film in the summer between high school and college, and being an actor myself, holds a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The greatest criticisms of Fame usually have to do with continuity, and there are certainly some plots that have not been completed or make no sense. However, these problems are more than offset by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I saw him recently and was surprised that I still loved him as much as the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I don't think is right. Although Flashdance has good music and Jennifer Beals is wonderful, I think Fame is enormously superior in the development of her characters and the complexity of her stories. For all those who truly love the arts, this is a must-see film.
