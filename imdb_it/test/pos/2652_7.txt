A film, first of all, should be a good narrative. It should be fun - and fun doesn't necessarily mean "laughs", and it doesn't necessarily mean "light". Basically it means that you are not bored while watching it. <br /> <br /> As brilliant as 2001 can be, it's a difficult film to watch, especially for the current generation (video-game-playback / iPod). His slow pace and the sometimes unbearable time an actor takes to perform a single action (for example, trying to save the floating member of the crew in space) will lengthen patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film intelligently directed, the ending that stimulates thought and scoring ... the score is chilling, especially when the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I got goose bumps, big time. This does not happen often when I watch films, and is a testament to Kubrick's directing skills. <br /> <br /> It is considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science fiction film of all time. Only this is a good reason to look at it if you haven't done it yet. However, just because everyone thinks it's a brilliant movie, doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like yourself. Either you'll do it (you like it) or you won't. Perhaps the slow pace is not so bad after all. Directing your attention to something rather static and slow for two and a half hours could teach you a lesson. It will surely be a different experience from all these fast and fast images to which we are subjected these days (advertisements, music videos or video games). <br /> <br /> I myself think it's a "memorable" film. But not one I'm eager to watch again any time soon (unless I'm in a particular mood for slow-moving movies). <br /> <br /> So 7 out of 10 stars from me.
