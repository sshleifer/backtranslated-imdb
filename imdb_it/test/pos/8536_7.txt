First of all, to rent or watch this movie you expect something in the B-horror range. What this film offers for the crafty fan of this genre is a fun walk through Nordic taste. Sometimes, reminding me of the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and others of a Stuart Gordon film, this little discovery should resonate more. <br /> <br /> The f / x reach some really ghostly highs (the first time Ed meets his nemesis) but generally they have the feeling that this film was put together by a team af / x who decided use any and all props available to them from other movies ... gremlins, devils, slasher movies, etc. they have a pretty good effect and have worked through the use of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The gem of the film is humor. The gore works most of the time but more for laughter. At its heart it is a parody and a funny thing.
