Yikes! and we all thought that Joan Crawford was THE horror Mommy Dearest ... well, Laura Hope Crewes as a mom in this pungent 4-character movie delivers (and does the cops) the merchandise in this cracker of a conjugal Mommy mangle ... THE SILVER CD is a truly sensational pre-code drama from RKO made in 1932, published in 1933 by a 1929 comedy. So amazing, sincere and honest is every surprising verbal exchange between a son's wife (IreneDunne) with her boyfriend of the other while these two young girls together go to war - cheerful cheerfully discarding the clearly incestuous beggars of mother towards her big first-born son played by virile Joel MacCrea and his younger 'beau' / son paid by the delicate and beautiful twenty-five year old actor Eric Linden. I would think that this film was played by many listeners who shouted in huge theaters in 1933 and offers viewers, even in 2005, a very fruity melodrama animated by a crackling dialogue that is not afraid to call the mother exactly like her. This film would have been impossible to do after the censorship code arrived after 1934. Other viewer comments on IMDb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see (and record) THE SILVER CORD will agree that it is an unforgettable event and a pungent script in a superbly produced film. He would play as the VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932. Laura Hope Crewes must have kissed the RKO stage for this role of a lifetime ... even more than her soft turn in GWTW. Irene Dunne is beautiful, casual and credible as always, fighting for her husband once again, and it is worth seeing The Divorc√©e made in 1929 as a complement to THE SILVER CAVO. Joel MaCrea is certainly in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in his beautiful and amiable stakes. I had never seen Eric Linden in a real acting role before (he played the amputated leg in the hospital horror scene in GWTW) and here he is amazing and young with an excellent role as Robert, the youngest and most sensitive son. Some verbal beards pointed back at him would not have been able to overcome the Code office, if done later. This is really a good movie, and if the viewer forgives a bit of the crunch of his time and is content with a shoot-out of unparalleled bite for a 1932 movie, you will be well rewarded. At first I thought that some of the throat that gripped the melodrama of Mother was dated until I realized that it was a script of the excellent script to make the viewer laugh as if it were a weak old lady ...... NOT. .... but not even the other two women in this power plant play on film, hence the fantastic dialog box. That transatlantic seen on a reel is LEVIATHAN the monstrous ship that the United States won from the Germans in the First World War which was so enormous and cumbersome that the crews were nervous wrecks trying to fight with it on the Atlantic. It is infamous for having stranded a colossal wave in a storm with its head held high and fired over the ridge with such an angle that the spine along the bottom broke and the ship split vertically between the funnels. He limped towards the harbor with rattling steel panels and winking riveting holes ... and crewmembers and mentally destroyed passengers. It was sunk in 1935 after being cursed and tormented by mechanical problems of horror all its existence. After all, it is not such a war prize. <br /> <br /> However, the dialogue in THE SILVER CORD is quite exciting for one night: eg: "Mother! The Doctor said there was nothing wrong with you, in fact he said that it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you ". Whammo!
