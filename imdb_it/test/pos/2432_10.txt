This film is a very funny tribute to Bogart and other old detective movies. Robert Sacchi nails him like Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a timeless beauty like Gena Anastas. <br /> <br /> However, the most noteworthy part of this film is the longest belly dance scene ever produced in a Hollywood movie. A well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in the cinema is approached due to the excitement of the dance. <br /> <br /> The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a luxuriant Middle Eastern nightclub and is in effect mesmerizing. The pulsating music, the swirling vortices and the sounds of the dishes, the flowing undulations and the splendid costumes - and a surprise touch involving the seductive Sybil Danning - create tension and excitement until the end. <br /> <br /> The three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are guided by the exotic beauty of chestnut Kamala Almanzar, one of the leading belly dancers in the United States since the mid-1970s. It was chosen by the famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with his orchestra on the road. Guy's ensemble is the live band with which the dancers perform in the scene. If you watch the trailer on this site, you'll see a taste of Kamala (playing the cymbals with your fingers behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of belly dancing yet, you will be after watching this movie, and if you are a fan, it holds up very well after repeated viewing.
