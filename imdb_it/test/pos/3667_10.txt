Too bad someone hasn't had the ability to spread this movie in theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing that this is not like any other movie you've seen since you hold onto Baby, you have to let yourself be dragged and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize that it covers issues that are not only subtle but meaningful. Alienation, denial, satisfaction of desire, to begin with. Cathy Bates owns this film, it has never been better. The entire cast has the feel of the plot and knows what they are doing without resorting to free blackmail, except where it is required, as in the case of the pieces by Julie Andrews or the videos of Jonathan Pryce's camp. If you are not open minded, you will not understand it. (See the bizarre review of Mark Adnum, who dedicates to the adulation of Stephanie Beacham, her career and her brother's OBE for introducing vegetable oil or something of the natives of the island.) Taking this as a starting point, I could also devote of time to praise the stellar cameo of Amo Gulinello as an intern of a television station or scene of the shower of Jack Noseworthy. So put aside all the previous cinematographic comedy concepts and have fun. I loved it.
