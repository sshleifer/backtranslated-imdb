Although the films about Edgar Rice Burroughs, the famous Rousseauian hero Tarzan, have been seen by movie-goers for almost a century, this is the final version of the story. Greystoke is the true story of Tarzan's origins as reported by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the second decade of the last century. I was insured by experts. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes are probably the most science-fiction heroes in history. Actually I have no basis to say it, just an instinctive feeling. The most popular Holmes was Basil Rathbone, the most famous Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller. And the films they made with both characters will be criticized endlessly by purists. <br /> <br /> But Greystoke is the real deal, a faithful adaptation of Burroughs' first story about the origin of his hero. I can't think of another film that shows that Tarzan learned French before English, but this is shown here and it's natural because he was a French survivor of a massacred safari played by Ian Holm who discovers Tarzan who was bred from the monkeys since his parents wrecked on the African coast died there after his mother gave birth. <br /> <br /> His parents were actually the son and daughter-in-law of the Earl of Greystoke and the surviving count, of Ralph Richardson is obviously delighted to learn that he has a nephew. Of course there are others who do not welcome the new heir to society. <br /> <br /> The one who isn't is Andie McDowell who obviously plays Jane. It does not communicate with Tarzan in response to its grunts and monosyllabic commands. Tarzan speaks concise English, French, and also includes the language of monkeys. As for the language of love, Tarzan and Jane do not need lessons. <br /> <br /> Greystoke received three Oscar nominations for best monkey makeup, the most suitable script and a posthumous nomination for Ralph Richardson as best supporting actor. He should also have considered a nomination for the cinematography of the jungle scenes in Cameroon and the scenes of the British Aristocracy in several historical places like Hatfield House and Blenheim Palace. <br /> <br /> For the purists of Burroughs, Greystoke is the real deal.
