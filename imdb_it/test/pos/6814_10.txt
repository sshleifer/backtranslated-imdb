I came across this film while singing on the channel and I was speechless. It was broadcast on a less well-known short film program here in Australia. It's been a long time since I've been so impressed with a movie, especially one so short. <br /> <br /> The power of history, the quality of acting and the splendid cinematography ... wow. If it were available, it would be a very worthy addition to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> I am undoubtedly impressed, and I look forward to the next Joshua Leonards movie. <br /> <br /> An exceptional experience 10/10
