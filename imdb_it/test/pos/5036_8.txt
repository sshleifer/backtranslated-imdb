This is one of my favorite "Capra-esque" comedies. This film is only meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, analyzed under the microscope. It is not a religious comment. It is funny. It's a fantasy. The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think that they must be part of every movie. <br /> <br /> Others have described the role of Travolta (which is why you will watch the movie over and over) and the excellent supporting cast (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes a movie is simply fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
