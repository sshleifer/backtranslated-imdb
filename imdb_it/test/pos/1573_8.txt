Writer and director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest but compelling road movie. His dialogue was lively, and his use of very short flashback sequences was particularly effective in the narrative structure of the film. <br /> <br /> At the center of the film is the character of Alice, who is fleeing her New England past in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, he travels with a couple of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who incredibly make the attempt to rule Alice like a prostitute who earns money at truck stops. <br /> <br /> Like a newcomer playing the role of her first screen, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no false note in his character choices. But the film deserves to be seen above all for the astute and sensitive character of Sandra, masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There is a particularly clever subtext for virtually every moment Ivey is on-camera. As a spectator, I found myself stopping the tape, hitting the rewind and reviewing its scenes to try to discern the psychological subtleties. <br /> <br /> The film raises the following question about the characters: are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they an evil pair of Dickensian predators that prey on the very young Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that it never completely answers this question. Alice seems more confident than she started because of her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is she really a better person? <br /> <br /> Part comedy, photos in part and a growing dramatic film, this carefully crafted film manages to get us involved on many levels.
