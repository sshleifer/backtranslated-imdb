Three ten-year-olds born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to surreptitiously kill someone who offends them. <br /> <br /> While the murderous children's films were not exactly new at the time of this twisted 1980s slang the theme of children as murderers works well for this film. Bloody Birthday gives you thrills and suspense, while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities. It straddles a thin line between cheese and creepy, but remains fun with an interesting plot. There are some scenes of strong murders, as well as a lot of nudity to establish this as a strong guilty pleasure of slasher. <br /> <br /> The cast does a good job. The young stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel offers some menacing shows, while the rising star Julie Brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo appearance. <br /> <br /> All around this unusual slashing voice is not bad, although it is certainly not perfect, but it is worth looking for fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
