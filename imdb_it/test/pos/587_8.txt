I loved THE MUPPET MOVIE. It was the first of the Muppet films and is by far the best because it is so creative and fresh. With subsequent films, the ideas didn't seem so original. But here, we can see the Kermit and Miss Piggy bikes (an incredibly difficult scene), an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute that the Muppets performed and I would have rated the film much higher, except for a serious problem. In this and other later Muppet films, some warned powers had to include many non-Muppets - in particular, many, many cameos of stars. Some worked well (like those of Charles Durning), but many seemed irrelevant and slowed the image to a halt. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an extraordinary man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew, but the scene he was in was neither necessary nor most of the cameos. However, despite this great complaint, it is a fantastic film for the whole family, from children to the most demanding adults.
