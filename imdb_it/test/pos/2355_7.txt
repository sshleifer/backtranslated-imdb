I saw this film for the first time in 1953 with my older brother. It was one of the great 3 Demension films released in that era. We have seen it at least thirteen times and we were proud of it. Scott does a typical western shooting job while surrounded by Indian arrows rather than surround sound. Oh, for those polaroid lenses again.
