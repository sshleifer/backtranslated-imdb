At the time of writing this article (January 25, 2006), I am saddened by the news of the death in the last hours of Chris Penn. In addition to Footloose, The Wild Life is the film that I most remember Chris. <br /> <br /> I still remember in the film, with a slight passion, the character and teammates of Chris sitting in their favorite restaurant with a huge plate of fries in front of them, drowned in a whole bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> However, my comment concerns the title track sung by Bananarama. After these many years, I still remember the Canadian spelling (lol) that Bananarama was called in the VERY VERY moment to compose the track of the film and that they wrote the song on the plane to the recording studio to record the song and immediately after recording the song they went on to shoot the low-cost video for their title track. I heard that the whole process (from beginning to end) took 4 hours! If this is true, then they are truly worthy of being the most successful women's band of all time. <br /> <br /> However, it's just a rumor I had heard in the past and I still remember a generation later. Perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify. Thank you.
