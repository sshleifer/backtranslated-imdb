OK .... so, at 15 minutes of the film, there is still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film came to me in a padded bag of Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted information on the front. I am a programmer for a North American festival, and MOD LOVE was sent to me by our boss as a potential starter who came to the far-flung Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. <br /> <br /> I thought "this movie is not for us" (no dialogue at minute 15 ??), but I kept looking anyway. Good good good. It was built and built and built, and in the middle of the film I got involved in this film, because, like when you go to the zoo, you're reticent at first, but when you get to the dangerous snake, you're totally "there". <br /> <br /> This film has a danger, not entirely similar to the aforementioned WolF Creek, but because it is totally totally "other" in every shape and form, and seems to weave the web is composed of all the fantasies of most independent helmsmen. - gloomy weather, intrigues with red necks, strange junctions, disturbing music, and a plot that, although imperfect and basic, has something in common with one of the "great Australian films", or The Cars That Ate Paris, by Wier. But MODERN LOVE is actually not a very Australian film in the sense of Ocker-ishness and playful self-irony that pervades many of the films of that country. It works on a more nightmare realm from the beginning. No cell phones, no brand names, no i-pods, no average / classy urban grain - just a good-looking married guy, an old Volvo, and a kid (son) who has teeth and strange stuff around . Oh, it's set in the strange seaside village where people all seem slightly "wrong". Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoe) MOD LUV happens where many Aust. the films fail - that is, they stand up without regard for the country "forgotten by God" from which it comes out. Instead, it reveals itself in a deformed but amusing enigma that the film itself cannot solve - and here is the weak bond ... what the hell does this film have to do with "Modern Love" ???? The last minutes of the film seem to give an answer, or at least suggestions to one ... and while I sat and drank a coffee and then ate my Hershey, all I could assume was that the guardian of this film, Alex Frayne, will be very funny with this. /
