I have reasons to love big camera users; the fluid direction of action lends itself to a frenetic adventure and a comic narrative; but such a skill, in the hands of a King Vidor or an Anthony Mann, can also be applied to work at the level of ideas. This is Paul Wendkos' masterpiece. Its plot can be sold in detail in a single pair of sentences. General Hector Cordoba is setting himself up as almost emperor in northern Mexico and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his mission unit of crack, divided, apprehensive but determined, led by George Peppard, to get the cannon back and bring Cordoba back to life, to end the rebellion. The charismatic Raf Vallone plays in Cordoba; the women in the piece are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; with the team even more composed of Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other supporters in the class include John Larch and John Russell. Even in an already dangerously dangerous operation there are Signorina Ralli and a stubborn Mexican Teniente (Gabriela Tinti) whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba took up office on its own. The danger multiplies when Gordon's brother, an early spy, is captured and tortured to death while watching ... and decides to kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon, when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a normal type of army, is one of the most electrifying visual and scenic results in the history of cinema; the penetration of the fortress of Cordoba, the revelations discovered there, and the actions that win the mission team a chance of victory - or almost victory - are presented impeccably. This is a beautiful color adventure film, with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, sets and music by Elmer Bernstein. Stephen Kandel's script is probably the best ever for a feature film. This is probably the most underrated western of the moment, but I have always appreciated his heroes as a result: having workers in difficulty. But as Peppard reminds his group on his way home, "The trouble of being a" hero "- is the day after." To find out why he says so, you'll have to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
