The Squire of Gothos is one of the "silliest" episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining. The entertainment factor is, in general, fueled by the stalemate between William Shatner and the hilarious guest star of the episode, William Campbell. <br /> <br /> During an unspecified routine mission, Sulu suddenly vanishes and Kirk follows shortly thereafter. Spock immediately starts looking for his missing colleagues (and, even if he hates to admit it, his friends), while the two crew members have to deal with the mysterious, all-powerful and flamboyant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed Squire of Gothos, a being capable of creating or destroying everything he wants through the pure power of his mind. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes (honestly, there are science fiction shows that did not include at least one God-like character), but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the acclaimed use of the exaggerated humor script, all transmitted through Campbell's deliberately camp performance: his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a spoiled child in an adult's body, while his curiosity fueled by ignorance for the human race ( his knowledge is rather limited) probably served as an inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he invented the Q character for the Next Generation pilot, about twenty years after this episode aired. <br /> <br /> In short, the key to appreciating The Squire of Gothos is this: "fool" is not necessarily equal to "bad".
