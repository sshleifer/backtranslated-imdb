THE LARGEST GAME THAT IS EVER PLAYED (TGGEP, 2005) is an incredibly stimulating and contagious underdog film that never (really) turns into ignorance or abuse. Yes, it takes a lot of freedom, like most Hollywood movies, but those freedoms are forgiven because they actually increase the enjoyment of the film, it doesn't take anything away. Indeed, there are many sincere moments in it. You can really say it's a "Rocky" movie since the beginning of the movie, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), It is expertly done and immensely watchable! <br /> <br /> TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, cockiness and class by the future superstar Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer of a family of Irish-French immigrants who lives in Brookline, MA, in the early 1900s. Ouimet qualified to play in the 1913 US Open. Included in its competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with Stephen Dillane's immense class, dignity and ferocity). Ironically, Vardon is the second underdog in this film! The film begins in 1870 in Scotland, where land developers tell the young man that they are building a golf course in his home and that golf is a game not for players like him. Francis suffers some of the same prejudices as a boy in the early 1900s Brookline. The stories converge at the 1913 Open. What is ironic is that, even as an adult and from many important champions, Vardon is still an outcast in British society because of his education. Francis learned a lot about golf by reading Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is his growing idol. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they met in Boston in 1900 after Vardon, who won that year's Open, was on tour when Francis had only 7. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, the participants in the 1913 Open include Vardon's friend and champion, the British Ted Ray (rowdy Stephen Marcus) and the two-time unscrupulous volleyball champion, John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men. <br /> <br /> The redhead Marnie McPhail is captivating and serene while the Irish mother and Francis Elias Koteas support veteran give a severe, reserved, silent performance like her French father. Additionally, the young and unlucky Josh Flitter (like Francis's ten-year-old caddy, Eddie), almost alone, steals the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Paxton throws up a lot of modern details, such as the zoom of special effects - in the shots to show the positioning of the players' board and the CGI for a lot of golf shots to keep the movie exciting and a lively rhythm so as not to make the film too much of a period piece. But the film still convinces us of a specific time and place. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is that while Rocky-like, everything is based on a true story! So the ending is satisfying on so many levels. A funny movie on the golf set in the early 1900s ... Wow!
