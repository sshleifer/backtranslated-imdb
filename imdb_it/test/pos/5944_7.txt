If you're going to parody James Bond, it's a brilliant idea to find a man who looks like BOTH Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, so take a step forward with Jean Dujardin who perfectly captures Connery's grin that masquerades as a smile plus the car - illusion of Rossiter's thought he is sweet Dujardin interprets him as a Clouseau who can maintain his karate skills. The plot has him looking for Our Man In Schtook which has mysteriously disappeared and includes such improbabilities as a Nazi cell hidden inside a pyramid. If there is a discordant note is the protagonist, Berenice Bejo, who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but just right - by Aure Atika. It's good for a vision but that's all.
