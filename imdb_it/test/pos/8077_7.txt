So forgive the game scene * really * blades, cardboard background and studio like stadium. For this part I should give the film 5 instead of 7, but read on ... <br /> <br /> From the premise to the plot there are many similarities with "The Replacements". Some argue that this film is a rip-off of "The Replacements", while others say that this script wrote before it. <br /> <br /> Both films require a sort of "suspension of disbelief on the basic premise, and this is particularly difficult for" Second String "as it has the NFL licensing team and the whole story behind it seems Too disgusting for some people, and not to mention "Second String" Bills has to pass the big scores again and again, with the limited budget to shoot the game scene, this also makes it look very bad. <br /> <br / > In "Substitutions", the premise and the league are fiction, but you know what happens in real life. I think it's easier to accept the fantasy story and set it with a real event ("OH yes, this has happened before!", Rather than real setting / background with imaginary scenery ("There is no way that Bill can win a Superbowl!"; Some scenes were actually shot in the pre-season game of the Raven games, real stadium, real audience and some shooting angle at the same NFL. <br /> <br /> But let's say that both films were released the same day, and we cancel the budget factor (so forgotten ive the play play action scene): Overall, I like "Second String" on "Replacements", not by much, but I like it better. <br /> <br /> Has a "relatively better" character development. In "Substitutions", Keanu's character is too "out of sync with the world", and all he cares about is, take a girl? In Second String we see the QB struggle to get the job back and face his past with the coach. Or the fumble problem. This "keep the ball all day" solution is obviously not new, but we see a progression in solving it. <br /> <br /> What do you think of these magic tricks? I think it's "relatively realistic" compared to "Substitutions". The "Dan Marino" is like a fake knee passing, a flicker, a wild cat full of life, all true, except that sometimes it seems a bit too easy. But for me it is better than the central rebound of "Replacement" and run for 50 yards call, or as a field goal of 60 yards is too easy. OH BTW, I'm glad they didn't force the TE kicker to make his shot .... <br /> <br /> Obviously --- if you review this film on other football films objectively, that could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie. But some say this is the worst football movie? Try "The Comebacks".
