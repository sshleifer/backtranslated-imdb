This completely forgotten slasher film is one of the best horror movies ever made. Very dark sometimes reminds me of a famous little thriller "Deliverance". Director Jeff Lieberman creates a terrifying atmosphere of terror and despair. All the actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable. So if you're looking for something creepy, try to find this little treasure. My personal vote: 10 out of 10.PS This is even more chilling than "Halloween".
