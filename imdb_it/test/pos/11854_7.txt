This independent film deserves a look thanks to the enormous talent of its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr. Wolodarsky has directed the young cast and must be praised for this effort. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is a warning about the danger of wanting something that cannot be had. What is the story of Alice and Ed. After living together for a while, Alice suddenly becomes restless because she imagines she has no experience in the area of ​​sex. The relationship between Alice and Ed, while not an example of ideal happiness, is a convenient way to share their lives with one another. That is, until the moment Alice and Claire, his sister, come across a sexual encounter from another couple who has no idea of ​​being watched. <br /> <br /> This incident makes Alice re-evaluate her sex life with Ed; she finds that she lacks substance. When he proposes to "see other people", Ed is shocked, to put it mildly, but not wanting to contradict Alice, decides to go ahead. What happens next is that both Alice and Ed enter a world unknown to them. The people they meet in the end are not worth it. Unfortunately, they realized that in the end they were made for each other. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing to see the wonderful Julianne Nicholson, who liked us in another independent film, "Tully". Mrs. Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLaine; she projects such a luminous quality on her that it is difficult to look away from her whenever she is in a scene. This young actress proves to be an expert performer that gets better with every new appearance. Basically, she brings the movie. His Alice is a contrasting study. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate in pleasing Ed because of her inexperience. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr, it's an excellent pair for Mrs. Nicholson. Both work miracles together. His Ed is perfectly credible. We met people like him. In himself, he is a good person, who suddenly finds himself in a situation that he did not request, however, he goes on only to find out that he is too honest and uncut for a lifetime of free sex with available women who have no problems a fall in the hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is wonderful. Lauren Graham does an extraordinary job as Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also as wonderful as Carl, the nerd friend, who finally finds satisfaction when he meets Penelope, a single mother. Like Penelope, Helen Slater, makes a very happy one, even if of a brief appearance in the film. <br /> <br /> The director is enormously gifted, who will undoubtedly go to the seats because he proves to be suitable for the job.
