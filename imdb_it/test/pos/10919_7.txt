In & Out was a fun comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The thought that Kevin Kline was gay was very funny. If I were him, I will hate to say that I'm gay at his wedding with his family, his friends and his wife. Very rarely would it ever happen. I also liked when he was dancing when the voice on the radio spoke to him. I would say that In & Out was a stupid comedy with lots of laughs and laughter. This is a recommended comedy and Kevin Kline had a great performance as a gay. Believe me, you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
