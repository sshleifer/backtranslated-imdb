Honestly wonderful. Recommended by a friend who knew that I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of storytelling - how the characters moved from hope and ideals of value through shock, fear, disintegration, despair and total annihilation. A first-class anti-war film that must have aroused much enthusiasm in Germany. It is not a moment of pride for anyone and the study of a lost generation. This film was excellent in conveying the removal of command from ground troops and in beating the total futility of trying to control the wilderness and the Russian psyche. If I didn't know, I would have thought it was a Russian film, it was so fatalistic. What an end without compromise. A pity.
