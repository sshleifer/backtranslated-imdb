"Fire" by Deepa Mehta is innovative, bold and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the condition of women of conservative and middle-class Indian families, this is a film that no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underestimating their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's soundtrack and together they create wonderful sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look at each other as a support. This film does not talk about lesbianism as many have branded it. Lesbianism is only part of the film. It is a pity that many people tend to write the film calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its true meaning.
