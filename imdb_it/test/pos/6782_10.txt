This game is an action / adventure with combat. There are quite long periods without fighting but other times, you have to get rid of various types of monsters. Monsters are not like those you would see in real life and should be eliminated to continue your search. The whole game is a search. You play Adam Randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him. The game is from the mid-90s and must be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and was able to play pretty well. The graphics are not as good as some games even of the time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes seem quite blocked, but others seem messy, but don't let the game put you off. The game is very imaginative, it's long and can blow you up when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. Not for kids who probably wouldn't be interested anyway, but more than 13 or 14 might like this game. It's a combination of horror, mystery, adventure, and fighting. I thought it was a great game. He had to find now. maybe Ebay. But remember that it's a DOS game and you couldn't play it on today's fastest computers. it would be difficult to play on fast computers unless you use Dosbox. Oh, acting is also very good.
