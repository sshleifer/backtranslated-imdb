I love this movie and I've seen it many times. I recorded it roughly in 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is very worn out now and I would like a new copy of it. I emailed the movie Four to ask them to show it again because it was never available on video and as far as I know it hasn't been repeated since the 1980s. I have not received an answer and it has not yet been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. It's fun, sad, scary, exciting and brings you back to school. It is extremely stimulating and will catch you from beginning to end. The scene in the shower is particularly horrible. Also I can't hear the song Badge from Cream and I don't think about this movie. This film deserves to be seen by a much wider audience as it is superb. Channel Four, please, show again or publish on Video or DVD.
