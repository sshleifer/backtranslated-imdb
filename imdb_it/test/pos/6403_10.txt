This series, idealized and fictional, has the strangeness, the sultriness and goodness that comes from living on an island. <br /> <br /> I lived in the midst of Hawaii for a few years and found some hilarious, eccentric and funny people in some remote (not tourist) areas. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the replicas of this series, I like to compare my memories of experiences in out-of-road parts of Hawaii with recollected and romanticized memories in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not television reality. I hate reality television. <br /> <br /> It's from the era when people were still writing creative TV series. Give me a "young writer" who is inspired by "spray angels, magicians in palms and elves in shells" every day.
