I have been interested in this film for a long time, especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the DVD edition; however, I continued to postpone its purchase due to the excessive price and the total lack of relevant supplements. When it went out of print earlier this year, I eventually gave up, but the entire order (which included a number of other highly desirable titles) was lost during transport! fortunately, the DVD has been reissued at bargain prices - and I'm sure glad I picked it up! <br /> <br /> However, this is a strange film, and a real sleeper: initially a confusing but striking occult story that manages to hit bullseye both for its threatening atmosphere and for the intrinsic restlessness of the alleys claims - above. A small cast responds perfectly to a concise, engaging and intelligent script: the Strother Martin host, in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with its nuanced performances as a city doctor / head of the coven witch; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both also produced the film!) Offer solid support like the absurd sheriff and his assistant comic aficionado. <br /> <br /> The plot combines elements of various previous films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural, and not just the obvious titles: the fact that the city is held back by a spell that cannot be identified at first, for example, it immediately recalls the similar affliction of a specific bourgeois family in the sublime surreal of Luis Bunuel L'ANGELO ESTERMINANTE (1962)! the corner of the "possessed children" was borrowed, perhaps, from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960); there have been many films - especially of a recent harvest - in which the satanic rituals of a coven of witches are shown: from THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960) to THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (1968) but, since the acts themselves they play in modern-day America (even if in a remote environment) and revolve around old witches (in search of a 'renaissance'), the film they remember most of all is ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968). <br /> <br /> The occult scenes (accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadow of the shadow of the garishly decorated house where diabolical events take place) are presented in a very practical way to make them shocking and extremely effective - in particular the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car (!), the fury of a devil-doll (a concept that has been killed over the years but, here, raises an undeniable frisson) , a surreal dream sequence (set in the ice chamber where all the victims are kept, since they can't be buried!), a sequence in which witches attack a doubtful member of the coven, a beheading committed by a medieval knight on horseback (!) and the long final of "mass black" (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child who will take control, all dressed in red - except for a martyr dressed in black who presides over the ceremony) that culminates in mass ritual suicide! <br /> <br /> The film also has the courage to offer an unexpected "curtain"; it is so refreshing to come across a title (albeit with a low-cost production) from a major Hollywood studio, Columbia, which tries to go so completely against grain (as, I said, the film is rather strange - also extending to the assembly and the score)! It is also strange that an offer of this kind - and cinema - horror is due to a television director more often associated with westerns and other familiar dishes! By the way, the same theme was treated almost simultaneously with the umpteenth collaboration of Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT (1972, which Lee himself produced!) - a film that I lost madly about 20 years ago when it was shown on local TV, and that has been MIA since then !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review of THE FRATERNITY OF Satan will certainly contain spoilers but, therefore, the synopsis and the works of art on the cover of the DVD manage to give everything away anyway!
