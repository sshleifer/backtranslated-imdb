Asterix and the Vikings is the first asterix animated film in over 12 years since 1994 "Asterix conquers America". It also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterix animation, which makes the story largely fun a lot more breathtaking to see. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this film is vividly rendered in bright cheerful hues closely adhering to the color combinations of the comics on which it was based. The characters' drawings are also relatively close to comics, for better or for worse, preserving the simple but unique appearance of the characters. Being simple in terms of character design, this allows you to spend more time and effort on real animation, overcoming many other big screen theatrical animation films. The movements of the characters are very fluid and possess a quality that seems far beyond what a modest budget usually produces; there is always something touching in every scene and no evidence of the usual shortcuts of animation to cut costs. 3D computer images are perfectly incorporated with traditional 2D art. If anything, the style of shading makes 3D elements more like traditional comic paintings than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The plot takes many of its elements from the comic "Asterix and the Normans", and this is where its main flaw lies. As an adaptation of the said comic, "Asterix and the Vikings" takes too many liberties with its starting material. Long-time comics fans will undoubtedly find much dislike of the film's history and its lack of adherence to the source. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, you can see this story as a really fun thing if taken alone without comparing it to its source material. The very comical and well-written lines accompany the cheerful script. The funniest parts were the numerous references and jibes of pop culture in modern life in the 21st century. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are falsified with great effectiveness. Excellent chemistry and acting from the cast (I watched it in English, by the way) although a couple of voices like Cacofonix I found it really irritating (but I guess it's all part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there is something to criticize about the story, it is the lack of "asterisk". This story seems to be more like Justforkix's story of adolescent romanticism and "coming of age" with Asterix and Obelix simply playing secondary roles. This gives a fairly large sense of staleness since most of the elements of the story are the usual basis points of these teen movies. Sometimes derivatives and clich√©s, only the witty comedy and the traditional elements of "Astrix" (the Romans, the pirates, etc.) manage to save this film from falling into mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Although not the best. Asterix's animated film library is certainly one of the most fun, the best dramatized and the most beautiful animated. DVD seems a bit hard to find even though ????????
