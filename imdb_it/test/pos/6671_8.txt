* Can be spoiler * Without a doubt one of the best dramas if not the best of the kind I've ever seen. Is Prot is an alien or just a crazy fool? This is the question you must be asking yourself throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is simply fantastic, as is Jeff Bridges. You can't beat this type of acting, plus a little humor at times. Some of Kevin Spaceys' actions in this film are very funny. When he was up in the tree, for example, and when he spoke with the "queen" mental patient, the way he hid half his face around the wall and simply stared at it. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, from the beginning you will be passionate, and if you really love drama you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> A good 85%.
