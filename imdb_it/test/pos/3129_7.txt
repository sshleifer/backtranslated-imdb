although I liked this Western, I must say, it is not one of my favorite John Ford Westerns. For me, all that is missing is a certain something that most of his other films (the ones I saw anyway) have, is not something tangible. In any case, the core of the story concerns a train of Mormon tanks that is used by a band of outlaws as a hideout from a band of pursuers. Floy employs many of his regulars here. There are some interesting characters, some nice scenarios, some action, excitement. All this adds up to an unforgettable experience. It is certainly not boring. Solo is not up to the usual John Ford standard. For me, Wagon Master is a 7/10
