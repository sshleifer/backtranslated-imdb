Chick Flick? Sure .... done before? Many times .... Predictable? Yes ..... Is it worth watching? You bet! I was very pleased with the portrait of Sarandon and Portman of series characters in a familiar plot. I'm a big fan of mother and daughter stories. What makes the difference between good and weak ones is performance and character development. Although this is not the BEST of its kind, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the credible characters and the acting was superior.
