I watch this movie at the beginning of each summer and it never ceases to amuse me. Here the lines are packed close to each line of dialogue, giving you more hits than the Simpson episode. Some jokes fall flat or will only cause a slight chuckle, but others will let you roll and then there will be those that remain in your brain ... "The audience is now deaf." <br /> <br /> the video knows that it is a video and does not claim to be anything else. It is easy to sit down and let the bombardment of humor begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture and ironic comedies ensures that there is something for everyone. I was in the sixth year when I saw this video for the first time, and I must admit that I still find it exhilarating now that I started college. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch over the summer, much in the way you might look at "It's a wonderful life" at Christmas or "Ten Commandments" at Easter / Easter. More than that, it's simply fun to die for.
