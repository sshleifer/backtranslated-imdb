Are beach resorts the sad and sad places that are always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this film, together with the almost contemporary "Do not Look Now" portrays Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more carefree approach, see "Just Married" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). I've never been to Venice, I can't say for sure, but it's perfect for this sober but sumptuous show by Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having seen the film, I would now like to be able to read the Thomas Mann novella on which it is based (which also inspired a work by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I don't know the background and the film has little in terms of plot or exposure, I remain uncertain about Aschenbach's (Dirk Bogarde) obsession with the young Tadzio. Is he a homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his desire for beautiful youth something more innocent? Maybe Tadzio reminds him of what could have been and now he knows he never will be. Those who complain about the slowness of this film should stick to car accidents and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it is not particularly long, and it moves at a slow but slow pace. The film benefits from the charming music of Gustave Mahler, on which the character of Aschenbach is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance, and the film is honored by the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of the great beauties of Italy, as the mother of Tadzio.
