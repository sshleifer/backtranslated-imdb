This must be the stupidest film I've ever seen and therefore deserves a special award. OK, so it starts pretty well, logical, humorous and then quickly changes to complete and pronounce uh f @ rt, @ ss, f√∂ck stupidity that makes sense. The strange thing is that I barely laughed, although I suppose it should be fun, with a very serious message. After a moment of reflection, because I didn't laugh, the answer was clear enough ... this film is much more realistic than I would like it to be. So it's extremely stupid, but very wise if the goal was to reach people who are not "blessed" with a lot of neurons, synapses and electrolytes (eh, electrolytes?). This film could actually be understood at some level by a large audience! <br /> <br /> Although they probably laugh. <br /> <br /> Ah well, nice try ... <br /> <br /> Now I'm editing (adding a) my comment, because I've read some of the other comments. First I noticed that some people see racism in this film. Well, that never occurred to me when I looked at him. However, I can imagine if you are looking from that perspective, you will see some. We could of course discuss the link between intelligence and race, but I think this is not the right place to do it. I wonder, if we were to evaluate the Huxtable family here, would you complain that they are all black? I don't think so, but I think you could ... (apart from that, from the 2 wisest people in the world, half, the woman, doesn't seem entirely Indo-European, so 'what's the problem?') > <br /> Secondly, the film gets very mixed votes; from 1 to 10 and all the rest, but there is a lot of polarization, which means that the film does its job very well! It stimulates people, makes them want to talk about it and judge them. This means that it is a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes it becomes very predictable and boring, yet you continue to watch this total shit. I guess you keep hoping it's not like that. Or maybe it's our sick way of looking at terrible accidents. Well, that's for sure.
