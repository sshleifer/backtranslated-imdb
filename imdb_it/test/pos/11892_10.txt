We have just finished the screening of El Padrino in Australia. A phenomenal film. We look forward to seeing many more Chapa films in the future. It was wonderful to see a film so well thought out with such suspense and a story that it will remain an instant classic. Seeing a high quality film outlines Chapa's true potential and his skill as a writer, actor, director and director. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant interpretation of "blood in and blood out" and has now demonstrated to everyone who has seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with genuine artistic control. With his lead role, Kilo Vasquez is a perfect combination of Milo Velka of "Blood in Blood Out" and Al Pacino of "Scarface", the film will do wonders for us here in Australia.
