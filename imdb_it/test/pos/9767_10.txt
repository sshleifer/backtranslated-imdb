I remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when the end ended. Over the years since then, I have tried to find out if I could get a copy on both videos or on d.v.d., without result. However, I was happy to find this website with the details of it, only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase, that the available videos will not be played on English recorders! This production was so wonderful, absolutely accurate with Nevil Shute's novel, which brought the plot to the end of the war, with Joe and Jean's next life - absolutely wonderful - and I just wish I could see it again, since then it's original projection, there were no replicas on British television.
