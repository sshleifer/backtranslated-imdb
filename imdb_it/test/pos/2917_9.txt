After reading all the comments on this film, I am still amazed by Fox's reluctance to publish a full-screen restored version on DVD. Yes, the story may be a little sketchy and certainly not as powerful as the book, but it was Fox's second film made in Real Cinemascope and only production values ​​deserve restoration and distribution. I saw this movie in second grade and it triggered my life-long interest in everything that is Egyptian, culminating with my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! The power of a child's imagination is incredible, eh? In high school I read the book and made a promise for one day to make that dream trip. Now, this film was made in the "old school" style, which means that the Egyptians were interpreted by Englishmen with pink skin and blue eyes. However, has anyone seen the current HBO series "ROME"? Everything old is old again. One cannot imagine why today we continue to cast actors entrenched as Mayfair aristocrats in the Roman resistance. Not an actor on ROME could pass for an ancient Italian. That being said, the period of AMARNA in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. This film is immensely attractive (to borrow a word from NEFER) for its historical information (BEER! BRAIN SURGERY! IRON!) And its stunning cinematography and scoring. I have a terrible Taiwanese DVD version that I watch again and again praying that one day a restored widescreen version will be available. For anyone interested in this topic I highly recommend the historical novel "A God against the gods" by the author of Notices and Consents. If any of you movie fans out there know how to contact Fox to encourage them, please let me know!
