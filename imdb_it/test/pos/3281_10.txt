Trey's favorite from the first season series 10 and also one of my personal favorites, Manbearpig presents Al Gore's adventure before starting global warming and before the movie, it was a similar adventure certainly, Al Gore also tried to know the world about something that can change the Earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to know everyone about Manbearpig and kill him! Al Gore here is more than amusing, all those who see him sorry for him and yes he can be childish, making tantrums because no one believes him but he's just a fucking demented bastard. Basically four children are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but they certainly don't have this in his mind, there's no room for any other subject, it's just Manbearpig what concerns Al Gore. Those four kids are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four guys were just playing in the game of Al Gore without ever imagining that Gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene - "they are just children, damn Manbearpig"). So in this part we have on one side all the stuff with the rescue team that also felt sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a small but extremely hilarious episode of Cartman and there are no surprises of Cartman's attitude after finding a darling inside the cave, surely all the stuff with this treasure is fantastic and it's fantastic because you'll see a Cartman sick in both directions, he's really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end Al Gore killed Manbearpig! This character is awesome and I'm cereal! Fantastic fun in this highly reusable episode. 10 out of 10
