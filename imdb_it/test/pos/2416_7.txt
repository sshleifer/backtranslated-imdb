This film was very different from the previous films and I had to ask myself "Where is Ralph Macchio?" he may have been involved in the plot somewhere like Myiagi's old friend who teaches Julie what he already knows, then Myiagi can come and add more! Macchio could have been the love interest for Julie in this movie! It does not matter! <br /> <br /> Seriously, I liked this movie because it meant teaching a girl how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different from Daniel's. Julie is much wilder than Daniel and needs taming, which Myiagi finds very demanding; she is a rather troubled girl and a rude, hateful brat! <br /> <br /> It was very satisfying to see Julie's transformation as she warms up with Myiagi and to understand more about Karate and her life in general. We can all learn one or two things from Myiagi's jokes!
