I probably liked a little more of Terror by Night, although not enough to give him the extra *. The beginning is simply brilliant, as we look at the Nazi agents who plan to get their hands on a new bomb and its inventor in a small Swiss village, only to be thwarted by a disguised Holmes who animates the scientist in London. Once there, he does everything possible to prevent the scientist from falling into human hands behind everything - not Hitler, but worse: the arch-enemy Moriarty of Holmes. Obviously the scientist disappears, leaving an enticing coded note, and Holmes goes in pursuit, once again disguised. A climax in Moriarty's den is appropriately exciting, and we can imagine that everything ends well, right? A somewhat exaggerated patriotic message as the credits come out. Now that I think about it, the beautiful sense of place, despite the obvious scenes, the use of Rathbone's disguise and the way the plot is crammed in just over an hour - what the heck do you get that extra * and it's the my favorite of the 5 Rathbone / Bruce films I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Watched on DVD, part of the "50 Mystery Classics" set by Mill Creek Entertainment. Many of the transfers on these boxes of el cheapo are of very poor quality, but Holmes fans note that the Rathbone / Bruce films (there are 4 on this set) are all quite watchable and reasonably sharp.
