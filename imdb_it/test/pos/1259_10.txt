This is a fantastic movie! If you haven't seen it yet, you should do it damn well. Of course, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as the wrestler DDP would say; It's not a bad thing ... it's a good thing! Everything about this film is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. It is an endless series of laughs to the end, nostalgia for the sequel, in which the mummy fights fighting with women. So, I give him ten stars. Unless you are one of those "discriminating" and "smart" tasteful people who only like high-end "high quality" movies, I recommend this absolutely monkeydellic movie!
