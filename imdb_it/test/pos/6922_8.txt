Look how Anglo-Irish I assure you that this reviewer is anything but Bias. But I assure you that this is an Irish film - and not English as the last comment seems to suggest. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and also directed by Conor McPherson, both Irish. The cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Michael Gambon was also born in Ireland - I remember he joked about it in an interview on this film. <br /> <br /> Michael Cane was obviously introduced to increase box office receipts abroad. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie, I just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment! <br /> <br /> Now on with the review - I loved Dylan Moran, I've always been a fan of him, he and Michael Cane have formed a surprisingly good double act. It was nice to see that Morans has an actor role while playing several characters made up during the film. I would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy, as it represents a fresh, bizarre and inventive turn in Irish feature films. I laughed a lot. What more could you ask for?
