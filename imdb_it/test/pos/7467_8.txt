I had the pleasure of seeing these two chairs by (one of?) Executive producer at the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different moments than we did. <br /> <br /> in Atlantic Canada, the film is about three teenage girls who, in one of their last summers of their youth, devote a great deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30-year-old man, despite many protests. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth being a watch, but the humor was very different from the one in which I live (male 18-25), so I shook my head at the character's antics rather than laughing. Despite this, the story is strong enough to keep the fun going, making it fun, without so much laughing.
