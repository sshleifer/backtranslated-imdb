1 we suspend the conviction for a moment and stop pretending that we could, we could or should know "how it is" or "should be" there in space. Human knowledge in that area is probably primitive, since the maps of the Middle Ages are compared to today's satellite maps, so we have no idea at all. 2 considering that this is "just" a BBC TV documentation simulation, it gets much better than many big Hollywood hits, and this is simply amazing. 3 all in all, a show that deserves to be seen while portraying the improved and fictionalized version of CGI of what we know of the solar system up to here. 4 probably invent and CGI: all the rest is the only way to make it appealing to a large audience. Have you ever watched clips from real space missions and REAL space probes? The quality is generally medium to poor and the comparison should be between the examination of a chest x-ray (and what it tells of the human body) and compare it to a cyborg film in CGI-published ... what would be the most fun? Yet the chest radiograph is real, while the cyborg flick is only fictitious SFX. 5 actors do a good job. No one will tell my grandchildren, but it is very fair that this is a simulation of the BBC documentation.
