People watch movies for a number of different reasons. This film has no big budget, no special effects, no car chases and no explosions. In reality reality doesn't have much of these either. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real film about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and which in turn is makes order out of chaos. I am not willing to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I am neither an expert nor use my whole mind. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie for the characters. It is full of a whole cast of wonderful and extravagant people. <br /> <br /> In the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland superbly stages the life of Detective Michael Hayden and continues to develop the character throughout the film. Excellent acting, very credible. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny could not have been casted better and the relationship between his "Harvey" and Kiefer's "Mickey" exalts the opposition of their characters. <br /> <br /> I really liked the angry mistress, "Mrs Ramsay", I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There is a guest more than these wonderful characters but space is limited here, so watch the movie and enjoy it
