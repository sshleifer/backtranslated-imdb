"Chips" is an excellent blend of music, light comedy and drama with a perfect performance for the image of Peter O 'Toole and a romantic and effortless performance by Petula Clark. O 'Toole is able to show the shy and non-communicative teacher who wants so much to be loved by his students and is able to express his love only when he married Katherine (Clark). She brings him the world "How many flowers" and he has changed forever. He became the beloved headmaster of Brookfield through tragedy, but he knows he could have achieved his goal only through the love of Katherine. The songs (except for the Music hall number) are all "thought-songs" that come from the emotions and thoughts of the character and, the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - "Walk through the World with Me" and "Me and you ". O'Toole's best moment is the final speech he gives to the students (it was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher, we wonder about what the "book" learning has ever gone through - but, as Chips says, we taught them how to behave with one another and that's what really matters. Beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by John Williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" the boys sing their school song. In the end, Chips realizes he can do it - but only because Catherine was there.
