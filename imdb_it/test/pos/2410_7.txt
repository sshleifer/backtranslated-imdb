After a very disappointing 3 part, I was wondering if I should have been worried about The Next Karate Kid, as I saw why this saga wouldn't go on, I still liked The Next Karate Kid most of the second and the third Karate Kid movie. While there are some very unrealistic moments and situations, it was a lot of fun and the story is captivating and warm. <br /> <br /> Hilary Swank, this girl has come far or what? She plays a rebellious girl who lost her parents to a car accident and when Miaugi is a sort of "babysitter" for her, she realizes she has karate skills. It offers you more lessons if you become more serious in life. Now, of course, there is the guy you like and the nasty bullies who are very similar to the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend this. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
