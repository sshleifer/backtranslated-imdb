Before seeing this film I heard a lot of praise and many exclamations about how "awful" it was. Don't take any credit from this movie, I think it wasn't all so horrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people living in the dark side of the city. And one good at portraying the point. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful acting here and a well thought out manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a famous writer in the Finnish film scene and is the best in what comes to describe contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the only author of this film, but I would dare say he is still the main writer. I was wrong) . <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, except Jasper Pääkkönen (the pseudo-main character, who I think should have stayed in the soap opera scene), and the sets, cuts and even sounds are very well facts and give a great atmosphere to this film. <br /> <br /> This film is a story of sad and freely interconnected fates that according to the famous song of a famous Finnish group (Tuhansien of Eppu Normaali) Murheellisten Laulujen Maa ", which very roughly translated into" Paha Maa ") in all Finnish society it leads to a sad, obscure end accompanied by alcohol, loneliness and bad choices, and it is the side of Finnish daily life of which about 80% of the population has no awareness, unless films are made like this.
