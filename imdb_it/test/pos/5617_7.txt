A brilliant boy interested in "serious" music (certainly an endangered breed - who will play the violin when no one can play the violin? "- could find this interesting fiction about street kids and the great stars of music. In effect the greatest violinist of his generation and the film gives him a rare chance on the screen to show his technique. Children, particularly Gene Reynolds, are fine and, all in all, the image is a good example of a family of Top-notch study in the late 1930s. It didn't reach the top of the big '39 list, but it's a nice way for a smart family to spend a rainy afternoon with AMC or the Video Store - good luck to Blockbuster !!!
