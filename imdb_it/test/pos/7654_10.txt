This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Roma communities woven together by music. It is very much the film of a musician, due to the scarcity of spoken dialogues - and what dialogue there is, is not important for the structure of the narrative. Some might expect a National Geographic tale of "costumes, clothes and music" or a plot that orbits some central character - don't look for that one here. <br /> <br /> This is because he paints a portrait of a family of peoples, rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is the story through space (from India to Andalusia) and / or / time (we can't say it) of a people. No need for narration. You have the feeling of a joyful people, strongly linked to small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in some parts, to their rejection by society in general. <br /> <br /> So it's a paean for Roma culture, very well shot, with a wide spectrum of Roma music, and a sting in the tail which is the oppression that these people have faced and still face.
