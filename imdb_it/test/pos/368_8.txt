It has aged really well - still thrilling and full of suspense today. Definitely one of Hitch's best films. Beautifully filmed, with a great premise for the suspense, the sex appeal offered by the beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the big premise, you feel like you should see it until the end. If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubt his Master of Suspense title, I recommend this nice film as an antidote. 5 out of 5.
