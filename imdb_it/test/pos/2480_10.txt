First of all, the entire script is largely improvised, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are looking at is a real documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were specifically chosen to represent their true alliances and political backgrounds. The hippie portraits are true hippies, government officials (though not necessarily in the government itself) are at least actually substantial conservatives within the system, and many of the policemen are real policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms assigned by Watkins, eventually come to a violent leader where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member has actually been hit. (We hear him scream "Cut! Cut!" In the background.) <br /> <br /> An INCREDIBLE movie even though American critics have been pretty tough on their reviews, one actually reported that it was the "most offensive "she had never seen. This is not entirely unexpected, as the revelation of this oppressive American communist mentality during this era would certainly have caused some cages to waver. This pseudo-documentary certainly requires an open mind, although if you're seriously looking for an intensely accurate portrait of the culture of the 1960s, this would be THE movie to watch.
