When Accepted's trailer came out, many people started getting excited to see it ... really excited. Who could blame them, it seemed fun. But this is exactly the thing. People have come into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted is not the kind of film destined to be a good movie. It is meant to be a film that appeals to its audience without much effort. That said, for those of you who expected a great movie, you need to think about what could be done with a comedy like this. Think about it, and you'll really like the movie (because you'll get rid of your idea that the movie will be fantastic). LOWER LINE: watch the movie and have fun, but don't look for anything innovative.
