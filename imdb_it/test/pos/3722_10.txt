I'm a longtime fan of Luc Besson's work, and since I met his name, I've also been looking for this film. I've been trying to find this movie in all of California for over four years. Last summer I took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to see at least this film. In short, I bought it and saw it in France! I was astonished, it completely made my journey and I finally felt the content of seeing Luc Besson's first work. character development absolutely amazing, very inspiring, great acting and the definitive conceptual film. if you are a concept movie enthusiast, this is one of the most original and classic. I feel like it's a rare pleasure to see a film like this, its risky, its unorthodox, and in the end its only real one. if you are a fan of Luc Besson, it is a must see, however, whether you are a Besson fan or not, it is certainly an important work, in general a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema.
