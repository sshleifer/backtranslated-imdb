Ah, how beautiful it is to see a vision of 18th century England complete with mud, smallpox and gallows ... and accompanied by a delightful techno soundtrack. This is the story of the trampled bandit Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Gentleman - fell on the tough captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), and how they unite and rob aristo pigs. Plunkett is crazy, but MaCleane is too polite for this, and thus becomes "the bandit gentleman". He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), (which to be honest is the only weak part of all shebang) and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are fantastic. Beautiful, colorful, historically beautiful fine tog. Alan Cummings gets all the best weaves and the best jokes of Lord Rochester, showing off an eyebrow piercing not of the eighteenth century. The music moves between the glorious dive choruses and the bass-charged techno, which does not jarr as you think it should do in a historical film. The screenplay is rapidly moving and full of modern dialectics; Merchant Ivory, this is not. There are hilarious parts, disgusting parts, parts sitting on the edge of your chair and your nibble-nails, but the whole thing snorts and is wonderfully fun in everything. This is rodent stuff in the cinema. Unmissable.
