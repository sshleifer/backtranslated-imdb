In this unlikely love triangle, set in 19th-century Italy, "Beauty and the Beast" is turned upside down and then some: Giorgio, an army officer and the very image of male beauty, is transferred away from his (married) lover of Clara and sent to a small garrison somewhere in Piedmont. There - initially much to his horror ?? Fosca, the grotesquely ugly cousin of his commander, develops an obsessive love for him. She suffers from her passionate and demanding displays of affection out of pity and concern for her health (she is seriously ill), but does she become more and more fascinated by her? up to the dramatic ending ?? <br /> <br /> Don't miss this truly unusual love story, however distorted it may seem. Valeria d'Obici, who deservedly won a price for her portrait of Fosca, is as alarming as she is touching. Buy the video, read the book, go see the musical!
