Everyone wants Duvall and Jones to come back, come on! Viewers say things like that, Zahn and Urban aren't that deep ... Puhlease! Were you so deep when you were young? This is the point: they have a lot to learn. Zahn and Urban show off the superficial innocence with which they were directed to act and with the superb commitment to preserve the nuances of Duvall and Jones in the characters. Zahn is perfectly perfect as the first Gus, and Urban is subtly perfect as the first Woodrow. What a bold move it must have been for them to take such a position in the entertainment industry. They must have known that they would bring down all those who were not really the original loved ones, yet they clearly made the maximum effort. I gave a 7 because the assembly was uneven in some places and the time lines were approximate, but the acting was a joy to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely fantastic. Another thing: I expect the public to accept more the mysticism implicit in the appearances of a jaguar and a blue and golden macaw, if more efforts were put into the way they appear and are so simply accepted by the characters.
