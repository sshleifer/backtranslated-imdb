It was obvious until the end credits that this film was made in 1989, since all the elements of its production were made to look like the 60s: acting, characterizations, sets and props all had a aesthetics of an earlier time. /> <br /> The film opens at the moments before the fall of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and how this tragic accident affects only one family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but still emotional and effective, the representations of the immediate consequences of the bomb are rather horrific. Family members become unrecognizable with one another, others resemble zombies as they wander through untidy and traumatized streets. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the precipitations that fell shortly after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash, and in which Yasuko is captured. Yasuko's rumors in Hiroshima at the time of the attack hit his marriage prospects and later it was learned that black rain is actually causing illness. The film is not just about the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese, but the social and psychological damage that has been caused. <br /> <br /> I found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. While the film is mainly concerned with the pain experienced by a family, the delicate political message of the film is relevant today and probably for all times: wars have terrible consequences and should not be undertaken unless absolutely necessary. It is said that history repeats itself and the current leaders of the "Coalition of the Willing" have learned nothing. While the atomic war has not re-emerged since 1945, other deadly side effects have. This film is compelling.
