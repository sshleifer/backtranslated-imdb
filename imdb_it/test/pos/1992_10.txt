"EXistenZ" by David Cronenberg is a well-designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is connected to technology that can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanic. The film upsets the public with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic and metabolic technology. In this context, technology is able to be part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality game of "eXistenZ", the real world looks like a game and, as a result, human behavior changes to apply violent game impulses even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machines to biological organisms that fit directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects the belief of Marshall McLuhan, who is a well-known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. As the telephone is an extension of the ear, television is an extension of the eye, the telegram is an extension of the central nervous system, high-tech virtual reality is an extension of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and therefore more human than it is in our world. But when technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their gaming stimuli. eXistenZ is a virtual reality simulation of human existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a society mediated in his book of Simulacra and Simulation, that all the power to act has been transformed to appear. The world has passed to a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ it is obvious to see the society mediated by Baudrillard with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the self into others. <br /> <br /> While you are in the eXistenZ, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection of the subconscious of the real life of each individual. As you gain control of your hyperreal life, step by step, the aura of your real life disappears. For Baudrillard, `simulations or simulacra, they have become hyperreal, more than real. "Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg's computer simulation world," he feels and, to all intents and purposes, more real than what we call the real world. " (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game which can basically be called "experience" is quite metaphorical. Because you can't even know what the experience is if you didn't live it. As existentialists say, life without an exact explanation is absurd, even the game of eXistenZ is absurd. Cronenberg ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, in the game, the other roles remain in place unless you ask them for a pre-programmed question. And when you put their status aimlessly, funny-looking, in the representation of our lives, the exposed absurdity is really upsetting. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anxiety about the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, yet they do not know the reason behind their existence. The essence. <br /> <br /> The existentialists have argued that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as do other animals and plants; every human being makes choices that create their own nature. In the formulation of the 20th century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. "The choice is therefore central to human existence and is inevitable; refusal to choose is also a choice. Freedom of choice involves commitment and responsibility. As individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility to follow their commitment wherever they lead ". Perhaps I should mention, "eXistenZ" also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. Reach your final role in the game by making the right decisions. If you don't, the game becomes unreal and boring. So, start questioning the game, your existence rather than your essence. Suddenly you become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position outside the game. Well, as a final word, eXistenZ is a well-conceived reverse simulation of life therefore existentialism. <br /> <br />
