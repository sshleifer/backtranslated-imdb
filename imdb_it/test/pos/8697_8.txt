Absolute film hoarder, and given his age, years ahead of his time. I saw it for the first time the week my father came home with a neighbor's TV, which the boy had thrown on the pile of rubbish. A dagger with all the electrical stuff, Dad worked in two days. It was July 1955 ... and therefore probably only the third house on the street for HAVE TV! Practically the first thing we saw on that gritty and flickering old 12-inch screen was THIS movie. "She is cute OLD," I remember my mother told me! <br /> <br /> Almost 50 years later, and it doesn't look older - rather like the first world war in this sense! Fantastic fantasy on a London omnibus that carries thirteen passengers, which crashes, killing one of their numbers. Then, in the flashback, we gather the lives of these people and what brought them to be on this bus that very day. <br /> <br /> Returning to the incident at the end of the film, the identity of the victim is revealed, perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 film THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this little gem, I recommend you watch it!
