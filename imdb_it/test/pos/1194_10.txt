Absolutely amazing! Humor, up-beat music and an anti-war message make this probably the best film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love how clever this film is, especially in the Vietnamese part of the track. It is interesting how the army officials who enforce the draft make it look ridiculous. Follow it with the serious situation of the war proper, and then the conclusion (which leaves me seething with anger over the war); yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the music is really fantastic. But what's really unique about this musical (as opposed to Evita, or Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the lyrics don't tell the story. The atmosphere (together with the visual dialogue and between the songs): "Donna" is a cheerful song that emphasizes the happy mood, while "Flesh Failures" has an intense and intense beat in a minor key. <br /> <br /> Also, I notice that the LSD scene is not very flattering. Now I'm not going to do drugs (not that I've ever intended to do). <br /> <br /> All things considered, this is a fantastic film. The only negative comment I can say is that it is sometimes difficult to hear the dialog box. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
