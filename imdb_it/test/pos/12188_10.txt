"Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen! The film had suspense, action and a cool head. The combination of the fierce attitude of the Queen and the rock mood of our star, played very well by Stuart Townsend, makes a wonderfully made film that only this combination can create. I'm always the only one to give advice to my friends and family about which movies are worth renting and when they ask me if "Queen of the Damned" is worthy, I tell them that it is worthy to buy. This film is definitely a must in all the homes of horror movie lovers!
