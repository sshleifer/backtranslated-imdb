I have to say that I thought the Greek show would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I'm part of a sisterhood, I didn't want Greek organizations to look bad .... <br /> <br /> but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they have the stereotype of sisterhood and brotherhood but it is not mocking but just a cute humor. <br /> <br /> All the characters are pretty nice less Rebecca Logan (I can't stand it), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there's Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha. His character brings so much to the show. Rusty's roommate, Dale played by Clark Duke, is hilarious. <br /> <br /> It's definitely fun to watch, so stay tuned for season 2. I can't wait for you to come back!
