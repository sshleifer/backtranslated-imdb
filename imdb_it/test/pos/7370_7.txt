This film has dethroned Dr. Giggles as the best horror film I've ever seen. The plot was great, the twists were even better and the cast was great. It is hard to believe that they have compiled the most unknown people 8 years ago and would become big names today! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teenagers destroy their car in the middle of nowhere. They come across this campsite and do what everyone in an accident should do. Build a fire and tell scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "The hook." Grand opening. Anyone in high school has heard variations of this story on dance night. But they do really well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "Honeymoon." OK, this was not the best of the 4. It was good enough and you can see some tits. The emphasis on the word "some". It's just your basic creature in the history of the forest. <br /> <br /> 3. "Even people can lick." This is a warning about what happens in Internet chat rooms across the country. This segment alone should be required for viewing for parents whose children have Internet access. <br /> <br /> 4. "The medallion". This is the best story of the whole movie. A guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this dumb girl's house. Very nice twist. <br /> <br /> The main plot, "The Campfire" has the biggest and best turning point in the whole film. I won't say why I don't want to ruin it. I was never shocked during a movie in my life! <br /> <br /> Plot: A + <br /> <br /> Acting: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> <br /> Director: A + <br /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> General: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone over the age of 13 with the exception of "People can Lick Too . "Any parent who has a child has access to the Internet needs to watch this with their child.
