Obviously, experienced reviewers who like things like Star Wars and professional shit will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments. But really, it's a fun youthful comedy with a fantastic story and good acting. <br /> <br /> Josie Gellar (well played by Drew Barrymore) is part of a group of journalists and offered a job - she has to go back to school and find out what teenagers are these days. Well, that's fine, until Josie remembers her horrible High School time and gets scared. But it has never been fashionable, it has never been beautiful, it has never been popular until now! <br /> <br /> Sit back and relax with Never Been Kissed! <br /> <br />
