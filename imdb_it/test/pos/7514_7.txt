I will never be able to go to this hospital [or hospice, if I want to be politically correct] [which donkey coined this sentence, anyway?], For something other than how to get out of the city. George C. did a masterful job interpreting the cynical out of focus, cynical and overworked who came to the conclusion that his life was a waste, but he is not able to change his environment or conditions even when he was given a golden opportunity [which probably wasn't so golden anyway]. I got a lot of laughter from this brutally black comedy, but at the same time I was sober and often relaxed to the core because I fear that this same atmosphere pervades most healing houses even as I write.
