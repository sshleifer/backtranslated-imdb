After my 6-year-old daughter started taking riding lessons, I started looking for horse films for her. I had always heard of National Velvet, but I had never seen it before. I'm glad I bought it! It has become my favorite, my 6 year old and my 2 year old. It is a pity that films like this are no longer made.
