On a lonely road in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, a black man driving a car is chased and hit by a truck, falling off the road and dying. His daughter Cassie Robinson calls her ex-boyfriend Dean and asks him to investigate the mysterious incident. Sam and Dean see that three African Americans and the city's largest Caucasian have been killed in strange accidents on the same road. When the truck threatens Cassie, her Caucasian mother, Mrs. Robinson, tells of a tragic racial murder that took place thirty years ago, and the brothers realize that they must fight against the spirit of hatred in a ghost truck. <br /> <br /> in this episode, Dean reveals his first and only love for his brother, surprising Sam and showing feelings, but also that his desire to hunt is stronger than his love. The story is only reasonable, touching the delicate issue of racism in an efficient manner and mixing it with a supernatural event. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rota 666" ("Route 666")
