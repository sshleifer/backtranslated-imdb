The NVA combines humor, military comedy and children's movies. Although somehow it is typically German as a sentimental film, I think it is a fantastic and very funny movie. You will not only laugh in NVA, but you will also get some insight into the East German armed forces of the late 1980s and how young recruits and professional troops experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democracy Republic. <br /> <br /> You'll have fun with NVA if you liked Sonnenallee (another film directed by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you liked Good Bye Lenin which is much more serious and less obviously fun. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable. But look at the band's former singer, Kim Frank, who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked!
