This film ... I saw it 15 years ago and in the last few years I no longer remembered it, name or anything, only that it was about a Romanian country man superbly played by Anthony Quinn. The impression I received from this drama will be eternal. I finally found the name of the film, I hope I can buy it. And honestly this movie is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was quite young when I saw the film for the first time. I asked my friends if they had heard of this story, but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer arrived who saw Anthony and told him it was a good "race", but in reality the German betrayed him. For a few dollars you won't get rich if you buy the movie, but you'll be rich if you have it.
