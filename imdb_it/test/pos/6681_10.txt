If you've enjoyed Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you'll also like K-Pax. For me, this film seemed really uplifting and at the same time depressing. Spacey offers a great performance as Prot. Also, let's not forget Saul Williams' appearance in the film, of which I am a big fan. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I recommended the film to many of my friends, and they all jumped away. <br /> <br /> But anyway, it is very undervalued, perhaps due to the lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry, this is not a film about how to blow things up, it's about how humans behave, and how people live in worlds that don't exist. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and have fun.
