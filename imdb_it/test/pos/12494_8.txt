And I love it !!! Wonder Showzen will gather a cult audience and once deleted, DVD sales will go to the roof. This is a very funny show in its own way. It is a parody of shows for children, namely Sesame Street. Our puppet characters are made of Chauncy, a yellow hairy monster with a hat, whose guest. Clarence is something like a blue lizard that makes its segments come out into the streets. He is a strange thing like the dog that refers to himself in the third person. Wordsworth is the intelligent one whose brain always shows. Then there is the journalist and the pink puppet. It's a very funny show, not really bad as you would expect, but more situations. They take 7-year-olds on the street, tell them what to say, and make them make bad jokes that they don't understand. My favorite segments are Clarence videos, especially when someone doesn't want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was a similar show, but this is still a very funny show that I hope will last for years. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 out of *** *. 30 minutes TV MA.
