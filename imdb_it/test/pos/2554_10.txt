Chop Shop is a hidden treasure in cinemas! I can't begin to describe how wonderful the performances in this film are. This film is for everyone who wants to see a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary films should look like. <br /> <br /> This film is about a boy, Alejandro "Ale" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar "Izzie" in a tiny studio of a car in a car shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (which I didn't even know existed - Willits Points) where there are innumerable safes and car bodies. Here, Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to keep themselves by buying and arranging a food van. <br /> <br /> Ale makes money by helping in the car shop, and Izzie helps in a food van; both, however, earn extra money on the side. Ale sells stolen bootleg films and car parts; Izzie turns out to be selling. Their lives are surrounded by grit and gloom, but even if both witnesses live and barely survive in their harsh world, their love for each other is never contaminated by the filth that surrounds them. And from time to time I am able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that are stolen from the reality of struggling to survive and be together. <br /> <br /> The best comparison I have for Chop Shop is that Bahrani's juxtaposition of an innocent love among family members against such a squalid atmosphere is as powerful as Pasolini's Mama Roma combined with the difficulties of grow too fast in an adverse environment just like in Bresson's Mouchette. <br /> <br /> Having co-written, directed and edited both this film and its first, Man Push Cart (which has won awards worldwide), Bahrani is a complete film director. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that your films are not hidden treasures for long!
