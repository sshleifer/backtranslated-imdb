First, I'm a teenager. OK, and I have to say that this movie was pretty good. I think any kid of ten and under will like it, but people my age up could be a little, um, a, well, we'd describe the movie as LAME! But I liked it. It may be that I still behave like a child, or I visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie was nice. I liked the way the actors were like children, not small blond cakes, wearing three layers of clothes, a fashionable hat and about a thousand assections (like most of today's shows, to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire, well every show for children.) And the setting was perfect, but there was a flaw. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did their home look like something of a "western" versace store? That was a flaw. <br /> <br /> Cameos are fantastic, there are about five hundred, and the only explanation is that Julia Roberts is the main girl's aunt. How the hell did the others have? This film seemed to have a limited budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was fun to watch, and I thought some parts were exaggerated (like a cow that sells for $ 750,000? Ha! my ass a cow sells for so much! ) But otherwise it was good, I liked it and I could watch it again. But I'd never buy it, there aren't even any special features on the DVD! What happens with that? But rent it, especially if you have children running around the house.
