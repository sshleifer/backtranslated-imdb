My companions were stunned to find this film a documentary. It was so funny, it seemed scripted, yet it gives a moving picture of real life in the life of the independent film. We felt moved by the purchase of Coven and wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As a university student, this film gave us a very useful inspiration about real life.
