This is the classic Disney in his best live action movie! University student Bumbling Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious formula of liquid invisibility that makes objects disappear and helps him save his college short of money. Further experiments reveal that it works incredibly well even on humans! Riley's shocking discovery takes some hilarious and funny twists when a cheating gang is directed by the infamous A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it for their non-legal activities. Dazzling special effects and a hectic story make this lively movie a college comedy textbook case! I love this movie! This film has always conveyed to me a sense of wonder and joy. A nice little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. There is not much violence or sex and absolutely not, this makes a film that parents can watch with their children. One in a series of Kurt Russell films set at Medvale College. A pleasant little series set in a healthy America before the terrorists, when people valued integrity more than money! I highly recommend this movie!
