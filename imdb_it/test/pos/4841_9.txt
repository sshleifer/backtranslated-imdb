Newman rails against false accusations when they cause him direct damage, but he thinks of his own business. We see the increase in antisemitic attacks through his myopia, a condition not completely cured by glasses. <br /> <br /> The typical role of every Macy's man is once again characterized and the long journey towards the realization that we are all connected almost costs him his life. <br /> <br /> What does the character that Macy represents us talk about? We cannot choose to ignore violence, hatred and bigotry because citizenship forces us to take sides. Newman's dilemma is that he has no alternative but to take the side of the abused and go through hell to see it. And our sadness is that many of us need to be beaten to realize the dangers that surround us. <br /> <br /> Let's concentrate.
