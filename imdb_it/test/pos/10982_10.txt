At a time when Hollywood thinks that stronger, faster and more bloody is better, Manna From Heaven is comedy and touching looks at something we all thought: what would I do if a pile of money fell from the sky. <Br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that it took many years to realize that the money had not made a single difference in their lives. They all become what they were meant to be. Unfortunately, in most cases, what they became was unhappy, despite their luck all those years. <br /> <br /> While Manna offers the famous Hollywood plot of Good vs. Evil, or in the case, Generosity vs Greed, what distinguishes this film is that Good wins by converting Evil, not crushing it. <br /> <br /> I think the important message of this film is that you can change the world ... even if you do it one person at a time.
