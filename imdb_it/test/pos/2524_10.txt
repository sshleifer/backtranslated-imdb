The story takes place in the streets of Sao Paoulo, Brazil, where a young boy named Pixote grows alone without his parents. Left unsettled and without direction, Pixote is taken to an asylum with other teenagers from the street. Terrible things happen behind closed doors within the staff and within groups of children. And there's one last trigger that makes the place explode, the latest incident that lets Pixote and his friends decide to run away and escape. From then on a journey overwhelmed by strong friendships linked, torn friendships, love and hate, criminal activities and simply chilling on the beach to talk about things, something that sometimes you and I also like. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is perfect in so many ways because it touches you on so many levels, it did it with me anyway. The style of document used to portray Pixote and its environment seems more realistic, and the actors, who are really street children and have lived similar lives, help humanity in the conditions to look more natural. He also has a social commentary on child abuse, but I think what makes the film so good is that the pressure is on the plot and not on political opinions. The last scene, which I find the best piece in the film, strikes me as something that goes beyond the nothingness I've seen before. So full of emotions, yet so little sentimental, it makes this film a true, credible, unbearable, unforgettable story. A true heartbreaking masterpiece that is underestimated! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
