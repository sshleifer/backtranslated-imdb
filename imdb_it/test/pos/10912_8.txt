A beautifully constructed and brilliantly performed comedy. There is not one person in the cast who does not absolve himself (or herself) with exhilarating distinction. However, the real protagonist of the film is the invisible director, Frank Oz, who brings all the mad sensitivity and intelligence to this farce that led to Miss Piggy's meetings with Kermit the frog. This is a movie not to be missed.
