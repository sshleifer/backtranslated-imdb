Clint Eastwood has achieved great success in this thriller since 1993. With an absolute master of suspense, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood offers as only him. Also, John Malkovich goes on my list of the most effective villains in film history as the demented killer. As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest, I think Kirk Douglas said better when he said, referring to his career , "I keep getting old, and my main women keep getting younger". This film is a very effective thriller with enough twists and surprises to keep you going. Eastwood and Peterson should work more often. Top-notch movies.
