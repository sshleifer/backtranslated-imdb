I liked this movie since I was a child and I still do it. I also liked Batman forever, but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't come out when I grew up. I noticed some scenes in this movie that didn't make any sense: "Hmmm ... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes?" Then I thought, "Who cares? This movie is not 100% serious ! '<br /> <br /> The original Tim Burton Batman was great, but in some parts it was a bit rough and I don't like all the actors, this movie has improved in almost every aspect with a wonderful cast , a more Gothic style and no Prince involvement. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, many fans of Christopher Nolan's films don't like Burton claiming that Nolan's films are more serious and therefore more loyal to comics I don't think it's entirely true: -It has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman, who was a criminal avenger murderer with a gun -Batman has taken many forms over the years peering at his stupidity in the 60s (and a bit with Batman & Robin.) A director is free to choose what kind of Batman h a going to portray until it's beautiful. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman does not necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton has managed to create a perfect balance between the nonsense and the darkness surrounding the idea. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Nolan's films and I also love those (especially The Dark Knight). There is simply something in this film that interests me most. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he sought an explanation of almost every aspect of Batman. This is a bit too much for me, I'm a big fan of the more abstract version of Batman. Burton's films are more theatrical and focused on the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is that one should not compare Nolan with Burton's films. They are just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like best. My respect is for both directors.
