This is a short film by Laurel & Hardy with some great and funny moments, but overall the film is based a little too much on a single comic premise. <br /> <br /> The comic premise on which the film is mostly based is very simple; Stan Laurel is not wearing pants. Laurel plays a young Scottish naive who comes to America with the kilt. For some reason he puts himself in the spotlight because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks that this is the time to put some pants on Philip. <br /> <br /> His humor is well executed but the main premise also becomes a bit boring after a while. Although the film still has some good comic moments, it is at the same time far from the best Laurel & Hardy short films still in circulation. The film is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest, although it is certainly the most beautiful performed for the most part. <br /> <br /> Great clean fun, nothing too extraordinary or memorable. <Br /> <br /> 7/10
