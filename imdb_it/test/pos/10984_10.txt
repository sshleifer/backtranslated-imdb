I didn't know much about this movie where my roommate dragged me inside. I was pleasantly surprised! The plot caught my attention and took it, and the characters are well designed and realistic. The script is very smart and fun, and the cast does great things with it. And the best part is that he managed to be funny without any explicit sex or violence! If this film arrives anywhere in your area, you should really see it - defend this little movie, it's worth it!
