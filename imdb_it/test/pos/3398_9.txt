This commentary speaks of the "North and South I Book" dealing with the period 1842-1861 <br /> <br /> The history of the 19th century of the United States is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865 ). This is a reasonable opinion because that was the Civil War that subjected the Union to severe tests; that was the civil war that made the Americans understand how precious it is to live in peace; finally, it was this period that eventually brought the shameful system of slavery to an end. <br /> <br /> Since the inception of the films, there have been people who have adapted that time on the screen. D. W. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable birth of a nation. Still, the most famous film on the North-South clash is still, I suppose, GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know about the magnificent television series based on the novel by John Jakes, "North and South". It's the best TV series ever made and the time spent looking at it is really precious. I recorded it on my video from Polish TV many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since. Why? <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, the Maines of South Carolina and the Hazards of Pennsylvania, represent two completely different ways of living. Nevertheless, friendship unites them. Yet, what they experience is the struggle that all people make: the friendship attacked by the "truth" of "political correctness", the love attacked by hatred for "legal spouses", the meekness with the strength of "social heroes ". Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and is soon deprived of her; someone who takes care of friends but political fanatics get in the way and ruin a lot. Finally, it is someone who can see the tragic future for his land, but there is nothing he can do about the inevitable fate of the south. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most respects, but sometimes he seems to have a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that even if there are tragedies, he must get up from despair and live because life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship is stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflict. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also particularly well developed. There are villains, like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones, who are really evil, but most people are as ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is, at first, full of rebellion, inclined to fight, but later he learns of being a true gentleman of the south for whom the pride of the south is not a courageous word but above all a courageous act. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of the abolitionist movement that seeks to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black farms". His marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying "NO" to southern politics. Two interesting characters are the sisters of Orry, Brett and Ashton, sisters in whose veins flow completely opposite blood. Brett, in his kindness but also in his naivety, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, even though he is a northerner, because she really loves him. Brett is the representation of all that is precious in every young woman. Ashton, however, is a vampire, a tiger, a woman who does not hesitate to do the worst things. The clear picture of their visions of the world is the clash between men and family ... an unforgettable and universal moment! Most of the characters head for their values ​​... however, war breaks out and they will have to set aside a lot ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, the performances ... someone said that all people act naturally. I wouldn't say it. Rather I would say that all the casts do a great job in their parts from the main characters that are portrayed by younger staff to guests that consist of famous stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role one of its best. Even Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is very memorable. His part, perhaps, involves too much suffering but manages to really express all kinds of feelings. Kirstie Alley is very attractive and truly memorable as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worthy of consideration as Elkanah Bent horribly ambitious and David Carradine as a monster husband, disgusting Justin LaMotte. And, in contrast to him, we must mention Jean Simmons who is truly excellent as Orry's mother, whose heart beats for the glory of family life and the harmony of union. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the memorable moments of "North and South" leave an indifferent trace in one's mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what a charm, how sweet it is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful, there's a real drama right now, a drama about a woman left by someone who really loved her. I also liked the Churubusco sequence and George Hazard was so worried about the life of his closest friend, Orry. Then his meetings with Constance are fantastic. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a performance masterpiece. And the final moment of the first part: although North and South can separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically join hands as the train proceeds. There are simply so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to mention even half of them. And these wonderful pieces by Bill Conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. The music in "North and South" is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What to say in the end? "North and South" is a real must on DVD, simply an extraordinary television series on the victory of all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute loyalty. 9/10
