What a great movie !! It is a touching story of four high school friends who grew up in the 1960s. Over the decade, friends are somehow separated, but they meet from time to time. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It is a story full of life, love and friendship. A must see for drama fans.
