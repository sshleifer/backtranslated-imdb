I agree with the posters before the characters were exceptionally strong and credible and all the actors in their highest form. I particularly enjoyed David Boreanaz who extends to such a different part from anything else that he played once again demonstrating his extraordinary talent for comedy. The first part of the film was light and fun, the part of the blackmail was a bit surreal but interesting - and it was all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> I found it frustrating that at least two of the 3 girls (Keira and Lisa) run away from blackmail and betrayal, leaving no trace on their psyche. I know the film has changed the darkest ending of the drama - and I'm not saying that I missed the crime. But I definitely needed to see those two get their comeuppance somehow and I was left moaning with frustration about the end. (That's why I only gave it a 9) <br /> <br /> But definitely an interesting movie.
