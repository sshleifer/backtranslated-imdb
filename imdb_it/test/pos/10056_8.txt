I haven't been a Madonna fan for quite some time, however, I thought I'd comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is wrong. One of them, like Madonna, was struck by criticism. They were very wrong and many potential viewers were excluded from the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> First of all, Madonna does an excellent job in this film which was one of her first. In the film she plays an extravagant blonde, she is far from a blonde in real life. Most critics were a little biased by her singing fame and not shaken. When you watch this movie, I hope you understand that the accent and nonsense are just acting. It was absolutely hysterical like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person who has not been given a good review in the film. If you take a look at his filmography, you will see that he is a rather complete actor. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, this is something like the beautiful woman, but it arrived 3 years before Roberts, Success. It's a clumsy comedy with lots of gags on the site, slapstick and a lining. Some of the plays are impassive and take a comedy fanatic to really appreciate the subtlest humor. <br /> <br /> I know this doesn't tell you much about the movie, however, I hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor film. It is absolutely worth hiring for a pleasant evening of great fun. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
