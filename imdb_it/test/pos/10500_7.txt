Thanks to FilmZone for showing this slippery soft core porn movie at 1am. I really liked it. To be honest, I expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore and, of course, the talented Chloe Nicholle (like Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are really bad especially because of the low budget but a little more effort would not harm. For example, cinematography makes a porn film look like a hard core. There is absolutely no effort in a flash. But we ignore this fact because we are honest, we have seen "Pleasures of sin" due to the high amount of sex. <br /> <br /> The sex factor is quite good and offers smoky and explicit scenes. Chole Nicholle offers the best interpretation of the female cast. <br /> <br /> So my advice is, watch this movie if you're in the mood for a good sex or just watch it if you're a fan of Mrs. Nicholle. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for sex scenes; don't expect anything else
