Oliver Stone is not the type to avoid for a film or a theme. He is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Watch his CV for proof! This film is not an exception, on the contrary, it is another jewel, which unfortunately not many have seen. <br /> <br /> While the controversial films go, this is one you should be grateful for. A film that should encourage you to think about yourself, the people next to you. The prejudices that exist and that each of us has in one form or another. Either we like to admit it or not, but it's easier to classify people and be like "Ah, he is 'xyz', yes, it must be like ...". Now I could read it too much, but I don't believe it. I think Oliver Stone is a very intelligent filmmaker who aimed at these things. And if this is something you want to explore (like a movie or inside yourself), watch this movie and be enthusiastic!
