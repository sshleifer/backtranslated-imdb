Once again I have to play something of the contrarian. Most of Ab Tak Chappan's reviews have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a vote in letters "C" from me. <br /> <br /> It seems that many of the praises are rooted in two factors: One, which Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood movie, and two, which is trying to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point I don't care about. I'm not looking for realism in the movies, so I don't get a higher score for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how I think it's the real world - I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, the absurd, and so away, even if I don't like realistic films just because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> For the second point, I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However, I do not think that "originality" with respect to formalism does in itself a better or worse film. A film can be "original" and poor, just as a film can be formidable and excellent. What matters is how well the film does everything it proposes to do and how rewarding or aesthetically rewarding it is for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai policeman named Daya Naik. Naik was a "meeting specialist". Meeting specialists, who could be considered initial instances of the real world "Judge Dredds", are trained to act like criminals and gang members who pursue, and are basically given a license to kill - by acting effectively as a policeman, judge, jury and executioner in a few minutes. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the Naik-based meeting specialist. We see him at work, interacting with his fellow meeting specialists and doing violence. We see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his not exactly luxurious environment. We see him trying to adapt to a new "commissioner" in the middle of the film. And we see his strange relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to make a fabulous and gritty film. I agree that it's nice to give up the typical Bollywood music numbers and novels - not all movies need that stuff; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for having left the music and the love stories in the background or on the roadside in many films he directed or produced. Moreover, Ab Tak Chappan has good performances - Patekar almost makes a Death Wish (1974) - the atmosphere of Charles Bronson. It also has an admirable cinematography: for example, things hand-picked near the beginning of the film have been particularly effective. It has a great score that mixes more of a Hollywood moody-sounding with the crime / action score with traditional Indian instruments and modes. Violence is well done and determination. <br /> <br /> There is also a fair exploration of subtexts, including the morality of specialists (have), the idea of ​​following orders, and so on. Meeting specialists have shown that they have to largely separate themselves from the ideas of right and wrong. More acutely, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. The parallels are drawn between meeting specialists following orders and, for example, members of a country's army, and we are shown how a corrupt situation can lead to this. <br /> <br /> But (did you know there was a "Ma" coming, didn't you? "Director Shimit Amin and his writers created a story with too many characters, too much sprawl, and that moves a a little too slowly All these problems could be due to Amin and the troupe watching the Godfather movies, of which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) similarities, albeit from the point of view of a policeman. <br /> <br /> Most of the meeting specialists don't know each other very well, these are poorly defined characters, with the exception of Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one, Narayan, I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through film. His name is mentioned a number of times, but I only had one glimpse of it until the scene changes, then everyone changes their clothes when they appear again and I should start again to figure out who Narayan was. what happened with Agashe's first commissioner, the film was already lon in the new commissioner, before I could understand the reports. There seem to be new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. While this could have some artistic merit as the meeting specialists mostly kill people they know nothing about (because they mostly do it on orders), since we don't learn much about most of the meeting specialists, either, it's hard to find characters to worry about, and this isn't exactly a compelling movie. <br /> <br /> The main villain is Zameer. But until about half the movie, there is no indication of this. He doesn't get much more time on the screen than the other villains in the film, and he is literally "phoning his performance" - he is in another location (Dubai), communicating only by telephone for most of the film. We actually don't see Zameer doing much. To some extent, the film depends on a couple of "twists" that don't require Zameer to do a number of things, but we might see him do other things, and many of the other villains may have been left out. <br /> <br /> This would have made the film a little more rigid, making it more focused and about half an hour shorter, both of which would have benefited from its impact. This is not an action-packed film by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring the considerable style of Ab Tak Chappan, but saying, "Okay, go on with the story".
