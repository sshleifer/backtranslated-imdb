Since I grew up in Czechoslovakia, I was following the story of the RAF pilots and crews in World War II, their stories and their tragic end in combat or in prisons and communist camps. This is undoubtedly more than a dark chapter in our history, even though the fact that those brave men are able to deal with all this and recover later is incredible. To all the people who want to see a fantastic movie ... that's it! During the recent visit to the Czech Republic I saw this film three times in three days (we only play it for three days ... otherwise I will go to see it a few more times !!! It's worth it!) I hope you like it, even if requires a little more thought and knowledge of the basic information behind the story, practically like the movie "Kolya". It's not a simple film because of its deep story, and the way it is most likely told will make you cry ... it made me three times in a row ... Zdenek Sverak did as always a great script, his son Jan did a great film and cast? No doubt everyone has done a great job, I was amazed by Ondrej Vetchy, the great role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all the other actors who made this film simply GREAT !!! If this isn't an Oscar nomination, I think I'll be on strike in Holywood.
