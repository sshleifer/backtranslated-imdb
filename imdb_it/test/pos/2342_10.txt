I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was impressed. Made with a micro budget, this black and white film is a European film and succeeds brilliantly despite the limitations of DV. The film works because it is in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, but moving and relieved by touches of sober humor. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other realist UK films, with ordinary workers portrayed as hopeless victims or comic stereotypes. The performances are strong, particularly Maureen Carr as her mother, Trise. I understand that the film was recently released on DVD and I would certainly recommend it. The evaluation on this site is misleading, which is why I gave a high score because the director May Miles Thomas obviously put his heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for his incredible result.
