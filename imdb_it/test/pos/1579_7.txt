GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a little better than its predecessor GUTS OF A VERGIN. Although this film is not really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first episode, I found BEAUTY to be a little stronger and better put together in the round of VIRGIN ... but then again, it's not saying much. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY starts as a rather rough and direct exploit movie. A couple of Yakuza cats are holding a young woman captive and are beginning to rape her quite brutally. While this wickedness is happening, the principal tells the girl that they did the same with his sister and sold her into slavery in Africa, and that they will do the same with her. Then they shoot her with some drugs and rape her a little more. She somehow leaves and ends up in a clinic where the nurse listens to her sobs. The robbery freaks out from the stress of his previous experience and commits suicide. The clinic operator, moved by the young woman's story, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower level boys and trying to hypnotize him to kill the leaders of the Yakuza. The whole plan backfires, so now Ms. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker is exposed to the same treatment that our original robbery received - only worse (some pretty rough head rapes arise along with the pre-requisite group rape ...). She is also drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly unfortunate victim ----- turns her into an angry osafroditic demon !!! (no sh! t, that's what really happens !!!) This is when BEAUTY really takes off with some crazy insane kill scenes! - including a very elegant chest rape that looks like a cross between ALIEN and a bad porn, and my favorite - a demon-vagina submerged killing (complete with vagina-slime demon ...) that must be seen to believe it ... <br /> <br /> Definitely some promising stuff that's happening in GUTS OF A BEAUTY, but still feeling very bumpy. BEAUTY it almost seems like two different films are forced together in an incompatible way. Still, I have to give credit to the film - the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic, and the killing scenes are completely off the wall. A solid 7/10 for another crazy "classic" J-horror.
