A beautiful woman, a backwoods, an innate monster, a super monster, a road that kills a zombie brother and two friends ... a confident nerd, a too sensitive nerd and the other a crazy drunk teenager. Throw them all together with a pinch of Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip and you have Monster Man. An exhilarating horror / comic film that never aims to "say something". It's a simple, simple laugh party. Unpretentious and well done, this horror / comedy is in his heart, a glance. This film offered some hilarious and enchanting sets. I highly recommend this for scary fans trying to be entertained.
