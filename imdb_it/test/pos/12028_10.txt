Spending an hour watching this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" perform in Bravo is the most enjoyable time I've ever spent watching TV. This young man (Dan) is an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even dancer. It can range from the happiest of ballad pop songs, all sung only by women, hip-hop, rock, even songs written for women .. This guy can do anything. I saw it live at least 11 times, so I wasn't just expecting how well his show would fit into a TV or movie format, but all reservations went away immediately when the show started because of the overwhelming quality of the stars of Dan a favor and look at this, or better yet, buy it.
