Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I want to marry. It is never boring, it always thinks in a positive way, good with animals. Ok, as a reviewer wrote, a bit too peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (only Madonna could get away with it). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your normal girlfriend. It makes things happen, it's always exciting to be around, and always honest. Sure, she steals, but she doesn't steal or kill (unless you're out to let her in). You know which rules can be broken and which should be respected. You know what to take and what can't be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she is 100%. Bottom line: You know how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (that's why she has a way with wild animals), and completely dedicated to those she loves and loves her. <br /> <br /> Who's That Girl? She's the girl for me.
