"Nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the United States as "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and, I think, better - than most films about poor people who leave Europe and come to the United States. <br /> <br /> The film begins with scenes in a poor rural region of Sicily. We have always heard that Sicily is a rocky island, but you won't really understand the implications of this sentence until you see the first half hour of "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The central part of the film is dedicated to the long journey in the United States. Most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third class section who become seasick, and then show us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie - we have a sense for life below, and it's not fascinating. (We never even see the Statue of Liberty.) <br /> <br /> Finally, the typical film will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island, and then the immigrants are walking on the Lower East Side of New York. Not here - the Ellis Island experience takes up about a third of the video. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato is as exceptional as Salvatore Mancuso, who is bringing his two sons and his mother into the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is just as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious English woman who speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There are some strange touches in the film, especially the soundtrack with the songs of Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism there, but I couldn't make sense of it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will be better seen in a theater than in a DVD. Again, big screen or small screen, it's worth looking for.
