Hey, what do you expect from a very low budget movie!?!? Although I have not seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that following what the media published on Jeff this is a fairly accurate representation. I studied the Jeffrey Dahmer case and learned all I can about this man. This is a low budget movie but shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can overcome the blood and see what is the underlying story of a sick mind. I loved this movie! Get ready for a small, bloodless budget. It is a story seen through the eyes of a murderer and his actions and thoughts from childhood until his arrest. My favorite sentence is: "If they had taken the trouble to look in the back seat, they could have saved many lives" Enjoy!
