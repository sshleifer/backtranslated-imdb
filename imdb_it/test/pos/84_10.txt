A very beautiful film, focused on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable. If more families saw this film, perhaps more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent film that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is no different from the thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children who struggle with this world. The really important point here is that this could have been prevented. Other people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously. It is well done, with important messages, managed in a graceful way.
