The greatest Tarzan ever made! This film is made so that no other Tarzan has ever come close. It has everything you want in a Tarzan movie. No other Tarzan film has ever represented the character so well. I would say that if you saw a Tarzan movie and liked it, you should see it, you will love it, and if you've never seen Tarzan, you should see this and forget the rest of them.
