The independent horror author Todd Sheets returns with another hilarious and atrocious clunker on nickel'n'dime which in practice is just a weak excuse to shove thicker blood and sparkling guts as often as possible. An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead like ravenous-faced rotting zombies, so they can feast on the living. A group of quarrelsome college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped prisoners led by the ferocious Slade (Byron Nichodemus who outraged him in an outrageous way), two equally fierce sleazeball thugs, and a trio of hottie sisters must do their best to survive this tough test. This is all due to the unnecessarily confused and twisted plot, but fortunately what this horrible horror lacks narrative coherence (abundant) is more than compensating with a pleasant plethora of gloriously gross'grafical blood. Disgusting highlights include a woman with severed fingers, a fatal fatal blow to the groin of a young girl, attempted necrophilic rape, evisceration, and, of course, more viscid repulsive eating than you can shake a pile of damp intestines. Furthermore, we also have a rough and grainy cinematography that constantly alternates faded color and dirty fighting scenes in black and white, ineptically staged, the bad acting of a uniform and pathetic nameless cast (Jerry Angell in particular plays the part of the film dishonest for his ridiculous humorous histrionics like slimy no-count criminal psychopath Joe Bob), a grotesque thrash metal soundtrack, and a generic shivering score synth. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which many of our survivors come across some vials of carnivorous bacteria to use on the undead hordes. Of course, this film is pure dreck, but it has some incredibly abominable quality which in turn makes it a fantastic Z-grade fun for hardcore lovers.
