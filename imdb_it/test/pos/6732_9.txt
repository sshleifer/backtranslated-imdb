This film is one of those that cannot be considered from its exterior. In fact, at first glance, it seems that the story simply focuses on the desire to have more money. But ... let's take a look on the other side ... What do you see? See that money is just a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings that human beings have: should I do the right thing, or should I? And ... what is the "right thing"? They do a more in-depth analysis ... -What does a small town on the border mean? - It means that sometimes we can go too close to the border to do something we thought we could not ... - What does the dry terrain shown in this picture mean? - It means the aridity that sometimes takes possession of our offended hearts ... - What does the phrase of the character (KRISTEN) mean: "Now I belong to him"? - It means the loss of our free will because of our unpremeditated actions. In MY OPINION he is the writer of history and the director tried to "tell us". By the way ... remember what another character (JACK BARNES) said: "Nothing is so simple ..."
