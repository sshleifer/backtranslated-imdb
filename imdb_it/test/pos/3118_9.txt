I first saw this film on TV in 1959 when I was eight. I knew nothing about westerns, but I recognized Ben Johnson from the movie "Mighty Joe Young". What attracted me to "Wagon Master" were the great songs sung by the "Figli dei Pionieri". Merian C. Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to commission original music to adapt to the atmosphere of a specific scene and thus created the soundtrack for the modern film. Cooper hired Max Steiner to set the mood for his classic King Kong creation. Later Steiner won an Oscar for the "Gone With the Wind" theme. Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young". If you remember, music was important to the great ape who would only respond to the sound of "Beautiful Dreamer" by Stephan Foster. In 1947, Cooper would collaborate with John Ford, who ran "Wagon Master." Of all the famous Ford westerns, this is my favorite that presents his brother Francis and a soul Janes Arness.
