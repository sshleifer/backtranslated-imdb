This film was incredible !!!! I didn't know the backstory about it, so I had to let it explain before I did on DVD. He had many twists, but he kept the story fresh and exciting. Elaine Cassidy's acting was brilliant in addition to Sally Hawkins. The plot is full of plausible events and fresh ideas of the present. <br /> <br /> There really is something in Mrs Cassidy's eyes that leaves a "mark". This film is a refreshing look at how we look at "Victorian times" and how we see that society. A very useful watch.
