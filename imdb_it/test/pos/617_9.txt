This is one of the movies that you have to start looking at with an open mind. It is known that it is a mute, one could look forward or be afraid for a lot of feeling. <br /> <br /> Well, forget it. The film starts with some black humor and then starts. From that moment on, he takes you on an ever-scary ride through the dark centers of Moscow. Okay, it must be said: unexpected twists are expected and the silent is used mainly as a plot or fear generator. But this movie won't let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like the old gangster movies, but then without any charm and in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this film: it is located in Russia. This has a big impact on the film, I think it makes it better. Everything becomes simple and essential, life is nonsense. This could be great potential for other films in the future, the gangster films about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and terrifying film. It's horror, but you can't feel sympathy for the little dumb. One last tip: don't look too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.
