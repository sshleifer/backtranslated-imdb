one of the best films of all time ... Fire ... this is not a sociological description of today's India ... it is the use of light that suffocates the mind that never stops, never becomes ... normal ... even when .. In this sense the film is almost unique ... both tracks are of excellent quality ... the origin of Das as a street artist is quite obvious ... his performance is superb "cameo" ... but the use of light ... I looked at it and looked at it again and again ... again with the passage of time ... nothing torrid in history ... rather " pure "way to face the subject ... in a certain sense it is sad that in the bizarre world in which we live today, an important work of art is generally known as a genre film ... Fire can stand face to face with Jeanne D 'Arc by Dryer or Biruma no Tategoto by Ichikawa or some of Kurosawa's main films, to name a few. I would like my contribution to help this film a bit with its well-deserved fame.
