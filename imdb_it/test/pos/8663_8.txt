A bus falls out of a nameless man outside a Standard Oil petrol station in ruins in the middle of nowhere. We never learn where the bus comes from, or why he is there, or who he is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is "the annoying man" spoken of in the film's title? Did he die and go to heaven or hell? Like our man, we have no chance to stop and ask. He is greeted by a guardian of all kinds and transported to an anonymous city. From day one, all choices are made for him. An apartment was rented, a job was found, an office was assigned. In reality, his life is not completely different from the life in virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban apartment buildings. Women are heartless, dinners are a breath of fresh air, office jobs suck. But some pieces don't fit the puzzle. Silent efficient henchmen dressed in gray roam the streets. Am I a kind of paramedic or the secret police? And why are there no children? Is the plot also set in the real world? Whenever we think we might have answers, new mysteries are revealed. "The Bothersome Man" leaves you a little relieved that it's over, half wants more. I hope they soon become a computer game.
