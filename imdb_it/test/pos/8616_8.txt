I like Breillat films, but this is the best I've seen in balancing animal heat with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric, and the script is incredible - especially considering that it should be set on the set of another Breillat film. You don't have to agree with his take on everything to get much from this. It made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. Try to imagine a male director with Jeanne's opening - not impossible, but a little bent. The underlying unannounced sexual currents that are always present when humans come together to create anything are brought back here in intense light, but not in cold light.
