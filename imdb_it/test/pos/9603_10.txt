.... could it be that ITV would not want to release this absolute classic because it would show its current Mike Bassett series for what it is? When I discussed Mike Bassett with some co-workers, I mentioned Bostock's Cup as a far superior offer and I was surprised to find that I seem to be the only person in my entire office to see it. This may not be right for a film that has to be the most fun I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, ITV does not have the biggest recent record for comedy production so you would think it would jump at the risk of repeating at least something that is really fun. Perhaps if it could be combined with lucrative telephone competition where we think the coach driver will go after, they might be interested. <br /> <br /> Force ITV, there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original and quality comedies / dramas. Do the right thing. Repeat the operation and let it out on DVD.
