This almost perfect film version of Edith Nesbit's children's novel follows the life of Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter and their mother, after their father was unjustly accused of treason and sent to prison. Are they going to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country that is near a railway line ?? Mom writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while the children spend most of their time around the train station and, in particular, greet with a train in particular to "send their love to their father". <br /> <br /> Always an engaging and intelligent novel, the characters are brought back to life here under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and her brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks the railway-man) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman on the train). <br /> <br /> 'The Railway Children' is kind of entertainment from another era, but does its job beautifully. As we watch Bobbie grow up with the concerns of an absent parent who goes against his own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the end of the photo. In all we have a sense of time and place ?? either from steam trains, from university paper tracking, or from red flannel slips worn by girls (and used to avoid disaster!).
