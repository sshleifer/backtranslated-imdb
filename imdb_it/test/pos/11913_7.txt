'Toy Soldiers' is the story of five misfits (in particular Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton and Kieth Coogan) who try to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the US government imprisoned the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr. plays the headmaster of the school, a stubborn boy who tries to instill a sense of discipline in his students. <br /> <br /> 'Toy Soldiers' is a fun and beautiful action, and certainly the best of hostage-crisis-at-school movies. I think most of the appeal comes from the youth cast, but even the terrorists are not completely useless, while in some films they never seem to be the most intimidating group they should. Trapped inside the college, and threatened with being killed if the army or police interfere, this is a very formidable challenge for this group of boys who plan to save the school. In reality they are also quite intelligent. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. It keeps a steady rhythm and doesn't become ridiculously sentimental or something. Astin and Gosset Jr. are performing well. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an undervalued action movie.
