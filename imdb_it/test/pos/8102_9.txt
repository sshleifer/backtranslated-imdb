With the rise of Nazis in eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction. The catalyst may have been a propaganda publication that referred to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a deadly parody of Hitler that is as much fun as it is sometimes scary. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from World War I to the present day. At the same time, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like a tramp leaving a hospital after so long, only to find out how different the world is under Nazi rule. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great role as an Oscar nominated supporter as a double of Mussolini (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Adenoid Hynkel the character of Hitler of Chaplin. Henry Daniell is his usual usual sloppy as Garbitsch, Adenoid Hynkel's chief adviser. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay and acting. The film was also nominated for best film. <br /> <br /> Chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He financed the entire film at his own risk because of the matter, and there were no other great films made for Nazi Germany up to that point. The film spent about twenty months of production with Chaplin, also rebuilding a set and shooting a scene to fix things. At the time of the film's release, in October 1940, the war in Europe was well underway with Hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more current in its release than when production began. <br /> <br /> There isn't much plot to watch the film in retrospect; the film looks more like a series of comic sketches and / or misadventures tied together to achieve a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very much fun, but it leads to nothing in terms of plot. Similarly, the escape of both the barber and Schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of Hynkel's barber to give Chaplin (through the character of the barber) the opportunity to pontificate the public at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to highlight the misplaced narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish barber mistaken for Hynkel? <br /> <br /> However, the film contains many high-level comic moments, such as the rally speech, new developments of the war (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene and the whole scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber scene) to strongly recommend the film. Nor can we forget the risks Chaplin took in making his first talking film, an anti-Nazi film, and funding the film himself. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
