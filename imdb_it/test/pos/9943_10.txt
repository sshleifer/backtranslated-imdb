Although many have mixed feelings about this yellow thriller thriller from Argento, it is yet another lavish testament to Argento's cinematic brilliance. <br /> <br /> A young opera singer has her first performance and suddenly finds herself the object of obsession with a crazy maniac. <br /> <br /> In a sense, the Opera is like a modern yellow on Phantom of the Opera combined with all the style and glorious color that one would expect from Dario Argento to deliver. Argento makes fantastic use of inventive machine techniques, recurring symbols (like those crows!), Gothic atmosphere and really gruesome sequences of murders. A particular scene (involving a peephole and a gun) will cause the spectators to fall out of their seats! From the point of view of history, the film also manages to be gripped by a strong suspense and given a great atmosphere by the splendid soundtrack by Claudio Simonetti. <br /> <br /> The cast does some satisfying shows. Cristina Marsillach is good as our protagonist. The late Ian Charleson makes a nice turn as a director, as do Urbano Barberini as investigator, Daria Nicolodi as Marsillach's agent and William McNamara as Marsillach's unlucky lover. <br /> <br /> The work is terrifying on the last day of Argento, and perhaps the last of his great works. He will surely please his fans and create new ones. <br /> <br /> **** on ****
