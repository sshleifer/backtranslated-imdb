Some time ago, we read the results of a survey conducted by some sports journalists. The questions asked were only two, they were brief and correct to the point. <br /> <br /> Question number 1 asked those who answered that they knew who their most beloved college football team was. Question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated football team. The answer to both questions was simply, Notre Dame! ND is on top of both lists! Yes, we love them or we hate them, but certainly not ignored, em. <br /> <br /> The roots of this unique position of this Indepent * College Football Powerhouse lie in the life and career of one, grown up, the small immigrant Norweigen from Chicago called Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> As a biographical film, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940), came out relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne in a 1930s plane crash. It was about 10 years after the film was been released. This would mean that the preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after the great loss of our nation to Mr. Rockne. <br /> <br /> His resemblance and voice were well known by Newspapers, Radio and Motion Picture News Reels. Both Knute's Widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and the University of Notre Dame had the approval rights for choosing the actor to play the lead role and the script. We think they couldn't have done the job better. Pat O'Brien really looks the part and was a college footballer. Ronald Reagan is in the key role of George Gipp **, a free-spirited student who goes to Notre Dame on a baseball scholarship! He was a "walk-on" football player. <br /> <br /> The cast is full of talented players. We have Griffith Veteran, Donald Crisp as p. Callaghan, C.S.C., President of Notre Dame. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland, Rockne's chemistry professor and mentor. Gail Page looks like the lady, Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is the Rockne cohort, Gus Dorais (the passer-by in the historical ND against ARMY Game at West Point.) <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne as the Four Horsemen. Howard Jones, "Pop" Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear as themselves in the Congress Probe scenes in College Sports and add an authentic touch. <br /> <br /> As for the biographical film, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American !, all that can be said is that it succeeds and does not slow down from start to finish. There is not even a waste of time. All the time on the screen is used to move the story. <br /> <br /> The use of the Notre Dame Choir, the Campus itself and all the music of the Brass Band Rah-Rah conveys the feeling of being really there. *** <br /> <br /> * To this day, even if their basketball team and other sports teams compete in the Big East Conference, Notre Dame remains an independent in NCAA football. This means that, in effect, The Fighting Irish has a national program. <br /> <br /> ** There was no such agreement with the family of George Gipp. There was a cause some years ago on the scene that depicts the young Mr. Gipp giving the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper" speech. The television prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were less the subject of the deathbed scene. <br /> <br /> *** Other Notre Dame themed films have been made over the years. THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME (Universal 1931) saw J. Farrell McDonald as Rockne's coach. He also saw the participation of Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton and members of the royal teams of Notre Dame with the true Four Horsemen. Then, of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, among others, in a refined cast. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, a critic of Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing materialized, did it? (Let me know, dear reader, THANX !!) <br /> <br /> **** Warner The brothers have always had great music in them, both in the opening themes and in the casual music. In this movie Rockne, they incorporated the song NOTRE DAME FIGHT into the score. Along with this were STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, which had its premiere at the 1930 Rockne Funeral in the Basilica of Notre Dame.
