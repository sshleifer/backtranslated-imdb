Angels are a bit obsessive Americans, but they are often rather boring. They are the messengers of God, and even the archangels are great warriors (Lucifer is the toughest and most beautiful until he was driven from heaven). <br /> <br /> So what happens if you don't believe in anything, not to mention the angels and you're sent to investigate an angel story, only to meet one with wings and less of an angelic attitude. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what America needs, being a Puritan is different from being good. Michael is a rude and hateful heavenly messenger that will satisfy your desires and make you worry enough about the world to be touched. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not so much, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being intelligent ... it's just a good, simple comedy. Look on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
