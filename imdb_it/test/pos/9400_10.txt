This film is on my list of the 20 best comedies. This is a truly unique film. For the reviewer who said "I really have to miss something". You are right. You're missing something. If you don't have the sense of humor required by this film, this is one thing. But don't give a negative review because you think it's "looney" but it's not meant to be. Loony is an appropriate description of what it intends to be and what it manages to be. I laughed much more often and much more intensely in this film than it is in other fun movies. <br /> <br /> Michael Almereyda brought out the best of his cast in this, his first major film, for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit award for best feature debut. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in a perfectly inexplicable way, and some of his funniest lines have ever been said in this film. Glover is clearly the best comedian at work right now. Harry Dean Stanton stages an excellent comic performance. William Burroughs is incredible in a small role. Dylan McDermott was the ideal cast, and Lois Chiles is completely excellent. <br /> <br /> All the things above are perfectly fun in their perfect way, but this is one of Crispin's best performances - up there with his performances in River's Edge and Willard. If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, but somehow you have overlooked this movie, you must stop whatever you are doing and see it immediately. <br /> <br /> But remember to relax first, and maybe have a beer or something. This is a great film, but it is very unusual, and before I look at it, I advise entering or inducing an appropriate state of mind.
