While on vacation in northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and her younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to take the Blackwater Barry tour in the swamp for fishing. Their guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist down the river to a remote point. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that turns their boat upside down and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out of their protected position. However, in the muddy water, their boat is turned over and the crocodile chases the trio underwater. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low-budget film in accordance with the warning at the beginning, based on a real event. The recitation of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is top notch, giving credibility to this simple but frightening story. There are many similarities between this film and "Prey", but in different environments. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
