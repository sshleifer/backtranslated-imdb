A photographer in the small town of Gunsan, in South Korea, discovers he has a terminal illness but underestimates his seriousness to his family and friends. We never find out about the nature of the disease, but the main focus of Hur Jin-ho's first moving Christmas film in August is not his illness. It is the grace with which he leads his life: his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Unfortunately, it was the last film shot by filmmaker Yoo Young-kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> The photographer, Jung-won, is played by Han Suk-kyu, once Korea's most popular star. A handsome man in his thirties with a contagious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is hard to imagine him approaching the end of life. Jung-won owns a small photo shop and lives at home with his deaf father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji-hye), teaching his father how to play movies on the VCR and writing instructions to him about his shop if he should to die. While Jung-won handles the day-to-day business to bring his business into order, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, enters his store with an urgent request for photo enlargements. <Br /> <br /> Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain, but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without an explicit expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being, the place from which they come. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won doesn't tell her that she has only a short time to live, but that doesn't make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably, her growing absence from the store makes her feel betrayed and frustrated to the point of throwing a stone through the shop window. Although Jung-won's decision to withdraw his disease from Dar-im is open to the question, he feels organic for his character in the film and is not simply used as a plot device or excuse for the character to "live life at best "playing around. <br /> <br /> One of the film's most moving sequences is when an old woman returns to her studio to take a commemorative photo of herself. Jung-won makes sure that the image is exactly a likeness, knowing that he will soon take his picture of the memory. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never uses melodrama to make the point. It's about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: riding a bicycle, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and thoughtful, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story in which love means having to say that you are sorry. Although there have been many films about the death process, Christmas in August pushes the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the greatest joy.
