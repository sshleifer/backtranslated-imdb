I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was in The Bridges of Madison County, but it was until I saw The Beguiled. He manages to make it, giving a good performance and so does the rest of the cast. The direction is imaginative since the film was made in 1971 and there were no holes in the plot - which the director seems to struggle to cover at times - we are talking about an excellent film. However it remains powerful. <br /> <br /> 8
