I took "On the Run" at the New York Screening Room and was immediately seduced by his true independent spirit. Starring Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia by The Sopranos cast, "On the Run" takes us on a 24-hour wild ride in the city that never sleeps, while we follow the intricacies of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly swept away long - a school friend, just out of prison. In fact it has escaped and is "on the run" in search of some action and a glimpse of life in the middle of the great metropolis. Driven by great shows, this film gives us the old feeling of the photos of the '70s, with both characters rediscovering themselves while blazing in the city, encountering wild events and locals. An elegy of a certain side of New York that seems to disappear, "On the Run" shows great sensitivity and humor. I expect it to be a cult classic that needs to be discovered: future viewers should definitely surrender to this night trip.
