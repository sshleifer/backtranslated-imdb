Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast in the role of Blade, a half-human half vampire known to the daywalker. He has all his strength and his only weakness is his thirst for blood. Since he collaborated with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has been chasing vampires who have lived among us unnoticed for centuries, but the almighty king Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with humans (Food as he calls them) and plans to wake the god of blood and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This film is well written, written and directed; ensuring the spectator an electrifying ride from start to finish. Packed with great fight sequences and clear dialogues, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but it certainly offers. <br /> <br /> 8/10
