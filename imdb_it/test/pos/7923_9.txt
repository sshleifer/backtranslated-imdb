ALESSANDRO NEVSKY is nothing short of a great large-scale film. The film opens a window on a world and a culture that most Americans will never know. And much has been said and written about the subtly veiled patriotism of the film in the face of the impending war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> According to US standards, acting is a bit truculent. The script is short on words and great on graphics and action. And while the action can get boring, the images are often amazing. The management is incredible. <br /> <br /> On another note, Ralph Bakshi's animation fans might notice that he stole many of his WIZARD images directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKY.
