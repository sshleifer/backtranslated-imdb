This film is not really a remake of the 1949 film O'Brien (which is excellent). He borrows the main premise: a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that writers have chosen as professor a professor of English instead of a private dick. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film runs fast enough to keep you awake. But what scares this film is a strange dated quality (probably due to the horrendous original soundtrack of the 80s) combined with a "noir" feeling. Dennis Quaid grins inexplicably throughout the film at odd moments, but it is still compelling in general. Meg Ryan is fine as a student / love interest assistant. When the film gets a little ugly it is when Dex (the prof) meets the British bodyguard / driver and their duels are rather laughable. The bodyguard works for the rich widow (played by the adorable Charlotte Rampling), but those scenes are too unconsciously "noir" to help the film, even if the familiar "plot" is quite interesting. Dex also continues to show up in the same place and find this bodyguard, which is rather random. In the last part of the film, a man is hit by a window, and from outside you see him jumping out - it was a bad direction. But apart from some of these obvious flaws, I think it's still valid. I certainly did not predict the ending, so it was nice - there is a turning point, and although some posters here seem to have been misled, I thought it was a beautiful and believable ending. Dennis Quaid, with his strange smiles and black eyes, is more likeable on The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor. But here as Dex, he should somehow be a jerk, so he did well. Pretty decent movie.
