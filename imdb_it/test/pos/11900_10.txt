This film was one that I waited to see for some time. I was happy to find out that everything was anticipated. The script of this film has been elaborated and studied in a very refined way, beyond what is seen by the public. I found it amusing that so many people watching don't read in some very important lines, but in reality if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very bright. The film has many stories and characters intertwined around this Kilo character, a man who has risen from the streets in the midst of many evils and become a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in prison, Kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and is released only through a disturbing turn of events to discover that everything is not at all what it seems. Kilo finds himself clashing with the higher realm of society and political sovereignty to clarify how important and representative the Word of a man is. A war begins while the road is in arms against the Lords of wealth and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> An accumulation of uninterrupted and powerful twists. This film will leave you spellbound. I found the cast of this exceptional film and not a movie to ignore. Excellent. Go get it today !!
