Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongly accused of sabotaging a hook that made aircraft for war. He goes on the run, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice. <br /> <br /> There are many things wrong with this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he is totally disbelieving in this role; Priscilla Lane is pretty but has never been a good actress; history doesn't make much sense (and wanders longer than necessary); it carries its patriotism a little too much (but this was done while the Second World War was in full swing) and there is no end. It shouldn't work but it is. <br /> <br /> It is full of bizarre lines and characters that will surely interest you. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane tells Cummings (while they are falling in love), "I wish I could meet you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane PAYS is a villain for having lunch and Cummings and Lane briefly join a circus company while on the run. Even the direction of Hitchcock was (as always) simply fantastic - it throws in some really incredible shots and sequences - especially the climax of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the classic Hitchcock movies, but it is still very good and worth catching.
