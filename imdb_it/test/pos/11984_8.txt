This black and white film reached the spartan movie theater of my Frisian village about 18 months after its release. At that time, much of our rich comedy service came from Denmark (someone from Nils Poppe?), So this film struck me like lightning - it made me cry with helpless joy, ROTFL as we said it now. OK, so some of the gags were actually "schtick" of recycled vaudeville, but how could he know this "barefoot boy with brass cheeks" at the moment? In any case, my favorite scenes had Jerry's unique frantic clowning brand, like that of the boxing match in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I was still laughing loudly. Of course, without the component of nostalgia, it would probably be just another fair-to-middle comedy. But then, another film that once made me to points even more powerless, the Spike Jones movie "Fireman Save My Child", now looks dated and entrenched, apart from too many orchestral tracks and Doodles Weaver scenes. It must be a special ingredient that makes the Martin & Lewis product fresher. For me this is at least eight out of ten.
