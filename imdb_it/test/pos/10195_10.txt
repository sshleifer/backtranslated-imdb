The combination of incredible special effects and acting worthy of the Oscar makes the Vindicator one of the most important science fiction films of recent years. For some reason still unknown to me this gem has been found in a business basket, because some worthless humans thought it was right to dirty a modern classic, relating to a deal, is beyond me. I've never been so terrified of a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire. Forget the Terminator, Robocop, Aliens and other films that have literally taken away this masterpiece, the avenger is an unstoppable force.
