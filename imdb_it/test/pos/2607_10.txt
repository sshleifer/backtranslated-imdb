During the Southern War for Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes its forces to defend local women and children against a Yankee invasion. In 1936, Hal Roach decided that the time had come for his children of OUR GANG to expand into occasional feature films. With the great success of Shirley Temple in two films from the Civil War period of 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was natural that Roach looked in the same direction for his GANG. Although it had a rather lavish production and was distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success. The small GANGsters would remain short subjects from now on. <br /> <br /> Although I gave the best and the main role, George ?? Spanky 'McFarland is rivaled in the first half of the film by little Billie ?? Buckwheat 'Thomas. Here were two of the best young actors to appear in American films. With all the experience of old and experienced professionals, these two gamin could steal scenes and hearts with the same bravado. A constant joy, without a false note between them, provides the essential reason to watch the film today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes offers a quiet and noble performance as Spanky's adult protector. Almost forgotten now, Holmes was a good actor who died too early during the Second World War. Genial Ralph Morgan is particularly good as a friendly general in the Union - his scenes with Spanky are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Other OUR GANGERS appear in the middle of the film, in particular Carl ?? Alfalfa 'Switzer; he starts to warble right before the battle, mother. Even the beautiful Rosina Lawrence (the GANG schoolchild) shows up to play Holmes's beloved. <br /> <br /> Irving Pichel is particularly slimy like a cowardly cowardice turned into a vengeful Yankee captain. Bumbling Willie Best & feisty Louise Beavers plays Miss Lawrence's slaves. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that there is racism in the film, not unusual for Hollywood of that era - but almost completely missing in the original OUR GANG shorts series. <br /> <br /> Music lovers of the 19th century will appreciate the soundtrack, which is a long succession of ancient pieces.
