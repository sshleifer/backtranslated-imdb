Now, the original company of the science fiction channel has made some rather disgusting films (House of the dead 2, All souls day, etc.) But when you leave the work entirely to the horror teacher and writer and now to the director, Bruce Campbell, you get one of the best damn facts for independent horror movies TV ever made! I normally hate these movies, in my previous review, House of the dead 2, I couldn't believe how awful the movie was! But somehow I took a liking to this film, a great taste for this film. Violence is good, as is the black comedy in the film and I suggest you take it, a true masterpiece of Bruce Campbell! Well, since there are only a few lines left, I can say all I want about this film: IJAJKASIF JHJDJ NXD FNEHSD FHNCFNFVHS DJKEALJWSNS.UHHD SISHSNHF AHCNAKDJH HNDCHJNDN JACND HCHJNNHW JHJ NASHDNFHCKA FHNKHAD
