Nominated for Best Documentary at the 2004 Academy Awards, My Architect follows director Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to discover his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11, leaving behind an incredible but limited amount of work, unpaid debts and three separate families living a few miles apart. <br /> <br /> My architect follows Kahn's life by chronologically examining his buildings and intertwining their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As a son that Lou never publicly acknowledged during his life, Nate placed himself gently in history without oppressing the main attention. <br /> <br /> Examining the magnificent Salk Institute in California, Nate evokes the mythical use of space and light in its buildings, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for spectators. Nate's rollerblading shot in Salk's smoky white lounge emphasizes the building's harmony with nature. It's breathtaking. My architect also covers the difficulties Louis Kahn has had in making his designs be accepted. Several fantastic buildings exist only on paper, rejected by more practical architects and property developers. It was only when Louis Kahn went to the East that his visions were received with enthusiasm. In India, where he built the management institute <br /> <br />, a former collaborator describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent Palace of the National Assembly, citizens consider him a father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Watching My Architect is a wonderful way to start or continue to learn about architecture and the importance of space. But it is the irony of Lou Kahn's egotism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.
