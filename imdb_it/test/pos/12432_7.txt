Well, it must be said that Monster Man is a huge mess of a movie, but somehow several different genres and a cliché storyline come together to make one of the funniest modern horror movies I've ever seen in different eras! The two biggest styles that the film mixes are a "Road Trip" teenage comedy and a horror-style "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" horror style, while the other often gets in the way; director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant change of tone means that we are never quite sure where the next movie will be. Things start worryingly when two characters are introduced, both irritating in different ways. Adam is a shameful virgin, while Harley is an "A-hole" with a big mouth. They are both driving through the desert to attend the wedding of a girl they both loved in high school. After a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitchhiker, and then find themselves chased by some maniac on a monster truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​someone being chased by someone else in a vehicle more big is not at all original, but the way the monster is used here is one of the greatest advantages of the film. The truck itself looks scary because it is so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces off the screen makes the action exciting and thrilling. After a while, you start to get used to the characters and when Aimee Brooks enters the fray, things start looking. The teen comedy part of the film works really well, as Justin Ulrich is always available to provide some fun lines of dialogue and the scenes between the shameful virgin and the female enthusiast are quite interesting. Just when you think the film can never become more messy, things take a turn for the strange in the third final. Without ruining things, it must be said that Monster Man presents that kind of final that cannot be seen coming, and together with the twist, it is a great surprise. Some people may feel robbed by the sudden turnaround at the end - but in reality I thought it worked pretty well as it adapted to the film, meaning that nothing really fit here ... Overall, this is not a "big" movie with any medium - but if you are looking for some silly entertainment, Monster Man should hit the shot!
