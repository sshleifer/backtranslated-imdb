.. is the princess bride meets ... well Trainspotting. But wait, really, it's a good combination! This was certainly one of the best films I've seen in a long time ... it has the kind of witty dialogue I associate with The Princess Bride or Cemetery man, along with the disgusting scenes of violence in a horror movie ... the Princess Bride's heroic atmosphere combined with the (this is odd) lack of really good guys that Trainspotting had. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it was VERY like Princess Bride, but it was in the arena, and it swayed. Some of the dialogues transcend the pleasure of genius, the plot is interesting, the characters - while SLIGHTLY anachronistic - are anachronistic not for their intrinsic nature (there were FAMOUSly gay in the XVIII century, contrary to the previous observations of a reviewer) but only in some of the language they used. The anachronisms made it still fun, and NOT picky and easy to liquidate. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read a Garrett series by Simon R. Green, or Gleen Cook, you know EXACTLY what this movie is. Check it out. It's great.
