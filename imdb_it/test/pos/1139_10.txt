If you listen to Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what's going on with "Split". I discovered that watching the movie under the influence of LSD helped to tackle the audio / video tracers from a fantastic editing job. The plot was important only from the second to the second. The acid has helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general rhythm of this masterpiece. Don't worry about writing something about your understanding ... There isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at the crudest, most amateur level. I challenge anyone to make a film that can match my mind and change the way I look at visual arts and the reality of the world. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet been explored by this human mind. I love the vision of Chris Shaw. I also appreciate the terrorist texturing film "The Begotten" by E. Elias Merhige.
