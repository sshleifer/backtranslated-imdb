'This Is Not a Film' works because it's so true in what it's trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus on the message, you'll see a little bit of yourself in the main character, Michael. Both male and female, we all came to a point in our lives where we want to look back and re-examine a situation or a relationship. Did it really happen as remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything else, he wants to make himself feel better about how things went. But even so, he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. We wouldn't be in them otherwise. At the end of the film, I'm not sure Michael learned anything new about him or not. Our best indicator on the relationship is through his friend, Nadia. She is the soul of the film and reminds us that there are always two parts to each story. I found Michael pompous, arrogant, and simply clueless. That's exactly why I liked it. He is a real character. If you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship, then this is a movie for you. In closing, it's a film for everyone.
