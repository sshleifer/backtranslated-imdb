This is one of the best TV movies I've ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but come on, all TV movies are like that! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous, but it is based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage. He abandons his wife and children and then fakes his death! Everything could be with Alyson (Karen Sillas). How far will Dave keep his secret? <br /> <br /> Acting is top notch for TV movies. Gary Cole in particular keeps the film together as a charming and casual sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife becomes suspicious. Karen Sillas does her best as a wife who finds out that her husband is a LIAR and doesn't know what to do about it. Teddi Siddall, who I believe is Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays her part well especially when she cries about her husband's "death". Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch to Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is great in her small role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but acting and history bring this film to multiple levels.
