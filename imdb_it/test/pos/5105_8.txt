One night he captured this 1969 film on a TCM cable. I remember when I saw the film in Hong Kong for the first time, I really liked the songs and shows of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark at its best in "Finian's Rainbow" (1968) by Francis Ford Coppola with Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Simply ecstatic to know that, finally, this delicious gold plate with an Irish flavor is published on DVD! Ah, "it's that old devil moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole in the role of Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - rather a liberation. He may not be a veteran in musicals like Rex Harrison, but he has inhabited the role beautifully. The scene of him running across the lawn in his flying cloak reminds me of the PBS series, "To serve them all my days" - a lovable school teacher and loving man, he is, "Mr. Chipey '. Clark and "O'Toole somehow gave us the right mix of sperm and circumstance. Leslie Bricusse's songs and lyrics are catchy as usual. The" You and Me "and" Walk Through the World (with Me) "melodies are stay with me at most all these years And there is "How many flowers", "And the sky smiled", "Fill the world with love" - ​​it's not syrupy at all. Sometimes I think that if the world is immersed in words and in Bricusse's words, we would overcome all the struggles on earth and "adorable" will be all our time! Yes, even "Speak with animals". ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) <br /> <br /> Musicals are a blessing for the world of spectators, they are somewhat larger than life, like the music and lyrics of the Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who wouldn't feel absolutely delighted simply by saying "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" "? I was also tickled by a single song and dance number in the Spanish film "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000). My favorite of all time is "Young Girls of Rochefort" by French filmmaker Jacques Demy (1967) with the colorful cast of Catherine Deneuve and (deceased sister) Francoise Dorléac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris who they sing, dancing The music of Michel Legrand. Long live musicals.
