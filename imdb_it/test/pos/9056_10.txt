I usually avoid film festivals and don't like slap-stick comedy, but I have to say this photo was fantastic. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the "Numbers" television show and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were better than usual. This is a comedy on an incredibly high level with visual, spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience, and I, laughing about a rather ingrained plot. Congratulations to Mr. Parness for dealing with a delicate, but real, subject in a way that can be enjoyed but completely absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect. The plot remains intact throughout the film and the comic relief adds to the message without being too often distorted. The fusion of the segways is well done and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful. <br /> <br /> I can certainly say that this film is one that will go very far and should be seen by an audience of all ages; the problem is real and so is the strong impact of this production.
