This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I've ever played. The plot is a bit uncertain, but the game never fails to send you a lot of chills and excitement. Many people have shelved the game when they discovered that there are no tricks for this and potions and ammunition for health very small to find. But in reality, once you've tackled the game once, you're more familiar with monsters and different rooms, so you can easily get the second time around. The puzzles are fantastic, not too difficult, not too easy. There are lots of different monsters so you will never get bored. And there are many play areas. You really feel like you're in a good Stephen King novel while you play. It is beautiful and disturbing. Choose this inexpensive game and have fun.
