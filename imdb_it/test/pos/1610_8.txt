Set in Venice mainly at the Lido, "Death in Venice" by Visconti is a triumph of cinema that combines the excellence of the characterization of Dirk Bogarde and the resort's expert photography in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a movie to love. <br /> <br /> Mahler's music, often heard during the film, increases the drama. The atmosphere he creates is not always happy. But then what else would you expect with a title like that? <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the film. Quite poor indeed. They are above all background noises, chatter and laughter among hotel guests. The intriguing part is interpreting the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach, a renowned composer and a very young teenager Tadzio who occasionally see each other on the tables of the hotel dining room, on the beach and in strange and unexpected places around Venice. They seem timidly to recognize each other's presence at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile, but later with a strong and compelling and urgent look. <br /> <br /> Each viewer will have his own interpretation. The composer has lost a child of his own. Is this behavior an expression of desire for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed and slightly boyish gaze? Could he discover any new inspiration for a musical masterpiece not yet written? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th-century Venice. The elegance of the ladies, the sun loungers on the sand, the children enjoying themselves in bathing suits, the glare of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction for the world. While some may think that the rhythm is rather slow, sometimes the film has a delicate general quality, but with a latent indecision between two repressed human beings. Get ready for a sad and beautiful ending.
