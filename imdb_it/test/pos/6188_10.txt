<br /> <br /> There's something about watching a movie in an old-fashioned movie theater that adds tremendous appeal to every image. I, fortunately, was able to see a couple of Ernst Lubitsch comedies at the New York Film Forum during their three-week tribute to the legendary director. The double film I attended was the screening of Lubitsch's 1938 comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and the classic pre-Code Design for Living, none of which I had ever seen before. Everything I read about Design for Living praised the film, but I couldn't find a good review for Bluebeard's Eighth Wife. Leonard Maltin didn't like it. Even VideoHound gave the play a low score. The IMDB score was not free. Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) blew up the movie in her pungent review. So when I went to town that day, I expected to just enjoy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and I completely adore Design for Living. The Eighth Bluebeard's Wife (who first showed) began, while the eccentrics that populated the cinema took their place and the music of the thirties diminished. "Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Bluebeard's Ethics by Ernst Lubitsch," he read the title. Then the photo opened with a hilarious scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajamas, but he doesn't want any part of the fund! He begins to quarrel with the clerk, who seeks the help of his chief superiors, and their seems to be no end to the discussion. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the most beautiful, fascinating and talented personalities of cinema of the Thirties. "I'll take the bottom", kindly question. And there you have perhaps the most beautiful screwball comedies ever. The film has kept my interest wonderfully. I found myself laughing almost constantly. When Colbert discovers, shortly before a family portrait is portrayed, that his future husband has been married seven times, the entire theater has entered into hysteria. When he does business for money immediately after overcoming the shock, the laughter (which has not yet ceased) intensifies. And Edward Everett Horton also moved some hilarious reactions from the script. When Cooper draws from Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew in disciplining his wife by slapping her in the face, I couldn't control my laughter when she slapped him back. And the drunken scene with shallots is one of Claudette Colbert's funniest comic scenes. The film's biggest comic moment came when Colbert promoted a boxer to "teach her husband a lesson". In pure broom style, he puts the wrong man out of action, instead he puts his friend David Niven into a cold sleep. He wakes up while Cooper is coming. To cover the situation, Colbert herself, in a moment of strong sensuality, leans her fist on Niven, asks: "Where did that man hit you? Here? Right here? Right here?" and then BAM! hits him again! The film was wonderful, from the beginning to the end it was a perfect pleasure. I too loved Design for Living, even if I dare say that I think out of pure laugh and entertainment. Bluebeard Wife was the best and funniest movie. There is a certain fascination with watching a vintage movie on the big screen. And in the presence of others who laugh, you feel more comfortable doing it yourself. maybe, the reason why I felt the way I acted for Bluebeard's Eighth Wife.
