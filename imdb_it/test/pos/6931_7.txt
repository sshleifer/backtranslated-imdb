I was in the world premiere of this movie, and I even met Todd in pairs around the city (once at Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he is just a small film director with little or no budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it's nice if you like zombie movies with a very small plot and lots of blood and guts. You get to see some places in Kansas City and lots of raw meat, what could be better? :-) Look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (with only a change of clothes or hats). You can have a good game of drinking with this movie, take a shot every time you see the same zombie in a different shirt.
