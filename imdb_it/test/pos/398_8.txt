<br /> <br /> "The Last Frontier" is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its history of hunters Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relations with the army in particular Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as explorers after losing their stocks to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adapt to living the "civilized" life within a fort on the edge of the "last frontier". Jed, who was raised by Gus, inspires them both and looks at the "old" Gus and Mungo, and has a particularly difficult time facing "civilization". His real problems begin after becoming strongly attracted to the Colonel's wife, Corrina. Colonel Marston is a reckless man who endangers all those around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. Corrina, a woman repressed by her station and with a sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. In the middle is Captain Riordon, a courageous and sympathetic man torn between his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the probable disastrous consequences of the colonel's unconsciousness. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that, in most cases, the weaknesses and strengths of The Last Frontier are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the insipid title and the dated music) <br /> <br /> First, the script. Almost all the subplots (in particular, the reckless Colonel) have been better done elsewhere, but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity. Just when you think you know what will happen next, it takes off in a DIFFERENT direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: "The Last Frontier" is a film of "production code" (on the day when the word "virgin" was taboo), it is very surprising that the adultery factor was managed in such a mature and tolerant way. I expected Jed or the colonel's wife to pick up some punishment for their sin. I was surprised and a little disappointed that the film did not use this expectation to create a less predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Second, the casting. Mature is at least ten years old to play the part of Jed, the innocent with wild eyes raised in the woods ". James Whitmore, who plays Gus," the man who raised Jed "is actually five years younger than However, Maturo is very attractive, he plays a character who is innocent of civilization but he is not stupid at all, although there were several actors who could have played the role at that time (particularly Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), no one could have better to interpret Jed Preston (also a junior of Mature) plays Colonel Marston, who lacks the tics and affectations one would expect from such a determined man.However, Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor that someone must have seen in "Marston to promote such a reckless fool to the rank of Colonel. Bancroft is a particularly shrewd choice like Corrina. The dark hair of Bancroft died blond, and this h to the same effect as Winona Ryder ("Edward Scissorhands") and Christina Ricci ("Sleepy Hollow"). I mean, I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; I think the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades. Moreover, Bancroft has always projected a hardness that borders on hardness (here the blond hair softens it a little, though). This allows 24-year-old Bancroft to stand upright with both the 40-year-old Maturo and 37-year-old Preston yes, it could be a colonel's wife. Madison performs a careful balancing act like Riordan, managing a complex role and sometimes sharp dialogues. Playing a role similar to John Wayne in "Fort Apache" Madison does a more skillful job. <br /> <br /> This the film has a "Silverado" type of camaraderie. This alone is worth seeing. It also has memorable performances, good action and great action and direction. I only hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost), because this film takes full advantage of this format.
