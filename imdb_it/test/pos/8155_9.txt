Hey boy, this movie is all about the choices. Every time in your life you have to choose something or simply disappear ... And this movie proves it! Of course, life is not like a beautiful image as this film shows ... it doesn't really show, but some can understand it. I am trying to say that he is full of pain, love and profound lessons of life. Aaron, the Mormon missionary is the true pastor who digs the beautiful thing at the bottom of Chisthian, the guy who feels the skin ... <br /> <br /> It's a great end and you always believe in destiny because it will surprise you in one round or another of your live shows like Latter Days ... <br /> <br /> Big deal watch it !!!
