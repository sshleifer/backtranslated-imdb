I hope the summary line does not irritate you so much (it is a small tribute to the Chappelle / Charlie Murphy show, but also to the character Daywalker). But I will try to put all the things I liked about the film in a paragraph and everything I don't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things! The phrase "strong bloody violence" (used by the evaluation sheets, to describe the content of a film, fits very well. This is not a film for children! Or for the faint of heart! Ha Blade as central character (Wesley Snipes it's phenomenal) and a crazy enough plot to contain / justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. Even the action scenes are fantastic. <br /> <br /> OK to Things that I didn't like The general story is too thin, it's enough as I wrote above to keep the action scenes together, but there could be more and a character like Blade deserves more (imo). even the use of clich√©s does not help. Some characters are written ... This is that !: o)
