Bug Juice changed my life. I know it sounds weird, weird, weird. But it happened. I come from England, Bug Juice never went on air, but five years ago I went on vacation with my family and saw it on the Disney channel. I once saw this TV series that I was hooked. I wanted to convince my parents a lot to let my brother and I go to Waziyatah. I've been going since I was 12 and it was my fourth year this summer. If you are a teenager reading this come into this field change your life. make life long friendship with Wazi. It doesn't matter who you are or if someone at home doesn't like everyone you like at the camp. You have so much fun If you want to take a look go to www.wazi.com and take a look at yourself. It's so funny that I love it. It's my home away from home
