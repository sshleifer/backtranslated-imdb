Considered as one of Hollywood's recent exaggerated dramas, this film excels where others have totally failed (especially considering the most underrated performance in Natalie Portman's recent dramatic interpretation of the character), this film is almost unanimously driven by chemistry that they share both Susan and Natalie. They seem so natural during the film that you would exchange them for a real family. They pass through so many mother-daughter conflicts in history their kind of hard to not grasp on their acting skills. I feel that the talented performances of these two actresses have seized the point where the story was lacking and almost too familiar (full of clich√©s) and really saved the story of suffering. I would recommend this film mainly to those who love one of the two actresses or such an exaggerated drama.
