This is definitely a good movie unlike what others say. Peline and I have seen the 3x movie and the end is poor but this is part of the package ... experiencing death is like trying to challenge it, so the film is beautiful. For those wishing to watch a classic Kevin Bacon film, see this please. take care of greeting from Istanbul. we will write 10 lines if we really want 2 but we think it is a waste of time hi The rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we have just written it to fill the 10 line requirement (which is crazy) but we are kind people and therefore we will adapt to the rules we are established. So people watch this film not because we wrote 10 lines, but because it's good. and the way we wrote 12 lines !!
