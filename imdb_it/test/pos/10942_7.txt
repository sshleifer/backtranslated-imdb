The fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a plot mess and the acting of those who have nicknamed the voices is almost universally bad, but the premise is compelling, the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the film is often quite funny . It is a pity that the story is such a disaster. There are a couple of places where I had no idea what had just happened, it was like they had just been cut off five minutes and you were suddenly on the next scene without knowing how you got there. The film is scarce in explaining things and some things don't make much sense, but the film moves in a convulsive way, so its flaws are barely registered. It's not a great film, but it's certainly fun.
