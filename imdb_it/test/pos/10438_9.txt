I loved this movie, I tried to buy it and I can't find it. a must see, a movie that you can see again and again, fun but also a rip in one. really good album for the movie. it's really a good movie from the 80s, I wish I could find a copy to buy this movie, because I'd do it, the actors played really well. There are a lot of people out there who could probably relate to this movie. This is what makes this movie film so good. so go out and try to rent this, you won't regret it. it's an older film but it's worth watching, I wouldn't be surprised if they did a remake of this movie soon, but I'm sure it wouldn't be the same. anyone who has not seen it must be rented.
