E. Elias Merhige's Begotten is a unique and surreal representation of humanity's treatment of religion. There are a couple of ways in which you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: a god flies out and from his corpse gushes mother earth. Mother Earth then pretends to be the corpse of the post-mortem god, and then imbues herself with what remains of her descendants. Later, he gave birth to a messianic figure that vibrates, presumably in childhood, but perhaps with the terror of being brought back to life on earth. All this happens in the first 15-30 minutes, and then the rest of the film consists of dressed figures who drag the messiah (who is incessantly trembling, or grabbing) through a desert landscape. The dressed figures stop only to brutalize the messiah, then they continue to drag him around. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of ways to interpret it, depending on your level of optimism and your view of the world. It can easily be interpreted as a bleak atheistic nihilist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that Christian "gods" can be perceived to be present in a modern society that only invokes their names to advance their selfish goals. Or you can interpret it as a post-modern pro-Christian allegory, in which you consider the film as the way in which humanity has distorted the message of Christ so much that the purity and original innocence can no longer be relevant in a world in where that message and image are used inappropriately to approve anything, from interpersonal violence, to war, to totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The images in this film are phenomenal and you won't see anything like it, period. If you can, look at the original VHS version, I recommend it. I'm not sure that the images have been modified on the DVD, but I have seen some clips of this streaming on you tube and the effects have seriously decreased. On the VHS version, Merhige obtained TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. It means, in practice there are no intermediate tones except for some grains in some of the shots. In addition to this, this film offers the rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black, and the result is surprising, hallucinatory and rather disturbing. This film makes Film Noir look decidedly faded and mediocre. The shots fade each other in a surreal way that reminds of A Chien Andalou without ever mimicking it, for an effect that has been called a Rorschach film test. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the film can certainly prove the patience and commitment of the viewer. There is no dialogue for beginners. The only sound in the whole film is a fairly constant cycle of chirping crickets, punctuated from time to time with the gurgling and death rattles of the dying deities, and a plot of amelodic melodic synthesizer. Personally, I find that the film enjoys at best listening to experimental industrial music such as the NIN instrumental remixes of the downhill Spiral era, more abstract noise / experimental music like F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works very well with apocalyptic black metal. Virtually any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most surprising and versatile aspects of this film, it is PRIME for postmodern re-contextualization, how to project it during an avant-garde music performance, or to compose avant-garde music to accompany it. <br /> <br /> Once the figure of the Messiah is born, there is not really much change for the rest of the film, which means that you are practically sitting in at least 45 minutes or more of the figure of the Messiah being a drug in the desert and beaten. It sounds exquisitely beautiful, but in reality there is nothing new that can be deployed. It helps to cement the intentions of filmmakers to communicate that for thousands of years people have been using the name and image of Christ for personal benefits, but it can be boring for an occasional spectator or someone with poor attention span. Basically, if you're looking for a modern horror film with suspense, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a unique cinematic experience and don't particularly like Hollywood cinema, this could be your terrible messiah.
