Ok, so this was not what I expected. I rented this movie just to see what it would be like, since I want to see the first one anyway. But this movie had B-movies everywhere. But when I saw it I knew it was a lot of fun. For the first 30 minutes It was just like the snowman was making people fly and a man lost his sanity. But those first minutes contained some strange lining. When he throws the first of his little servants I knew it would be very, very funny. They all act like the gremlins in the number eight of the four successful gremlins that made it look like they were spoiling it and made me forget it was a B-movie. So if you feel like laughing, rent this.
