This mischievously relaxed, low-key, casual and casual Australian thriller unfolds with casual ease and self-confidence that is a delight for the eyes. Jimmy, an eager working-class beaver child (an irresponsible Heath Ledger) yearns to do something out of his ordinary life without reward. Jimmy gets his big break when local crime boss Pando (an exceptional Bryan Brown) gives him an easy courier that involves the delivery of $ 10 dollars to an old lady. Jimmy finds himself on his knees in serious trouble when he loses Pando's money. The compelling story of Gregor Jordan, writer / director, on how things are not always what they have become, young love, all actions with consequences and that old brownhead on how crime does not pay works like a spell thanks to a wonderful one richness of minor minor details that are well observed, a strong subtext concerning the ability to duel man both for good and for evil, a good sense of forced irony, the chilling way in which violence is presented and the wonderful foundation of assorted complex warts and all the characters of a low life in a banal reality instantly recognizable and totally credible (for example, Panda is shown playing Scrabble with an idiot and at some point interrupts a working conversation with a colleague to talk to his son on the phone). Judging by his portrayal of finely shaded cunning and two daggers, not to joke with Pando, Bryan Brown undoubtedly qualifies himself as one of the best actors forever the grace of celluloid. A small robust and satisfying sleeper.
