What this movie is not: Fantastic, Funny <br /> <br /> What is this film: Visually interesting, Hard to overcome, Intentional <br /> <br /> I feel that this film puts the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a time clip in which they experience a world without language. Just like animals have to live the world. You don't really watch this film as much as you witness a terrible series of events in what "looks" like real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently, it goes on much longer than is comfortable. This film could be reduced to 20 minutes and would be a completely different film. It would be nice and fun, but the experience would be lost. I've seen a lot of interesting movies, but I've never seen one like it. If you can put your head in the right place for this, you should be able to really appreciate (but probably not "enjoy") what they have achieved here. 10 out of 10.
