One of the most gruesome, depressing, but eye-opening documents. I've seen for a while. There is no narration or story told, only a "third eye" type camera that follows about 2 pairs of heroin addicts in New York during the seasons. Watching them shoot on the floors of public baths then "clean" their needles in public restrooms ... sometimes it's a bit too much and you have to take a break just to take a break. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is currently recovering alcohol / drugs should watch it when it is eager - it really shows you what you could come back to! After seeing this it is a wonder how someone can even try this drug to begin with. <br /> <br /> The only thing he needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today. Judging by what is shown in the document, there is no hope for any of them. They say they want to improve and stop, but it seems that the only end to their habits is to stop dying. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for all audiences. I found myself looking at a car accident - after I started looking at it, I couldn't turn it off. I had to keep looking with a dark / morbid fascination of what it is like in the lives of these addicts.
