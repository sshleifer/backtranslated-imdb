The trailer for this film has focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the film, which is about a developing, albeit rather simple, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they try take back their past pains between them. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the premise of a chain-nymphomaniac, it is no surprise that there is a lot of implicit sex involved. However, at its core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person. Maybe it's just me, but I think poor Lazarus should have focused more on his story. He is a ferocious man after his wife leaves him, but we never completely see how he can help Rae solve his past pains. It is only implied that he does - in essence, he interprets the magician who helps the young Rae to overcome his curse, through a big chain and a bit of blues. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I wish it was a little more uniform and didn't have to rely on the sensational. The secondary characters were pretty decent, if simple and I liked music. The acting was pretty good, although I can't be sure that Rae's character is fully credible. But it could just be my naivety. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked the movie, but I wasn't forced to. Maybe it's that I'm too critical, but the story seems a little too comfortable to be fully credible and so, while it all seemed very nice, I could never really buy it. The chain thing was a bit too far-fetched for me. However, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a stroke of blues. 7/10
