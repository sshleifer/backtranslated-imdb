If you take the movie for what it's worth, you won't be disappointed. If you think Murray should win an Oscar for his performance and this is the kind of movie you expect, don't worry. It was fun when I saw it in 1979 and it hasn't lost its charm. Good clean fun for the children and carefree entertainment for the elderly. The plot is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but this is his first film. The film reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained. Morty is the chief donkey and plays the perfect part. The other advisers are typically teenagers with the desire to have fun during the summer. A nice thing about this movie, it has a message.
