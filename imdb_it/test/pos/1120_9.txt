One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings and I like Walter Matthau. I miss and I'm glad to have a great movie like this to remind me why it was so wonderful. Watch it with your children (or your horse). <br /> <br /> The story of an old horse trainer with tough boots for children, and his luck. If you've ever had or enjoyed horse racing you'll appreciate the texture of the stables and the riches. It may be a little below "Seabiscuit", but not much. The story is the same, except it's the quarter horse version. Well played, correct terms and equipment, and beautiful racing scenes. Don't believe me, take it and decide for yourself.
