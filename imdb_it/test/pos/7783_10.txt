The summary is only for those who hate this movie, how to find the film OK or average is acceptable. Visiting this movie on IMDb made me nostalgic, because I can't stop myself from returning in 1994. I was one of the lucky few who saw this film in theaters. It immediately became one of my favorite comedies and it took a few years to make it my favorite. How can I tell what made this movie my favorite? It was excellent writing (the story was OK, but the script and dialogues were fabulous). Were the superlative performances? Was it the atmosphere of the movie? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for so many years, I say it must be a mix. It is one of those films that have no flaws, not even his music. (The other film that comes to mind right now is Sholay) <br /> <br /> PS: Rajkumar Santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee ..........
