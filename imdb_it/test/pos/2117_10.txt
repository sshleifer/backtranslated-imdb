My mother and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait, but in the end we had the opportunity to see the premiere of the film at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film that not only describes the beautiful Texan landscape, but also has a fantastic plot. It was well written, directed and produced and my mom and I loved it from start to finish! Thanks Jay for giving us the opportunity to be part of the premiere of this wonderful film. It was a night we will never forget. As if seeing the movie was not enough, we also had the luck to find 4 rows in front of my favorite singer, George Strait !! Thanks thanks thanks!! Keep up the good work, thanks! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Vale, TX
