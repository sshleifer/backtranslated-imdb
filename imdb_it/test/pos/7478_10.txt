I loved this movie! Fantastic original and different! A solid, intense, hard-core and suspense film that has the right touch of humor (dark?). If you are tired of the typical, exaggerated, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. movies, how many big explosions and horrible and unrealistic shootings are unleashed in gunfights that insult your intelligence, so this movie is for you. Fantastic characters who are wonderfully original and believable and solid performances of all the actors, not a weak character or a performance in the film. The Skip Woods film is a breath of fresh air and I appreciate its originality and efforts, its film has the feeling of a cross between a Quentin Tarantino and a Cohen brothers movie (it's not a bad mix in my opinion ). This movie takes you by the throat and does not give up, there is nothing boring or chewing gum on this film. The only disappointment is that nobody seems to know, all those to whom I have recommended to thank me and have shared my opinion on the matter. This film is a welcome change / alternative from the traditional Hollywood trash in a box produced today, even with their big names, big explosions, special effects and huge budgets. It's incredibly wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw (I mean that, in a good way, no fake Hollywood record here) rides. Thanks to everyone involved in making this film, you did an incredible job!
