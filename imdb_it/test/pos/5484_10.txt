I just saw this movie for the first time last night. Wow! What film! This is the kind of movie you want to see everyone in the world because it's so beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say a word about the plot because I think it would be better for people to go cold. DO NOT READ THE PLOT SUMMARY before watching the movie! All I will say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson and the screenplay by Jeff Maguire are top notch. I wish all thrillers were more like this.
