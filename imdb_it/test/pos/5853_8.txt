I find it hard to believe that this can happen. We don't know if Justin and Richard were upset or had committed crimes in the past. The film seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. So the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play and push with the cops? How do they take any girl and simply say that you are? Richard also seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort, nor do women seem to struggle. Hmmm. The whole concept is really hard to believe. That said, let's move on. I really found myself hating these punks and I would like to have been present with my gun fired with police tactical ammunition and see how their plastic suits behave. As for Cassie who was a victim of Carl Hudson, she has a horrible time trying to survive. The memory of being stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional confusion. Sandra does a great job of acting. It sure made me believe he was an angry cop. As for the resolution of the crime, I thought it was great. This film kept me stuck in my chair. I liked the acting of everyone except Sam. He didn't get up and leave. The only thing this film didn't need was the love scene or should I say the rape scene.
