Too bad the Monkees. People always accused them of being fabricated (which they were) or of being nothing more than an American Beatles knock-off (again, but they were) but for the children of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who was better The Monkees or The Beatles were common in school yards but critics, well, they never got us enough. Despite having recorded some classic and catchy pop songs, Monkess have not received much respect for their albums. Unfortunately a similar fate has been reached by their only cinematographic vehicle, despite the fact that it is the best film ever. Beatles fans might argue that "Hard Days Night" was better and I'm sure many of the guys think "8 Mile" is superior, but none of these films was as bold and inventive as "Head" and this is probably the why he failed. <br /> <br /> If Head had told a story of type A to B perhaps he would have appealed to the young fans of the band, but pushing the envelope and taking advantage of the film's opportunity to mock his image have really sabotaged the film with their fans. You could imagine that Eminem turns to the camera and actually talks about how sad it is that he is the best-selling guy in a genre where only 5% (and I'm generous) of the acts are white. If you can imagine it, then you have an idea of ​​how audacious it was for Monkess to sing "Hey, we are the Monkees. You know that we like it for pleasure. A fabricated image, without philosophy". When you have a movie in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on the dance, and more on the music it is clear that there is much more than you then expected. <br /> <br /> The story, what is there, concerns the boys who try to escape from their manager, who at some point forces them to play dandruff in an advertising spot, but every time they escape they end up inside a box. I don't think you have to be Fellini to understand the symbolism of that piece. Some small comic comedies follow with Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dip in the big match and Peter refuses to throw away an ice cream cone he doesn't want because there are hungry children so it's wrong to waste food but the real The strength of this film is the music and it is among the best that the band has ever recorded. Even if you're discouraged by history, you can relax and enjoy some fantastic music. <br /> <br /> Every film that starts and ends with Mickey trying to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge (in the end the band follows him) will never be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of the band or experimental cinema of the epoch of how much you will like this film.
