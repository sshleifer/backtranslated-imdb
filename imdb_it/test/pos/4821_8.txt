You rarely see a cinematic sequel that exceeds or even equals the size of its original predecessor. A film like that is Vivid Encounters 2. <br /> <br /> It's a couple of college kids selling virtual sex to the entire campus. If you like to see naked chicks, this offers. Chrissy Styler is a meter and a half high and is a fantastic specimen and you will dream about it for days if you are ever lucky enough to catch the unrated version. Wear the right amount of body glitter in its multiple nude scenes and its giant boxes look real. (= Giddyup !! <br /> <br /> <br /> W / the exception of "Aliens" by James Cameron, "The Godfather Part II" by Francis For Coppola and - of course - "Airplane 2" by the Zuckers, this is the The only sequel in the history of cinema that takes a classic film and improves on it. <br /> <br /> The way in which this film was ignored by the academy is criminal, Nikki Fritz and the great one who is tied to the beginning (as well as the brunette who gets a rubdown towards the end) all deserves the best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Too bad, Hollywood !!!
