This is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen - from the beginning to the end it was perfect in terms of time, atmosphere, punch lines, background music, combat sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of. To be absolutely honest, I find this movie as fun as the "Rik & Ade" sitcom "Bottom", maybe even more fun. I laughed constantly throughout the film and can only recommend seeing this movie ... However, if you look at it without knowing (or appreciating?) The kind of comedy that Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson have already done, you might not think it's funny to everything - but I can't really understand who doesn't appreciate it - THIS IS A HUMAN SLUT !!! (People are hit with frying pans, guys who go around wearing red rubber lingerie, green vomit that fills the corridors, guys who kick themselves in b ****** and get candlesticks in their eyes - HOW NOT can it be fun ???) 10/10
