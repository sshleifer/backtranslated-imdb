This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of the American film noir of the '40s, completed with a surprise touch at the end. It's exciting from beginning to end. My only criticism is its poor production values. The film seems cheap, and probably it was, so black and white cinematography is far inferior to Godard's Vivre Sa Vie, to quote another film noir over 30 years ago. Most subtitles are often difficult to read. When filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so they can be read on a white background. I would give an overall 8, although with better production values ​​it could have been higher.
