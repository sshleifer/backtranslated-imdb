I saw this movie last night on HBO and I didn't expect to get nervous. I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened and you will too. It's a tragic documentary (winner of the 2002 Academy Award) on a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, and subsequent investigations, arrests and trials of a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie today and get an idea of ​​how we have progressed as a society. This film was the most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - you will be moved to tears.
