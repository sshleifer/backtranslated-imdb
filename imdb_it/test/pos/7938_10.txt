Alexander Nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematographic works that pass from pastoral to lament and end in a triumphal cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic knights in a battle on the ice of Lake Peipus. <br /> <br /> The film is a splendid historical show that shows director Sergei Eisenstein to his most inventively pictorial and climax in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Dr. Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was kept out of circulation due to the change of political winds, and then recorded as perhaps the most influential historical Soviet film made.
