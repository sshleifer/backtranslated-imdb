I watched this movie on the LOGO television today. I was absolutely fascinated by the powerful messages and the plot of this movie. I don't want to ruin it. I will say this, I referred to Aaron's inner struggle and his education. As a homosexual who grew up in a small town, I connected the "big secret" and the choices I made so well. This film has had a huge impact on me and I'm going to buy a copy for my personal library in the near future. I never finished the film and started calling my friends to recommend it. He had this profound effect on me. Who reads this comment Look at it. Try to have as little distraction as possible. Also, keep an open mind. This is not a movie that can be seen as a Disney movie or the movie of the week. Instead, take the time to actively watch and listen to the dialogue as well as read between the lines and get involved in the plot. You may find yourself in tears. Not since "Steel Magnolias" I was moved to tears by a movie. This has done just that. Thanks to the cast, screenwriter and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic movie about homosexuality and religion. Was late LONG.
