I thought it would be a bad movie, honestly, I mean, Rupert Grint, RON, acting in a movie other than Harry Potter, was really hard to imagine. But when the film started, he showed that this guy has talent, I mean, he's the best actor in the HP trio, by reference, did you see Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniel's acting? Both lack experience even though they starred in a million Harry Potter films. Ben, his character is a very shy guy, unable to show his true feelings about everything, his contempt for his sovereign mother and resentful anger against his father who is unable to intervene and face his unfaithful wife . Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! His interpretation of an old retired actress who tries to live with the shadow of her past, while trying to remember the Shakespearean sonnets is absolutely wonderful! Furthermore, it seems that many young people are wasted in meaningless religious acts.
