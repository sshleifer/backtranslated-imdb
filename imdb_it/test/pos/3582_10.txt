The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we've ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling in space! We saw this with our 10 and 7 year olds and all four of us were unable to retire. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information we never learned in school. It is also the best vision we have seen from any television or film in the delicate balance of our earth ecosystem. The amount of time and effort it takes to capture these shots is very obvious when you sit down and watch this series. <br /> <br /> To see for everyone.
