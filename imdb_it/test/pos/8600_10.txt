In light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (ie typhoon Ondoy), I thought to review "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), the obsessive black and white masterpiece of Shohei Imamura on the destruction and after effects of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima during the closing period of the Second World War. The destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality, but the trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) are still there. <br /> <br /> It is a testament to the power of a film that its images remain as powerful and indelible as when they were first seen. It's just that the difference now, in my case, is that looking at those images has taken on a greater sense of intensity and power due to the direct experience of an almost monumental atmospheric calamity. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthiness: "The Pornographers: Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge" (2001), his two Golden Palm Winners "Ballad of Narayama" (1983) and "The Eel" (1997), to name a few. Given the mood of his films, who would have ever thought he was assistant director to Yasujiro Ozu, the most austere and minimalist filmmaker of Japanese cinema? But then, it is Ozu's rigorous formality and domesticity to which Imamura was rebelling. <br /> <br /> But then again, with "Black Rain" you can unmistakably perceive Ozu's footprints. The father (or paternal figure) is determined to see his daughter get married before time runs out on both, and the stillness and calmness of the scenes that show all family members together (in particular, the dinner scenes or Ozu the lexicon of the film, the tatami) is something that the revered filmmaker would explore perpetually in his works ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). In essence, the subdued and deliberate quality of "Black Rain" is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanal chaos and instinctual drive of Imamura's entire filmography. <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that watching the movie would not be a completely shocking experience. "Black Rain", as rightly described by the American film critic Leonard Maltin, is "full of disturbing black and white images". In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura does not take punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of nuclear bombing, one after the other (burned bodies, hanging meat, walking dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness everywhere). An assault on the senses of viewers, surely it is, along with Takashi Kawamata's black and white somber (he made the goal of Yoshitaru Nomura's dramatic film "The Incident") and Toru Takemitsu's chilling score (he made music in classics such as "Ran" by Akira Kurosawa and "Double Suicide" by Masahiro Shinoda). <br /> <br /> Even during the alleged "quiet" phase of the film (ie, five years after the atomic attack), one cannot yet have a sense of fulfillment and order, with the discomfort and pain still strongly felt by the survivors, not only in terms of lack of physical health, but even more in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race, now unquestionably appears, was destined to carry the legacy of the bomb, for as long as it lives. <br /> <br /> I've already written a piece on "Black Rain" a few years before (published on IMDb.com), but only in comparison to the magnificent "Tin Drum" by Volker Schlondorff, another film about monumental human madness and global catastrophe. Furthermore, it has never been my habit to write twice about a film I have already written about before. It is in the light of the recent meteorological disaster that devastated our country that I was asked to re-visit and write something again about this extraordinary Imamura film, as there are lots of lessons to be learned both from the film and from the recent event regarding the imperfections and dangers of knowledge and scientific action, and the long-term scars and wounds inflicted by large-scale destruction (induced by man or nature). <br /> <br /> There have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("Testament", "Threads", "The War Game", each located within their respective countries) and "Black Rain" is in the midst of them, if not more, for his not-displeased and a melancholy portrait of individual and communal disintegration caused by atomic devastation and by the fact that it has a historical event as a base. <br /> <br /> A few weeks from now, another catastrophic Hollywood film, "2012" by Roland Emmerich, will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. As we all know, the "disaster / apocalypse" film group of this American director - "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "The Day After Tomorrow" - has no other purpose than to be a simple entertainment value, without real intuition of the nature and wisdom of the apocalyptic disaster and of the human condition affected. I wonder how this "gigantic" film can exploit the trauma, the disorientation and the apprehensions still experienced by our people due to the recent meteorological disaster. To say that this film is a precautionary story would probably be nothing but an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> But yes, I'll look again at "2012".
