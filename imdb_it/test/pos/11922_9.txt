It is worth looking at this, even if it is sometimes a mess, it's nice to see a young Sean Astin, and this ends up being a rather fun and entertaining action movie. I watched it many times when I was young, and now I still enjoy it when I put the old VHS in the machine (I happen to own a copy). So sit down with this movie, let reality go for a while and you will be able to have a good laugh and an hour and a half.
