This is my favorite Indian movie of all time. He's a comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's clothes tell a story of their own - you wonder if the designer deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie more fun (at some point she looks like she's wearing a diaper). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comic genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning to the end. There's no boring moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will make you laugh out loud. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) "regains his memory". I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count. And I'm so happy to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic film as far as I know. A.A.A is not a replica of a Hollywood movie (THANKS TO GOD). Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> Watch it you will like it !!!!!
