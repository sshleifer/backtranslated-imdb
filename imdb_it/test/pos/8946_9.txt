Two funeral directors in a Welsh village? English humor as opposed to that of the other ocean? How could I resist. My wife and I saw it on March 6th for our late Valentine's Day party and enjoyed some lovely belly laughs. We would have seen another film later, but we decided not to do it because we wanted the experience of THIS film to come with us for the evening. <br /> <br /> The mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the movie is worth the wait. It raises issues rarely discussed in the community, but I know three funeral directors, and the humor is right about the money <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and congratulations to the writers. Without you all the actors, directors and others do not have a job on any Monday.
