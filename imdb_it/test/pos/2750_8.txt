Very good "Precoder" with Dick Barthelmess, who in a way reminded me of "Only Angels Have Wings" by the Hawks (1939), in which he also performed Barthelmess. This film was directed by the magisterial William Wellman, who was responsible for the reference aviation film "Wings". <br /> <br /> Barthelmess plays an airplane pilot who takes care of the devil, accused of a plane crash. Later he meets and falls for the beautiful Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess's brother appears on the scene, a triangular relationship follows. <br /> <br /> "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and some moving and touching scenes, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (which, in my opinion, very much resembles actress Dorothy Mackaill ). Tom Brown is good as a brother of Barthelmess, fresh from his success in "Tom Brown of Culver" by Wyler. <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying acrobatics, fast-paced movies; in all, very funny. Not to be missed when TCM airs it again.
