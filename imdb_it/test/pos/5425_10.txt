Richard Condie is a Canadian wonder and should be shared with the world. Both for the first works like "Getting Started" and "Snit" nominated for an Oscar through "The Apprentice" and for "La Salla", "Condie" is a precious local hero. But no singular piece of work brings a mark to his career as "The Big Snit". And did I mention that he was nominated for an Academy Award? Bloody tootin '. <br /> <br /> "The Big Snit", although clearly a message carrier dated from the 1980s (the brief tour around the Cold War-hesitates nuclear annihilation, but don't worry about it? it's funny how hell), carries with it a broader meaning, like most of Condie's work in a minimized way. While the planet rushes in search of cover from Armageddon, a couple argues about the annoying habits of others (in true Condie style, he saws the furniture while she shakes her eyes ?? literally). And don't forget to watch it again and again, because there's always something to look at. Condie loads this character with countless visual gags and memorable phrases. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage this incredible animation track. In Canada he is usually seen in a video of the National Film Board which includes other short films (including the equally amusing "The Cat Came Back" by fellow Winnipegger Cordell Barker). Americans will only have to dig a little deeper, but do you keep doing it? the reward is worth.
