I liked the film, and the fact that it aimed quite high at dealing with a sophisticated material. I saw the film premiered, and it wasn't spoiled by any stupid videotape that ruined the ending. The performances were pretty good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature shot. I also liked the look of the film that gave it a mysterious and hostile air. I also liked some "twists and turns" in the plot, and I don't want to give too much space if the videotapes of other countries didn't give everything away! The script was a bit exaggerated at times, but I appreciated the fact that the directors were not afraid to challenge the audience with interesting and disconcerting research regarding the scroll of faith in our world. And, while some may find the ending a little too open, I appreciated the fact that the film refused to tie everything with a bow. This is not how life works.
