In the late eighties and early nineties, the decline and death of independent video companies such as Vestron and Media effectively blocked Italian horror films for much of the American public. Coincidently (?) Italian genre films have also decreased in terms of quality and profitability. <br /> <br /> Occasionally films like Primal Rage, "sequels" such as Beyond The Door III, Troll 2 and some films by Dario Argento have gone on video on video but most have remained unpublished (up to DVD) in the United States for almost a decade or more. The films of these lost years have become much sought after and discussed among horror fans. <br /> <br /> Of these films, Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most publicized because of the legions of Lucio Fulci's fans and the fact that it was not only directed but also played by their idol, Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> Although not quite the best of Fulci, it is even better than most of its subsequent efforts. His huge fan will probably love it. Even lovers of horror and Italian yellow could appreciate it, depending on their tastes, but I'm not sure of anyone else. People who only watch things in Hollywood may not want to take the word of the many positive reviews here. <br /> <br /> One thing I personally found fascinating are the scenes that probably present the only lasting contribution of Benito Mussolini to Italy, the Cinecitta Studios. The name is immediately recognizable for any fan of Italian films. Until I saw it here, I could only imagine what it was like.
