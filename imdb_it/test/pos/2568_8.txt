I am stunned and bewildered by the number of reviewers on this site who did not understand the meaning of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black / white relationships or old / young relationships, although I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw both elements to change the imagined taboos. This is not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, although the character of Christina Ricci, Rae, characterizes them. This is not a popular religion in the black community, even though religion plays an important role. It is not a love story, even if there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it is certainly not the south, where "everything is warmer", even if it is set in the south and is undeniably warm; Holy Smoke, even the writers did not understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moan is a parable on the Mississippi Delta; who hears them, who writes them, who plays them, what they are playing, how it heals them. <br /> <br /> It is as if the film producers sat down with an empty board and asked, "Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues consisted of, what would it be like?" in the rural south. Then they dream of two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes to war and his abused girlfriend sleeps with everyone in the city. Then, we immerse ourselves in grizzled worldliness, touched only a little by popular religion (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and even if they respect him, they know they can't give it to him), some violence between men and women, and much and much of smoking sexual images, including - ready to go beyond the lines? - a black man in a sleeveless shirt holding a half-naked white girl at the end of a 40-pound chain. Fill with authentic delta blues sounds, create a real blues picker, use music as the main curative element in the plot, slap the clips of Son House of the blues men at both ends and Voila - you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about on Even the climax of the film is not a conflict between the characters, but the whole city dancing the steamed dances for the hot, turbulent blues. <br /> <br /> Of course, here is a bit of a dilemma. Rae (Ricci) is destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is healed by the family religion of Lazarus (Jackson) and by firmness (and don't forget the chain). But then, we are shown the restored Rae dancing blues dancing at the end. Is it an expression of a restored healthy life force, or just more of the same scruffy behavior that ruined it in the first place? Brewer wants it in both directions, but the blues is really about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose you would say that the blues gives a healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without triggering either. I have my doubts. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson sounds so good that we forget to look at Samuel L Jackson; man is incredibly good. He also takes some of his songs in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty and warm. Christina Ricci is usually not so good. Granted, half of his work is done by the Costume that Wasn't There and by his slinky figure, but it's a wonderful combination of cynical desire, rebellion and vulnerability; Good at her, she arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he was a professional actor and not a real minister of the country. <br /> <br /> Parents need to be aware of what is coming if their children bring this home. The language is quite far from the charts, the first half hour is full of graphic sex and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means good and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator? ) Furthermore, Ricci spends half of the movie dressed for sex; if you have teenage boys, lick the screen in the middle of the movie. I do not recommend it to children of any age. Only for adults, please. <br /> <br /> That said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, popular religion and sexual abuse, and tells a story that is redeeming in many ways. It is not orthodox, but it is worth it. And, my God, it's the hot soundtrack.
