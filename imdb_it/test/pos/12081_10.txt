I saw this film when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital, having just given birth to my first and only child. I will refrain from telling you how much I was moved. Suffice it to say that the memory of the film remained with me until today, almost 23 years later. I hope I can find a copy of this film, if such a thing has ever been done. This film should be remembered fondly by anyone who has ever seen it. However, I must admit that the fact that it remains a bit obscure is fine for me. In this way, it will always be a little secret for me and also for those who have been touched by it. I've never seen Mrs Margaret play a better part. Nor have I ever seen her in a more convincing role. I will always respect her just for having accepted such a beautiful part.
