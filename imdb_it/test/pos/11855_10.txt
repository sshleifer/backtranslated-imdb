Intense, amusing, witty and, more than anything else, a social comedy about adult dating and its results, both for good and for bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged two months after a wedding date, when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to rethink the relationship and start dating other people so they don't feel so pristine when it comes to experiences sexual relations. This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr, Nicholson and their cohorts. Very clever and necessary in this moment of clumsy and condescending comedy, while containing your usual variety of comic, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated demon ... very annoying) that they also seem to have the right feeling to this heart felt comment. <br /> <br /> The film goes as the films should go these days, showing that kids are sensitive in the heart and have the moral. Most male characters are moralistic eyes and straight forward, while the woman is the new road that moves prowlers that will stop at nothing to get pleasure. The boys will appreciate the message made for the boys with self-respect, however it is easy to assume that most of the males who see this film will use its message of male sensibility that covers every defect or characteristic that a female could find offensive. However, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for its male protagonists, particularly those of Mohr, Richter, and find the director in a cameo as a seller! <br /> <br /> Females are far more promiscuous as they only talk about pleasure and what it would be like ... with someone else. However, they have friendly traits, even if they are covered by the image of sex-driven kittens. Very funny. <br /> <br /> On another level, the film follows some of its ensembles in a different relationship work. Richter meets with a stressed-out divorcee (a VERY noteworthy performance of the ever-reliable Helen Slater) named Penelope, divorced from a son who hates her for parting with her father. As the two of them deepen a relationship, the human interest is revealed and both the comedy and the tragedy of divorce are studied as well as starting over. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson have become a way to dig deep to see what happens next, and it's up to what they learned about each other and themselves to decide what will be come later. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at the right time. <br /> <br /> The management of Wallodorski is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened ... with the right ending. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film should have been distributed nationally, and I should hope it is up to some Academy Awards ... maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Whatever, this movie is a no hit miss, give it all you did fetish of romantic sex, visualized very mature and aesthetically. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
