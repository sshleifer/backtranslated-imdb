This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I thought he had never had the necessary. This until I read the brilliant reviews here. It seems that many feel like when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> It's a damn scary movie, and I've spent most of my life watching scary movies. I've always found dolls, mannequins and so damn creepy! Look at the dolls in "Beyond the Door" and, of course, the great "Trilogy of terror". And what about the magnificent Twilight Zone episode "Living Doll". Hell, dolls are scary! And the tourist trap has some moments that will keep your hair behind your neck. All supported by an excellent soundtrack that makes Connors' performance even more compelling. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the trailer for this movie on TV and late at night, "Wow, I have to see it!" It was memorable. And it's one of the only trailers I remember seeing as a child that scared me. It took me years to see it, but it was a pleasure. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this film in his book "Danse Macabre", and gives him a brilliant recommendation. An excellent company. <br /> <br /> This film will always be at the top of my list of things to see. It's a real addition to the genre of the time and deserves a place next to the best schockers of the 70s.
