From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took some time to start, at least for me, as I expected it to be an America Pie movie. But it was slightly different - a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and does his own college, performing it accordingly. As you can expect, there are a lot of parties and sexy girls in bikinis, but this movie has tried harder than your usual teen movie. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / colleagues to learn through freedom of expression and eventually "pushes him to the system". The humor was varied I loved. The whole cast has produced some fantastic performances ... let's rent it with a friend, it's a crash!
