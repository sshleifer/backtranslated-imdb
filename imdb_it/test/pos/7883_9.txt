This is a classic film that dramatizes the condition of a man who cannot adapt to changes in society and feels increasingly alienated, which leads to violence. Joe is a worker, and he is dissatisfied and angry, and everything he needs is a pretext to lash out, about which the story speaks. Alone, Joe is quiet; together with someone else, it becomes lethal. And what makes Joe's character even more appalling is that he completely rationalizes his violence so that for him not only is it not bad, is it necessary. For Joe he projects his violent tendencies on those he considers "the enemy" and therefore considers himself in a war, and in this film, the "generation gap" is described as a war. But it's just a war in Joe's mind, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he has to defend himself. Although this film was released in 1970, his message is as relevant now as it was at that time when the company continues to undergo major changes that lead to the kind of intense alienation that the film effectively dramatizes.
