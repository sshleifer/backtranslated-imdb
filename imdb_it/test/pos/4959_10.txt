Ok, here's the deal. There is this American pilot who is flying ahead, minding his own business, when suddenly he is outnumbered by evil fighter planes and non-American cowards (they are Middle Eastern types, but suffice to say that they do not like apple pie or Elvis Presley), who proceeds to bring it down. Now this American pilot wasn't doing anything wrong, but those non-American villains didn't care and before you know it he is thrown into a foreign prison and sentenced to death !! <br /> <br /> Now, what would you normally do? It happens here that the US Military would have bombed a couple of nearby cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. Those kinds of bad peace they love were probably involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine, this does not please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug and pleased look on him. It will make those Americans pay, oh yes yes! <br /> <br /> But he didn't come to terms with Doug Masters, the sixteen year old son of captured pilots. You see Doug was able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car, (which can't be that long) and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and bring his father back. So, with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, retired pilot Chappy 'Sinclair, Doug launches an air raid of two men against foreigners. <br /> <br /> Now you would think that this plan would be doomed to failure, but you would be wrong. Of course, those Middle Eastern guys could all be veteran pilots, but Doug has an ace up his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen enemy planes and detonating an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and picks up his now injured father on board the plane. Understandably, the wicked, no longer so smug, the dictator gets very angry at these antics and launches himself into the skies in an attempt to overthrow Doug. But the young boy still listens to some rock music and blows the villain out of the sky. Hurray! <br /> <br /> After Doug and Chappy shot down 90% of their air force, foreigners sent their last aircraft in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug, but soon, a US flight F16s get up and scare them away. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. It was the first film on videotape that I brought, and up to twenty years, I continued to hope that my father would be shot down in a foreign country in order to save him. But he doesn't like flying, so it didn't happen.
