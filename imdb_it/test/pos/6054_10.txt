I would like to buy this and "Thirty Seconds Over Toyko" today if available. I also saw this movie after seeing big Jack Webb billboards in his Dress Blues on the highway at age 12. Always admired Jack Weeb as a John Wayne type and American all the way. He almost became a Marine just for this film, but he served in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Army for 32 years. I haven't seen this movie on TV and I'd like to have it on DVD. At least if it was on TV, I would copy it to VHS and use it until it is available on DVD. I also have a great collection of WWII and Korean War movies and I'm always looking for new releases on DVD.
