To tell you the truth, I don't speak Tamil, and I didn't understand the film. My good friend Tamil, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I felt that I should have watched many other films from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were incredible, the work with the excellent camera and the beautiful plot. The actress "Simran", what a beauty. Give them a prize for someone's best appearance. Ding, Ding, Ding, come on, I smell an OSCAR winner. I didn't understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a great director and I hope his next film was a success.
