The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. Set in Bengal in the early 1900s, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman, Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her company. The film looks good but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of its depth in portraying the strong character of Binodini with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness. Binodini's idealism does not arise and, consequently, the analogy between women and colonization remains somehow buried.
