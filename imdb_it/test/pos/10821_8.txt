He was in the mood for a French film and saw it at Blockbuster. What a little gem it turned out to be! I'm not sure how much I've lost Gregori Derangere all these years, but it's fantastic. Such innocence and grace! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was hilarious - she reminded me of Nicole Kidman's exaggerated performance in Moulin Rouge. It looks the same as 20 years ago ... truly remarkable. Even Gerard Depardieu did not hold out, but his acting continues to amaze. It's perfect in this movie. I'll probably buy this, I loved it so much. If you want to see another great French film, rent Joyeux Noel. Astounding.
