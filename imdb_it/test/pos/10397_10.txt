I saw the film for the first time a couple of years ago and I was totally impressed, but its sensuality. It's one of the most touching films I've ever seen, even though it might look a little pretentious and artificial - too good, if you like. However, one thing is certain: the cameraman did a great job - every image deserves to be cut off from the film and displayed as a separate art peace, comparable to the paintings of Chirico or Bernard Buffet. <br /> <br /> Music is a perfect background for the story, especially that of U2 who played between the first and second novel on the beach scene. As for the casting, I can't be objective since I really like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue and I can't add anything to the appreciative comments of others. <br /> <br /> However, the very fact that many people (critical and sophisticated in cinema), criticized by the film, made me look for the second time with a more critical eye. Without a doubt, the setting is beautiful and the casting is wonderful. But this is not enough to make a complete and cohesive film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic is somehow superficial and doesn't say much about the motivations of the people involved - was it just about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked Marceau or what?). Apparently, it adds nothing to the idea of ​​the film and even the hoarse voice of Malcovic is unable to link it to the main plot. <br /> <br /> Other stories are more justified and are really well done, which indulges many of the logical errors within them. The scene where Jean Reneau overlooks the city through the huge window of his apartment at the top of the tall building is absolutely incredible. The sensation of moist air and fine mist, which is spread by the first "Ferrera" scene, can literally be perceived through the screen. Without a doubt, Antonioni is a great master of nuances and semi-nuances. My favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, profound and meaningful - I think it is the most Antonioni of the film - almost a parable. Probably, the overall positive impression of the film is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small Italian town, with the winding winding streets and winding sidewalks, the fountains with the potable and monumental cathedrals the eau ... Era laconic but truly moving. <br /> <br /> I hope that my impressions and comments on the film, no matter how chaotic they may be, could motivate someone to spend an evening watching it (it works best with home theater, having someone take care of you by your side , rather than in the cinema). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> I apologize for imperfect English and any possible spelling mistakes
