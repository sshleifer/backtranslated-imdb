Strangeland seems to have a love / hate relationship with many of his viewers. Personally, I loved the film and everything about it. <br /> <br /> Acting in some places could be improved, but filming adds to the atmosphere where acting cannot. In some areas, the dialogue is a bit rough and too dramatic, but in reality, what do you expect from the late 1990s? Overall, Dee did an incredible job of writing what I consider to be one of the most terrifying thrillers I've ever seen. It plays on the fears of many age groups: adults, parents and children. Every parent fears that their children feel too involved in chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet. And * it happens * in the real world. And every child and every adult is afraid of being kidnapped and tortured against their will; this also happens in the real world. This is what makes this film a subject so delicate for many. <br /> <br /> My only warning is that if you * know * you are sensitive to things like strong violence, visible torture and cold blood, then do * I * don't want to see this movie. If you are not sure if this movie will entertain you, then read as many reviews as you can, ask the people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn off the movie at any time if you are disturbed.
