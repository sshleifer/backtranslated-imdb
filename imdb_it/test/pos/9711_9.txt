Where do I start? I sat down ready to laugh a little and I was speechless! This film is simply perfect, it is indescribable. The Jackass number two in all honesty was coarser, more obscene, more fun and more fun than the first. This was just what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say "Oh My! No Way!" or "Ouch!". Perfectly mastered and set up, each event and scene was previously coordinated and then made even more perfect. I loved every minute! I will only say that there was also a scene where it was necessary to censor a particular movie to avoid an NC-17 rating! It was so funny they had to put it anyway! Incredibly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly fun, don't miss it!
