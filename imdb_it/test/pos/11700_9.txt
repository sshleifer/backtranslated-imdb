While it's not for everyone, Crackerjack is a pleasure to watch, with the tongue firmly planted in one cheek. The cute character of Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, is cheating the local "bowlo" for free parking and making a few bucks on the side, selling the parking lot to work colleagues. When members of the Bowling Club have to raise money to save their club, they invite Jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls. <br /> <br /> Filled with Aussie Charm, the laconic spirit of Mick Molloy is showing through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his previous work on Radio. The perfect Australian casting with Bill Hunter as Jack Stan Coombes' bowling mentor, John Clarke (of The Games fame) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowling club owner Bernie Fowler, with Samuel Johnson in the role of Jack Dave's and Judith Lucy's apartment as the tired journalist, Nancy. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought that only Molloy fans would like this movie, but judging by the number of the blue rinse set that came out of the theater and giggled, this is a movie for everyone.
