This must be one of the best post-auction musicals made by Columbia. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by veterinarian Charles Vidor, this photo really put Gene Kelly on the map and cemented the reputation of Rita Hayworth as the main female dance partner of cinema. He has played a dual role in this film since playing the contemporary 1940s number with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers, but he also puts her in the role of his grandmother, a nightclub performer in the late nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> The music should also be identified because I believe it was the last project that the legendary Jerome Kern worked on (the most famous today for "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" ), and his lyricist was the same legendary Ira Gershwin. They provided a full score of charm and characterization. The music for historical sequences is particularly noteworthy because it is so perfectly stylized in the idiom of the early twentieth century that it was the original period of Kern. It's kind of like taking a record from one of your favorite bands from the 70s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that period. <br /> <br /> The story is rather irrelevant, which is fine for me because this film is an approximation very similar to the one you'll probably see in the golden age of the 30s / 40s of the comic style of the Broadway musical comedy. Even the aspects of war propaganda from the 1940s of the film's music give it an extra charm while the talented trio sings "make way for tomorrow" and also jokes humorously about American enemies and uses vintage slang like the "gremlins". <br /> <br /> Probably the most memorable performance in the film is Kelly's dance for the "Alter-Ego Dance", which finds him quarreling and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of consciousness. This prefigures much of his later work and also represents an effective and memorable scene in itself. <br /> <br /> Fans will want to look for it for various reasons - Kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see it outside the boundaries of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music than its usual material MGM. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in a glorious color at the height of her fame and skill. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kern's final score and admire the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. This is a real gem in the Columbia crown music program.
