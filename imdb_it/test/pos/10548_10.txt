this is one of my favorite movies of all time. it's one of those movies where I know every line, but I can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest. I always launch this movie if I go on vacation, or if I don't want to go to the gym, seeing Nikki's magnificent body will give me the motivation I need. It is an easy film to watch that always makes me smile, but I know it will not be a cup of tea for everyone, but if like me you love the movies that are shot wonderfully and you have comedy, romance and an interesting plot you will like it. It's full of great characters and Ben and Nikki are both beautiful, so anyone can fix something attractive. LOWER LINE ...... YOU MUST GIVE IT A TEST! I saw it on TV one day by accident and I really liked that I had to go out and find it, which took a while and I saw it every day. MY FATHER THE HERO I LOVE YOU !!!
