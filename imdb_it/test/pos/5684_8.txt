So well done, no CGI rubbish. Has anyone else been on Darwin's "Jumping Crocs" tour of Darwin's before? Black Water was realistic WAY; Rogue was a little cringeworthy. <br /> <br /> Thought the blonde chick was excellent at this - I've never seen her before. And the other girl is a girl, she is always excellent. <br /> <br /> Suspenseful V. - I would compare it to Jaws compared to any other man who eats an animal movie. <br /> <br /> I made the hole in Aussie without even stepping on assholes and crikeys. <br /> <br /> We liked it!
