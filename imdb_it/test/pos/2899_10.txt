Personally, I consider "The Egyptian" in an extremely favorable light. <br /> <br /> I was introduced by a well-known Australian commentator and film critic, Bill, who was famous for his insight and broad vision of people and places and in particular of films. This film perfectly adapted the Bill and I came to appreciate his comment and enthusiasm for this film that emerged even more as I watched it, since I was literally attracted to it, minute by minute, beyond its introductory comments, in my first vision many years ago. <br /> <br /> For me it was pushed, layer by layer, in half an hour, in an intriguing and fascinating production! Yes, I am aware of its defects! But was it so tempting ?? the young man of idealism who learns from & inspired by his father ?? the peasant treated like garbage in his suffering? the opportunist friend but imperfect but nevertheless loved by his friend, the central character Sinute ?? and to be sure, even an imperfect hero, like so many in all humanity of all societies and in all times, but also lovable and worthy of love! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but I too recognize the rights and respect that should be due to ANY kindhearted human being who does not want or does not want to disrespect his neighbor's rights without just cause. As such, I support this film and its presentation of a man of good heart and conviction in his faith in the god of the sun to whom he was devoted. These people will always be welcome in my vision of the world and hopefully in many others. <br /> <br /> So also the drama of the following film I often looked with the same certainty with which it touched my heart and my soul, as surely seems to have infuriated critics in his era. It is captivating, looking at the struggles and pain and loves of Sinute, the doctor! When I look at it again, my friend Bill, the film critic, always comes to mind, who dared to oppose ALL the critics who crumpled it. Has he criticized too many critics? that make statues to honor the stars, on the screen or in history, but they don't make statues to honor critics! And beyond all this, it comes to mind with every vision of a SUPERB & TOUCHING show, of a beautiful and well presented drama, which was not only relevant for the 1950s or a bygone era. It was designed for YOU and I, through time and place, for every man and woman and child and their personal aspirations for love and freedom and to overcome obstacles to misunderstandings and serious injustices and tragic attractiveness to those of simple faith of many religions, which seems too much to consider as a cause of war! Take a night out of invitations or unjust violence, fanaticism and judicial attacks on others unjustly executed and consider the merits of this offer. Not for the god of the sun, or for the power that reveals itself over and over again to be so transitory .. let this film EXCEPTIONALLY wash over you, like the waves on a beach, like the passing hands of time ?? how life had to be. And maybe, you'll find yourself transported into his world of possibilities! Offers no longer lost! 9.9 out of 10!
