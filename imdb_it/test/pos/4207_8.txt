*** SPOILERS *** Although the movie "They Made Me A Criminal" was never as good as the later classic anti-heroes by John Garfield as "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and the his last and much underestimated "He Ran All The Way" in 1951 is the film that defined his career from that moment on until his untimely death on May 21st 1952 at the young age of 39 years. <br /> <br /> Garfiled plays the role of lightweight champion Johnnie Bradfield and then law enforcement fugitive Jack Dorney who is innocent of the murder he is accused of, even though he was declared officially dead. Jonnie Doc Ward's manager, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who killed reporter Charles McGee, John Ridgely, who was about to expose his fighter Johnnie Bradfield to the public during a drunken victory party. woman and did not drink mum's boyfriend. Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle on McGee's head killing him while Jonnie was drunk almost dead with a number of women celebrating in her hotel suite. <br /> <br /> Doc was later killed in a car accident with Johnnie Goldie's girlfriend, Ann Sheridan, but Doc was burned with a crunchiness and with Johnnie's watch on him was exchanged for Johnnie. Said to remain dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin, Robert Strange, who withdrew $ 9,750.00 of Johnnie's $ 10,000.00 money he had for this great advice. Malvin told Johnnie to assume a new identity and call himself Jack Dorney from now on and go out to New York; speaking of timid squalid. Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels on the tracks from New York to Arizona to Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the film takes place. <br /> <br /> If it hadn't been for John Garfield in the lead role both Jonnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney the film would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26 at the time, brought the best of all in the film. Even the Dead End Kids carried, I guess we could call them The Arizona Kids here, acting was higher than you'd expect from them and they came across real and sensitive people not like a bunch of clowns like in almost all their movies . All this to be on the same stage or place of filming, with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They Made Me a Criminal" is a beautiful story whose protagonist is the incognito sample, but not to draw attention to itself and finish not only behind bars but in the electric chair. In the end Jack showed what kind of man he is not fighting the big fight and against all the adversities that they won dramatically at the last moment, but passing four brutal rounds to get the money for his new family found on the given farm including his Peggy girl, Gloria Dickson, to open a gas station with it. <br /> <br /> Giving the European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggi, the fight of his life and getting $ 2,000.00, this is $ 500.00 per round, to do that Jack showed everyone who looked at him like the "Arizona Kids" who sometimes take a punch is much more courageous and brave, then throw one. The fact that Jack could have easily defeated Rutched but not to expose himself to the police, like for the homicidal murderer Johnnie Bradfield. But instead he went farther that he could take all that Rutchek could throw at him to help his friends show more of all the struggles he won in the ring put together. <br /> <br /> I was the first to not find the ending of the artificial movie but suited to the story. Police officer Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack, had to live with him for years because he had once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We were told all this at the beginning of the film. Why know that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder he is accused of and not knowing for sure if he will be found innocent in a court would like to repeat the same terrible mistake? I can easily see this happening in real life because then not in the movies.
