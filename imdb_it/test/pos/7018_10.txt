I've seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't seem like it will ever tire of me. I always look at it with my best friend and it has become a kind of tradition for us now to watch it almost every month. every time we see this movie we both become very emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the TV together and sing all the songs out loud and in the end we always dance. Now we also know practically the entire dialogue from the heart and watching the film seems to see our old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> this movie is perfect! although I must admit that the story itself is a bit rough, but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where everything takes place make you forget everything and start to believe that things like that really happen and that song "all you need is love" actually has a kind of meaning. <br /> <br /> I'm really a normal person and not too serious about this comment, but I can't wait until the next time we'll be able to see Dirty Dancing.
