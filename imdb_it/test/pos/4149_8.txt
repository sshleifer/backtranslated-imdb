This review is in response to the request asking me how the film was actually corrected ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last year and found it a source of inspiration for confident immigrants, like mine Italian grandparents who crossed Ellis Island at the turn of the last century, underwent every kind of invasive inspection just to enter America. <br /> <br /> It was certainly an eye opening, as my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while they were there. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather was 18 when they arrived. I have just returned from a trip to New York, where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum really guides you through the immigration assessment process - The director obviously did his research, up to the exams and medical equipment, to questions and puzzles. They are all there at the museum. Even the wedding photos and the boardroom - Factually correct! Anyone with immigrant grandparents should watch this movie. Inspirational to say the least.
