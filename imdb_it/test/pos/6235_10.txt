Let me start by saying that Tourist Trap is a 99.9% better film than horror movies that have come out of Hollywood lately. If you don't believe me, see Darkness Falls or They. And it's definitely better than any of those video-directed crap like Stab, Bleed, The Pool and so on. One of the biggest problems with the Tourist Trap movie is that you never really find an audience. When the film was inaugurated in 1979, he was awarded a PG vote by the MPAA. Anyone familiar with horror movies knows that a PG on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this issue in the commentary track on the DVD.) There are exceptions like Poltergeist, which also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between Tourist Trap and Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big-budget Hollywood movie like Poltergeist nor was it produced by Steven Spielberg. This alone was enough to guarantee the success of Poltergeist. (Again for those of you who have seen the tourist trap, you will even have scratched your head about why the MPAA voted for this PG movie. The "broken heart" scene should be enough for the film to slap and R. that tell of the tube in the back with the blood flowing out of it.) I have to admit though that when I was young I looked at a copy of Poltergeist on the shelf of the video store, I took it, since it was rated PG and put it on favor of a film classified R instead. Years later I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what a great film I missed for not having rented a PG horror movie. From that moment on I will never judge a film based on his evaluation. This is most likely what happened to Tourist Trap. People, like me with Poltergeist, will probably neglect it in favor of the R-rated movie. Most likely it would also be a teenager, to whom most of these types of films are directed. The 13th of Friday was not even a masterpiece, but it was extremely positive at the box office because it was classified as R and was heavily advertised by Paramount at the time. He found his audience and made enough money to generate several sequels. When you watch people, Tourist Trap is as good as on Friday 13. The same thing could have happened to Tourist Trap. We could have seen Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. As for the film, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror film made with an extremely small budget, but it is well acted, well directed and well done on many levels. Chuck Connors is a revolt like Mr. Slausen and offers the best interpretation of the film. A special credit must be given to the composer Pino Donaggio, whose soundtrack for this film is really what distinguishes him from the others and gives him his disturbing appearance. The music in the scenes involving the mannequins is particularly disturbing. Donaggio has worked on the horror films Carrie and many other films from Tourist Trap. He did an exceptionally good job in film and continues to score films to date. The weakness of Tourist Trap is that there is never any explanation of Davey's powers. Maybe that's how it should be. He only has them, and we should accept it to make the film work. We accept it to a certain extent, but then the script has incidents like the one in which Davey makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. If so, is Davey limited in using his powers? Can a phone ring in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is its range? These are things that people who didn't care about this movie would most likely be referred to as flaws. Others would accept it as a mistake. I accept it. There isn't enough of the kind of questions generated by this movie to make me hate. This is a horror movie. We should not be forced to read too much into it. Many people have called it the "killer dummy" movie. I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this movie. The dummies are controlled by the power of Davey who uses them as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this film. Some people have a problem with dummies and some have even said that they are simply silly. I think they add to the overall creepiness of the film. Overall Tourist Trap is a fun rental. *** (out of 5)
