The process of truth and reconciliation in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This film does a great job in revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges that plague South Africa. I think everyone should see this film because I think that few people outside South Africa understand his past and what is attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has a part of its history that is still a source of continuous hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand the ways of dealing with the past. What is happening in South Africa should guide us all. I found it credible, moving and sometimes upsetting. There were no exceptional acting performances, but this added to the strength of the narrative. Once again the BBC was instrumental in taking a complex subject and making a high-class film.
