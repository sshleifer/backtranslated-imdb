George Hearn really went all out and over the top, which in this case was great. I heard Len Cariou's version but he was too docile. George was exceptional in that character - very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for the part. He gave a great performance. She gave Ms. Lovett a great subtle and comic personality that balanced the dark story. <br /> <br /> I love dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and George Hearn's angry emotions in her songs of anger, revenge and anguish. <br /> <br /> I've seen this game 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it in 1985 for myself) when it came out in 1990 and I bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004.
