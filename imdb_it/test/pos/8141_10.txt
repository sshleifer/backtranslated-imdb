My friend took me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was great! It's a noir film with extraordinary acting, fantastic script, fantastic music, everything was very well done and fun. I don't know if it will be released in theaters, but it would be a dating movie or a fun movie to rent if you saw it on Blockbuster. This is the kind of movie I love, with a limited budget but great for style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden has more important parts like her in this one, she's fantastic.
