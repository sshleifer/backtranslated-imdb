The first feature film with the characters of Aardman, Wallace and Gromit, manages to introduce elements of the entire previous half-hour show broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> Wallace runs a company to humanly capture rogue rabbits from vegetable gardens and has the brilliant idea of ​​trying his invention on the unfortunate bunnies once captured. Obviously, as in the other films by Wallace and Gromit, things do not work as expected. <br /> <br /> Like A Close Shave, there is a love interest for Wallace, in this case the Lady Posh village, and a big bad villain with a trusting dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions that make the character fun. And, of course, Peter Sallis offers Wallace's voice again and is perfect. <br /> <br /> And like in A Grand Day Out, the cheese has a strong comic effect when the film moves. <br /> <br /> On the negative side this film is a bit long. There are great effects, and some pieces that make you sit and watch, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to the length of the feature.
