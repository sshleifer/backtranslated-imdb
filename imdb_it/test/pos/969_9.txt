BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious film with a moral. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") played these tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DR. DR. DR.), I really smiled and felt good . This is what I liked most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay ended up wrongly in Marty's hands was hilarious. I particularly liked the cameo by Jaleel White. When I saw it for the first time, I couldn't be sure, but when I asked my mother if it was him, she replied: "Of course!" Before concluding, I would like to say: "As I said before, there is a moral in this story, and the moral one is always telling the truth". Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious film with a moral.
