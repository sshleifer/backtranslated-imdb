I've been an avid chipmunk fan since the late 1970s - early 1980s. When this movie came out, it was absolutely necessary to see it. And after seeing it, I immediately went to buy it! The film is fantastic, I love the animated action it brings, and the music is fantastic (yes, I bought the soundtrack on CD ...) A video recommended for everyone to watch and have fun!
