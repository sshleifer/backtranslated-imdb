For me, Pink Flamingos lived up to its reputation as a shocking, disgusting, repulsive and trash film that I expected it to be, that really contained everything but the kitchen sink. We are treated for almost two hours of wickedness that never give up: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism and a horrendous demonstration of singing their own animals. It is a strange couple that starts a competition with a caravan trash family, trying to steal their title as "the dirtiest people alive". Divino (a dragging fat man) is an incredibly vile human being, which actually becomes painful to watch. Trust me when I say that this film is not to be forgotten quickly, especially the final scene in which Divine eats the dog's prick from the sidewalk. I always thought that John Waters was overrated and I can't say I like this movie, but it's an experience if you have the chance to see it.
