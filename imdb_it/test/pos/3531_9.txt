It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of "slasher" films in the early 1980s, some of the good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great "rare" film by Jeff Lieberman, who secured his cult status with his memorable 1970s films "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". <br /> <br /> Five young men head to the mountains of Oregon (this film was actually filmed on the spot) to camp out and check the act of some land that one of them has acquired. In a short time, they will be predictably terrorized by a bulky assassin with an incredibly disturbing hissing laugh. <br /> <br /> "Just Before Dawn" is visibly more ambitious, "arty", and intelligent than some slasher movies. Lieberman actually embodies the characters - well, two of them, anyway - as a 90-minute movie will allow him. The film has real moments of suspense and tension, and in reality it abstracts from the gore of the graphics, except for a murder at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> There is an above average cast here, including Oscar winner George Kennedy, as a ranger who has understandably become a bit unbalanced after being alone in the desert for too long. Jack Lemmon's son, Chris, the future Brian De Palma, Gregg Henry, the blonde Deborah Benson (it's a pity she didn't become a more famous singer, judging by her work here), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp"), and Jamie Rose ("Chopper Chicks in Zombietown") complete the cast. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots are interesting, and Brad Feidel's ancient music (now better known for its "Terminator" theme is disturbing and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> is worth catching for the important turn of events at about an hour, although a time of about 75 minutes involving the heroine and a tree and the murderer is almost comical, it could actually remind a spectator of a cartoon! One of the touches more clever is the final dispatch of the killer, whom I had never seen before in a horror movie and probably won't see him again. <br /> <br /> I didn't give him 10 of 10 because I can't honestly say I was so scared. Still, it's an interesting slasher that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> "That action means nothing, son, those mountains can't read." <br /> <br /> 9 / 10
