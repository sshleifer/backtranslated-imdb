This film was great and I've been waiting for a long time. When it finally came out, I was really happy and I looked forward to a 10 out of 10. It was great and up to my potential. The shows were great by adults and most children. The only negative benefit was Milo himself. There was a problem I encountered with this film (and others like it). All the characters I wanted to live were killed. Overall, I give this movie 9 out of 10 excellent. Maybe we should select better people to kill next time, okay?
