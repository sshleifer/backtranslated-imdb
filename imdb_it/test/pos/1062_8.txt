Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Former Superintendent Grodman, Conte Fosco, Titus Semple) he surprised many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in West End and Broadway comedies. He was usually such a total villain, or a serious public actor that his comic talents were ignored. In fact, in fact, he made four appearances in comedies (a parody of his bad portraits with his villain Peter Lorre in a cameo). His best film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley on "Christmas In Connecticut" (although his autocratic and half-crazy tycoon in "The Hucksters" is a close second). Despite some problems with the script, it is a good movie, and it usually comes back at Christmas time. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in "American Housekeeping" magazine for Yardley, where she gives tips for the house and cooking recipes. She is the 1945 version of Martha Steward, except that Mrs. Steward is a cook and owner, and can guarantee to try and test what she claims. Stanwyck cannot. His cooking recipes are those of his friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur. The house that describes how his house (a model farm in Connecticut) belongs to his unofficial boyfriend, architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner would not mind really marrying Stanwyck, but he is not completely ready to consider a final commitment for him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, an American was shipwrecked by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. Spend two weeks in a raft before being saved. Sensing the value of advertising, Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan's desire to have an authentic old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that he will entertain Morgan and himself on his holiday farm. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the image of the columns of herself (complete with her ability to throw flaps-jacks and raise a child she should have had with her husband) is a lie - if she does she will be fired , as well as his immediate boss Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression he accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and then Gardiner discovers that his home in Connecticut has been turned into a "real" Stanwyck house and of himself and "their child". <br /> <br /> Of course, aside from postponing Greenstreet's intriguing curiosity, Stanwyck and Morgan find that they are falling in love (much to Gardiner's regret - he really expects Stanwyck to marry him again). Complications due to complications occur, such as lies about lies, and how neighbour's children succeed their neighbors' children before Greenstreet begins to wonder if something is missing. But it's a comedy, so everything works fine. Even Greenstreet, in the end, is amused by all the madness: his famous resentment resonates with that of Santa Claus for a change. This is not a classic comedy, certainly not exceptional, but fun enough to claim the season in December.
