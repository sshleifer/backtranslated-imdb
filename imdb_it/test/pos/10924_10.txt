First of all I would like to say that before watching this film I considered myself an accepting individual. Someone who cared about others, appreciated others, found / hardly judged against other people, and this film has (I think) changed my life or point of view dramatically. When I looked at it, I didn't particularly know what it was, I knew it was about some kind of forbidden relationship, but other than that I was clueless, and as I started to see what was happening between these two wonderfully represented characters, I was in state of shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time I saw him, I was blind. Blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their purity as human beings, to their relationship. I looked at it a second time, because I finally realized how hypocritical I was, telling myself and others: "Oh, I accept all kinds of people, and I try not to judge them" as I judge this wonderful and incredibly insightful story, to cause of my fear, I suppose. The second time I watched this movie, I opened those eyes that had been closed for the first time, and I really looked, not at the kind of taboo relationship that I had heard all my life, but simply by two human beings in love . And I loved it, I loved the plot, I loved the individual people slightly broken and strong in the film, I loved sharing feelings and I loved the strong bonds created. It is a really beautiful film, which has made a great success and which has made me cry sometimes, and I hope that the people who will read this film and will watch the film in the end will remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what form or form is presented in ....
