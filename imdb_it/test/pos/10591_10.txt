This film is simply fantastic. It's so funny. Although skating and other montages are played, the play is fantastic. Raab Himself and Brandon Dicamillo are hilarious. There will be times when you can't breathe that you're laughing so hard. Also, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
