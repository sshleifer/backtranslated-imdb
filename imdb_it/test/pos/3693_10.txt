I found this film extremely enjoyable. I am biased. I happen to love Kathy Bates. I found her singing an added pleasure. He has a beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Ms. Bates plays Grace Beasley. The film takes you from her spiritual pains to Chicago, England, the home of her recently assassinated idol singer Victor Fox. Here he meets his three surviving sisters. He also discovers that Victor leaves a male lover, Dirk Simpson. <br /> <br /> The story takes you in some surprisingly comical and moving situations, while Grace and Dirk develop a true mutual passion, after an initial rather rude refusal on his part. They return to Chicago where they join with the daughter-in-law, hilarious daughter-in-law of Grace, Maudie, to find the serial killer who murdered Victor. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the picture did a great job. Especially liked by Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow. This movie was fun. It makes you cry. The music is absolutely fascinating. <br /> <br /> Other posters here who have encountered problems with any part of this film simply have no idea. <br /> <br />
