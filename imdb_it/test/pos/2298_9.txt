After reading more than my fair share of reviews for a large number of different films, I noticed a certain tendency, people strictly judge what they expected to see. I imagine that if you go into an open-minded movie, don't expect anything certain, then you will have better feelings towards it, if you try to look but you have pre-created standards that you want them to reach. <br /> <br /> From I try not to be hypocritical I watched this film with a very clean slate and an open mind, and I was very happy. Since it's not a mainstream title or an award winner for that issue, I really didn't know what to expect, but I actually liked it much more than Ninja Scroll. An enchanting animation, a deep story and the ever joyous ninja hack-n-slash combined very well with one of my favorite personal spirits ever made. <br /> <br /> I don't promise you will like it, but just giving is an opportunity and you could come out with a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before speaking, make sure that what you say will be more beautiful than silence" - Chinese Proverb
