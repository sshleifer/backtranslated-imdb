Funny movie, I really enjoyed watching it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular Turkish actor. He played many hard roles, epic sword movies and novels. It was fun to see him with an international cast and a pair of really lousy-looking gloves. If I remember he was also dubbed in English, which made things even more fun. (a bit like seeing John Wayne speak Turkish).
