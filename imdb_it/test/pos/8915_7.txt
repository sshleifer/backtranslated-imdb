Why do I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I watched it. And I found it funny! The aliens, their strange spaceship, their strange helmets ... my God, it was a show. And all these desperate alien women need is sperm from the earth. <br /> <br /> And where are they looking for it? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And this is where the main fun comes from: In Europe (and even more so in German-speaking countries), Bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so powerless with alien women. Well, there have been films about people who haven't been able to deal with women like the "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what made this film is a strange weirdness. You constantly wonder how they came up with these crazy ideas. But it was 1974, and looking back 35 years one fills one with a kind of nostalgia. You've never seen a movie like that. <br /> <br /> And if you don't mind seeing random pubic hair and breasts, look at it once. It's essentially a comedy, not a porn movie.
