I'm not a sports fan, but I love sports movies! So why ... what is a great sport flic ... this. And the narrative style is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for 2 hours of incredibly fantastic entertainment, "Greatest Game" qualifies powerfully. Here is a film that moves. Bill Paxton went to the same directorial school as Ron Howard - a.k.a Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days". It's not bad. Look at the immense body of excellent work that Ron did after moving behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Bill as Ron was a great actor, but he will be a superstar director if "Greatest Game Ever" is an indication of things to follow. <br /> <br /> Wonderful cinematography - fantastic direction - fine acting, particularly from Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth. <br /> <br /> This is a film to be seen not only as "good humor", nor "sports film", this is a great film.
