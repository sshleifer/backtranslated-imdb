I haven't seen a Van Damme movie for a while, pleasantly surprised, it still has it, it looks older, but harder, a little like Sly, it gets sturdier with age. This is a good film and has prompted me to take a look at all the Van Damme films I've lost in the last ten years. I'd like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good storyline. Van Damme still has the moves to amaze the public, the last film seen with Van Damme was the Legionary, which was also a good movie. Also, I looked into Van Damme's first combat story, I too, to my amazement, realized that he is a true martial artist, very skilled in his younger years.
