The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her elder sister's suicide ten years earlier. There he meets his sister's ex-boyfriend and they travel to all the places where his sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film so special, and flies over the limited plot are the beautiful portraits of the characters. Although the elder sister's boyfriend is an abandoned hippie, she has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. And even if the older sister, whom we see in the flashbacks, shares these ideals, she doesn't have a sense of limitation or balance, than is too much. And although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was just a normal girl, after all. <br /> <br /> The film's most special moment is when the sister's girlfriend and boyfriend finally stop fighting their mutual attraction. I can't remember ever having seen a more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in making love in a movie! <br /> <br /> In all these ways this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be appreciated and reviewed and again. 9 out of 10.
