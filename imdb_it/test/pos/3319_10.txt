If this isn't my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in the top five. I love this. Everything is perfect - the clothes, the set, the lines - yes, they are not like normal people talk, but ... Just in the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office, the girls change their shoes, choose a wedgie, water the office ivy plant, put the lunch in the fridge ... Identical to what we office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is exaggerated, it's all part of the package. If you select many things in the film, it is very clear that this was the beginning of the 1960s as women were starting to "not take it lying down", at least not if they didn't want it. Although the characters are contradictory, for example, the character of Suzy Parker behaves as if it were all for the adventures, but then becomes too attached to the character of Louis Jourdan, is not so that many people are like - contradictory? They mix in real things with scenes like the character of Diane Baker who finds the love of her life after aborting her illegitimate son in an accident - lying in the hospital with an old old bandage on his head. This is also part of the package, it's charm, lucid evasion. I like the mix of relevant real stories today (the stereotypical career woman who only has relationships with married men, so she doesn't have a family when she's older) with those that make you want, "ah, if I could just fall in I love a doctor and he will love me even if he knows my sordid past and he saw me messed up after the scandalous accident !! "Furthermore, I just got the DVD, widescreen, it's even more beautiful than the full screen one ... Yes!
