How good is this movie? Apparently good enough to think of doing it again in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> The film is almost a silence. These are men of few words, preferring to let their actions speak for them. They live according to a code that governs their every move. <br /> <br /> There are some great actors in this film: Alain Delon (The Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's Make Love) and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio from A Fistful of Dollars & A Few Dollars More). The film doesn't shine on them; they are together for the journey that Melville has for them. Melville makes the film; make it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in the Ocean movies, but they just got the idea. He can't make it work the way he did. A great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.
