Director Peter Chan, screenplay Maria Maggenti. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel "The Love Letter" by Cathleen Schine, the film version of director Peter Chan, published in 1999, was not a major attraction at the box office, not even for a romantic movie with some comic elements . Although it wasn't as popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved film on cable television and VHS / DVD. Set in a port city in the beautiful old United States (I have forgotten the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious and passionately written love letter that triggers emotions and confusion between the main characters, each of whom thinks the letter is personally addressed to them. At the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or loved one is, but the power of the letter has changed the lives of almost everyone in the small city. The cast is composed of wonderful actors who have done well on TV and movies, including Kate Capshaw in the title role of middle-aged beauty Helen, a bookstore owner, comedian Ellen DeGeneres as her friend / employee Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young 20-year-old boy who falls for old Hellen and older Tom Selleck as fireman George Matthias who has to compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are cameo roles of old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly Rose in "Titanic" (1997) and a cameo by Kate Capshaw's daughter (with her husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feels passionate about Helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will he choose the right person? Which man has more to offer her? Johnny has an affair with a girl his age who loves him with a passion of his own, and it is indeed a sort of reminder of how Helen was at her age. George is about to divorce his wife and has lived a mundane and eventful life. A cultured intellectual, he takes Helen to an opera appointment, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca moves Helen into explosive tears. There are many beautiful views of the charming coastal city, made wonderfully by the director of photography Tami Reiker. The soundtrack is a paradise of romantic and lovable songs - "I've Never Been In Love Before", "I'm In The Mood For Love" and "Only The Lonely". Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is constantly lagging behind her work at Helen's bookstore, which ceaselessly dates back to men without being able to find the right man, is simply wonderful. He did not lose his comic talent, although at this point in his career he did not appear much on TV or in the cinema because only about two years before his television broadcast in the mid-90s "Ellen" was canceled due to his "coming out" as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject of the show. Here you even find the comedian Jack Black, long before he grew up, in the role of a fisherman. This is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant, about the human need for a passionate consuming love and about the general love for evasion brought not only through books, letters and music, but through a genuinely loving and safe relationship . This is a great movie with wonderful moments and a contagious romantic spirit.
