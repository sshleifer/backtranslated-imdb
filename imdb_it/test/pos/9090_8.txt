Flatliner has all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher film: intelligent and youthful characters, a breathtaking cinematography, a compelling story and excellent performances. It's fun for evasion, but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message, despite the undeniable precedents. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has a talent for identifying talented young actors, and all the top five here have moved on to more (see the cast list). Their credible performance helps bring this film well above the average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his role as a meditating student. <br /> <br /> Cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what I love about Schumacher; its use of light and position create images that stick together. A disturbing nightmare atmosphere is created that displaces you while you watch the movie and haunts you when you go to bed - the Lost Boys reminded me. <br /> <br /> This is a film that takes a fantastic premise - curious students want to find out what is there after death and follow it successfully in a scary and compelling story of redemption. One of Schumacher's best; highly recommended.
