The film Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans during the 1961-89 period. I lived in West Berlin during most of 1967 and traveled across the Wall to East Berlin every week. Why? Excitement, crossing a border in a Soviet ruled country, experiencing the smells and the feeling of East Germany, which is why Night Crossing is excellent, captures that feeling, and is exciting. I was arrested by the Vopos at Checkpoint Charlie and approached by a man with his leather coat and dark glasses that I was able to believe was Stasi. When I watch the movie I smell low-cost diesel and cooking oil, I can see the obsolete vehicles, the dull clothes that the public has worn and the dull products in the shop windows. It reminds me of how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988, I turned the DDR from east to west, from north to south. East Germany had changed little since 1967. The Trabants, constantly en route, were still the main mode of private motorized transport, the shops were not yet able to tempt me, the uniforms were still on the agenda, but people, ordinary people were open and beautiful once you gained their trust. Watch Night Crossing, is the closest to the truth of any movie you will see in Germany divided, even closer than two other favorites. The spy who came from the cold and the Berlin funeral.
