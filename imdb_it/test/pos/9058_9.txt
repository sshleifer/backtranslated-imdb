I went to watch this movie cautiously. A suicidal "comedy" did not seem consistent. Having a brother who attempted suicide and see the devastation that caused our whole family, I know firsthand how overwhelming it can be to tackle this problem. I have to say: this film treats it in a way that allows the viewer to "inside" someone who is suffering and simply doesn't know why, or how to stop it. While the film is not perfect, it respects the topic and, above all, makes it accessible to the masses. I know for our family, humor has helped us overcome pain. And, Max and Grace is just what he promises to be - a suicidal comedy. It's funny - And I also thought the characters were real and vibrant. It is also extremely intelligent, but simple. It cuts to the chase and I appreciate it! I give him a 9 and I will recommend him.
