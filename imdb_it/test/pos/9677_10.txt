When I saw this show for the first time, I was 9, and it caught my eye immediately when Stewie was trying to call Lois on the hotel phone. I laughed and kept looking. When the episode ended, I wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. This separates from the Simpsons and other shows on Cartoon Network, because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's TV-14 for a reason. The fast movie cuts after every joke and the funny and amusing movements and the behavior of the characters make it special. The talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and voice of a lot of characters in the show. A good theme song and a crazy family that there's always something fun, makes this my favorite cartoon along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Watch it is fun stuff.
