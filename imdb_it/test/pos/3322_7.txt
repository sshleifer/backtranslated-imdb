This working girl goes to hell, soap is a candidate for the time capsule, courtesy of her immaculate physical production, costumes from the 50s (see all those bows and pearls), creamy theme song by Johnny Mathis and oh -so bold (for his time) sexual attitudes. The novel by Rona Jaffe, on which the film is based, continues to be republished, and only a few years ago Vanity Fair dedicated an article to this delightful bon bon of a film. Take a look at the new transfer DVD and you'll know why. <br /> <br /> The three protagonists - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker - recall the girls of "How to Marry A Millionaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends from "Sex and the City". "Gentlemen singers go wild in a revel ..." Their romantic adventures and sexual intertwining are the result of the passion of pocket books: empty calories of caramel corn, without nutrition, impossible to resist to snacks. Lange is genuinely moving in his neo-Grace Kelly way, Baker is properly dimer and idealistic as a shy virgin who is (startled) by a (hiss) cad. Help the cad is played by Robert Evans, the guttural voice, coke that snorted the movie magnate who surely brought many innocent young lambs to slaughter in his Beverly Hills bedroom. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker is charming in the first half of the film, all carefree and confident. He stuffs his stuff with the brio of the fashion icon he was in the 50s. Alas, she is not up to the point where the film sends her: into madness and obsession. But exudes glamor and savior faire and his acting is at least adequate. One wonders why the critics hated her, virtually taking her out of the movies a few years later. Perhaps a detached attitude on the part of a good-looking woman is really too much to bear. Ali McGraw's career sank a generation later and, when you think about it, Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were practically the same actress. <br /> <br /> The film's only major flaw is a weak ending. It practically collapses into a romantic fainting at the end, rather than rising to a melodramatic wham bang finale, like the other famous soap opera by producer Jerry Wald, "Peyton Place", with Lana Turner crying and grinding her teeth during a rape trial . Here, Hope Lange wanders on the sidewalk of New York, the engaging stains, eternally hung (but now, of course, sober) to Stephen Boyd and they simply leave together ... towards sunset, it is assumed. Otherwise, this is practically the definition of a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... Joan Crawford is there too, she spits fire on all the girls and smokes cigarettes while hissing at her married lover Telephone. And the titles are made in bright pink, with ribbon characters that recall the department store advertisements of the late 1950s. Not to be missed!
