I must say that this film was produced in an excellent way and at the top of the charts as a typical science fiction movie! I liked it ... it's a science fiction movie, if you want a thriller watch another channel .. This is what scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of the best science fiction producers Scot Vandiver! OK, the special effects weren't excellent, but what a beautiful cast! A little more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high-budget effects. Stop complaining and change channels if you don't like this kind of movie. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great but these are not science fiction movies. Sci fi produces excellent films like Sabretooth, Alien Hunters etc. Well done ... keep them churning out!
