For all intents and purposes, "Teen Devian" may seem like just another light Bollywood musical. To a certain extent, this could also be true, especially since the producers had to be sure that the film had succeeded with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, both Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the "idea" for this story) and Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a breakthrough to the usual formula, and perhaps even surpassed it your expectations. <br /> <br /> It is not simply a handsome man who hangs out with 3 women, undecided on who to choose as a partner in his life. The character of Dev Anand was really in love with each of the 3 women on various occasions, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - as each of the women comes to depend heavily on him. There are a lot of suggestive teasers in the body language of the stars that lend themselves to imagination depending on the maturity of the viewer. The theme is surprisingly adult and, after all, it was the case that the ending was docile, obviously designed to satisfy the masses and divert criticism.
