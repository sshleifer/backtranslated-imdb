This is the story of a journey made by a man who once had a dream and a courage. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and an amateur sailor who participated in the Sunday Times Golden Globe race, a solo yacht regatta in the world. <br /> <br /> I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview with producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of "Touching the Void", one of the first documentaries that had commercial success in 2003. I had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge about the historical event, and I am relieved that it did not disappoint me. For 92 minutes I was led through a disturbing story and came up with many things to think about. <br /> <br /> Without any re-enactment, this film made great use of the limited audio and video archive material found and turned it into a compelling story that allowed the public to understand Crowhurst on a personal level. The story was revealed as people who had direct connections to events including his wife and son, and the final winner, also the only one who managed to re-enter among the 9 competitors, Robin Knox-Johnston gave his own stories of what happened almost 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> The journals of Crowhurst (logbooks) he held during the 243 days at sea are so disturbing that it made it much easier for me to understand what a man can do in total isolation. While Crowhurst's body was never found, the other competitor Nigel Tetley whose yacht sank a few weeks before claiming the fastest passage award committed suicide three years after failed attempts to successfully complete a circumnavigation. <br /> <br /> Everything could take its toll, especially the sea. <br /> <br /> Director Louise Osmond was also in the Q&A session after the screening with producer John Smithson. I had no idea that she was a director and this was a very nice surprise. The film is getting a limited release in the UK (a couple of days in some cinemas). Capture it in the cinema as long as you can, unless you have a state-of-the-art sound system that can recreate the sound of the South Ocean that hits the island .. so I'm sure they'll get it on DVD soon.
