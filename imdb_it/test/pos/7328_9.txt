I can't say that this film deserves a ten, because I'd be lying. I loved this movie when I saw it, though! It carries the unique bond of a friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although he doesn't show the sweetness that Jesse and Willy have had in Free Willy, he provides an exciting film that the whole family will love! If you love marine animals, or if you just love a perfect family movie, this movie is for YOU! Flipper certainly shows us how lovely the dolphins are, and they are playful and could easily be pets if everyone had a big enough pool! I love whales and dolphins, so obviously this movie works for me. I think the producers should have chosen another shark instead of the hammer to improve the antagonist part in the story. Maybe a big white man? FLIPPER IS MAGNIFICENT! So take a look!
