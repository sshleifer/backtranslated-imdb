He came through this film recently after a long time about it. It is an excellent and unpretentious film for people who love literature and film noir films. Not "camp" but humorous. <br /> <br /> GREAT CAST! From the magnificent Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as the antagonist of the band. I'd like to see spin-off movies with this character and Emma Thompson solving cases and arguments between them all the time (very similar to Tracy and Hepburn, etc.) <br /> <br /> Smart story, twists and photography look unless it's a scope, because the compositions are very rich. <br /> <br /> Sexy sexy and very funny sexy. <br /> <br /> Best use of Just Like Heaven by The Cure of all time (must see is believing!) <br /> <br /> ********
