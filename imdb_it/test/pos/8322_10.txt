As John Grierson pointed out: "The documentary genre can be defined as: the creative interpretation of reality" <br /> <br /> This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time that a computer-generated dinosaur project respects the intelligence of the viewer. <br /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I expected with great excitement, I was extremely disappointed. Of course the dinosaurs were fantastic, but the story was not necessary. I thought: "And if they had made a documentary about dinosaurs, without children crying or bad word games, only the dinosaurs would make it as realistic as possible, to make us wonder at what was once a reality." <br /> <br /> My dream came true. The BBC has produced a hilarious documentary that explores the different epochs of the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This part is for all people who seem to disagree with the fact that they have had to guess in many points about behavior, skin patterns etc: of course they must. There was nobody I think it's great that they can present something so realistic. The conjectures are all based on the knowledge of many paleontologists and allow the viewer to have a good idea of ​​what it was like. If you want to stay true to what we know for sure, then go visit a dinosaur bone museum. This is why I incorporated the Grierson quote at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> However, remove the hat from its creators.
