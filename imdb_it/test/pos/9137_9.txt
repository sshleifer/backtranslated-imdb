Everyone likes the robbery film created with ease, memorable. Alain Delon supplies the anti-hero, Melville provides the beauty, and a handful of other great talents (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourvil, mostly) arrive to add a captivating and captivating film ... <br /> < br /> ... with very little dialogue This is great, because a certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialogues involving the witty and their various answers. This film, however, could be watched with the sound completely turned off and not too terribly missed. Not to mention that the sound is ugly, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the clear audio that captures the small movements makes the patient slow and patient evaluation very slow. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this film is really nice that color cinematography is really fantastic. Usually when it comes to cinematography, black and white films tend to stand out in my mind, but this film has some very strong and beautiful images that make the film pure visual pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
