Crossfire is one of those movies of the 40s that is crying for a remake, if for no other reason than maybe it's time it was done as originally written. The story on which the film is based speaks of the murder of a homosexual. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days after World War II with the fresh holocaust in everyone's mind. <br /> <br /> In Lee Server's Lee Mackum biography, Edward Dmytryk was interviewed by the director and bluntly said that the film could never be made about a hate crime against gays at the moment with the code firmly in place. It may have been because the character of Robert Ryan is a hater of equal opportunities for everything that deviates from his social norms. <br /> <br /> Mitchum was said in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the film ride. Robert Young was chosen as captain of the Washington, DC police homicide, which captured the case and while Mitchum was in second place, he knew from the beginning that the film would belong to Ryan. But he was the new RKO star by dint of his performances in The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End Of Time so he was there for box office insurance. Mitchum's part was like a sergeant and a friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not a whodunit, although we do not see the crime that becomes clear that Montgomery is the only one who kills Sam Levene, the Jewish seller par excellence. And it becomes clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is almost as guilty as the public. It becomes just a matter of getting the evidence. <br /> <br /> Ryan received one of the film's many Oscar nominations, his Best Supporting Actor category. Although he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan's revolutionary role. Similarly, Gloria Grahame was briefly nominated as a party girl for Best Supporting Actress, but lost to Celeste Holm for the Gentleman Agreement. Crossfire clashed with Gentleman's Agreement and lost to Dmytryk's best film and best director for Elia Kazan. It is the fifth nomination for best screenplay and Crossfire is back short again with the winner being Miracle on 34th Street. <br /> <br /> Gloria Grahame also had her problems on the set that spilled over from her personal life. She was having big problems with her, then her husband Stanley Clements who was a violent husband. He was around the set causing a lot of trouble for Ed Dmytryk. Fortunately, the part of Grahame was small. In fact, the entire film was shot in a typical RKO economy in 20 days. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly beautiful scene with William Phipps, a Tennessee boy in Mitchum and Ryan's dress that Ryan constantly exposes. Young is very eloquent in talking about the corrosive nature of hatred and how he influenced his family as Irish Catholics who came in the years of potato famine. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on screen in his long career. <br /> <br /> A film as beautiful as Crossfire is, it's time to be redone as a story about an anti-gay hate crime. Especially with the real killing of Barry Winchell over the past decade and the gay debate in the military. <br /> <br /> This is a film that is time and almost finished.
