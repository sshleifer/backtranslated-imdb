This is the kind of movie they used to make, funny, touching, disturbing, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose jobs, boobs jobs, eye jobs, in other words real people. Shauna Macdonald plays the female love interest, and it's so real that you want to cuddle her at least. Imagine, a real girl in a movie, at any time? Hollywood will hate it, because its freshness is a harsh reproach for every false star of Tinseltown. This story has the same exhilarating feeling of Sandy Mackendrick's classic Whiskey Galore, with the gnomic humor of remote Scottish islanders punctuating the claims of intruders from the outside and enjoying drama from time to time (the actual intervals between those times often I'm rather short). Director Stephen Whittaker shows a rare ability to pull it off right, and it is shocking to find that he died before the release of his 56-year-old film, which was clearly a substantial screen loss. Ulrich Thomsen is very good at playing a German rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to Scarp on the Isle of Harris to build a small rocket to transport postal packages between the islands. There he falls in love with the seductive Macdonald girl and returns the affection. Some wonderfully colorful local characters decorate the story and the film is pure delight. There is obviously the threat of an imminent war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler executed 1,000 missile scientists who refused to build war weapons, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from sight, but the lips must remain sealed in a review of what happens at the end. This film is a magnificent example of the kind of film that people in Britain should do. But are they properly released? In a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by TV reality shows, where repellent noents have become national heroes, is there still a market for a film like this? After all, there is no sex that screams, there are no close-ups of suppurating wounds or of nobody's genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no senseless celebrities who skip around wanting to be looked at, and then one wonders if there is something to interest an audience that has become so decadent and tired that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their useless existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the emptiness of contemporary Britain can take refuge in this fresh and honest film.
