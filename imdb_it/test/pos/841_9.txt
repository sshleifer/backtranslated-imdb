"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of mush. Closer in tone and subject to a more violent Nikkatsu cello than other Scorpion voices, it is incredibly photographed, directed with unbridled enthusiasm, and populated with a gallery of degenerate criminals and criminals. Shinya Ito, the director of the first episode, returns for this surreal fairy tale that begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting off the arm of a policeman to whom she is handcuffed and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with her arm still swinging from her wrist. He takes refuge in a red-light district where he makes friends with a prostitute, who is seen for the first time having incestuous relations with his brother (who ends up impregnating her). The scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and hell breaks loose. She is beaten, sexually assaulted and locked up in a bizarre bird cage in the villain's lair. I loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and moving film. He is the superior of the first three Scorpion films and presents one great scene after another. I can't recommend it well enough.
