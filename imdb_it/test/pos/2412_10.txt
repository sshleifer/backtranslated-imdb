THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts film. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) were fine with their dance dress. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he had put Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure ******! This was because he was a very hard man who would not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and showdown between Julie and Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this great success to all those who love martial arts movies or are fans of Hilary Swank.
