Truly a wonderful film. Bruce Willis gives this message-message its exceptional acting-romantic power, and the film brings hope to the losers, many of us know that we are. A gift for all those of middle age whose time seems to be full but empty: there is more around the next curve and can be large, enriching and romantic. Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past, and then take off on a favorite flight for your best future. If we could relive our youthful experiences, if we could really remember the events that shaped us, wouldn't we have found a special kind of freedom? Watch the movie, open the gift.
