Even with all the cinema that deals with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver to some extent) we feel that we don't know even half of what happened. Even contemplating the horror seems inhuman. And a progression - or retreat? - for the inhumanity it requires is a fundamental part of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's greatest film and one of the most important ever made. Freely inspired by the 1902 classic of Joseph Conrad, "Heart of Darkness" which tells the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes from the distance from civilization - an outcrop of bestial nature, so to speak, a Lord of flies - brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is of Willard, a general in charge of a special mission in Cambodia after his first shift in service was served in Vietnam. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to go home - echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter. So he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade green cap that has isolated itself in a remote outpost on the Nung River, and which presumably went completely crazy - worshiped by the natives as a god, and indiscriminately killing. The name of this man is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best is Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). While Willard travels upstream in an army boat with some accompanying soldiers, his testimony of horrors and madness - and the overwhelming futility of it all - leads to a mysterious liking and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. The moment they do it, Kurtz's methods don't seem so wrong or as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out of place. Apocalypse: a place beyond morality, the outpost on the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgment, of oneself. Kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a green beret and his subsequent revelation is one of the most chilling and well-presented discourses in the history of cinema. The film is about the trauma, the human spirit and its breaking point - here, it is very similar to The Deer Hunter, and just as good. Apocalypse, however, takes the boundaries of what we can bear globally: Coppola's large film on Cambodian wet and murky jungles and a helicopter opening sequence between exploding forests and an orange sky - set in a strange column Sounds of Doors - as well as chilling scenes on the river and an air raid in a village with Wagner blowing up the speakers (a scene that has become one of the most chilling, darkly humorous and incredibly useless war scenes ever) - everything this contributes to the meaning of the Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not in a distant point in the future, but Apocalypse Now and forever. The Deer Hunter is much closer and personal, you can also say from the title, and shows the total effect that the trauma has on the individual psyche, the breaking of the human soul and its ability to surrender completely to the forces of darkness or limp . This is why both films are the same: they are two parts of the same thing. In "Heart of Darkness", Kurtz is shown to be in conflict between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz left all the conflicts behind. He is beyond good and evil. He let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand moments before his death. Kurtz actually only awaits death, quoting T. S. Eliot in his temple for himself, lost in the jungle. His last words and the words echoed at the end of the film are: "The horror ... the horror". It refers to the infinite void of existence, of the human psyche and to the dark void in his own mind, where atrocities are reborn. It is impossible to put into words the experience of watching this film - in short, the experience that Willard experiences on his journey. The final part, at the outpost, almost in fact comparable to the scene of the brother in The Deer Hunter, is one of the most deeply, quietly and seductively disturbing things I have ever seen.
