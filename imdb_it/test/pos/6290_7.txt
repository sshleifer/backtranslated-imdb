Despite everything, I like this movie a bit. Pauley Shore is invariably ridiculously funny, and here is no exception. It is simply excellent in playing the weirdo with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance in this, although nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good, it seems to raise the performances of other cast members. Maybe it's because he's the kind of guy that is easy to bounce off of. <br /> <br /> The clich√©s about country life in this film are hilarious and the way Shore's "city boy" Crawl is so at odds with lifestyle, it's also fun, but it is not only he who is a fish out of water; the comedy also derives from the fact that, for any "ordinary" person or person, Crawl is a bizarre nightmare of a person. That's why this movie works so well: we love Crawl, it's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with Warner. It's an incredible cultural shock. <br /> <br /> Although this film is the classic Pauley Shore, so there is no need for a great brain energy to enjoy the movie, enjoy it, and there is also a "never judge" book from his cover "write morality here somewhere. Not bad, not bad.
