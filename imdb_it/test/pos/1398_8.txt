Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (The Island of Fish Men) purchased by Roger Corman and published through his New World Pictures. Obviously Corman has to carve out his initials by having one of his lackeys (Dan T. Miller) record more gore footage before making it available in the United States. <br /> <br /> The Isle of Fishmen is a very entertaining reinterpretation of Dr. Moreau's Island. It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli was shipwrecked on a mysterious island with some convicts just escaped. Claudio meets the stellar Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays the vile Edmund Rackham: a man who is able to manipulate the scientist Joseph Cotton in transforming the local native population into underwater amphibious creatures, (they seem a cross between the creature of the Black Lagoon and one of the humanoids from the deep convincing Cotton that mutations are created for maximum scientific and humanitarian reasons. <br /> <br /> After discovering the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham is using amphibious creatures to plunder his treasures.Sexy Barbara Bach plays the daughter of Cotton has a psychic connection with these mutations: In a memorable scene, Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination, and Claudio discovers that one of the inmates with whom he has held friendship has been turned into a cock-creature and then all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> Shot at the same time and in the same position as Zombi 2, Richard Johnson has not done I also have to change the seeds in the movies. The house where the experiments take place is the same house that Johnson uses to conduct experiments in Zombi 2. Talk about cheap movies! <br /> <br /> The additional video has some damn beheadings, (the way to go to Roger!), and a funny cameron Mitchell who does his best pirate imitation. All that is missing is the parrot. <br /> <br /> Spanish title: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
