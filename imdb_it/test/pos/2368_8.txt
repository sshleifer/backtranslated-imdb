This film makes many references to various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the original THX-1138 stage version (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here were clips of some of SF's first Japanese TV shows). Then the opening blow of the city in 2345 has the beep of the dragon that flies over the head with a billboard, immediately remembering a BLADERUNNER. The appearance of BLADERUNNER also comes <br /> <br /> more pronounced when we meet the hero, who is called Replicant (he has blond hair and is called Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, the character of Rutger Hauer in BLADERUNNER ?). A battle scene soon follows that immediately reminds THE MATRIX. The government that forces people to take drugs is like the THX-1138 and the main executor, while it seems a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, very similar to the TERMINATOR. The end of the battle resembles that of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is exhilarating. Probably not one of the best SF movies out there, but it's pleasant, certainly much more enjoyable than tripe like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
