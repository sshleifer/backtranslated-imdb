I saw him at the London Film Festival last night, apparently the shortest version. James McNally's summary of the film's content is very good. Nossiter skillfully fuses his survey of the wine industry into wider concerns about globalization, homogenization, the effect of the media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed by hand-held DV that some may find offoff, but which allows Nossiter to capture people off guard on a number of occasions that probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment . <br /> <br /> Despite the disproportionate feeling of the film, the editing is very clear, not only gives us a parade of dogs of the world, but also a fair number of comments from the interviewees with visually contradictory visual images, and giving enough rope to hang each other. To a certain extent this evoked Michael Moore's recent work (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the film's roots go back to "The Sorrow and the Pity" by Marcel Ophuls, both in the way the film French peasants like the stars are built and emerge in the "salt of the earth". De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered the questions later. We all really need a little mess - good Hubert! <br /> <br /> Overall an excellent film with implications that go far beyond the world of wine in the way we build ourselves as people and organize our world.
