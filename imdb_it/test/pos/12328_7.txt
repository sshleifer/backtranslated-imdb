Lightning flashes; a vast cemetery; the name of Adam 'Batman' West: everyone appears on the screen before the opening credits are over, yet despite these rather unpleasant elements, One Dark Night is not as trivial as it might seem. <br /> <br /> Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays the beautiful student Julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into the exclusive high school clique The Sisters. What Julie does not understand is that the other "sisters" plan upsets her with some macabre joke or that the most recent body to be buried in the mausoleum is the "psychic vampire" Raymar, who feeds on the life force of young women frightened. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is not the most original of the productions, but fortunately there are enough inventive touches to help make this film different from the competition, my favorites are the macabres the sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of Raymar's apartment and the gruesome way in which the moldy corpses float through the corridors of cold marble of the mausoleum during the excellent finale. Hal Trussell's impressive steadicam cinematography and Tom Burman's wonderfully macabre special effects add immensely to the chilling atmosphere.
