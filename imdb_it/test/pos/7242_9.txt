'Nemesis' was the last book to present Miss Marple written by Agatha Christie (the final official case 'Sleeping Murder' was written in the forties) and I always had a weakness for this. I loved the characters and are lovingly portrayed in this excellent BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson, terrific as ever, like Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> Overall he is very faithful to the book. Some characters are eliminated, the first (new) murder is slightly different and a couple of new characters are introduced. I personally felt that the added character of Lionel Peel was useless and rather irritating. The Madge tour guide was irritating in a different way but often quite funny. It is mainly due to Lionel that I do not press 10 out of 10! The other characters are beautifully made, in particular Helen Cherry as a dignified Miss Temple and all three strange sisters, but in particular Margaret Tyzack, who gives an impressive performance as Clothilde. He threatens to go over the top towards the end, but avoids it. The female bodyguards also have a good relationship and the episode contains one of my favorite Hickson lines ... "An archdeacon?!" <br /> <br /> This is another relatively recent BBC Marple that looks wonderful and looks gloriously nostalgic. Highly recommended.
