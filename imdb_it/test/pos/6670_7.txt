Who is the man ~~~ what do I feel? A resounding cry from Kevin? Well, if you didn't scream for the "usual suspicion" I suggest you change your prescription. However this is not a first class movie, just a very well made story, which is almost believable. Considering that it's an alien, you're probably wondering what? All the acting is the best and even the first I saw a balanced and sarcastic Alien. Simply fun is all I can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the film). SEVEN STARS
