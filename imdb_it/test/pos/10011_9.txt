I have to say, every time I see this film, I am deeply moved, not only by the most painful four years of Hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. It is also true that becoming addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol or pornography, can not only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. As the family is the number 1 priority in Asian culture, it takes courage for the circle to come together and show a person how much the family loves him. this is actually the first Chinese film that I really like, not for the sake of it, but the elements that surround it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this film worth seeing. What stands out most is that Hongsheng and his family act the story themselves instead of having a B-movie actor who tries to imitate the real person. Show the genuineness of the film.
