I avoided seeing this movie for a while, but eventually I got a copy. Having been born too late to see "Hair" in his contemporary environment, I was just familiar with UK and Broadway cast recordings for many years; and I saw it on stage at the end of the 80s, where it seemed a little creaky, but still, very funny. <br /> <br /> The movie. Drop some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cut others (Walking in Space). However, what is left is presented very well. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the main performers (especially Treat Williams like Berger, Beverley D'Angelo like Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable. <br /> <br /> As a hippy and hymn celebration, "Hair 'manages to remain powerful even in a film made ten years late. It was no longer the era of peace, love and Biba, but the time of punk rock ... even if watching this film now, at the time of the Iraqi problems, it gives a new resonance to the questions of Vietnam in the 1960s. /> <br /> Milos Forman, who also did "Amadeus" , did a good job in directing. In his scope and feeling he reminds me of Norman Jewison 'Jesus Christ Superstar', especially with the joy of the 'Aquarium' scene and the intimacy of 'Easy To Be Hard'. <br /> < br /> I really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born from the first real hedonistic era.
