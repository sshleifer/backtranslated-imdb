This is a bright western and strangely well written by the veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main help in this regard. His strong plot can be told in a few sentences. A hard from a book, a cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures an Indian enemy leader after a massacre in a fort. He insists on bringing the man back on trial, to be sent to Tucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out. This means the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead a second patrol - and choose the men that the fort can save more, a company of problems - to defend the advanced fort that had been wiped out and save the command from a another attack blocking the bottleneck move in that sector. Like Lance, the young Gregory Peck is quite strong. More in the big cast of this film that shows life in a cavalry outpost that resembles a host of heterogeneous types and quarrels includes powerful War Bond as a hard-drink sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as trouble, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr as psychopath and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as other officers with Nana Bryant as the colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as the love interest gets in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief and Jeff Corey plays the scout of the fort. There are really two great scenes in this very well done western - the long section of the fort before the last patrol is sent, and that long patrol to the condemned Ft. Defiant himself. Once at the fort, Peck comes to deliver a great speech in which, at the request of the men he has lined up for the orders, he tells everyone why he has brought them forward. reading to them their flaws one by one; then they tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die for him, to take the Indian instead of going alone ... and he feels bad for the rest of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and the bravery. Franz Waxman's music is good, the qualities of the production are admirable; the discussion of what would happen if Lance assumed the head of the war is actually true; apart from this unsolvable error of the central character, this is a great western. It has been my favorite for fifty years.
