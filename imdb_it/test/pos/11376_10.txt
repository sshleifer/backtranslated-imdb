This was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90s. Yes, it's a rip off of the good guys. But as they say, good poets borrow, the great poets steal. And PTA has brilliantly stolen some of the best, also adding some brilliant touches. I gave this to ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I'm commenting on this though (because I could rave all night) are all those people who saw it on VHS standard problem ... what are you thinking about? This deserves the FULL SCREEN experience. Look at the report in which it was shot! I saw it 5 times in the cinema and I didn't bother watching it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
