I was very lucky this year to have seen several films in my university's art museum. Sometimes, well, more like half the time, I can't watch movies there. I systematically tried to view all the films that I missed. So far pestilences and pleasures on the Salton Sea and who killed the electric car? are the other films that I had to look at this way. The film is an interesting topic and is well theorized (the emphasis on this later), but not as effective as Plagues and Pleasures, but far superior to Electric Car. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film's thesis is the future of the American concept of suburban life. It calls into question the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. Thus, the film discusses the origin of the suburb, and its evolution until the early 2000s. One of the themes on which the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants. While many people can live together, they do not "know" each other when we define the word. This, for me, represents the strength of the film: its appeal for true human emotions. We can understand the filmmakers' topic much more easily because they don't have to convince us of the legitimacy of their arguments. This is also one of the reasons why Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia loses its message in an explanation by Firebrand in support of its central argument. While the interviewees speak, their arguments become progressively more similar to those made by militant environmentalists. We are told that oil production will reach its peak in this decade, but no scientific proof is provided (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) in support of this statement. We are given little information on how this date was calculated. Fortunately, this was the only significant flaw that I was able to detect in the film's discussion, however it is still evident. Another less important discrepancy I noticed was the liberal (political) polarization that could polarize some viewers. However, this bias reveals serious footage of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. The clips, especially those from the 50s, seemed a bit useless. The film was not better with their presence, and would have been more concise in their absence. <br /> <br /> As I thought more about this film before composing this review, I thought about why I found his argument more convincing than other documentaries I had seen recently. In the end, I realized that the filmmakers actually offered an analysis to the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized village system in which people live together. They argue that this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. They define the wasted space as the long stretches of parking between commercial areas, for example. What is incredible about this assumption is that it is actually conceivable. Most documentaries vaguely state that some problems should be solved but offer no method to do so. Thinking more about the film, I decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why I give it a favorable review. <br /> <br /> Although neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in the presentation, The End of Suburbia is a worthwhile investment of its time. Not only does it address the contemporary problem of sprawl, but it also provides realistic information on how to modify it. The public can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 50s, connected with the modern arguers. People living in Atlanta, Georgia or the triad region of North Carolina will particularly appreciate this documentary as sprawl is the most established.
