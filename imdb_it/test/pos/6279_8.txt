This is like something I've never seen before. It made me collapse all the time I don't think there was a scene that I didn't laugh at. It's about a girl from the village of South who goes to a big city for college. At the school he makes friends with the RA on the other side of the corridor. When he realizes he doesn't have a family for Thanksgiving, he invites him to come home with her. Rabecca and his family and his serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do ... Propose. He pushes Cral to do something so he gets up and shouts something like ... Sorry buddy, but it's too late I already asked Becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago at school and she said yes. Everything turns into Chaos. Please look at this classic it was worth it ... I swear.
