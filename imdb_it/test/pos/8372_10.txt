Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he needs to take a break because everyone around him trusts him and stages his own death. When he discovers those he loved and loves still need, he gets Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina) to help them. In search of his past, his desires, this fabulous film by Claude Lelouch is the self-search of a man of mature age. <br /> <br /> Built like all Lelouch films, the beginning of the film with constant flashbacks could be disconcerting, especially the scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks a lot like his father) is playing a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion is in the same room - a flashback sequence that takes a second to capture. <br /> <br /> One of the most elaborate works by Lelouch, the inineraire of an infant gate is an unmissable story of self-realization.
