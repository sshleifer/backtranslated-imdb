I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was browsing the channel during a vacation. It's a great show, I just wish it wasn't turned on so late in the evening. It's on at 12:30. As a working person it is difficult to always look. <br /> <br /> I have read some comments. I didn't agree with the end of not growing up in the 60s and not believing that this stuff could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60s. I'm Hispanic and I had a "white" boyfriend and we had black friends in high school. I believe that people get along with their interests and personalities and has nothing to do with being a certain race or color. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the show to go on DVD, so I can buy it. In this way I can see it from the beginning.
