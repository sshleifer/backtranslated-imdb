Great vintage piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Big sets, captivating stars, big lines ("Miss Bender, I don't care if I beat her on a native drum!", Says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredibly asks how he should read a summarize a great deal of a very short time). If you saw this film filtered and scanned on TV and not in the letterbox version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you didn't really see it. We hope that this guilty pleasure of a film will soon be available on DVD in a letterbox version and with its original 4-track stereo soundtrack. Great sequence of titles at the beginning that captures the mood of New York in 1959, while Johnny Mathis sings the musical theme "The best of everything" in a resonance room surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of screaming background. Spontaneous abortions! Madness! Office romance! Bitchy heads with a cold heart! Frustrated love! It's all here for fun.
