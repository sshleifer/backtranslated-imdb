This is a wonderful new film that is still shown in the cinemas of my country. His director, the Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is in my humble opinion perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, to deserve to be called great (that is, apart from the old masters who are still around and who so often they continue to churn out films). It is one of my biggest regrets for the fact that contemporary Italian cinema has suffered since the mid-1970s, mainly due to the terrible lack of funding and new talent, something that can be transferred to most fields and which makes Italy one of the most static industrialized countries of our production-wise time (both in an industrial and cultural sense) ... unlike, for example, China. And this, among other things, is the theme of Amelio's latest film. Few directors can tell me about the current and real state of my country and the world like Amelio, yet his images also have a precious eternity and universality. And for those who are already worried that they may be slow, ponderous and worthy of being certain: of those I have seen they are certainly not, at least not if you are used to quality European cinema. <br /> <br /> The basic plot of the plot: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician in an obsolete steelworks factory somewhere in Italy, probably in the north. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of the most versatile and talented actors of contemporary Italy. When an important Chinese steel company purchases some industrial machinery of the Italian steel plant, Vincenzo, who struggles to make himself understood with the Chinese director who does not speak Italian, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and that his converter needs to replace , an element is working on building itself. He warns them that not doing so could have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile a young Chinese woman named Liu Hua acts as an interpreter between the two men, but seems to struggle to find adequate translations for some of Vincenzo's technical jargons. The Italian eventually loses patience with her, practically pushing her aside and asking her to give him the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can translate by himself. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he discovers that the manager of the Chinese factory and his employees have returned to their country without paying attention to its proper use of the industrial machine. So Vincenzo, endowed with his great integrity, leaves for China. And here begins an incessantly fascinating street film through China, a very current 21st century odyssey through the Asian giant. Marco Polo's latest search for the secrets of the mysterious nation? Not exactly. As in all Amelio's films, the journey itself becomes much more important than its final "mission" or not. In fact, the way the point is literally brought home, not without a touch of humor, is a delightful, touching paradox and irony, which made me look up while I was simultaneously smiling. The viewer suggests that Vincenzo's journey was ultimately completely useless, but he himself does not know, and a satisfied man, an innocent deluded, returns home. At least, you believe, he is happy. A little bit of. <br /> <br /> The journeys that the characters of Amelio undertake totally uprooted and strip them down to their essential, essential human. I am momentarily without a name, state or someone to put in a word for them. These themes by Theo Angelopoulos have also been explored in Lamerica, actually my favorite film by Amelio, closely followed by La stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian banditers travel to Albania to "do business". Just like Vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and then go home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends up on an almost Homeric journey through this land devastated immediately after the fall of communism. <br /> <br /> But let's get back to The star that isn't there: once Vincenzo is in China, it turns out that the seemingly "simple" task of delivering the converter to his new owner is anything but simple. The new location of the machinery is apparently almost impossible to determine, unless it undertakes a arduous journey through China. When he meets Liu Hua, the young interpreter who has abused working as a librarian, he tries to talk to her but reacts in a hostile way, informing him that, because of him, he had lost his job as an interpreter in Italy. Interpreted by the newcomer Ling Ling, Liu Hua soon becomes a Virgil for Vincenzo's Dante when, reluctantly, he thinks he could do worse than serve as a guide and interpreter for the Italian on his journey (obviously for a substantial sum of money ). This young Chinese actress may not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, nor the charm of the Gong Li movie star, but her charming, expressive and graceful face exudes a combination of rebel strength, intelligence, dignity and ironic humor that will make it difficult his features forget once you've seen the movie. Furthermore, she and Castellitto have a wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars. <br /> <br /> Amelio interweaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic and humorous at the same time, while maintaining a heart that warms up to explore the ephemeral essence of humanity in everyday circumstances and common. A documentary naturalness hides what in reality is a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places, a vision that also manages to incorporate a cinematography of breathtaking beauty. Photography here is functional and at the same time splendid, as befits a film about displaced people in an industrial and emotional area. <br /> <br /> Amelio's attentive eye is adult, disillusioned, but also never cynical or misanthropic. Even the magic corners of the camera give a sense of Vincenzo's alienity in the eyes of the Chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that is very rare in films about a "familiar" Westerner exploring a non-Western country not familiar. I can't recommend this movie enough.
