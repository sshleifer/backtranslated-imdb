This film was made thirteen years before I was born, but I still think it's the most playful, the sweetest, the most innocuous piece of fun ever made. He simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb British actors he boasts. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Alastair Sim-unmatched; Margaret Rutherford-idem, the wonderful innocent, innocent Gossage, played to perfection by Joyce Grenfell's enthusiasm. The caddy Victor Hyde-Brown (a Guy Middleton special) and the rest of the staff summarize post-war bourgeois England in a t-shirt. <br /> <br /> Humor is sometimes obvious, but it is of this special "Ealing" variety and is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film more times than I would like to remember and in any case laugh like antics every time. The assault of the dorms occupied by the girls' school, the school's twin tours magnificently planned but ultimately condemned in the end and the chaotic ending that involves the arrival of a third school to add to anarchy, are priceless. <br /> <br /> It's an old clich√© that I know, but it doesn't really make them that way anymore. How I wish they would do it. If you haven't seen it, please do it, you won't be disappointed.
