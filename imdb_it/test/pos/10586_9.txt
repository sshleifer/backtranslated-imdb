"Haggard" is set in the hometown of Bam Margera, Westchester PA, a semi-true story about the lives of Ryan Dunn and his friends Falcone and Vallo. <br /> <br /> Dunn was left by his 2-year-old girlfriend, Glauren, who now sees a beer hanging in the balance, a long-haired metal head named 'Hellboy' and this is driving Dunn crazy with jealousy. <br /> <br /> In a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what's going on between Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone to enter his home and produce evidence of the affair, with somewhat disastrous results for all interested! I found this movie very funny, perhaps partly because I am a total fan of Jackass and CKY, and it must be said that a lot of humor will probably be lost on those who do not have a prior knowledge of Margera's "comedy" crazy brand. <br /> <br /> The film contains a lot that will be of interest to skaters, not least the cameo aspect of the skateboarding legend, Tony Hawk as a police officer. There are also cameos by Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis and the long-lived parents of Bam, April and Phil. <br /> <br /> Extra DVDs include CKY music videos (with Bam's brother, Jess on drums), and Bam's favorite band, HIM (Bam's character in the film takes its name from the frontman of the HIM Ville Vallo) There is also a documentary and a scene "too hot for jackass". In summary, as I said before, this film will mainly be of interest to skaters and fans of Jackass / CKY, but I feel that Margera and co made a great effort with "Haggard" and I for one, I had a great time.
