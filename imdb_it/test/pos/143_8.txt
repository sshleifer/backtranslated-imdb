I am the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park's Thirst is exceptionally well done, but spending more than two hours with Tae-joo (OK-vin Kim) is enough for anyone to tolerate for so long. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest who wants to volunteer for experimental studies on those who are willing to undergo rigorous injections concerning a specific virus that kills infectiously. Instead of dying legitimately, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always eager for the sustenance of blood that gives him the chance to fight an infectious disease that returns causing the symptoms that afflicted him at the beginning (.. bumps / sores and the body vomits blood ). Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes tortuous death when exposed to Hyeon for a certain period of time. Hyeon falls into concupiscence with Tae-joo, the wife of the aspiring childhood friend Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin). Tae-joo was greeted by Mrs. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), considered a puppy, and practically used as a pet to order around. Ta-joo is unhappy in this situation and starts a torrid story that incites with Hyeon, who will soon manipulate him perhaps by killing Kang-woo into believing he is a victim of abuse. Giving up his priesthood, Hyeon plunges headlong into his relationship with Tae-joo, soon a participant willing to kill Kang-woo. This incident, to which Tae-woo contributed (using a boat, in the middle of a lake, both proceeded to bury him underwater, Tae-woo kept him Kang-woo from re-emerging while trying to re-enter) haunt them both, while the circumstances they introduce themselves with "missing" Kang-woo (Hyeon got rid of him, where the police would not find his body). Soon Mrs. Ra suffers a stroke (... even if a finger and the ability to blink contributes greatly as the story progresses, showing that she is more aware than they believe), and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday gift ..vampirism. Thus, Hyeon created a monster. Tae-joo admits (even if a strip of tongue) that, in reality, Kang-woo never hurts her, and while thirsty for blood she soon realizes that killing for an escort does not bother her morally or psychologically. Tae-joo becomes such a full hand, Hyeon must take desperate measures if he wants to stop such a threat to society, including himself. <br /> <br /> I will say that Thirst is one of the best horror films I have seen for 2009. It is a methodical approach that Park takes and we are led along a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo, because they commit terrible actions without anything positive ever coming from their unholy union. Innocent people die because of Hyeon's love (... what was once lust turned into an obsessive love towards the end) for Tae-joo, and will cease to end if he does not make a painful choice. We see inside their heads, their souls, and it's not always pretty. 2 hours with them can be quite grueling ... but, credit to the director for not throwing punches with regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people. Hyeon, seen as a rather pleasant soul at the inauguration, accepts "hell" for Tae-joo so he can look at Thirst as a unique but not quite healthy love story. <br /> <br /> violence, while Park has a tendency to move away from extremely graphic details, there is enough sadism to perhaps turn the stomach a little. At the very least, the way violence is conducted can be sure to leave a lasting impact. The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be quite hot and erotic, while also sordid and morally reprehensible. The film, I think, is still a fairly complex examination of the lengths that will remain attached to an object of affection (lust).
