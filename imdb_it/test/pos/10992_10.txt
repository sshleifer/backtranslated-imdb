`Manna From Heaven 'is a delightfully compelling film. <br /> <br /> In the changing paradox of values ​​in middle-class Americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot changes the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of "Damon Runyonesque" characters. <br /> <br /> Their struggles with moral dilemmas, focusing on "what could have been", hopes to achieve youthful dreams, romantic desires and "strike big" to unite to create the funniest movie. Rather than relying on explicit "in-your-face" sexual testimonials, the thriving relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically subtle but clear. His slippage in his snare at the Art Gallery and their warmth in their poker game is exceptional <br /> <br /> The clear writing of the script is skillfully interpreted by an exceptional star and a supporting cast. One of the few films I've ever seen twice in its opening run, `Manna From Heaven 'certainly deserves national distribution. <br /> <br /> Conrad F. Toepfer
