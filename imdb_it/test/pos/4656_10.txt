What can I say about this film that hasn't been said hundreds of times before? It's an American classic. He generated dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is one of a kind. From the ridiculous opening / music montage to Bonaventure HOtel, I was conquered. Leon made us all feel so young and carefree. One question though, how did he get those two hot whores with him all the time? And how did they get the time / money to organize such an event? The cast is top notch. David Naughton is at his best here. Its tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Fox (in his first starring role), is a real brat. There is also Naughton's love interest and an idiot and the obligatory black guy in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things like trying to steal cups of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and flees to Flounder's van. Flounder's team gives us most of the play. What exactly is the deal with the blonde on that team? Are you dating Flounder? Or Melio? O Blade? Yes, the name of the Mexican gentleman is lama. The other guy on the Flounder team has the best jokes in the film, not the show here. The Meat Machine team is a group of drunks. My favorite is the armpit. But even the silent black man is fantastic. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of which are 450 lb). <br /> <br /> You know the ending from the beginning. But it does not matter. This is the me kind of the 80s at its best. Do not rent this, BUY IT. and buy it now.
