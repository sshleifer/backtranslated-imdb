If you took a great black jack, you added small jeepers and then a dash of joyride with a pinch of chainsaw massacre in Texas and a house of 1000 corpses ... you would have had MONSTER MAN! I went to this movie, I didn't expect much, but I had a great time enjoying the movie. the whole premise is really poor, a monster in a monster truck chases people, but it's so funny that the writer / director doesn't expect you to take it seriously. justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career. he is identical to Jack Black. the only problem with the film is the incredible role of the hero played by Eric Jungmann. but overall, if you're looking for a really fun movie that will drive you crazy until it breaks you in the corridors, and at the same time, you'll be scared to death ... take a look at this movie.
