Excellent film in many respects. Vicente Aranda managed to depict the time (1830) with meticulous care. The light, the places, the feelings are perfectly perceived from the beginning of the film. And along with this - contrary to what happened to "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical film - all this beautiful photography / music / clothing is wrapping up a very fluid script that reaches its peak only possible way. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, Paz Vega as Carmen is exceptional: liar, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a little less convincing to the public than his instinctive love for Carmen, but manages to convey the right tragic mood to the entire film. I recommend it to everyone: the best Spanish film of the year.
