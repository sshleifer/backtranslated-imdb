Well, I should say, "the only movie about the club / dj / electronic music and raves ... what a respect". <br /> <br /> Really seriously. It is a gloriously funny, fast and fairly accurate portrait of a raver's night. Although, he is in a club, he is in Wales and is a little dated. The film leaves out some sketchier elements of club life, but does not separate them altogether. It presents an idyllic but serious portrait of the ups and downs of the lives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At the center of the film, and the best element of Justin Kerrigan's screenplay, are the characters, eccentric, unique but completely understandable and accessible. This simple movie wouldn't work and would have been infinitely less fun if it hadn't been for Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers can deny the political and social implications of the subtext of Human Traffic as a drug movie, Trainspotting's Wannabe, an important node in British youth culture around 90 years, BUT ... they can't deny that they are engaging characters. <Br /> <br /> It's frantic, brutally honest, sobering, it's exaggerated, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a complex thing, as are the drugs that are taken in these events, as well as the people you meet. But from someone who has gone to parties, he gets tired and still goes ... Human Traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken from the subculture. Whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.
