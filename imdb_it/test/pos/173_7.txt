An absolute classic of the frightening 80s flix. This is not the same as any other as it contrasts pint-size, wide-eyed, psychotic young with the desire to kill all the adults in the city. Bud of JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (again the gold of the 80s) plays one of the murdering boys and is paired with one of the girls that Jake Blues tries to buy in BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he continues to disappear from the film for any reason. Violence is sometimes hilarious and even surprisingly creepy. The demonic band of smiling children, though somehow possessed by extra-planetary means, bears little resemblance to the Droid-ish Children of the Damned, who never thought of using guns, crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults. Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown - the other) shows her rack, like three times, while dancing in her room. This film is a rarity that I can't believe I lost in the 1980s. This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a child if I had seen it. Where is the continuation of the finale? This film is simply amazing. Look for it at all costs.
