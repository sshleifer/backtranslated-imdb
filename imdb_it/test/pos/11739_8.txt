In a second vision, this is still a wonderful love story that, in my opinion, is much better than the film that was combined with my set of 2 DVDs, the classic by Leo McCarey "An Affair To Remember". Yet it seems to have faded slightly (just a 6.6 rating here on IMDb, and dismissed by many critics as "gooey slime"). How sad, because this is a romantic and intelligent drama with an excellent work by the two protagonists, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. If nothing else, the film should be well remembered for its splendid color cinematography and the unforgettable soundtrack. I don't really like Valentine's Day, but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and I'm happy about it. While I still think that the death of the character of Holden is too heavily foreshadowed, removing suspense from the final scenes, this film is very moving and I enjoy it a lot.
