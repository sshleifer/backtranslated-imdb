Great Comic Strip comedy from the 1980s set in the south west of England. It's a story of sex, drugs, cream tea and murders on the seashore. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (exhilarating in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a part. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress his girlfriend by bragging about being involved in a multi-million-pound drug deal. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I'm trying to find out the original image report for this film, but it doesn't appear under "Technical Aspects" on the IMDb website. I found the DVD in the store and it appears to be in 1.33: 1 format (full screen). Was the film shot in this report or was it originally a widescreen movie with a pan-scan DVD? It would be useful to know how I hate pan and scan movies. So go to IMDb. Could you find out for us?
