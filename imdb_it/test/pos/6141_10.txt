Although several Wirey Spindell scenes can be described as "over the top". I thought it was nice to see something that was willing to go to an almost taboo comedy level. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with a great dialogue. I wouldn't say that this film is for everyone, but the film is in my top 10. <br /> <br /> If you can look past its occasional offensive and watch it for the movie it is, I hope you can see it in same light that I do.
