Since 1996, before I watched this film, I never reached the end of my satisfaction, I feel that I want to look more and more until now, my god I don't think it was ten years ago, and I can believe it I remember almost every word of the dialogues. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfect. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to write the words "black night" and I always say it for many times, without ever getting bored. I love the music of Szararem, he is very spiritualist, he made me come to another world deep in my heart. can anyone hear what I hear and anyone could make the film this way? I don't believe it Thanks Ondaatje thanks Mingela.
