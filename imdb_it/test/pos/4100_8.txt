As a movie buff, I obviously read all the heartbreaking reviews and funny and sarcastic comments about this movie (my favorite is Woody Allen's joke "If I had my life to relive I wouldn't change anything ... except to see the remake musical of Lost Horizon "). So I was never able to look at him without smiling at the choreography / sets / songs etc. I recently came across a widescreen DVD and saw it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the reputable movie. I loved it and, after trying to block all the negative prejudices I obviously had on the film, I too. There is nothing particularly ugly about Lost Horizon, and it is much more enjoyable and watchable than many other films of the 70s. It is not even the field in particular. The lyrics of some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic, but this is not obvious when you hear them for the first time or if the flaws are highlighted beforehand, so you are ready to mock them. As with all critics who have claimed that the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart after Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were nicknamed (also brilliant, since the voices match their voices perfectly speakers) and Sally Kellerman really looks good and has a totally unique singing style. On a vocal level, Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on "The things I won't miss" is excellent. A special mention must be made to the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer, the brilliant interpretation of the High Lama - and his comments on the fact that humanity is being destroyed are coldly suited to today's fragmented world. I wouldn't say for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (The things I wouldn't miss are the uninspired choreography and the number of "Question Me An Answer" by Bobby Van, which could easily be cut), but if you haven't even seen Lost Horizon, or you haven't seen it for a while, try to look at it without that "Oh boy, let's laugh at this pile of trash" attitude and you'll be surprised how fun it really is.
