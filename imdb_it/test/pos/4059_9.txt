Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, what a team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter and that guy from the Everyday video are next door for the ride. This is a fun and fantastic movie. Not only is it so, but it is a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) directs this infernal film. From beginning to end, it was a masterpiece. No slapstick humor here. But the good old time laughs. Making fun of all the other detective movies (to name a few lethal weapons, Beverly Hills Cop, Fifteen minutes and etc ...) <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie, watch this. You will like it. He has a wonderful cast and crew. So, take off ** to watch "COPS" and watch "Showtime" for a detective movie. And remember, they'll protest your neighbor to ... um ... oh! Friday night at 8:00 am (friend, everyone says I'm a bad writer).
