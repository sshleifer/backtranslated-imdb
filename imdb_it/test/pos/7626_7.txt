I was 9 when I first saw it on TV. a Friday night I remember the full-page announcement in the TV guide with the Rex image. amazing how some things remain in your mind after 30 years. Anyway, if you're a kid who likes monster movies, that's pretty funny, especially with Boone and Keats who are mad at each other. The special effects are not harryhausen but it is worth an hour and a half if you find it somewhere in the late night TV. I haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics vanish from cable TV. If you take it late at night, don't be too critical, take some snacks and enjoy it. it could be poor but I thought it was much better than the kong remake that was released in theaters a year earlier.
