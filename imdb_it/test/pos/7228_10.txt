Wow, this movie is fantastic. It's such an excellent film. He has some sick scenes (not as bad as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie) some nude scenes, and this was the monster's debut on the movie! This created the scene for many Troma films, this is a very Tromatic film. Mix comedy, romance and my favorite, HORROR / GORE! Not so much blood in this film, but enough to satisfy. This is the best adaptation of Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare. Much better than any other version. Make it so fun and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I like it. :) All I have to say is that this is a fantastic movie, very funny, and Lemmy is a good master for that. The acting is good, and Kaufman directs with style as always. Must see for all TROMA fans!
