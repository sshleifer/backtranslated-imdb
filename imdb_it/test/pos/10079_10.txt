Finding this piece inserted between a stale prequel and a dried-up 80s machomovie on a Saturday midday program of the UPN subsidiary would be misleading. It deserves better and definitely uses the best features of its lucky charms at its maximum advantage. Bracco and Walken's team provides a film that, although perhaps predictable for those familiar with their genre, does the streetwise, "troubled mind" routine they are so good at portraying. For a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster during a Fuqua "Training Day", return to the world of the first TV movies of the 90s to find "Scam"!
