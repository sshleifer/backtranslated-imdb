In the early 1980s, I recorded Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable. Since then I've been waiting, hoping it was on DVD. I found it yesterday. It's one of the best studies of humorous characters I've ever seen. The Old Fashioned episode is priceless. At this time (4/28/02) only two have reviewed it. One hated it, the other loved it. If you have a DVD player, rent it or buy it like I did.
