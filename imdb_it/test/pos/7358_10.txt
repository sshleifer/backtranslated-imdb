He may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or sponsorships of Scream, Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing missing from these three films: the real horror. <br /> <br /> This film tackled the theme of urban legends a year before the urban legend aptly named and less compelling. It was intriguing, masterfully scripted and logical in a way that I know what you did last summer could only dream of. In the end, he focused his attention and ended in a burst as Scream died and died. <br /> <br /> The most exciting thing about the film is the variety of horror that writers and directors have achieved. The general history of adolescents around a bonfire was the classic terror of the unknown (but certainly expected) fate that awaited them in the forest, but the stories themselves are where the film really shone. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is pure and frenetic urban myth. It is based on a popular legend, and the director plays this with the style and rhythm of the action, making it more compelling because we know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The first bonfire story is a straight forward thriller. Based on another popular myth, we don't realize it until the end, either because it blends so well in history, or because the action attracts our attention. Being the thriller of the trilogy, this sounds our fear of the unknown and includes several well-made "jumped" sequences that don't seem almost cheap or contrite like those in films like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more suspenseful. This time, even if the characters still don't know what's going on, we do it, and this provides the horror. No need for chills at low cost here. <br /> <br /> The final story contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy / hallucinatory atmosphere to scare the viewer. Since we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and from what they cannot explain. This is the real ghost story of the trio. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I thought that if I didn't like his most acclaimed counterparts and higher budgets, how would I like it? <br /> <br /> The truth is, however, that this film is successful where others have remained far from the brand.
