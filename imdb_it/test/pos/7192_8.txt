Asterix's second live action is much better than the pasted elements of ten different stories that have been called the first film, while remaining fairly close to the original comic. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Queen Cleopatra made a bet with Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to prove that the Egyptians are a great people. The royal architect Edifis seeks the help of Asterix, Obelix and Druid Getafix to complete his task. There are several loud laughter, some jokes that only the French could get (jibs at the 35-hour week) while others are more universal. The big budget special effects are spectacular but obscured by the lines of the original comic. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier still work brilliantly as a couple while Monica Bellucci makes casting perfect as Cleopatra. Also, for comic book fans, the hilarious pirates receive a look that makes up for their absence in the movie 1.
