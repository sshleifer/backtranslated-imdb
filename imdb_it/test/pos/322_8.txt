Last night I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Strangely, it was 137 minutes long - slightly longer than the time shown on IMDb. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confused style of shooting really lost me. The context for what was happening was missing and I'm glad I blocked it. In the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the marriage, war breaks out in their native country, Sri Lanka, and lovers are separated. Months later, his wife is very pregnant and aboard a refugee ship headed for India. In a refugee center, see the lady who is about to give birth - after which the titles for the film are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The entire focus of the film then changes completely - to a girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and her family. None of this seems interesting or important and you wonder what's missing - what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I discussed this and we finally realized that this child was actually the daughter of the woman in the first part of the film. In one way or another, she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad n. 2 - although he did not realize that these people were not his biological parents. <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter, the parents revealed to be totally idiotic (one of the complaints I had about the film), when they decided to tell this very young woman the truth about her relationship AND to say it in a way that left the girl emotionally messed up and confused. Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way, the parents made up for it by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact this has had on the girl and her parents (especially her adoptive mother) has been impressive to watch and has certainly aroused my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and brutal civil war movie with the Tamil militants, away and away, for thirty years. The family's decision to look for a mother in Sri Lanka was indeed noble, but also a little stupid at times, since they took so many risks and were almost killed by jumping over and over in the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating, but it also left me wondering about the adoptive parents' sanity - first you tell them they are NOT your biological baby and now you take it in the middle of a WAR AREA !!! Of course, the child really wanted to meet his biological mother, but this was really stupid at first sight. If I were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and deceive the child - thus avoiding being in the middle of a war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the film was good to see and was very rewarding. Far from the perfect, it certainly affects an emotional home run. Also, while I expected it because I saw several Indian films, many Westerners will be a little surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come from where - this is the standard in most films from India - including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
