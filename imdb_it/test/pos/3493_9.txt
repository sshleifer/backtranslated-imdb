The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was a stupid imitator, but no one who interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually a very smart guy, pretending to be stupid, so he can get really honest answers from people ... And it's very funny. So I didn't expect the film to be good, because it was all played - no real people or interviews. So the base point of the whole show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Sure it was stupid, but who cares if you can't brake safely with a car battery, like someone said? It didn't have to be a realistic documentary ... And it's not like the show, it goes in a totally different way, but that doesn't mean it's bad. When I finished watching it I was totally impressed, but now when a little time passed I realized that it wasn't that special anyway, but still deserves a nine - well at least for what it should be.
