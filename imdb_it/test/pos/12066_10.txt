This show is getting bright. It is a modern day Married ... with children. The screenplays are witty, because they are sprinkled with intelligent sarcasm. They are also realistic, addressing issues that plague many parents of teenagers today. In addition to the ongoing burden that you may not be the largest parent in the world, and what is the best way to deal with it? However, at the same time, it manages to remain light and fun. Which, with all the drama and action on television these days, is a very pleasant and welcome change. It's something you can sit in front of for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and relate. It is not the most exhilarating comedy in the world. yet it will make you laugh at least a handful of times in an episode. Michael Rapaport is as bright as Dave. It fills up the big shoes that requires heavily sarcastic script and then some. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and bounce off each other very well. This show has a strong future if it is sold to the right target audience and inserted in the right time slot. Also, if Fox releases it on DVD, the following will always be bigger. (As is a classic example with Scrubs.)
