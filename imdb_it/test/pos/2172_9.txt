This is an unfortunately unknown classic. <br /> <br /> The look is superb, the design, the costumes, etc. They are impeccable, the post-battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are vivid and truly human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini in the lawyer Derville's role steals the film with his clever and pedantic rodent execution, delighted by the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. Depardieu is good but maybe it's too big a presence for this role. <br /> <br /> Where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from the Balzac novel. These changes are editorial as Balzac has a lot of discussions about the company and this movie breathes with the characters. Nevertheless, Yves Angelo has retained the key ingredient, not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society, but every character must find his place in society: Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a peer, his wife (Ardent) comes from a low birth and when she was married to Colonel Chabert they reached their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and this represents a good drama as their goals are in conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> It also looks very modern: money is essential to gaining status to gain power, but someone can go down as fast as they go up. Derville enjoys the strategy, he saw the worst of people he tells Chabert when he takes the case. The original place of this speech is at the end of the novel, since Balzac sums up the human comedy with enormous irony.
