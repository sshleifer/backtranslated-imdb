Widely known as "Do not Look in the Basement" - this is pure horror from the 70s, the goodness of film B that could actually pass as the genre version of "Someone Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Although the film does not seem to go anywhere during the first hour of its duration, I liked this particular group of eccentric madmen and their various personalities and shortcomings - like the former army sergeant, a girl obsessed with the care of a plastic doll, a lovable man -child, and a mad nymph. After their chief physician was murdered by a patient, a small sanatorium hires a new nurse in their facility with insufficient staff, who plunges into the different "ticks" and outbursts of the resident. Things gradually get weirder, however, when patients start behaving much more abnormally than usual ... You never really know, or worry about, where the movie is going, because it keeps having fun until it ends completely! Many "twists and turns" felt a bit too forced and I could have used a little more blood, but I really dug a too-humorous mixture of humor and horror. Check it out...
