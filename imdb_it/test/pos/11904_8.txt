This film is the Latin godfather. An unlikely gangster bridges the gap with some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I liked the action and the shootings along with blatant acting and colorful characters. This film is not an Academy Award, but certainly fun. Hey, who needs an Oscar anyway? <br /> <br /> Chapa has a few balls to direct and recite (I think he also produced?) this film. It reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do everything, Robert Rodrigez. Keep it up, is there a sequel in the works? There are a lot of strings that need to be tied. The son returns and avenges the death of the fathers?
