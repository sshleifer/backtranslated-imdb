Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenarios! Ridiculous death scenes! Bad creepy, bad for non-reason! The last 30 minutes of this movie could be the best 30 minutes ever made, especially in the scene where decent and tireless citizens tighten their chains across the street, knocking down the bad bikers and then shooting them, only to be joined by neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the old woman with the broom? He's wiping out the scum! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how quickly punks give up after Fraker is killed. I'm laughing just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I also like the death scene of Kersey's girlfriend. He * walks away * after seeing her explode. These are small things like this that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I watched this film because of Martin Balsam, who I seriously think is one of the best actors of characters of all time (and that is his "being beaten by the scum" the scene is hilarious) and me I left with a new favorite movie. Thanks, Death Wish 3 for making me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> Other things I forgot to mention: 1. The strange sound effect after Kersey says "Cash!" when you buy your used car. Has! He's so wicked. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Have the writers finished the names of the toasts? 3. The fact that the gangs apparently have a "lend and lease" thug exchange program: "I need other kids". And that Mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the film, after Kersey detonates Fraker: is it just me, or does it seem that the street gang is about to enter the choreography while giving up? See how they are synchronized after the female punk gave the "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing cheers me like Death Wish 3!
