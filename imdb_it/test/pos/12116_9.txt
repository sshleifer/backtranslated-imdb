This was a great anime. It is true that the animation is old but it is still worth looking at and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem is that it has been quite long. <br /> <br /> Japanese movie star Hiroyuki Sanada who played Ujio from Last Samurai played the main character Jiro and was directed by Rintaro who made Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> The anime has some good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan and of course he doesn't forget the beautiful soundtracks of the film. <br /> <br /> All this movie is worth watching the fans of anime, animation in general, action and Samurai / Ninja movies. Despite the film's lows, the film was not a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie.
