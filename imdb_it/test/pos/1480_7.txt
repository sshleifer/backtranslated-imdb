All the reviewers are making a big mistake. This film should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It was made for children and teens of the late 80s or early 90s and as such was really a film of its time. If you hated that period, or you love the first movie so much you can't even joke about it, then this is rubbish, but only because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget here and the failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (cashed under four mils with a budget of nine million) were obviously the reasons to abandon the seriousness of the original and put it in the present. You can complain about history, dialogue or logic, but even this was done to run, not to win races. If the film had tried to take itself seriously, it would have been a total failure, but it doesn't do it for a second (in "our" world, Dar sees a cinema that advertises The Beastmaster 2, enough). To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry's films: this film knows its limits. It is more than a comedy / parody that is the usual adventure. Even the soundtrack (for the moment) was fantastic. Even the actors don't take it seriously, so even the usual irritating role of "spoiled rich monster" (played very well by the young Kari Wuhrer) is good. <br /> <br /> So, if you are nostalgic for the 80ies / 90ies (cheese) culture, or you liked the first part, and don't worry about going out with a cheese limb, you'll have a great time with this attempt to to revive Dar in the 90s (literally). This is not really the sequel to the first, and don't look at it if that's what you want. It's more of a "what if" fantasy sequel. <br /> <br /> Regarding the question "why the different dimension and not just the different time": when in history did we have those high winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones (from the end of part 1)? By the way, the film ends in the zoo due to an attempt at a big economic final (moneywise). It is supposed to be the best place for Dar to show all his moves (he being the animal manipulator).
