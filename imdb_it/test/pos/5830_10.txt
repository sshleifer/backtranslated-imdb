I admit that I almost gave up watching TV shows. Why? Because most of them talk about doctors, forensic doctors or some girl / boy, who can predict a murder sitting on the toilet seat. But I have to say that I was wrong when I saw the first episode of Oz, one of the most brilliant shows on TV to date. Oz is a show about maximum and safe prison and shows the episodes in the life of every cell-mate in the prison and their frustrations. What I like about this show is the fact that it has the courage to show real life in prison without annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even if the characters on the show were not to be heroes, you quickly became attached to them and their lives. Sure, theirs is a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and drugs, but that's the point of this show; to present how brutal and frustrating prison life can be ... heck, you can't show life in prison as a "clean environment" with "nice characters", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors are doing a great job and the whole hour of this show is going really fast. The only thing I didn't like about this show was the last season of the show, I think it got too weird and brutal and the ending wasn't satisfying. But overall Oz is still my favorite TV show so far, it surpasses Sopranos and millions of CSI and Dr. House crap with just one main title. Brilliant show that has the balls to show what other shows are taking us away; realism.
