To those of you who have commented on this film before and hope to see it again, I hope you did. It was broadcast today (November 28th '04) on the Lifetime movie network. I subscribe to Dish. <br /> <br /> Karen Arthur directed William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this gothic fairy tale, similar to a gothic, with skill. Lighting, editing and dialogue contributed greatly to the film and Hershey and Peterson were chosen to play the roles, both playing sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. The script was excellent, as was the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Not having known in advance, I guessed that the story was based on the truth, and now that I know I have to stay, as Santa Fe is a jump, jump and a jump from Tucson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and by the man who designed and built it (who was he? an angel?). But the plot, and it is several plots, of how it arrived is what fascinates you the most. Surely you have the distinct feeling that God in his heaven is in every detail of this entire drama of history. For you who saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who don't, I don't want to spoil a minute of it ... <br /> <br /> Bon vacation, <br /> <br /> Bob Shank Jr, Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ
