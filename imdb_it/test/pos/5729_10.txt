Ladies and gentlemen: the show begins with this documentary film. It is structured in three chapters, each organized chronologically. The first presents classical physics and links to Einstein. The second studies in depth quantum physics and enters string theory. The last reveals the theory of Everything ... The difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way, with everyday objects; even if you have to believe them without checking yourself - if you're not a scientist - (and even if you're a scientist !!). The film is not a masterpiece with its fabulous technique or the way it is produced; what really matters is the story, and WHAT A STORY !!!
