Folletto with a warm heart that portrays the angel-bow Michael as a quarrelsome, overweight, cigarette smoker who loves to dance and ride with the opposite sex. He has a good side, however, as he struggles to sort things out in the life of a couple of burned-out losers before being called back to heaven. Funny movie, well played; very pleasant although a little irreverent.
