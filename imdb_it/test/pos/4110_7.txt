The musical remake of Ross Hunter of the fantasy of 1937, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was canceled by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, resenting a counter reaction to musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood For years. A group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight from a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes into snow-covered mountain terrain; A rescue team arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun always shines and most residents are young and happily happy. Some of the performances of the class cast are not so classy (the sparkling atmosphere of the piece, the melodramatic Burt Bacharach-Hal David, as well as the lightness that all comes together to make the artists a bit silly). Peter Finch is the custodian of international peace who is involved in a somewhat constipated love affair with the resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is a discontent that spews out phrases like: "I got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads wide open, so that people with the STILL head - and usually under the hair dryer - could get one last kick before turning to 'last recipe "; John Gieguld "as Chang", an Asian who learned to speak English while attending Oxford, is humorously self-amused (but why is there no song for Chang?). Hal David's stupid texts sometimes leave you speechless ("On the good ship Lollipop / how did Christopher Columbus / sail across the sea?") And the rhythm gets bogged down with all that chatter about the outside world and how nothing is anymore today painful today. However, the production is lush and the general treatment strangely influential. The two-dimensional characters are so overly serious that they become really eye-catching and the film's stupidity is contagious. It ends up being a lot of fun. *** from ****
