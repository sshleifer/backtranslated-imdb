this is another good western, which I liked. It's not an epic or anything, but it's good for what it is. "About 3 fur hunters, led by a man named Jed, who is rough and uncivilized. Jed and his two friends find themselves as explorers of a fort that is the only thing that stands between them and the Indian gang , that Americans resent on their land, and want to take them back in. This is the meaning of the story.The following is the action, the excitement, even a bit of forbidden romanticism and humor.One of Jed's friends, Gus , it reminded me a lot of the character of Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws. They both have a crusty and gruff behavior.If you are a western fan, you should find many things that this particular voice likes. 10
