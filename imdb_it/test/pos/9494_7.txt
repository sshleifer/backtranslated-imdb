"Do not Change Your Husband" is another soap opera comedy by producer / director Cecil B. De Mille. It is noteworthy as the first of several films that he played with Gloria Swanson. I imagine you could even call it a sequel to "Old Wives For New" (1918). James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter are a forty-year-old couple in which James has gone to seed and become sloppy and lazy. has a penchant for stinky cigars and eats raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to make it straighten to no avail. <br /> <br /> One evening at a dinner at the Porters, Leila meets the charming Schyler Van Sutphen (now there is a nickname), the playboy nephew of Mrs. socialite Huckney (Sylvia Ashton). Invite Leila to her house for the weekend to "miss James". Once there, Schyler starts making moves on her, promising her pleasure, riches and love, if she leaves her husband and leaves with him. The sequences involving Leila in imagining this promised new life are generously staged and include the dramatic costumed costumes of De Mille later in his career. <br /> <br /> Leila, bored by her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces James and marries the playboy. James eventually realizes he has lost the only thing that mattered to him and begins to repair his ways. The mustache is shaved, solves, shuns onions and regains good manners. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, everything is not rosy with Leila's new marriage. It seems to Schyler that he likes to gamble and has filmed with the gold he dug Nanette (aka Tootsie, or a similar name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all his money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover his losses. <br /> <br /> On a fateful day, Leila meets the "new" James and is taken by the changes in him. James leads her home and becomes aware of her situation and ...................................... . .......... <br /> <br /> This film marked the beginning of Gloria Swanson's growth towards celebrity in a career that would rival that of Mary Pickford. Barely 20 years old, he began his career with Mack Sennett two comedies for teenage reels. Elliot Dexter was almost 50 years old, but he and Swanson are a good team, although it is difficult to imagine that someone is getting tired of the beautiful Miss Swanson as in the case of this film. <br /> <br /> Dexter and Sylvia Ashton had appeared in the analogues "Old Wives For New" where the wife had gone to seed and her husband was wronged. <br /> <br /> The cast also includes the regulars De Mille Theodore Roberts as a bishop and Raymond Hatton as a gambler.
