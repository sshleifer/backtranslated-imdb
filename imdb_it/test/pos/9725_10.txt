This is the best television series for children (and adults) ever. John Hurt is a great actor, with many excellent performances for many years, but was born to play the narrator. The scripts for almost every episode are superb pieces of craftsmanship, and the productions manage the range of emotions, alternately fun, sad, happy, exciting and always wonderfully wonderful. It is difficult to choose a better episode from so many excellent contenders, but "The Soldier and Death", with its timeless pathos, is unbeatable. It's a series to watch with your kids, again and again.
