Yes, it's a wannabe from the Fast Times, but it's still decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the play are really fun. The scene where the three boys visit the Spanish lady is hilarious, with a little flamenco music in the background. The reaction when the sailor's husband returns home is a riot. The exploits of boys in dealing with crabs are fun even when they try to "drown" them and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /> <br /> Even the abortion scene is a rip off of the Fast Times, but it does a good job in capturing the terror of the situation. You really feel for what Karen is going through, and for Gary in his mad rush to earn money to pay for abortion and to welcome his recovery. <br /> <br /> The finish is painful to look at, but pleasantly realistic. Viewers will not be prepared for this and will be a shock. <br /> <br /> There is a good eye for boys with girls and the Spanish lady, but heterosexual boys will probably want to skip the penis measurement competition. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack undervalued. Check out early, at the beginning of U2 (!), A The Cars on the front page and a tear-jerking song by James Ingram for the surprise ending. <br /> <br /> Some will hate it and it's a little dated, but those who like teen movies or grown up in the early 80s should like it.
