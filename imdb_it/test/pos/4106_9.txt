I went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released, I was 11 at the time. I remember how much I liked and wanted to live in Shangri-la, so I was naive and young. I recently found a video of the film I had recorded on television a few years ago. I looked at it again and I'm not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy as much as I did 29 years ago. I also like listening to the words of the songs, because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns doesn't hammer in our ears and if we look at our reflection - we should be happy with what we see. a movie "feeling good" because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I'm still naive but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you look at it with an open mind and have fun for what it is - a good family movie. I have to be one of the few people who has this movie on VHS PAL - and DVD (self-made) video. I recorded it on DVD while the TV videotape recording was running out. I still watch it from time to time.
