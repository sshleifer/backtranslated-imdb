I saw this film at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. The pianist reinforces the "Austrians = dark" argument that I am making. Isabelle Huppert won the well-deserved award for best actress at Cannes for her portrait of a woman who, in an attempt to achieve the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes increase, but they are soon outlined by the awareness of not being able to feel love like others. It's too late for her, and the last 30 heartbreaking minutes of the film are significantly lacking in the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty that it describes.
