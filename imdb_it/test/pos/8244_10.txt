I must say that I know Mister Ã–rnek's documentaries and so I knew I will have a very well made documentary film. I was not disappointed. As a nerd of history - I saw hundreds of documentaries and I liked the different approach of this work. <br /> <br /> The director and his 17 consultants (historians, veterans' families) tried to access the reality of Gallipoli through the letters of welds on both sides. So the story is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. <br /> <br /> Narrated is this docu by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill - both increase the intensity and the emotion of this documentary with their great voices. <Br /> <br /> I saw this film in a cinema in Italy in Dolby Surround. I bought the DVD last year and I'll wait another 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his excellent documentaries. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Intense. Story with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great storytellers
