This belongs to their highest level, although there were others, such as Micro-Phonies and Punch Drunks, who were more deserving of the Oscar nominations for this one. But if anything, the recurring speaker announcement, "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard", followed by "Woo woo woo woo" by Curly, makes it a two-tiered classic. First of all, it symbolizes everything the Stooges represent; my daughter loves repeating the announcement when she is in the middle of doing something silly. Second, the absurdity of these three as doctors in a hospital; I imagine the terror I would feel if I were a real patient in a real hospital and listened to this announcement on the speaker. In all this short, you hear that announcement and you know that something horrible is about to happen, and the voice of the speaker remains with you for months afterwards.
