Yes, this film has many gay characters. He also has straight characters, characters who are not sure of their sexuality, people who are looking for some truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about sexual orientation. It is about the loneliness and the difficulty that human beings often experience in connecting to each other. Filmically, Denys Arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of relationships and the contrasting and ever-changing relationships. The serial killer element has a little less success (it seems more like a way to enclose various points of the plot and, unlike the rest of the film, it is thematically heavy). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson centers and establishes the film; it's a quiet performance, but behind the beautiful and arrogant appearance slowly reveals a terrified soul who is afraid to show or accept love from those around him. The supporting cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as a friend of Gibson, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers. His role is more a metaphor than a literal presumption --- strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, it represents the light and darkness of the characters' sexual consciousness. <br /> <br /> The film involves and often surprises in the development of the character. The effect is similar to that of Robert Altman who directs a screenplay by David Mamet --- the dialogue is not reduced to some scorching observation apart from some artificial moment at the beginning. Often, in our search for love and a conventional "relationship", we ignore the love that already exists around us - in our friends, in the family, in those who are able to see us as we are. Arcand and the writer, Brad Fraser, make some astute remarks about the different ways in which humans try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This film is a rewarding experience. It may not be for fanatics who cannot overcome the sexual orientation of some characters to see the greatest transcendent message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this, which dares to explore the darker side of our lives with an intelligent and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open approach.
