This low-budget crocodile film really offers the goods. The fact that it was inspired by real events would mean little if you find yourself with a fake crocodile, a bad C.G.I., or an obvious setting in the studio. Fortunately none of these are involved in this fantastic and very realistic film. The crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I., and outdoor shooting takes place in a real Australian swamp. The actors were obviously inspired to create the most realism possible in their performances, and they succeeded. You can put yourself in their situation, which is a demonstration of how realistically "Black Water" translates as entertainment. Highly recommended. - MERK
