Duck_of_Death needs to watch this movie again, as its main criticism is completely groundless. The film never forgot the delay, and was explicitly mentioned in a couple of points. The crew was never shown to have conversations with mission control that did not obey the rules of time delay. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was a bit far-fetched was the amount of risk involved - would a crew land on a planet where the pressure suits would last only two hours? I doubt it. Would a manned spaceship enter the crown of a star? I doubt it. Would humans land on a moon that was bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? I doubt it. Furthermore, the ship seemed excessively sturdy. Would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down? I doubt it. Would he survive being struck by comet debris? I doubt it. I think that in both cases the stress on the structure would be excessive. But overall, the unlikely scenarios were offset by some well-made special effects, good editing and production, and some good acting, especially by the actors portraying the ship's captain and the Russian cosmonaut.
