The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared. When the right hemisphere of his characters overwhelms the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment and various abominations are released. Religion will not save you, nor mother nature or your family. Hussain's obscure poetry, because it is what this film really is, destabilizes all sanctuary institutions. <br /> <br /> `Subconcious Cruelty 'is a treat for the current crowd in the horror fantasy festival circuit. The initial meditation on the madness of the film is both well written and profound. The protagonist's desire to profane the birth process that led him to the hell he lives in unfolds with a horrible and credible illogical. From here the film continues deeper into the subconcious mother nature and faces. Hussain offers depictions of lustful pagan fertility and infectious folly of mushrooms. Nature is exposed as bloody and violent in Hussain's frightening illumination. <br /> <br /> The "Subconcious Cruelty" is disturbing for everyone and rewarding for those who see beyond the shock in the mature themes of life, lust and madness this very worthy movie explores. CJ Goldman deserves compliments for his special make-up, as well as David Kristian for the disturbing sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for the score.
