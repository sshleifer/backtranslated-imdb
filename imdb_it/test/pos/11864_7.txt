All right. Here's the thing. I read the comments of other viewers --- some ruined the film and some said it was the most comical, dark, blackest comedy ever made. Whiffs of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess what? It is still a funny and ultimately fun movie. Not brilliant, not trash. Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely can't take your eyes off her. She is a woman with very strong decorative ideas ... Matt Dillon, an undervalued and undervalued actor, is wonderful, as always. He always manages to overcome that delicate line between the scruff and the soul, and pulls out the play beautifully. John Goodman himself (although religious nuances, probably fun in the script, don't really work). Paul Reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on TV. <br /> <br /> The usually unbearable Michael Douglas is truly exceptional in this role. As for his headphone, well, watch the movie. Between this and "Wonder Boys", you are actually reminded that Douglas can act. The film will make you laugh in part. Ok, not exactly laughing belly, but definitely in the category I'm-amused-I'm-very amused. If you are renting this to see another "Pulp Fiction", forget it. But if you want something pretty trendy and fun, this is a damn good choice.
