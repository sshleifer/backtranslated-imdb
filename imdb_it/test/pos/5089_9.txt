Nothing boring in this film, which is held together by characters fully realized with a certain depth for them. Even hooded torturers have body language. Jannings' performance is brilliant, everything will want, will and will need. A Henry VIII as it should have been. Henny Porten is, perhaps, more noble and purer than Anne Boleyn, but interprets the part as written: A victim trapped in the jaws of a large (huge) small. <br /> <br /> Sparkuhl's cinematography is splendid in its restoration, its sensual colors. Lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveals their corruption to the smallest of pettiness. He takes his time, who can experience the patience of an audience accustomed to being dragged by action, but time is worth spending. Slow down your heartbeat and watch this little miracle of the German silent film.
