"Mr. Bug Goes To Town" was the last great success produced by the Fleischer studios. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the assistance of veteran Flieshcer Sammy Timberg are quite good, but not as good as the score in the photo by Leigh Harline, who also made Snow White for Disney, Harline's "atmospheric music" is superb, and a treat for the ears. <br /> <br /> The staging and staging of the image were years before his time, and once again the background artists of Fleischer have surpassed themselves: the beauty of the film cannot be denied, and while Hoppity is the star, the characters of Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito steal the picture, the dubbing of Jack Mercer (of the fame of Popeye) is priceless: Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) of Guy Lombardo ... and a vocalist in his band ... does his usual and pleasant job in the role of Dick Dickinsen. <br /> <br /> The film has been criticized for all the wrong answers ons The Fleischer Studios were animation experts for excellence eq This is clearly seen in the finished product. The film is melodious, the fantastic story for all ages, and the final scenes of the insects that climb their lives on a rising skyscraper are some of the best sets and animations of any past and present animated film. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this wonderfully hand-drawn film. Be sure to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of Max Fleischer's remarkable 3D stereoscopic process, which took four months to build and employ 16,000 tiny glass plates in Manhattan's "electrified" buildings. <br /> <br /> Don't miss Mr. Bug goes to town ... aka Hoppity goes to town. I bet you will be stunned by the results!
