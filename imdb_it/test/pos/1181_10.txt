Movies are not always supposed to be deep and provocative thoughts. Sometimes they are simply destined to escape from reality. Out To Sea fits the bill perfectly. <br /> <br /> A romantic comedy "golden years" with a tender heart, Out To Sea may not be a big budget, you might be able to easily say when they acted in front of a green screen, but it's still a lot a movie that is worth watching. A sweet film that needs to be given a break. <br /> <br /> This is just good fun, light. It is not meant to be a deep movie. It is something worth looking at. If nothing else, you have to see it for the humorously rigid and rigid rendering of Oye Como Va by Brent Spiner. Gil is a character you love to hate and Mr. Spiner brings out the perfect evil comic devil to two beloved gods of cinema.
