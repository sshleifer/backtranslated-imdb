If you like your sports movies on dignity and on the best values, this will work great for you. Oversentimental in places? Of course, of course it is - and I'm proud of it. It is the biggest and best race of the Carnival and should be enjoyed as such. <br /> <br /> Great production values, simple narrative, with creative shots: it is not complex, it is a very beautiful and extraordinarily sweet film. It really seems like a labor of love by Bill Paxton; and I bet your son understands it. <br /> <br /> Accumulation is slow enough to be enjoyed, exuberant conflicts, and the British against the Americans have handled a degree of Vaudevillian evil, but the dignity between two main transatlantic protagonists is always in the foreground. I have small complaints: the score wants to be James Horner but it's too exaggerated, and there are too many close-ups and panoramic shots for 2005, but if you want a simple, decent and good-looking sports movie, then this is So. Here's the thing, and I feel I know my movie, but actually I liked it better than Seabiscuit: which is a better film, but Greatest Story is simply Disney in the middle and pleasant! Thanks, Bill.
