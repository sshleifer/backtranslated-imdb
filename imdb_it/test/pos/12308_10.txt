The Argentine poet, Atahualpa Yupanqui, once said that some popular music is repeated in a similar way in any country in the world. They look the same but all consider them as their folk music ... <br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, speaks of the same music that is repeated all over the world at a time in the history of each country. First, some listen to it and try to make it heard by others. Then some, they believe they hear it, but they don't. So nobody says anything and some people seem to hear it. And others acknowledge that they heard it, but they don't think others can hear it. Finally, everyone listens to the same music, and suddenly it no longer sounds ... <br /> <br /> Love and poetry, like a true nationalism and the legacy of a father for his children ... <br /> <br /> Why would you call the movie, The Dead when no one dies? The Spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it Dubliners, following the title of James Joyce ... <br /> <br /> A beautiful Irish postcard from 1900!
