Nice to see a comedy for adults. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin through the skill of Mike Nichols. Nichol's mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and compelling Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and gripping Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman in " Closer "". In "Charlie Wilson's War" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and compelling Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are at the service of something else, it is personal only up to a "Certainly. Hanks must bury his splendor in single malts and Julia Roberts throws parties and introduces the characters with obvious frankness. Amy Adams testifies and exists as a character, witness. An insurmountable task that Miss Adams manages to magnificently overcome. It's Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus with a t, but he has monopolized my attention, his character may not be the first, but he is the first in the way Hoffman introduced him to us. and survives the contempt with which it is treated by the absolute conviction of being smarter than all of them put together. Hoffman is superb. The rhythm of the story helps enormously to avoid falling into a myriad of useless questions. An acute comedy, short, intelligent, sad and when was the last time I managed to say it?
