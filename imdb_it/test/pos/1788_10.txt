After the transversal success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television has allowed Barbra to create an even more elaborate sequel like its second special. Streisand knew wisely, to follow the incredible success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that his second special really should have raised the level of inventiveness and show even further. Not surprisingly, it has succeeded once again. Even more impressive, Streisand has managed to mount this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again, the special is divided into three distinct acts. The on-site filming at the Bergdorf Goodman department store was so successful in the first special, that Streisand and the company decided to film again on the site for the first act of this second special. The decisive place this time was the Philadelphia Art Museum, which would have allowed Barbra infinite possibilities to "enter" into different works of art that corresponded to the songs that were performed. In addition to the many artistic possibilities that this position has made possible, the museum offers the perfect opportunity to take advantage of color shots. <br /> <br /> After recording "Draw Me a Circle" which is set against the opening credits, Barbra then turns to the museum in a maid costume to the notes of "Yesterdays" by Kern and Harbach. He stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character that is depicted and sings a thematically appropriate song. Streisand performs a bittersweet version of Hammerstein and Romberg "One Kiss" as Thomas Eakin's CONCERT SINGER, exhilaratingly exalt Chopin's "Minute Waltz" as Marie Antoinette, embracing abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of "Gotta Move "by Peter Matz and performs a harrowing rendition of" Non C'est Rien "as a distraught Modigliani girl. The highest point of Act I, however, is when Streisand compares the profiles with the bust sculpture of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, while singing a tour de force representation of Rogers and Hart "Where or When". The circus medley Act II allows Streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals, while singing various songs with farm / circus / animal themes. Some highlights include the singing of Barbra "Were Thine That Special Face" to a small elephant, while she recited "I got used to that face" like a serenade to a pig, the "Sam, you did the long trousers" camp sang to a group of little penguins and Barbra comparing profiles with an anteater while they sing "We have so much in common". Streisand also swings on a trapeze and jumps from a trampoline to the chorus of "Spring Again", and then slows things down by running an obsessive version of "I stayed too long at the fair" while I sat alone on stage. Barbra also has the opportunity to show his pet Sadie poodle in this segment, and even to speak a little French. <br /> <br /> The Act III concert is once again the climax of the hour. Dressed in a slimming white wool suit, the concert segment is performed on a uniquely designed stage with a partial scale that leads nowhere. Streisand opens the Act with a fascinating version of "Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home" by Harold Arlen, before launching in heartfelt versions of the family standard "It had to be yourself" and the rarely heard "C'est Si Bon" (It's SO good). "Streisand really amazes the audience with an incredibly powerful performance, able to overcome the eighth of the Sweet Charity ballad" Where Am I Going ", of which Streisand provides the final version of. Streisand also introduces the ballad by Richard Maltby, Jr.-David Shire, recently written "Starting Here, Starting Now", which contains a passionate voice of Streisand that ranks among the best vocal performances of his long career. <br /> <br / > More than anything else, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for Streisand's ever-growing stellar mega-watt power, and despite the presence of even more visual glares, Streisand itself is still the main attraction. plus b she's never before, and this special was the first to show how surprisingly she photographs in color. As with MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another rating-smash and generated yet another Top-Five soundtrack album, sold in gold. Simply put, COLOR ME BARBRA defies tradition and emerges as a sequel almost like a classic.
