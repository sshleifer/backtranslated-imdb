I absolutely hate the idea of ​​making movies for television. For me, TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying from a disease that is difficult to treat, all done in such a sugary way that the public does not need the tissues insulin needs . So when DEADLY VOYAGE is a BBC and HBO TV movie based on a true story, I vaguely remembered a couple of years before the TV shows I sat waiting to get bored with no sense. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> No strike that the last sentence, I was not surprised I was shocked. Here is a TVM that grips you stronger than a great white shark, in fact DEAD VOGENT does not deserve to be relegated to television programs that should have been realized and distributed by a Hollywood film company for its absolutely terrifying premise and what! s more it`s - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - completely true <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the story !!!!! SPOILERS POSSIBLE FROM PLOT !!!!! sometime, in the early 1990s, a group of Africans settled on a Ukrainian merchant ship headed for France to work there. Of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration, but the cargo crew had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants to board a ship from a previous trip and no longer wanting to get into trouble with the maritime and immigration authorities. the crew killed the Africans after discovering they are hiding in the hold. All but an African, Kingsley Ofusu, who manages to escape from the firing squad but must try to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is hunting him and France is still several days away . <br /> <br /> Just type in the previous paragraph to remember how MORTAL JOURNEY IS GOOD. What an extraordinary story, and once again - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true. It's very well written, directed and acted, especially by Sean Pertwee (why isn't that guy a big name?), And above all it's a tense and disturbing disturbing thriller that I can still vividly remember six years after seeing for the one and only once. I can't wait to see him again. <br /> <br /> But you have to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most Hollywood action movies that came out around the same time? Oh wait, I just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott's directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley, Brad Pitt playing the role of Pertwee, a massive artistic license taken with events etc. We keep DEADLY VOYAGE a superb TVM rather than a poor blockbuster
