I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who commented here ... I came back many times to see it over and over again ... I think 9 times in all. It is just as fantastic as I would describe it ... I was taken by the soundtrack, by the splendid views of the south of France, by the lifestyle that the children started alone. An ideal way to live is what they had created ... obviously the powers that have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the film and live like this! So good that it's available on DVD now ... it hasn't been around for years! <br /> <br /> TLW
