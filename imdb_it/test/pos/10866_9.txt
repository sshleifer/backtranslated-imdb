Here we have an intelligent mix of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and intelligent filmmaking. Not that the script doesn't have its big holes and some special effects are a bit cheap. But cinematography is an optical pleasure and the soundtrack is first-rate. The combination of fast action sequences and slow colored parts, sometimes almost poetic, has no comparison in its kind of film, so a classification is rather difficult. The most similar genre is a disaster or a terrorist film with deeper human and political notes than usual. It's worth being seen around the world in cinemas. But I wish this for many other films (especially Asian) and nobody seems to believe me. Unfortunately.
