I loved the rye catcher, it seems to be my favorite book. JD salinger, the author of the catcher, has the rights to the book and he did it so that no one can make a film about it with his permission. <br /> <br /> with that said, "United States of Leland". "Beautiful film with a lot of meaning and depth in the emotions. But a lot reminded me of the catcher, it reminded me almost too much of the catcher. The few stories Leland told in the film how to visit New York and his adventures were very similar to those of holden in catcher, and the way in which Leland sees people and emotions is similar to Holden's, both are simple and true to themselves and others - superior acting attributed to don Cheadle and Kevin Spacy - a nice montage, everything fits perfectly and loved the story all together, recommending it as a purchase or at least a good movie. <br /> <br /> the only thing that draws in some points but compensates in the long run: give it time and enjoy a good movie.
