I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was great. The film is rather off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and over the top, but also very fun and effective. Does the character have to be pretty horrible because otherwise someone might have thoughts of killing his mother? Now Crystal's wife - she is a "bitch" that everyone would like to receive her snack, so her role, although minor, is also effective, because she must justify Crystal's ridiculous case of "writer's block". Although there are certainly dark moments, the film is not depressing and, despite the murderous impulses the protagonists feel, they also have the qualities of redemption. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember, one that I don't mind looking at several times.
