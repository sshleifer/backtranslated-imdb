-Love is hard to find in this fast food company we live in, so the man called Hitch has a duty to help men find love with the women they are madly in love with. its rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex that seems like a big deal but soon the word starts spreading and people start to get the wrong idea of ​​what they do and begins to complicate the relationship with the woman. I just met to be madly in love with. <br /> <br /> - I must say that it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that doesn't make him try to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no effects that leave you speechless or showing your reinforced body. He's just a normal human being in this film that was really cool. Not necessarily stretching his acting muscles in this film, but then again the story does not require it, but at the same time it was nice to see him relaxed and not show his ripped body to make those of us without six packs be jealous . His character here is like all his cute, witty and very charming characters which is something that almost all the characters in this strange love story seem to share. The character of Kevin James is just a normal boy who needs help to get in touch with the girl of his dreams, which really makes you feel for the boy and is the master of every step of his journey. the only character that was a sore point for me was the character of Mendez because it's so cold and calculated that it's hard to believe that Smith could fall in love with her. I have to love a challenge, I guess. <br /> <br /> - this is the part of the review where I will make a joke about how I would never need Hitch because I am such a player but I only wrote about 16 reviews for another website and I'm still working on a small project, so I'm a little tired right now. While the film is full of charm and funny characters with funny lines, slowly but surely falls into the sea of ​​romantic and formal films in which, after the great scene in which the terrible secret comes out, everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey there are like 4000 films about the loser that overcome adversity so I imagine that another film with a predictable ending that was done almost to death does not cause much damage. I also really like the message of the film, because in the end you don't need a formula to have the right girl, be yourself and everything will turn into a game that is the theme of the film and why it works so well. I am sure that if the character of James had taken the girl after following all that the character of Smith had said, it would have been a rather empty film, but since it works it works really well. <br /> <br /> Although predictable, this is a film with a PERFECT date. It's sweet, it's fun and it's romantic, so anyone watching this movie on a date should have a little after it's finished. and by some I mean sex
