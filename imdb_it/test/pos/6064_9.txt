This is one of the best non-English series I've seen. Make interesting individual and double crime resolution episodes along with a personal aspect that you don't get in CSI. Individual characters have personal lives that combine well with their daily work and occasionally interfere. Moreover, the characters all manage to evolve naturally during the episodes. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb and has been recorded throughout Denmark, giving a good example of the highlights that the majestic country has to offer. Unfortunately only 32 episodes have been made, but they are high-end televisions. I hope they consider making other episodes of the same caliber.
