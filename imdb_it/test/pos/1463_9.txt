After the dark highs it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye were able to create something as good as the garth marengi. And yet I think that man for a man in his own right is a good show (on good episodes) as a dark place. I can't say that 2 of the episodes are not so good, but the other 4 certainly make up for it. if I had to choose 2 fantastic episodes, I go for the Formula 4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. already having a little understanding of the program is a real advantage as Dean Learner makes many jokes inside, but even if you haven't seen much Dean id I recommend it as some of the launches in which it launches are genius ie. His discussion with Def Lepord on their name. All in All a great show that only misses the top marks because of the couple of less funny episodes.
