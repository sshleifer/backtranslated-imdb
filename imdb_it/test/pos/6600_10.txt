In fact, I have more questions than a comment. I loved Z-Boys and The Lords of Dogtown. Saw Lords first, then the doc, and while I loved the story, I'm curious to know why in the film, Sid was an important character, but in the documentary he was not part of the team, and only merely mentioned one boy they knew. Does anyone know the story about this? The story of these guys was amazing. I never experienced the skateboarding craze I grew up in, but my kids had fun. What I saw in local skate parks is what these guys invented. I never knew. When the film showed competition, and the Z-Boys did their thing, they embarrassed others in competition.
