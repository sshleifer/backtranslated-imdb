After seeing Meredith in "Beyond the Prairie" I had to buy another movie with her gaze. I can't believe how she got involved in this teenage movie. It is better to watch this with the sound turned off but focus on Meredith as it moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on "Beyond the Prairie". It is worth it at any price, this must pay you to see. <br /> <br /> This beautiful lady needs someone to put her in a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Maybe some of his last could adapt but I didn't see them. She has the smile of a Cathrine Bell and Dana Delany's eyes with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
