Dogtown and Z-Boys are a documentary on the Zephyr Skateboarding Team and their influence on skateboarding. It also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team. The documentary features the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing. He discusses the popularity of skateboarding in the late 1960s and 1970s, his decline in the 1980s and his "revival" in the 1990s. Skateboarding was introduced at Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr team originates from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which produced the first modern skateboards. The documentary consists mainly of the original members of Team Zephyr who talk about the past in Team Zephyr, the competitions they won, their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three particular team members; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three skateboard virtuosos and probably the best three team members. <br /> <br /> The interviews in the documentary were usually rumors about Dogtown's archive footage in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely you see the people interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archive material is in color. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (ie the Glory Days of Team Zephyr) and not the present. The documentary is very fast, as we often see clips of impressive skateboards on up-beat music of the time (like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and interviews tend to be fast and to the point. Not knowing anything about skateboards (ie not even knowing how to ride a straight one down the ground) I was very surprised to have found this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this show spoke more about the Zephyr Team than about the true sport of skateboarding, so while I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could identify with the boys on the team. Since it was created by the actual members of the team, it gives a little more depth and authenticity. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'd say this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. He gave me a completely new idea, not just in Team Zephyr, but in the skateboard as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it should be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
