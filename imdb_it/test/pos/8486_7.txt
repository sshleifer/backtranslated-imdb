I saw Ray when he came out. Why? Partly because of the advertising clamor, secondly because I just loved the music of Ray Charles. But not being around when his most important things in music and in his life happened, I wanted to learn more about human life. And in this film, I did it. His drug addiction was something I didn't know, and the movie let us know. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical film ... I can't say it was a "great" movie. I saw "Malcolm X" and it was wiped out. "What's Love Got To It With It" and "Bird". The performances of each of those films were exceptional. I was not only attracted by the main characters of those films - who did incredible jobs - but also by those around them. it helps me to take a picture. <br /> <br /> I heard that in some parts of this film it was superficial and heavy due to emotional appeal, and yes, I admit that in some parts of the film I almost fell asleep. "The film was too long. And the film left out" other "important details of Ray Charles's life that would have made the film run better. The film became" moved "in parts. And the film seemed to end in a groan, not a bang - some parts, including the ending played like a "Lifetime" cable network movie for me or more outside the cinema. <br /> <br /> So where does my ambivalence come from? With the performance of Jamie Foxx. Overall, he did - ok. It's not the spectacular opera by Denzel Washington, Malcolm X or Angela Bassett by Tina Turner, but ... ok. <br /> <br /> Sorry folks, but for me, there were several points in the movie where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles, and in others - thanks to the wonderful shooting and lighting angles - he "looked like" to Ray Charles. But I paid attention to ... acting. An actor must make you believe that he is the character he is playing. Don't make a caricature of the character. Did I think Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes sometimes no. <br /> <br /> Did Jamie Foxx deserve a Golden Globe? Bet you deserve an Oscar ...? It depends on who is against it. It has some important competitors there, and could simply eliminate them. But then again, maybe not. If Jamie Foxx does not win, I will not get up and say "he was robbed". Above all, I don't think it was. <br /> <br /> It was a decent film with decent performance and a decent story. A "great" autobiographical film of the late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there, I feel like there's a great movie about Ray Charles just waiting to be done, and an actor that will blow you completely out of it.
