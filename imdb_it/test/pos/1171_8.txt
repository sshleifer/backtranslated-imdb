"Out to Sea" is a funny film featuring the wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This film is not as funny as their "Grumpy Old Men" comedies (which is strongly resembling), but there are many laughs everywhere. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws cruising together. Once on the boat, the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau signed them as dancing guests so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who doesn't feel like dancing. What's worse, Matthau doesn't even know how to dance. However, they get along well with it and the process some of their traveling companions and crew members encounter. Here are the crew members: there is the cruise director Gil Godwyn, played at most by the veteran "Star Trek: The Next Generation" Brent Spiner, who acts like an evil dictator. There are two dance mates, played by "Barney Miller" star Hal Linden and veteran movie star Donald O'Connor. There is the owner of the ship, Mrs Carruthers, played by "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers: there is Vivian, a widow played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There's Liz, played by one of my favorite actresses of all time, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis, Liz's mother, played by veteran stage actress Elaine Stritch. And they also meet others. All these actors are a pleasure to watch while Lemmon and Matthau play outside of them. It's great to see Cannon here, seeing is beautiful as always; Stritch is a cry; Spiner is a funny evil comedian who plays him deadly; De Haven is wonderful; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good time or two; and finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are doing well as usual. A beautiful gem of a comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
