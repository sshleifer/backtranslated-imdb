If you have a box of tissues, a comfortable sofa, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a Friday night, this is definitely your movie! It is romantic, warm and stimulating. For most of us gays, religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and we probably just starred in the role of alterity and how cute it was! But in the last few days, you see the difficulties of being gay when your whole world revolves around beliefs that totally contradict being gay. The two main cast members were totally warm, but at the same time they managed to capture your heart and even make me 'almost' cry (I never cried in a movie!), Which I thought was pretty awesome for a class movie B. I highly recommend this film, you will laugh, you will cry (unless you are me) and you will certainly come out! I like it so much that I even bought the DVD for my collection. It's really the best movie ever
