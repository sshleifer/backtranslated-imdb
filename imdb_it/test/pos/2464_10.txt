This film is sporadically on the wire, and I never really looked at it, thinking it would be similar to the Bruce Willis movie "America", with the usual banality on American freedom, etc. But it wasn't; it was so much more! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I've never seen him in a movie I didn't love, even if the script is bad, because he's so talented). Kathy Bates is the overbearing mother and does a great job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always been in the best films, but has also directed this film. Please do not stereotype it from the "Breakfast Club" movie; he's much better at it, and I want him to make other non-commercial, non-commercial Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The film is realistic, as we see Emilio at home from Vietnam, during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is passable like her sister, who feels "dishonored and embarrassed" by the returning soldier, her brother; it is quite alienated from the family, and, especially at this time in US history, this story is VERY relevant. <br /> <br /> I learned a lot about post-traumatic stress and you genuinely identify with this character; This is not a violent and journalistic portrait, such as "Ploton", it is more a study of character, which leaves us even more intrigued and worried about the effects of war, especially when we consider the young age of soldiers who are victims. With today's violence, it is rare that a film really makes one feel sad, and shed a tear; this does and deserves recognition.
