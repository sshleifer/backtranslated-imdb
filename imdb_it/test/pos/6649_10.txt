How is it possible to love and not love the same film? <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to that of Jody Foster, Sommersby, only it's not so pretty. Nicole was fantastic ... Jude was adequate. They didn't give him many lines ... is there a reason for this? In general, he is a pretty good actor. She is so elegant, her character is so bumpkin country. We wonder what they see each other. <br /> <br /> The romance between two of these was successful only in Lady Chatterly's Lover. <br /> <br /> I think antipathy comes because the film is too long. They could have told the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good locations, good shots. The actors of the character were fantastic.
