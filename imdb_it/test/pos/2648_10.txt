This move is absolutely, surely one of the greatest films of its kind, or any other genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be included in a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I've ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors able to attract and keep you fascinated from beginning to end, even in the absence of a prolonged dialogue or plot development. Only with images, 2001 is able to present an image of the future that is both sublime and terrifying. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money, it doesn't get much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey .... now, the sequel, 2010 ... this is a different story.
