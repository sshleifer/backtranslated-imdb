Dolemite is one of the best films with a pimp like a hero, who breaks down the man, meanwhile connecting with all the most beautiful women that the ghetto must provide. Let us understand that these women know karate, and they are beautiful fox ladies. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - the final scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite pulling Willy Green's heart out. Make sure your copy is unrated. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a cast full of innovative and brilliant characters such as the Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee and others. The clothing is fantastic and the sets are full of 70s style. There are some problems in production, such as the microphone boom that appears accidentally, among other things, but this adds charm and laughter. <br /> <br /> I recommend drinking a 6 pack before and during this movie, and keeping the squares and the man very far.
