Lackawanna Blues is a touching story of Nanny, a woman who gives herself completely to help those in need. It is told from the point of view of a boy, welcomed by the babysitter when his mother is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> I have respect for this film for three main reasons: 1) It is moving, but not mushy. It is told in a very real way, without much aggravating Hollywood narrative baggage. And the finish is pretty good (tearful but not overdone). <br /> <br /> 2) Although it is clearly an African-American film, it is set in the black post-segregation community of Lackawanna, New York, not wearing its ethnicity on the sleeve. The story is based on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) that surround their lives. It is not a sermon, it is simply good. <br /> <br /> 3) It has a fantastic soundtrack (can't beat old-school R & B and Chicago blues). <br /> <br /> Usually the acting is strong but not universally. Some of the performances simply don't hold up the characters that the actors should portray. But considering that it was a TV movie, that's to be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Imperfect but nice movie, good for a rainy day.
