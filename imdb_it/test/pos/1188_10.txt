I saw this movie for the first time in the theater. I was 10 years old. I just looked at it a second time and I have to say it was fantastic. Music, dance, acting. It's a great story and very well told. I fell in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mother kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and finally said "how much you need"? (money). It was classic; ). <br /> <br /> Mothers are the best. If you haven't seen this movie since it came out, I say we see it again. It is timeless. It will do what all the great films do; make you laugh, cry and think.
