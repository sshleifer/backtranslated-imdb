Compared to the competition, the soul calibur 3 is a god among games, a true piece of art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the most recent slash series on namcos is far too ambitious - its attempts to improve perfection are not successful enough. <br /> <br /> There are new game modes and tweaks that I recommend trying to elevate the series to new levels, but they complicate things. Examples? Well, the character creation mode is a great idea in theory, but it is actually full of restrictions and not as customizable as the one found in wwe games, for example. The chronicle of the sword mode is fun and challenging, but it eventually drags on and feels like an effort to earn money rather than a really fun game. Moreover, the history of the anime mode which is basically the arcade mode with small fragments of irrelevant story and shit-launched QTR-style bits looks really slow. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! YoU DON'T KNOW YOU SaYiNg" is probably what you think most zealous of you, but don't make it twisted - you don't hate this game - this game is awesome! It still has that classic game (even if some character moves have been changed unnecessarily), absolutely stunning graphics and that epic soundtrack for which the games are known. And also the good side of things are the new characters (in particular the zasalamel), which are all fashionable in their own way (except setsuka-yes, I know I'm doing the egg). <br /> <br /> It is just this in soul calibur 1 and 2 it seems as if it was trying to be much more than it actually is. This does not mean that it is not a classic, it only means that compared to its high standards it falls a little short, despite the fact that more characters move the phases and a better graphics than ever. <br /> <br /> Still, soul calibur 3 cleans the floor with 95% of the games out there - and that counts for something! Oh, and all those who mark this review as "useless" clearly feel hurt that I insulted their dear setuka. Listen to fanboy / girl well: SHE Is not REAL! And even if it were, she wouldn't have been surprised with you.
