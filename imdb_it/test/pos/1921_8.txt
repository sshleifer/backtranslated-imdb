Even if you don't usually like documentaries, chances are you'll find this fascinating. Not only does it have a well-defined plot that, although easy to follow, contains its interesting deviations; it also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that is based on a simple specific tone. Instead the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas in evidence. <br /> <br /> That said, if you know nothing about Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 single handers boat race around the world ... as was the case for me ... please, stop reading and rent / watch this movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt sent me a cutout linking this film with Antonioni's work. In 2007, I am been hypnotized by several Antonioni films, still are! To link this film to Antonioni, I think it is a bit long, the character most likely to be seen in one of Michelangelo's films is Francoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on IMDb's main page, it's not even listed as "Himself" which is probably a function of its long name, contrary to its realization / renunciation. Since Moitessier sets sail from the race, what could be considered is a little like Anna in The Adventure. A very important character. <br /> <br /> While there are many things to love about this film: the real movie of the time, the best stoic friend, the pure power of the roaring forties, I left with a simple connection. A man, really at sea. There have been moments in my life when I wonder how I got to this point, caught between dreams and reality, feeling like a stowaway in my own skin. It could be that I'm reading too much in this documentary, and that the directors themselves read too much in Crowhurst, but I found that sense as a spell like the other secrets kept in this film. <br /> <br /> On the strange possibility that Crowhurst's wife (who seemed a remarkable moderation study with understandably conflicting understandings) and her children (so young in the movie found, and still young at this date in their sense of pain and pride for their father), I am sure the comments here and the film itself fails to capture the man who was your father. In his death, however, he gave the world a taste of something like a lost myth, it is a pre-GPS Odysseus. Never finding his body adds to the air of fragile immortality, if not the stature of a cosmic being he had written about. <br /> <br /> This film accompanies you after watching, as if you were expecting another breakthrough to emerge from the deep waters. Or at least, you hope for the sequel to Moitessier. <br /> <br /> Thurston Hunger 8/10
