Running Out of Time is probably the closest to a perfect movie, as you can probably see from Hong Kong. All the elements click: a terrifying script (of the French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the strange clich√©, the reliably imaginative direction of Johnnie To, and the excellent central interpretations of Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, this one last showing his great comic timing for a wonderful effect, never exceeding the line in parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to the abyssal negotiating skills of his superior). Even the supporting cast is fine, with Yo Yo Mung having a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the very histrionic Waise Lee (who looks remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald Andy Lau) who puts her in stand out successfully. Is it better not to know too much about the plot going beyond the basic set-up ?? with only a few weeks to live, does Lau engage in a criminal game with the Wan policeman without an easily understandable reason? and sit down and enjoy the journey: it's definitely worth it. He also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent films, and he played in just three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of cinema I've seen in ages). There is also a good Raymond Wong score. The most fun cat and mouse game in the cinema over the years.
