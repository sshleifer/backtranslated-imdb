It is generally accepted that Marcel Carné's films of 1936-1946 are masterpieces and it is considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrity. This is an unfair opinion: at least two of these last times are eminently watchable: "Thérèse Raquin", her best post-war work, and "les tricheurs" (the tricks). <br /> <br /> There is a strange evolution from the golden hour of Prevert to "les tricheurs": in "les enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève", the real love is hindered by the bad. In "les tricheurs" true love no longer exists: we deal with a group of young people who do not believe in anything, falling in love would be incongruous for this young man. The adults are not at all the bad guys: Mic's brother and mother are kind people, but she is above their command. Many few adults appear anyway. <br /> <br /> During two hours, the characters never stop playing, dancing, listening to jazz records (a music that was not yet part of bourgeois culture), and drinking heavily. When two of them find out that they take care of each other, it will be too late. <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty good, Laurent Terzieff as a cynical existentialist and Andréa On the other hand, Parisy is a rich boy. On the other hand, Pascale Petit and above all Jacques Charrier (who married Brigitte Bardot in the same year as the "tricheurs") do not possess the ambiguity required by their parties. They are all smiling, too sweet and beautiful to be credible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, "les tricheurs" has been labeled "nouvelle vague"! You know that the priests of this film school (similar to Godard) thought of Carné, it's really a nice joke. But this disenchantment that you feel throughout the film is truly disturbing.
