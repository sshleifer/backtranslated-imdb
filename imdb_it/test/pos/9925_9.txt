I consider myself a huge fan of Dario Argento. For every very good brush stroke by him (such as "Deep Red" and "Darkness"), there seems to be one equally uninspired (his "Opera" production tends to disappoint). However, there is no denying that when it is at its best, there are some horror directors who can dominate it. I consider "Opera" the best job of Argento. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the film in which all its brands are present. There are no well-developed characters and the plot makes very little sense when you start looking at it. However, think of Argento as a European equivalent of Brian DePalma: style is all that matters here, so much becomes the substance. Typical of Argento, there are some wonderfully filmed murder sequences. Those who are not familiar with the work of man can perceive it as a sadistic observation (and can be, considering the misogyny often of their time), but it is really true. Argento stages a murder with a complexity in an amazing visual detail. It really is an art form of graphic violence. Furthermore, his direction and appearance of his films are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, "Opera" is one of its scariest products. Argento is the only director I feel that booming rock music works well for horror sequences (when others try to make it, it looks like a cheese). The acting varied, with Cristina Marsillach playing a young and industrious opera composer, handsome and reasonably nice, but never particularly animated. The rest of the actors work like a worker and get the job, but again, with Argento, acting is never the point. They are the beautiful colors, the terrifying violence and the dream / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)
