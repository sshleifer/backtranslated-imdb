Fortunately for Bill Murray this is such a light project, since he practically has to wear it. Meatballs is the story of Northstar Camp for rent at a low cost and how its consultants take care of the campers themselves. Then there is much of their rich rivals from all over the lake called Camp Mohawk which culminates in a two-day Olympics competition. Above all there is Bill Murray who plays the clown and makes a memorable film debut. <br /> <br /> The film is littered with medium-sized laughter, laughter and more than a few sneers along the way. The biggest laughs come from the jokes played in the director of the nerd camp. Three of them involve counselors who move his bed out to various positions while sleeping. Morty, or "Micky" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the edge of a road, climbs some trees several meters above the ground and finally floats on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments that involve the counselors who touch each other, but this is a PG-branded movie with some nastiness. <br /> <br /> The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Obviously it's up to Murray to teach the child how to open up and give him the security he needs to run a marathon during the Olympics. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems strongly aggravated. Notice how when Murray first sees the child sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he says "you have to be the depressed kid we ordered". You wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just making libations while the cameras were running. In other words, even Murray could have told Makepeace, "you have to be that actor we hired to play the stereotype of a lonely kid you see in many summer camp movies that don't fit." But before it is all over, Murray's performance makes this wearable device more than bearable. He really seems to have a good feeling with Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events shown to us are also slightly credible, but "it doesn't matter". This is a nice movie on many levels. Don't let the absurd 5.6 rating of this movie scare you. Murray will make you laugh for everything. Just be warned ..... avoid the sequels !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman !! 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hound.
