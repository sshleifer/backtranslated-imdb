In 1965 the producer Kevin McLory - who holds a part of the film rights of James Bond - partner of EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for having made "Thunderball", the fourth film of the series 007. The star is Sean Connery, of course . <br /> <br /> In 1982 McLory won a legal battle and could produce an "independent" Bond film. "Never say never again" (NSNA) is one of two "unofficial" 007 films made outside of EON (the other is the 1967 parody "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and plays the original Bond, Sean Connery, who returns to the role after many years of absence. <br /> <br /> The film comes out a few months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore, the 13th episode of the EON series. At the moment the press calls it "War of the Bonds" ... Both films are very successful in 1983, although "Octopussy" earns more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a luxurious film produced by excellent technicians - director Irvin Kershner who directed "The Empire Strikes", Douglas Slocombe, director of "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr, who wrote "The Three Days of the Condor" - among others ... <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent with Connery, a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> <br /> Although all that the film remains inferior to the original "Thunderball". Many fundamental ingredients are missing to be a real James Bond film: there is no traditional cannon sequence, there is no "James Bond theme", M and Q are not interpreted by traditional actors ... It is a reason Copyright: EON is only allowed to use these elements. In short, NSNA lacks the classic cinematic atmosphere of 007. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is exciting and fun. Brandauer is an excellent villain and women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and sumptuous. But the strong point is Sean Connery! He is once again wonderful in the role, he is older but looks more fit and beautiful here than in "Diamonds are forever", his last performance in the role of the British super spy before NSNA.
