A wonderful story that should be seen by all families. History, acting and production values ​​are all top quality. I highly recommend "Discover!" <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful as an old actor who wants to decide when he will die, so he can continue to know how things will go and not be "a member of the public." His three children rush to New York to confront him and try to change his mind. There are, of course, unresolved family problems to deal with, and the script and the actors handle them well and with great humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a Jewish family, but it could easily cover any other family. Well, maybe it's not a WASP family. The brothers have problems with each other and also with their father. I loved writing and directing, as well as acting. All in all, a humorous and moving film.
