"Lifeforce" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel "The Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson, written by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. A joint US-British space exploration team makes a mind-boggling discovery: an alien spacecraft resting in the Halleys Comet, containing three entities that resemble people, one of them a female beauty (oh-so-alluring Mathilda May) . <br /> <br /> They report these findings aboard their spaceship. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It turns out that these creatures draw their lives from humans, and from American Colonel Carlsen (an intense, sharp and committed Steve Railsback) and from the British S.A.S. Colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth) watches in horror, a vampire infestation overtakes London, with the fate of the Earth poised. <br /> <br /> This image is certainly not without imagination. It moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and imaginative ideas and amazing images that it's hard not to be amused. The first of the three-picture contract by director Tobe Hoopers with Cannon Films (which he followed with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and the remake "Invaders from Mars") makes it something truly unique. Incorporating science fiction elements, vampire movies, zombie movies, and end of the world sagas, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth are ably supported by such strong British actors as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as the seductive, enigmatic villousness; certainly it doesn't hurt that you interpret a lot of his scenes in the nude. Noteworthy is also the soundtrack of another composer of "Pink Panther" Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous, but I also found it funny. It is flamboyant and lively entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
