Wow! Fantastic movie in my opinion, I didn't expect it to be so beautiful! I was fascinated from beginning to end - it is a very well made and instructive film that gives us a fascinating insight into the evidence that Darwin had to face to convey his ideas to the world, telling his life as he writes "Origin of species" ; to fight both personal demons and society ignorant of time to do it. He struggles hard with his mind, his body and his soul as personal issues come to the breaking point and even his family seems to slip away ... while the rest of the world opposes him because he knows his discoveries literally they shake the very foundations of their lives, culture and meaning of existence. It is a thin film (not excessively exaggerated in any way in that typical Hollywood way, this is a British film produced by the BBC) but fortunately very powerful in meaning and this thanks to the beautiful well-directed scenes and the splendid acting of Bettany. Connelly acts more like a light supporting role, but I liked her a lot and she is as good as expected as always, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and engaging, you could feel the connection, and their real husband / his wife's bond definitely shines through their performances. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany and does a brilliant job, a very touching performance - I understood and sympathized with both as she struggled with her degrading health and impending "madness" to try to figure out what she discovered and came to reckon with with what really is everything and means that he found his thinking contradicting his feelings, and found himself losing it all, including his wife, who was naturally a firm believer in religion and a severe Christian while he was in the realm of science, two worlds that they couldn't see in their eyes, so their relationship was also at stake. <br /> <br /> However, a very good emotional drama, well acted and I would dare to say that I shed a tear during the tragic climax that was really heartbreaking and wonderfully touching and moving. The film is also symbolic and very intellectually artistic, in fact I can't wait to see it again because there was a lot to do the first time I missed it. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.
