This must be my favorite movie. The script is sharp and played to the limit by an excellent Miller and a fantastic Carlisle! Sharp spirit, excellent fiction and no Hollywood polish; a totally submersible movie that makes you shoot for the bad guys! Stott excels again as Detestable Chance, while Liv Tyler really beats her other, lighter shows of Rebecca, hungry for excitement! The soundtrack may not be known by name, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear, seen football or seen a TV sequence, probably knows it, especially thanks to Craig Armstrong's "Escape" which must allow him not to work again ! The soundtrack of the first game may seem out of place in a drama / action / comedy in costume, but a re-watching shows that he is perfectly at ease in giving the script his drama. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this film is that it is not shown enough on TV! Where is it? Really excellent, clear and classy - you won't regret watching it - again and again! (comes out to turn on the DVD player!)
