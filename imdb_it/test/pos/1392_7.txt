Lieutenant Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship throw themselves ashore on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After some random deaths on inmates, Rackham takes Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Fortunately for everyone, Barbara Bach is also on the island! Unfortunately, there are some crazy fish that love to kill people. <br /> <br /> This exploit produced in Italy seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a pinch of voodoo WHITE ZOMBIE and Atlantis stuff. Despite some extravagant-looking fish costumes, the film benefits from the beautiful location photography and a nice halfway turn. All the actors are good and Joseph Cotton even appears as an old biologist. The director Sergio Martino has behaved quite well as there is action in about 10 minutes. This cannot be said for his belated sequel THE FISHMEN AND THEIR QUEEN (1995), easily one of the most extravagant and offensive sequels after HIGHLANDER II.
