The Bothersome Man is an intelligent and surreal film that makes you re-evaluate what you are doing with your life and what makes you feel better. When you see these people in zombies like trances doing everyday events and realizing it's what we do and what we want in real life, it really hits home. This is a surprisingly effective film that eventually lets you ask questions about your direction and not so much about the movie. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character of which we have a third-person view while trying to adapt to a new life after being transferred. At first he seems to be the most popular guy in town as everyone at work turns to him and is invited to dinners etc. A good example of this is in the scene with his new boss offering him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying "here's a little something to start". Andreas also goes to a girl for 20 minutes in the film, with whom he eventually moves. It looks like an ideal life situation because his girlfriend is an established, attractive interior designer, and never complains about anything he does. But Andreas is not satisfied with their relationship as with anything else in the world. He then began a relationship with a colleague named Ingeborg who eventually leaves Anne and claims to be in love. After telling Ingeborg how she feels, she tells him that she is also seeing other colleagues and says that all relationships are "beautiful". Soon after we see Andreas in a train station where he tries to end his misery and the disappointment of the public does not occur. Still in search of salvation Andreas meets Hugo who has found a hole from which he can listen to music. So they embark on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or will it be worse? <br /> <br /> "The Bothersome Man" shows society's obsession with appearances and its materialistic mentality. He does a great job teasing us by filling the houses with IKEA products that the characters spend each lunch choosing. I think he's mainly making fun of the boring Scandinavian society and its high suicide rate. For example, there is a scene in the film where Andreas meets a man who jumped out of a building and onto a spiked fence. Moreover, Andreas is fed up with this world, he cuts his finger and then jumps in front of a train; this is one of the strangest / outrageous scenes I've ever seen. This world created by Lien is equivalent to purgatory in which there is no punishment or reward. In this world, after drinking a drink, Andreas never got drunk, sex was unsatisfactory, and no matter how many times he tried, he couldn't kill himself. This film reminded me of "Fight Club" and the way in which both the main characters were a bit out of sync with the world around them. In "Fight Club" Tyler Durden creates a second character who does everything he doesn't want and in this film Andreas awakens is the equivalent of Tyler Durden. After a while he wakes up and tries to escape the quiet life of which he is now part by running away through a hole in a wall. <br /> <br /> Lien does a great job with continuity in this film which means when a character has a half cup full in his hand and cut it so they come back with the glass in the same hand and it's not full or empty showing that the shot was made another day. Nowadays directors are more worried about sound effects and neglect the little things how is that character wearing the bracelet on the same hand as yesterday? Since I followed the television production for three years in high school, it is difficult for me not to look for continuity or a voice that drives me crazy. Lien does the little things well that he has great lighting in every shot, he never lets you wonder why something is in one shot and leads to an interesting topic. This film really worked for me because it not only makes fun of Scandinavians but Western society and what's wrong. The only real problem I had was with the man who committed suicide by jumping on a spiked fence. Because in the end you discover that this world has no death, but it remained motionless to force you to think that it was dead and this has never been answered in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only main character in which others come and go and never do more than support him. His first girlfriend Anne Britt is an interior designer who apparently looks perfect for him, but eventually turns out to be boring. This leads him to Ingeborg, with whom he begins a relationship and falls in love with. He soon discovers that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. In the end, Andreas meets Hugo in a bar bathroom complaining about how nothing is better and how he can't even get drunk anymore. Follow Hugo at home to find the hole in the wall with what is full of laughter for children and chirping of birds. <br /> <br /> Lien doesn't have much on the resume but "The Bothersome Man" is more than a start to a great career but a preview of an emerging director. If this is an indication of his talent and potential as a storyteller, Lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films won't take us so long to do it abroad for our pleasure to see. So sit back and enjoy the journey while Director Jens Lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the dream world that is "The Bothersome Man".
