"Down Periscope" has been in our library since he first arrived on VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital film from Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> It is an eccentric film that cannot be exploited militarily as a professional or a scammer. It is first of all a comedy and a vehicle for the main characters, I am rather surprised that a sequel was never offered. <br /> <br /> The film has gained a following that borders on the cult's obsession, even among the very young. I learned about it while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, my nephew, had taken all the roles in the film and planned to relive it during their overnight stay on board. /> <br /> It's a fun game that makes you proud of both our Navy and Hollywood ... which is a rare company. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for doing this could have been an otherwise insignificant film, such entertainment!
