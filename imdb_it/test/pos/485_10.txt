Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film. Writing, acting, directing could not have been better. This was a story that asked to be told, and this group of talented people and teams did a great job doing it. Stories like this are not pleasant, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist throughout the world. My hope is that when this film is seen, attitudes and prejudices will change. A film that can do it is a rare and special thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer, and his talent and experience in this field have shone in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for telling this story !!! <br /> <br /> Ruby
