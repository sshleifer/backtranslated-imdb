I don't watch many horror movies, but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins. Now, we're teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the acting here wasn't very good, especially in the beginning. A line that stood out was when Scarlett tells Jill and Tiffany: "This is so ... high school!" while the next scene shows Jill passing a sign with their name of the High School ... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of an episode of Lizzie McGuire poorly interpreted, poorly written and misinterpreted. However, as the story progressed, and the cast moved almost exclusively to Jill most of the time, I could appreciate the film more. Camilla Belle did very well in this film, and I think the other actors and actresses have ruined the film for her. And I have to admit that this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Well, no, there were no big monsters and white faces that appeared in dark corners and they had dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than those that contain those things is that it could really happen. And this movie really reminded me of what's really scary ... We all know it's not likely to stumble on the living dead at any point in our lives, but the idea of ​​having a murderer inside the house where you do the babysitter could really happen The only flaw in this movie is that it's one of the most cliché movies I've ever seen. It has everything a horror film has ever had: turn the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turn the corners of the stairs with suspense, turn around and see a corpse, quickly finish a fatal scene with awakening from a dream, etc. In the suspense scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, I would have given a 7/10. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my first review, so I don't know if some of these things were spoilers ... But for safety ...
