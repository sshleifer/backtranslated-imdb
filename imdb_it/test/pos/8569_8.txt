H.O.T.S. it's a fun film for a journey back in time where skin gestures have had a more positive and fun-filled program. They were simply made to titillate and laugh. Everything seems less cynical and tired. The girls all have natural figures and some are Playboy playmates. The simple plot concerns a group of young women who open a sister house not sanctioned to return to the haughty and sisterly girls who rejected and insulted them. Instead of today's petty tricks, most hijinks are simply innocent fun. Women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive. To keep our attention among the topless scenes, we have mafia henchmen, a stolen bear, a balloon, a mother of a funky house and the cheapest robot ever seen. There is also Danny Bonnaducci of the Partridge family. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.
