Incredible, stunning, brilliant, superb. These are the four adjectives that come to mind when I begin to describe "The Kite Runner". The adaptation of the book by Khaled Hosseini had already captured many minds, in fact it is said that he himself is crying after seeing the premier. I must say, before I even started, that I had read the book before seeing the advanced projection of "The Kite Runner". So my judgment and my opinions may be slightly biased. <br /> <br /> Firstly, let me say that, although I think the book was better than the final product of the film, it is not bad at all. I mean the deserved answer for a two-hour movie. Things look a little fast in the last twenty odd minutes, but apart from that, what the book did has happened. It has captured the mind and imagination of millions around the world. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini, to give us a sense of remorse of joy, of sadness, of pain, of loyalty is astute in this adaptation. Especially in the first scene, when the young Hassan says: "If you tell me to eat the earth, I'll do it, but I know you don't ask me". Such a touching line is destined to capture the hearts of many. The two young actors were brilliant, absolutely superb. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan, a boy, who refuses to give up a kite he captured because he promised his best friend that he would take it, only to be abused by big bullies who beat him and used sexually, and then be scolded by his best friend as a coward. The whole act is so touching that it can only wet the eyes. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is well positioned, except for the last bit. The point where Amir learns of his true relationship with Hassan and reads the first and last not of Hassan, when he bursts into tears feeling helpless, lonely and full of remorse, that he looked a little hasty and felt that Amir was behind a facade. In the book, Khaled Hosseini had dedicated some 10-12 pages to describe the mood of Amir in that position. But what he made up for in the penultimate part of the film, when Amir defends Hassan's boyfriend, his nephew, Sohrab, in front of his dominant father-in-law. The finale was well deserved and I'm sure it will be appreciated. He felt witness that the torch passed from one generation to another. <br /> <br /> Coming to the technical aspects. First of all, acting. Just one word: superb. From beginning to end, the young Hassan and Amir, their father, his friend Rahim Khan. All were superb, especially the young Hassans. Secondly, the direction was surprising, combined with a brilliant photographic work. Even the background score was impressive. From the beginning, he traces credit to the final credit, and I particularly liked the one in which Amir is in the mosque in Pakistan, the Western and Islamic fusion made him special. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is certainly one of the best films, and it is a welcome break from all those Iran-inspired films that we've floated throughout this year. 9/10 !!!
