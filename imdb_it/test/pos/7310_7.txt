The wife Devota Norma Shearer (like Katherine "Kitty" Brown) awaits her husband Rod La Rocque (like Bob Brown) hands and feet. While preparing breakfast in bed and helping him get dressed for a Sunday golf game, Mrs. Shearer suggests joining Mr. La Rocque for the day, noting how rarely they see each other. But La Rocque interrupts her saying that her presence negatively affects her game. Then, unexpectedly, does Shearer encounter the real reason for her husband's frequent absences? her beautiful blonde mistress! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a charming and flirtatious divorcee. During the summer in Paris, he became friends with the rich and elderly socialite Marie Dressler (like Mrs. "Boucci" Bouccicault). Miss Dressler invites Shearer to her home on Long Island to socialize with some friends and ask for a favor. Dressler is concerned about his niece's relationship with a sweet and worldly man. He wants young Sally Eilers (like Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (like Bruce) instead. Aware of Shearer's flirtatious achievements, Dressler asks her to lure the undesirable man away from Mrs. Eilers. Shearer is stunned to discover that the man is La Rocque, his ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Shearer and Dressler make this game cute and fun. They are in excellent shape, offering guaranteed performance, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is stupid and predictable; again, in a way that helps the humorous situation. And the ending is pretty smart. In fact, the "Let Us be Gay" comic could have aged better than Shearer's "The Divorc√©e", bigger and more serious, which was released at the same time. Cast uniformly well. La Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but his role is not at all appealing. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are nice supporters. <br /> <br /> Those unfamiliar with Norma Shearer may not realize that it is she who looks like the sloppy wife in the opening scenes. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before his make-over. Watch the close-ups of Shearer with a light and natural make-up, to take a look at a woman of intriguing beauty. <br /> <br /> ******* Let Us Be Gay (1930) Robert Z.
