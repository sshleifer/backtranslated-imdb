Peter Falk shines like a ninety-year-old Morris Applebaum, the patriarch who has decided it is time to "check out" after holding a final, a blow. His three sons, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold are advised / invited by letter and arrive immediately at his home to take care of their eccentric father. There is a great chemistry father / daughter with Laura San Giacomo, whose character seems to undergo the greatest growth from the ordeal. It is a well rounded example of the average, dysfunctional family and their memories, pains, growth and ignorance / tolerance of the lives of others. The soundtrack is the one you'll like and the first ones are well synchronized and fun. Even if I found a disappointment in the current "Checking Out" party, the rest of the film will make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. Move to "Big Fat Greek Wedding" .... the "Big Fat Jewish Suicide" has arrived.
