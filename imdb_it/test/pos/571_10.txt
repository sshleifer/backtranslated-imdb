I don't need to say much about how good this documentary is - it's really an extraordinary piece of true fiction. The story is quite simple: an elderly white tourist is killed by a young black man in Florida, and the boy who is arrested is abused and tried only with the public defender and his family on his side. It's very compelling, and the public defender is a joy to behold in all his human ways - you can't help but pull the triumph of justice, and the ending satisfies more than might be expected from a true story. > <br /> It is a pity that many people have not seen this documentary, but I hope you will find a way to see it. For those interested in race relations in the United States and the effective functioning of law enforcement and the legal process, it is worth spending time and effort to find this documentary. I give him a 10.
