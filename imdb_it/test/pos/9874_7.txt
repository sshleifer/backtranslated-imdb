For some reason, I always like movies that people hate when I really don't think they're that bad - and this is one of those movies. In the case of this film, I think it's too overly criticized, I'm not that bad in a movie at all. Actually, I think this is one of the best sequels. "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally kills Jamie Lloyd (who was captured in captivity by the "Man In Black" in part 5) after giving birth to his baby. We are then presented to the Strode family, who now lives by coincidence in Myers' old house (which seems to change in each film). Kara and his son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now adult boy who survived the original killings. They have to fight together to save Jamie's child from an evil cult that cares for Michael, while Michael himself is driven to kill by an old Celtic ritual where he has to sacrifice an entire family to Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> definitely one of the best sequels in the series, in my opinion anyway, and I can't understand all the hatred he got. He had a beautiful suspense, an interesting (but sometimes confusing, I admit) plot, some scary moments here and there, and a lot of blood and knife cuts to appease all of you cheetahs. Not all the acting wasn't particularly good, but it was pretty convincing to me. Marianne Hagan is the protagonist and she is very nice. Paul Rudd plays an adult Tommy Doyle and is also very talented and plays his part well. The rest of the supporting cast (in addition to the brilliant Donald Pleasance) is not much to praise, but it wasn't too bad either. I'm still not sure if giving an explanation of why Michael kills was completely necessary, but in the end he turned out to be ok and I wasn't upset by the way they tied everything together. The indefinite conclusion was also a bit disturbing, but it could have been something more. <br /> <br /> I also saw the infamous "Producer's Cut" of this film, its original cut, and I think it's better in some respects. He also explains the Thorn curse that drives Michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film, plus the ending was much better in my opinion. It seemed more natural than the conclusion given to us in the studio cut of the film. I would like Dimension to release this alternative version of the film, because I personally think it's better. However, the odds are very small. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequel and will satisfy all fans of the series. This film is not the best of all horror movies, but it is certainly worth hiring if you want to see Michael do his thing. Don't expect brilliance and you'll like it. 7/10.
