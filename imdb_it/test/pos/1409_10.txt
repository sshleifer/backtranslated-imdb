It is a pity that this series has not been remastered and produced on video by Warner or by some other professional cinema. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, 92 episodes were produced during its execution, but only 15 are recorded here. <br /> <br /> Some of the writers of the series, like Richard Matheson, continued to become famous authors. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well written, well represented and well produced. <br /> <br /> Michael Weldon, <br /> <br /> Udon Thani, Thailand
