Master Kieslowsky came up with an idea in 1993, the idea was to portray the human relationship in today's world, passing from Blue (a visual masterpiece of a woman's life) to White (A visual comedy about marriage) and finally arriving a Red (A masterpiece that deals with human interaction). <br /> <br /> Although I'm not going to ruin the move, I can easily say that Red is the best movie of the 90s because it has one of the strongest messages in a script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film starts a little slow, but gets the beat early enough to let you stick to the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The performances are perfect, sublime. since the characters are completely realistic and are in no way clich√© and you can't expect the actors and don't be disappointed ... seriously I think Jean Louis Tringtignat deserved at least one Oscar. <br /> <br /> The music of Zbiegnew Preisner is incredible, it's one of the best musical scores ever. Piotr Sobocinsk's Cinematography is also exceptional and won an Oscar (and deserved to win). <br /> <br /> Overall the film is a perfect 10 and will be loved by those who love foreign cinema and people who don't. Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> How did the horrible Pulp Fiction to beat this masterpiece at Cannes is beyond my comprehension
