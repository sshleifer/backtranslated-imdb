This is the fourth feature by Marc Recha. At the third "les mans" - empty hands - I promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. But this time the plot is completely different - a sort of homage to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001), a Catalan journalist -. The images in the trailer are stunning - a sparkling river bathed in sunlight - and the promise that Marc himself would face the camera with his twin brother - neither of the two professional actors - finally convinced me, six weeks after his release . Abandon yourself to this unusual film on the road / river. He learns almost nothing about Ramon Barnils but his most touching legacy: his constant struggle against the amnesia of what we Catalans chose to forget. "La batalla de l'Ebre" - look for the Ebro battle at wikipedia - has been lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of unconvinced democracy no one has done much to remember the legitimate side of the The Spanish civil war and those who fought it. This film is about lonely people wandering in the same places with very little awareness of what happened there 70 years ago. This film is about the landscape.
