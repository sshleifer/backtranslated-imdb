I can't describe the feeling when I had this nasty VHS rental box in my hands about 20 years ago. Somehow I took my father to rent it for me and I watched it twice with my little brother. Yes, we had nightmares. This film was originally classified as a PG in the United States, in many other countries, including Finland, it was forbidden to children under 18 or 16. The film was intended for teenagers, but this must be the best movie ever. There is no bad language or nudity in what ever. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves for a couple of years before release. <br /> <br /> This is a class A B movie, a true horror film, well done in the 80s. A group of college girls decide to spend a night in a mausoleum, not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits ... <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie. It's campy, absolutely stupid, but they can't make these films anymore. There is certainly a certain feeling in the 80s horror genre. This is still effectively spooky and fun after all these years. <br /> <br /> The effects are just exuding qualities of Ellis Burman Jr. and Thomas R. Burman. Makeup effects play an important role in this film, otherwise it would have been just a boring slasher for boys. <br /> <br /> It is finally available on DVD and is a special edition DVD that also includes some extras. The comment track is interesting. <br /> <br /> (In fact, this version is not that special.) Transfer below average on DVD, some flaws and scratches here and there. At first it was released by the Blue Underground but unfortunately it was canceled, so Shriek Show released it without restoring the press. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Great data-film! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I only gave 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
