Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about the complex life of singer Karen Carpenter. Even if it fails to provide accurate facts and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a good election. She's a good actress, but she plays a very naive and kind of stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. <br /> <br /> The role of Louise Fletcher as Agnes Carpenter is fantastic, she does a great job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> It has excellent songs, which could be included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they were not, even though this film was at the top of the charts in the United States and other countries
