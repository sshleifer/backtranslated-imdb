This film is about so many things. More obvious is the grip that the film can have on an audience and how capturing life on the film can be a kind of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West, as many Chinese have seen (probably rightly) the "barbarians" while trying to take over and pollute their way of life. Liu also tries to preserve their lifestyle on the film because he sees that one day he will disappear. Theirs is also Liu's internal conflict between the loyalty and traditions of China against the Western philosophy of self-determination. All these themes are quite cleverly woven into a coherent and pleasant whole of Hu. A very funny film.
