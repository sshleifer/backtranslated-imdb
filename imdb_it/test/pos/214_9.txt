I remember seeing the police team! when he first came to ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many gags, not sequencers and scripts full of word games. In one episode, there was a line in which a man named Once was hit twice. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, the ABC has canceled the show after only six episodes. I thought it deserved a much longer run, but a network executive thought the show required too much attention from the viewer due to all the gags of sight in each episode. One I remember was in the opening where the title of the episode was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Frank Drebin by Leslie Nielsen was impassive, but very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible was not as bad as Norberg, but the character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos by Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then manager Dodger Tommy LaSorda. <br /> <br /> Even if Police Squad! had a brief life on ABC, the Zucker brothers did not give up the concept that proved even more successful in the Naked Gun film series. I will close with a normal closing gag. Block the ending right here.
