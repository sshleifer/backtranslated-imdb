Harrowing series on life in Oz - an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate prisoners. There's gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, killing, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all in the face and in full force. <br /> <br /> It is also easily one of the best written dramas ever put on TV and almost all the actors are simply fantastic. Since this was on cable there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There are many racist comments that fly here but it is for all races. In reality the white characters come away very badly (especially the Arians) and the black characters come off better (peace loving Muslims). Hispanics do not play a strong role and there are no Asian prisoners at all. All the prisoners seem to be stabbed in the back and willing to kill someone at a specific time --- but you are still sympathetic to some of them. Even the guards, counselors and prison doctors have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this BUT we rent it, don't buy it. I have the entire collection and, to be completely honest, I don't think I want to see it again. It is an incredible TV but so dark, dark and depressing. I suppose I have to sell everything online. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10.
