I looked at it again after not having seen it since it came out (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud. It's cleverly written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can watch Bob Newhart in this movie and not laugh, you're more of a man than me. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the "How to be a Man" cassette, and the (almost) post scenes with Joan Cusack are three of the most fun scenes in any movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but ... some movies are perfect.
