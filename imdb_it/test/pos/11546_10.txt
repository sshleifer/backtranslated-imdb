When I first saw this movie I thought it was a very strange film. But I know the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a film. So I decided to watch it again. The second time I saw him I realized that Albert Puyn is a very talented and very original director. In the beginning the viewer was told that the film took place a decade after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a typical 1950s design. They had plutonium which I think is a symbol for futuristic commerce. I think this means that the film's real time is not specified. The music in the film is creating a long music video that tells some parts of the real story in the lyrics, especially for the intro and the outro. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyn uses the red and blue back-color when he is showing the symbols for communism (red) and capitalism and the western world (blue). It can be noted that Ice-T, has the name Mao (communism) and that when it is in focus the back-color is red. The American policeman, played by Burt Reynolds, is always shot with the blue back-color. Even the club where Mao and his band perform is red. The madman is hanging between red and blue. <br /> <br /> I think the white dog Mao had at the beginning symbolizes the dominant force. Mao had the dog at first but the policeman took it at the end. This symbolizes, I believe, the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalist way of thinking from the western world of Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well made film. Albert Puyn creates a science fiction / action film with political depth. It is a different but very special film about the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to watch another spectacular film by Albert Puyn.
