When is art going to overcome racism? I believe the Americans have grown up since this film was made. Porgy is composed of a stellar cast and music. This film is an excellent adaptation of a great work. For example, Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, a work was introduced here in Los Angeles, based on the movie The Fly. AN OPERA !! So be it!! <br /> <br /> Disney hesitates to release Song of the South. The NAACP has not expressed any dispute for race problems, and let's not forget that Amos N Andy was a great success in the 50s as a TV series. Ethnicity is our heritage in the United States and we should embrace all forms of artistic ethnic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PUBLISH 'PORGY' ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> j hartz
