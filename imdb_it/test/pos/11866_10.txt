A very funny film. The "do" by Michael Douglas is worth watching this film for no other reason. I'd like to see him do more of these low life roles. He was exceptional, as were all the musicians. <br /> <br /> The film immediately struck me as an American Roshomon, just more fun and easy to watch because he was in America and didn't need stinky subtitles! <br /> <br /> In a funny movie with a laugh every minute or two, two of the best were with John Goodman (not someone I'm crazy about) - 1. He's telling the priest that Jewel does something he liked and he says "I had to wipe my smile off my face". The visual shows that he is not smiling and clearly he is a boy who never smiles, but probably does not know. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, suitable for Jewel in his policeman's uniform, and grappling with the bent leather Reiser on a table ... and the two of them protesting against being gay with another character who happens on the scene - this alone deserved a special Comedy Academy Award.
