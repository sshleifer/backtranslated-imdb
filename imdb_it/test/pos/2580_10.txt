If ever a potential film should seem as if it were not based on reading the script on paper, it would be this. Here we have what apparently looks like a filthy soft and filthy porn movie, complete with the huge poster in the room, depicting an almost naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you, if ever a movie comes to life on a great celluloid moment with intense reserve power, it's Craig Brewer's redemptive sequel to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. <br /> <br /> Unashamedly over the top right from the start, this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper with each successive frame. It is your basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move forward, in more positive ways, with their lives. First made, of course, this story, but as I have always said, is the way in which a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power. <br /> <br /> Ricci was injured - the wild-child-child character of Rae and Jackson, the equally fond musician of Lazarus finds each other in desperate circumstances, and Laz takes on the attempt to help Rae himself. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea of ​​a man trying to really help a woman who is seriously suffering, rather than trying to take advantage of it further, and we know from the beginning that Laz's heart is the heart of the film , is in the right place. The film, at its core, speaks of the redemptive and healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth - with soul, with art and with genius. <br /> <br /> An important reason the film succeeds so deeply because of the fierce and committed performances of Ricci and Jackson. The scenes that would be ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of minor artists are as powerful as all the drawings. In particular, the arc scene of the film, in which Jackson sings and plays the title song alone in his house, with Ricci, in the midst of a severe thunderstorm and the abusive demons of Rae's past that hit her in the head, leading her to crawling up to Lazarus and clinging to his leg, it's not as ridiculous as technically it should be, but rather as a heartbreaking cathartic. <br /> <br /> All support performances are also fantastic. Justin Timberlake is completely believable as Rae's boyfriend, anxious about Ronnie, and the always wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly interpreted as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is exceptional, like the reverend friend of Laz R.L. (a nod from the blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Everything works on this film, let's face it, including the music / soundtrack, which features Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House and, above all, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I'm listening to while composing this review. There is also a very beautiful and moving version of "This Little Light of Mine" included in the film, sung by an incredibly hesitant and soft heart from Ricci. <br /> <br /> Samuel Jackson said in recent interviews that he believes that his performance in this film is the best of his career so far; I could not agree more with him. This is a work that can be enormously proud of, along with all the others involved in this daring, extremely wise and deeply felt mother of a project.
