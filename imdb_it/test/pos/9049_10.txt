If a joke doesn't offend anyone, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Inki's comics are offensive, no doubt. So is rap music. Get over it. I suspect that any black person can find hilarious Inki cartoons, and that the people offended by them Whites who still think the Blacks need their paternalistic protection against racist humor. <br /> <br /> Seriously, Inki cartoons are fun. It saddens me, not because someone is really offended, but because someone could, just might, be offended, I can't buy Inki or The African Queen or Song of the South cartoons on DVD.
