One of the greatest crimes committed against science fiction television was the cancellation of Farscape. One of the most well-written, well-performed and above all the best shows ever paired with radio waves, has set new standards for science fiction television. Once the flagship, the most critically acclaimed, critically acclaimed show on the Sci-Fi Channel, defies explanation of why shows like Buffy, Tremors: The Series and even StarGate: SG-1 lasted as long as they have. Yes, even Buffy. But I'll save Buffy for another time. Farscape has been abused by the Sci-Fi channel, continually turned over in planning, rarely shown replicas and never actually advertised. But while the show has been canceled, all those involved in the production of the show want to bring back the show (even the CEO of Henson Company, Brian Henson). There is also a large fan-based movement to bring the show back. Overall, things are going far from the dark and hopefully fans will have their season 5.
