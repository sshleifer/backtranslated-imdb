Along with Cops, The Goat is one of Keaton's two most amusing short films. Which makes it one of the best shorts ever made. This has a decent "plot" for a short, and forms a perfect line on which to hang fantastic gags. Keaton is mistaken for a convict on the run (as happens the error is a classic) and therefore must evade the authorities. The best gags: the bread line and the elevator.
