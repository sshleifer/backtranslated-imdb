this is the 4th movie in the Karate Kid series. However, it has nothing to do with the previous 3. The only character left is Mr Myagi. At that moment Mr Myagi meets the problematic teen Julie pierce (Hliary Swank, before she was famous) Julie having all kinds of problems including being bullied at school by a boy, belonging to a pseudo military campus club. Of course she is trained to fight. In any case, through Myagi, Julie learns karate and becomes a spiritually better person and learns to respect herself and eventually regains her respect. I like the unique idea of ​​the antagonist of being a female and having a male as his enemy. There are also combat scenes that are done quite well, very scarce and minimal. No one fighting is graphic. The finish is also good and a little surprising. It is predictable, but not a typical ending for this type of film. The film obviously has echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned. as good as the 1st mov, that is, and certainly not as good as the 2nd is, however, a leap forward compared to the overwhelming 3rd entry. this is a very funny movie under dogs that is suitable for the whole family. 8/10
