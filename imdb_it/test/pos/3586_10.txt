full of surprises, beautiful, sometimes cruel. just like life itself. leaves one to ask for more the best parts are obviously the action scenes and the chases. I really have to ask myself how much work these guys put into making some scenes (whale hunting, polar bear hunts, etc.). it is a wonderful experience and not to be missed by anyone who dives, sails or goes to the beach once in a while. the music is tempting and the narration is superb and extremely well done. definitely one of the best documentaries ever made and deserves no less than a respectable 10 (for its kind). part of the footage is very cruel and may not be recommended for people with weak stomachs (every killer whale movie is cruel).
