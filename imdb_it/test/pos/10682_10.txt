Gerry Anderson's first live-action foray into making an important film that benefits from the incredible work on the FX model and a great soundtrack by Barry Gray. Analogue reel-to-reel computers in the distant "2069" (I guess Anderson really wanted a secure 100-year appointment later!) They're a hoot to see what the guru-jacket fashions look like, but you could easily blame 2001 of the same violations, but nobody could have foreseen some things as they result. This film was the launch pad for the UFO series the following year, and in fact not only had the same FX people, and many producers, but many of them were regular customers on that show. <br /> <br /> It always looks like a future of "alternative history" more than anything else - the rocket "Apollo" used in take-off, it always seems that this is really another planet than earth. Given the plot of the "alternative land", one might suppose it was the feeling they wanted. We end with an ending that asks more questions than answers. This is because "the other earth" there is every movement, event and what is said is duplicated while it is happening on both worlds. Because of this, and the sun in the middle, the two versions of the same person (in this case Glenn Ross, astronaut) will never be able to meet. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it was probably a secret forever. <br /> <br /> Mainly shot in Portugal with works in England, it's a must for any Gerry Anderson fan. I have the Image Bones DVD of a few years ago now out of print, but hopefully Universal will release it with, maybe extra and even a comment from Gerry Anderson.
