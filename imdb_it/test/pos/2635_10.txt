This film is a great example of the greatness that is 80s entertainment. Oh don't get me wrong, most of the music sucked back then. I've always liked the metal bands of the 80s. Bands that had balls. Forget that keyboard bullshit and all that life is horrible and I want to die 'garbage. But the films of the 80s are the best. They were all nonsense and were simply having fun. This film proves it! Party! Get undressed! Saddle! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
