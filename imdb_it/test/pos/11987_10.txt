I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> No one I know likes, but I do. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good. The script and plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't like Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> <br /> NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think the film would have been better if Rodney Dangerfield had the part of Jackie Mason. Although I liked Jackie Mason in the film, it would be much better if they kept Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another flaw in the film, which I didn't hate so much, was Dan Akroyd. The film was made 8 years after the first one. Bill Murray, "Carl", may have left his job as a guardian and joined the army, you know? If Warner Bros. had thought of this, it could have improved the film as well. <br /> <br /> This was my comment for Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I gave it 8.2 on 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but still good. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Caddyshack 1 and are debating whether or not to see Caddyshack 2, I say it's a test.
