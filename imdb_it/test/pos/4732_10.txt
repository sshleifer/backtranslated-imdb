If you value your freedom! <br /> <br /> I first became interested in the debacle of The Branch Davidian after reading an article in the British periodical "The Fortean Times". Wanting to know more, I rented this documentary and after watching it, I was amazed by what I saw. This film has reached my interest in the subject and since then I have read several books on the subject. This film is a must see for people who only know the facts reported in the so-called "mainstream" media. The lies, double words and contradictory statements made by officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the actions of governments in this "crazy" "crazy" and "kooks" fiasco. <br /> <br /> What is scary is that I know people who consider themselves "open-minded intellectuals and liberal liberals who are still convinced that the government did the right thing to Waco and refuse to look at this film or read any of the books on the subject. They continue to insist that it is not worth their time because it is all propaganda as a lover of arms, Clinton's hatred, religious fanatic, anarchist madman of the right. A publication by an organization made up of many so-called "great minds" who claim to devote themselves to promoting "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film by claiming that it would poison people's minds and strongly suggested that this film should be deleted. They even mentioned the Davidians expected it. I will not say his name since I am a coward. If you are one of those who are reading this (of course you probably wouldn't read it anyway), I can only say that it's a shame not to open your mind.
