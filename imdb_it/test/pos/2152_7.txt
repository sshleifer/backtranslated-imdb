Biodoc on the enigmatic singer-songwriter who, according to friends' accounts, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life apparently on a mission of self-destruction. He died at 52, overweight and dissipated, of heart disease, after a protracted fury of unquestionable virtuosity without ceasing in alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, raucous parties and flagrant abuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend that he cried out his texts in a performance with such force that the splattered blood was left on the microphone). <br /> <br /> All this despite being: (1) widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop ability of his generation; (2) success, after years of effort, in terms of industry acclaim - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent record contract with a top label, and at least two stellar albums - 'Nilsson Schmilsson' (original) and A Little Tocco by Schmilsson in the Night '(standard); and (3) happily married (for the third time), with a young and adorable family that seemed to worship. <br /> <br /> The strengths of the film begin with the completeness of his story about Nilsson's life, including the excellent use of archive footage and many Nilsson stills; editors do a great job of bringing movement into the stills. We learn from his close ties with John Lennon and, later, with Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). Even more impressive are the talking heads, often the weakest aspect of a documentary. Here we find people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams, all of whom tell incredible stories about Nilsson ?? many incredibly funny, others profoundly pathetic and they all convey their deep affection for him. Are the interview segments with Nilsson's wives equally informative and moving? Annie and Una, her son Zach and cousin Doug Hoefer. The best set of heads that I can remember in a biodoc. <br /> <br /> The most obvious lack of the film is that it crowds Nilsson's music. Even the performance of his greatest success, "Without You", is interrupted after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for this, not considering that the film runs for two hours. Lose some headshots and we could have at least heard that song, and maybe one or two more, like "One", or his Oscar-winning cover of "Everybody's Talking." "Filmmakers are simply too intent on probing Nilsson's mystical and inadequate psychology of his music. My grades: 7.5 / 10 (bass B +) (seen in the NWFC Reel Music series, 07/01/07)
