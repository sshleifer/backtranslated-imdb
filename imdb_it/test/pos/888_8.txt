Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD in Korea, and despite the mostly negative responses I heard, and the suspiciously late release of DVDs, I couldn't help but get it back - any wu xia movie is better compared to most non-wu xia movies in my eyes: D Maybe low expectations were an advantage, because I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie pretty funny. <br /> <br /> A murderer is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government's top swordsman has the task of identifying the culprit. This is not particularly time consuming, but the answer is not the one he wanted to hear. Through prolonged flashbacks we learn why, and the story of the swordsman and the murderer, and of the revolution. <br /> <br /> The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean film, and resolutely serious in tone - no HK-style comedy moments to find here. The story can be a little difficult to follow at the beginning, but in the end it makes sense. Eventually the film gets a little unstable, but not worse than what a Chang Cheh movie could do, and for the most part I found it funny. Production values ​​are high, with some good cinematography to capture. The fighting scenes don't measure up to the best HK wu xia movies, but maybe they're not meant to be - the fights are more "realistic", as they are less similar to dance choreographies, but there are some wiring and cgi occasional that put the film in "wu xia" mode. The film does not have the best cast, unfortunately, with leads that are a bit lacking and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other. There's a young woman in the film that I don't think I've ever seen before, but it makes the best impression of any cast of principles - not just because you see it nekkid ... or maybe it is: p The film lacks charm and grace of the best films of HK wu xia, and maybe even beauty, but I only wish that HK would make them even better - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not make me hope that * * is going to happen soon, even if Tsui Hark surely has it still in him if he can get the financing and the cast. SWORD IN THE MOON will not enter my list of favorite wu xia by any means, but it is a bunch of better things than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - maybe even better than BICHUNMOO, although I loved that movie a little more in a second vision. Obviously it's not even remotely close to the wonderful MUSA, but it's a completely different affair. SITM will probably get a second view within three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked :) 7/10
