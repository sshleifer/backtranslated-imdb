This is a great documentary and above the comments make a brief summary of how good it was so I won't repeat the same compliments. But, like Faith, being a Turkey-oriented boy who probably knows that country more than a European municipality, he falls into the trap of orientalism that other Western artists usually fall into. But come on, you are Turkish blood and your film could be deeper and could describe what is beyond the "old city of Beyoglu". It's a lost opportunity for Akin for that reason. The performances of Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are a peek of the film and Ceza (a very talented Turkish rapper and bad ass) makes some talk about the American gangsta rappers who I totally agree. I will recommend this film to my American friends.
