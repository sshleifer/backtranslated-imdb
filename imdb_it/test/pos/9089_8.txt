This film has a decidedly strange environment, which takes place in a school that is really old to begin with, but it certainly doesn't look like a sterile medical school environment. Very Gothic and atmospheric. As for the movie itself, well, OK, the premise is a bit far-fetched but hey, that's why we watch movies, isn't it? And it's less far-fetched than a part of the trash that's out these days, that's for sure. Medical students are experiencing "short-term" death, as in letting themselves die for a short time so they can experience what the afterlife is like. It's kind of nice, in some cases, until some parts come back with the traveler and start to intrude on their land lives. I hadn't seen this film in years until I picked it up on DVD and I have to say that I had forgotten how beautiful it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts is really beautiful in this film, not as today's actresses who are apparently gorgeous but dressed and made up as cheap prostitutes. Ahh, the good old days. However, this is a great film, perhaps not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others could enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.
