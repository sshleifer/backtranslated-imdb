This is a prime example of an uninhibited filmmaker at his best. Richard Greene (who is good at the role) looks for his two lost friends, takes him to the domain of the Black Forest and in the castle of the Count with one eye Bruno (Stephen McNally), an enemy of the past who has never seen face to face . An incredible film has so many fantastic elements combined (for once) in a single film: a crocodile pit; a huge mute (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.); a shrewd doctor (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunt (VERY well done and VERY atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a sword fight; a sadist with one eye and his two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); an intriguing plot that makes the film even more interesting; and more !. Jerry Sackheim's script doesn't get involved on its own - making a film that is extremely recommendable for anyone involved in unlimited filmmaking with a touch of horror and atmosphere.
