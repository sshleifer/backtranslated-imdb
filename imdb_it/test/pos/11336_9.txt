Having seen many other Wong Kar-Wai films (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect entering the theater; cinematography would be luxuriant, the use of space and perspective would be varied, acting would be superb, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness. These are, after all, precisely the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I did not expect was the degree to which I was involved in a film that some reviewers have called "unfinished" and forced by characters who "seemed to be consumed by ennui". <br /> <br /> I find it interesting how people can be so totally impassive from a film that shows so vividly emotions and settings that many of us take for granted or who strive hard to forget: the overwhelming sense of pain resulting from being betrayed; the guilt caused by the thought of not becoming better than the traitor; moments of worldly but profoundly profound relationships, in which the need to speak verbally is completely superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai tries to portray in the film and what he gets so well. <br /> <br /> Too many Americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a movie full of stock dialogues; witty jokes, discontented sarcasm and excessive confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the "best" American film it has to offer. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character who needs to keep the public informed of his every feeling, perception or belief, Wong's characters make their feelings and understandings clearly recognizable through facial gestures, body position and, yes, silence. <br /> <br /> If viewers simply consider this film in terms of character development and action, then they may be disappointed with what it has to offer. If they are willing to let themselves be tempted to guess what the characters are feeling, then they may feel very differently about what Wong has to offer them.
