In December 1945 a train leaves Stockholm central station for Berlin. Not much remains when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted as if they were used to play in the 40s and also photographed (in b / w) as it once was during that period. The actors must have had a lot of fun doing it. Not many characters, as if they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well told and everyone has a sense of timing. <br /> <br /> A deadly black and deadly film. See, if you didn't think the Swedes were capable of humor.
