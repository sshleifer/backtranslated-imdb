Teen Deviyaan is a great movie. A very airy entertainer and a very modern film for his time in the 60s. The music and the songs are fantastic even if the lyrics of Majrooh don't make sense in the places. Dev Anand is a tremendous star and as usual he does justice to his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is OK. Simi is OK too. The film has a fantastic dialogue with Vrajendra Gaur who wrote most of Dev Anand's films like Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc. <br /> <br /> It's a story about Dev being attracted to three women - the Kalpana mod, Simi and the welcoming Nanda. In the end he opts for Nanda. The story is about OK, but it was told in a compelling way and the dialogue and the songs and the great Dev Anand are the highlight of the film. A film to watch absolutely for all Dev Anand fans.
