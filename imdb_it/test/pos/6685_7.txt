Following a robbery incident at Grand Central Station in New York, an innocent viewer (Kevin Spacey, "The Usual Suspects") is arrested by the police who believe he is under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think this, considering how politely the man informed them that he wears dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really bright". And so Prot (as identified, pronounced as rhyme with "goat") is sent to the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan, where a laborious doctor of the work, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski"), tries to understand the so-called disappointment of this man. <br /> <br /> Prot's ways are courteous and collaborative. When asked why he believes he was institutionalized, he responded very realistically which is why "you think I'm crazy". Within minutes, after fulfilling its insatiable new hunger for fruits of the earth, the direct Prot revealed itself to be an extraterrestrial on the planet K-PAX, which resides 1000 light-years away, surrounding the Agape binary star system and Satori located in the constellation of Lyra. He also explains how his infinitely more advanced species has already learned the fastest journey of light, exploiting the energy of light, a result that is presumably eons of distance for the human race. <br /> <br /> Powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, although he is still fascinated by them, and is committed to understanding how Prot has come to believe in such a thing. Meanwhile, Prot is using his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, eventually offering everyone around him something to live for, and hope for a cure. On July 27, prot later reveals, he will leave again for K-PAX, and can only take a human with him. Of what will actually happen on that date, no one is certain. <br /> <br /> Originally planned to play Dr. Powell ?? with Will Smith as Prot ?? Kevin Spacey entered the lead role when Smith had to retire from the movie. It can be said that he had a lot of fun with his character, the completely concrete delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("Your products alone were worth the trip") often arousing genuine laughter. There is an undeniable intelligence behind many of Prot's words, but logic claims that it must be delusional ... isn't it? <br /> <br /> Is the public led back and forth between the possibilities ?? for the first part of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an extraterrestrial (this is a science fiction film, isn't it?!), before being totally convinced when Prot inexplicably shows an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a planetary system just discovered. A final investigation by Dr. Powell offers us a well-grounded explanation for Prot's disappointments, but this is just as quickly taken away, and we were left scratching our heads again. The film rightly keeps its ending open, leaving the public the opportunity to contemplate what they have just seen and discuss it with those around them. However, if you believe that Prot is an alien or not, two irresistible certainties grip your mind: the Universe is, in effect, a fascinating place, and perhaps there are superior forces that we humans have yet to discover.
