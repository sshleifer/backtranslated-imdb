The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant Exploitation films, and the third masterpiece in a row, "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya" aka. "Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable" (aka "Sasori": Den Of The Beast "where I live) of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects, but that equals (or perhaps surpasses them) in a brilliant way. The entire Sasori original series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight of WIP cinema, and all films, especially the first three, uniquely combine Exploitation and auteur cinema like no other film does. "Beast Stable" is the third and penultimate film "Sasori" with Meiko Kaji, the last to be directed by the brilliant director Shunya Ito and, in my opinion, the greatest of all. The first film "Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori" from 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of the Exploitation cinema and simply THE Definition of Exploitation-Art. In the equally brilliant first sequel, "Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô" Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The "Sasori" third film, "Beast Stable", maintains surrealism (although not exactly in the same measure as the second), and presents even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics such as poverty, forced prostitution and exploitation of the poor are central themes of the film. <br /> <br /> This third film "Sasori" is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and probably the biggest of the cycle, generally brilliant, (for me this is it, with the first as a close second). Once again, "Best Stable" is both very artistic and very exploiting. The visually stunning film again presents an enormous amount of brutal and again sleaze violence, as well as sequences of enormously surreal beauty. The beautiful Meiko Kaji is again brilliant in her role as Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori). I absolutely love this wonderful actress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one doing it. The rest of the shows are also great, especially Mikio Narita is as big as a police inspector who is obsessed with taking Sasori. The soundtrack is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", sung by Meiko Kaji herself, as the main theme, which is great, since the soundtrack is, simply, pure perfection. Like its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art that no serious movie buff can afford to lose. The entire Sasori cycle is at the top of my list of all-time favorites. "Beast Stable" is without doubt the most brilliant masterpiece of them all! 10/10
