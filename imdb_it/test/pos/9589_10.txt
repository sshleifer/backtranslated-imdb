OK ... time for a little vent I think. 2 years have passed since I presented my original comments praising this high-level comedy ..... and the damned thing that has not yet come to video or DVD (or even if it was repeated on television! !!! <br /> <br /> Anyone out there knows why not? Was there a BBC-style error for which the original copy was deleted / lost / deleted ?? <br /> <br /> Listen to your role at ITV - whack this on to DVD now !!! Do you realize how fun this program is? Makes "Mike Bassett" as ugly as the current Spurs pants. <br /> <br /> Rant over. For the moment.
