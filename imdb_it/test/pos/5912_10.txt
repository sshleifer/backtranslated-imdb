Others played around here at the age of James Stewart when he played Lindburg (he was 47, Linburg was twenty-five.) But Stewart does not look like his age and the film, for him it was a dream come true. A true pilot and a retired aeronautical general retired at the end of his life, Stewart had the feeling for the character and understanding of his passion, which other actors could not lead to the role. Added to the cast was co-star Murray Hamilton, who also had to be represented in "FBI History with Stewart" and other well-known characters like Richard Deacon, of the later "Dick Van Dike Show" and Robert Cornthwaite of "The Thing from Another World, the 1951 classic of Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> Billy Wilder captures the flavor of Lindburg's Autobiography and the story of what would become an important event in aviation history. the film is a testimony of the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream. A box office failure at the time of its release has since become one of the great classics of American Film and another in a long series of extraordinary interpretations of an actor film that was called America's Everyman. No film history student should miss seeing it: there have been over 500,000 films since the beginning of the films, and this is among the top 500.
