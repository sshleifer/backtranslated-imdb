I'm glad I first read the Sarah Waters novel, since at the time I had my photos of the characters in my head. The casts of this production, however, were not at all disappointing - in fact, after getting used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, I think Nina Gold did a damn good job in the casting department. (Can Keeley Hawes be more delicious ?!) <br /> <br /> The BBC did it again: this is a wonderful production of a great book, and they did it in style. If you can get your hands on this (VHS, DVD) make sure you have the 181-minute version (the one without censorship). It's a wonderful journey, even if a little rocky, sometimes you won't regret it.
