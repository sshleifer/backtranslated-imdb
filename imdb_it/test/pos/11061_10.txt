I saw this film for the first time when I was in elementary school, in the 1960s. I was fascinated by the character played by Ingrid Bergman and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is the best as he returns to take revenge on his wife and his father's daughter (his mother was thrown out of favor). During this time he meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the two is great. The second part of the film takes place in Saratoga, New York (the Saratoga of the title) and I never like it as much as the New Orleans setting, but it's still very good. I give this film a ten - partly out of nostalgia but mostly because it's just a damn good movie and the characters besides those of Bergman and Cooper are just as wonderful (Flora Robson approaches to steal Bergman's scenes). It was shown periodically on TV, but it is rarely shown, if ever - it would be nice for one of the classic movie stations to be collected and included in their programming cycles.
