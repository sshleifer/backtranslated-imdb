I only saw this movie because I didn't want to leave my 9-year-old and her friend in the theater alone. Honestly, I expected to enjoy a good nap, but I found myself entranced by the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mom was in one of my favorite TV shows of all time years ago, playing a mermaid (Maximum Bob). She was really pretty in this movie. The three main characters were all excellent young actors. I also enjoyed seeing and hearing Jimmy Buffet. The film itself was very beautiful - it shows some of what makes Florida so great. I'm glad I ended up going to this movie. And thinking about it, I was disappointed that I couldn't bring them to see "Stick It" - I think it was MUCH better!
