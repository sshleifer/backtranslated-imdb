A British Brit-com vg, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Eccentric and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the most fun), although it has a unique charm. Well written, the plot vanishes into a few blind alleys but mostly emerges with a new high plot. You know from the beginning how it will end, but when it arrives it is honest and very open, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed a pleasant beginning and left me more.
