The Merchant of Venice 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and could therefore be thought of as containing spoilers to anyone who is not aware of the plot.) <br /> <br / > As a film version of Shakespeare's famous comedy, Merchant of Venice does what few Polanski gritty Macbeth adaptations do: it takes the spirit of the game and takes it out not only well, but better than the game alone could easily achieve. <br /> <br /> The Lord of the Rings director, Peter Jackson, has argued that when adapting a book or a game there are three options: try to replicate the original as perfectly as possible, use the idea original as inspiration, but take full license for the film change, or (the one he preferred) stick to the original as much as is practicable by a film ally, but make the necessary changes to the film and stay true to the intention or spirit of the original. /> <br /> In Macbeth, Polanski used rain-washed beaches and realistic rapes and murders to communicate in which bloody and horrible time the play was set, thus recalling the horrible context in which the characters perform such mistreatment recommended decisions. It differs from (say) Branlet's Hamlet, which has reached new levels of faithful rendering, but otherwise offered very little new. Macbeth, on the other hand, perhaps allowed a fresh audience of Shakespeare to appreciate part of the fullness of the drama without a thorough study; similarly, a more familiar audience may find a greater depth than what unauthorized scene performance could achieve. This interpretation plays a fundamental role if the public has to engage fully, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points that Shakespeare wanted to make. Radford's adaptation of Merchant of Venice does just that. We need crucial moral dilemmas that involve religious bigotry or promises of maintenance and, with a minimum disorder of the sacred saint of the Bard, faithfully transmit them in the spirit of the original story. <br /> <br /> The first of these, religious bigotry, gives meaning to Shylock's otherwise extravagant behavior. We see the Jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto, admitted only if they wear a red identifying cap. Not being allowed to own property, one of the few ways they can earn a living is by borrowing money. This makes them both useful to their Christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their denigration. The idea behind (both the old and the new testament) biblical prohibitions against usury probably derives from not making a profit by helping one's friends. This is extended by bigoted Christians to curse those to whom they spit (we see Shylock not only spitting, but other Jews thrown into waterways for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening). <br /> <br /> The actuality of the film is curious, since the bigotry of right-wing Christianity (personified by the Americans who follow Bush) has come full circle, since they are now the main supporters of Zionism, and the political leaders Jews bite their neighboring Palestinians as Shylock tries to bite Antonio (once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). Psychology is obvious - kick a dog repeatedly and it will become vicious. The circle continues easily as victims of oppression easily lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. <br /> <br /> The rigorous sleight of hand that the masquerade portia uses to save Antonio has some merit, both as an intelligent interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the Venetians of the game are so rare and also as a moral pointer. Shylock could 'have his pound of flesh' under his contract, but he may not have blood. An easy analogy could be made with regards to war and terrorism - it is much easier to justify the combat between fighters or to attack illegal acts if the soldiers or the wicked are the only victims - when there are huge collateral damage, such as when innocent citizens , including women and children, they are killed by the hundreds, the arguments of the warmongers (whether warmonging whether Israeli, Palestinian or American Americans) have a much less popular support. <br /> <br /> There has long been much discussion as to whether Shakespeare was anti-Semitic in this story. One wonders whether he should have adapted the ending to a largely Christian audience that had little to do with the Jewish people. Far from teaching him a greater good, the ending imposes Christianity and humiliation on Shylock - a course that probably will simply perpetuate the repressed resentment. Both fields look just as bad - one simply holds more power than the other. The slight improvement in the judgment simply gives the Christian judges a better public image, or as Bassanio so acutely (observes when he chooses the caskets and solves the puzzles to conquer the hand of Portia): <br /> <br /> In religion, What a damn mistake, but a little in the face of sobering It will bless him and approve him with a text, hiding the coarseness with a beautiful ornament? There is no such simple vice, but it assumes some sign of virtue on its external parts. <br /> <br /> Of course, bigotry applies to organized religion (rather than spirituality), especially when organized for political purposes, but one that easily scares ordinary people who fear God who are not in the habit of split hair. Kindness, mercy ('Chesed' in Judaism), which is so fundamental to true Christianity, is something that is wonderfully practiced even in Judaism as in most beliefs. The Jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity, ways of practicing both effectively and ways of making it part of being rather than an external spectacle. Both Shylock and Antonio are bigots and use their respective faiths to abuse those of another faith. While Shakespeare perhaps indicated the abyss between the goodness prescribed by the different faiths and his absence in practice, the film version reduces most of the windows for interpretations of anti-Semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to psychological causes. <br /> <br /> The preservation of promises (men to their wives) is treated less well, as are the comic elements inherent in cross-dressing sub-plots. Bassanio, however strong his love for Antonio (there are homosexual elements there?) He cannot make serious moral judgments when he shows his gratitude to the "judge", and thus breaks his promise (for which Portia forgives him, showing a triumphant character for women, not only as extremely intelligent and witty, but also as more truly merciful and caring towards others than her bigoted male counterparts, including her husband. <br /> <br /> Some recitations are a bit rigged, and there are too many regional accents (English), but on the whole Merchant of Venice offers a new and gratifying reworking of Shakespeare I liked the acting, and also the beautiful score of Hayley Westenra and others, singing signed ballad both from Shakespeare and from Edgar Allen Poe All in all, Merchant of Venice is a significant milestone in the British film tradition (although it can be said that every film is of a particular nationality in these days).
