... as precious as King Tut's grave! (OK, maybe not THE LAST one, but it's worth hunting if you can). I notice that nobody has commented on this film for some years, and I hope a new post will give new comments. This is a film that I remembered only fragments from childhood, and that I saw only recently when I was tired of waiting for Fox to honor his past and to hunt down the Korean DVD (in English, but with Korean subtitles irremovable). I won't go through another long description of the plot - suffice it to say that seeing it for the first time in its proper widescreen format left me speechless about the prospects and purpose of the film. The opaque paintings still hold up and the sets are truly breathtaking. But it is the details on a smaller scale that give this film its depth and richness, offering a look at the lifestyles of the poor Egyptians and their elite. The bazaars, the hovels, the docks, the embalming houses and the taverns are as fascinating as the throne room of the pharaoh. While errors abound on a large scale (especially dynastic succession), the details are more meticulously researched than the vast majority of Hollywood films. Visually, it is not without its flaws: the interiors are often too bright and colored to integrate perfectly with the exterior. However, this is a film that should be credited for being bold in the small as in the large. Boring? In parts, absolutely. Overacted? Underacted? Yes, both - even if "undervalued" could be a more appropriate description. Too long? Absolutely not. I wanted them to have spent more time with Sinuhe's experiences in the House of Death, and among the Hittites, and less with his "love story" with Nefer, though. Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but so was Shakespeare. No one scolds him for this. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as others, but in the end we must remember that cinema is theater, not a history lesson.
