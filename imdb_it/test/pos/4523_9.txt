This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in serial chronological order in these consecutive days. This is also my first comment on one I've seen before even though it's been about 24 years since then, so I didn't remember much about it. In this, the Honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring initially drawn by a former Scotland Yard acquaintance who disappeared in the Big Apple ... This is the best of Chan's voices that I've seen so far in the current memory with every clue connected (although, of course, if I look at them from a closer look, there may still be holes even if I can't think of any right now). And "N Â° 2 Son" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is somehow a help when he first identifies the poison that causes some murders at the beginning, even if, obviously, he does a little later. Among the comeback cast of Chan's latest film - Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum - we find the blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, her brother John G. who directed a lost Chan one called Chan Chan Chance, as fingerprint expert. Nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber. Oh, and look at a certain Stooge in a row of policemen ...
