several years ago I saw this film, with no subtitles, on television, and although I didn't understand anything about what the characters were saying, I still had the general idea, and the atmosphere of the film fascinated me without end. <br /> <br /> I finally saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart skipped when I saw the picture in the TV guide, and for 8 days until the movie was really shown I told everyone I knew I was going to see it. the story reminded me a little of the vertigo of Alfred Hitchcock. a slow and thoughtful film about a boy who one day believes he sees the girl who disappeared years before. what follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really fanciful twists in the plot, and at the end of the film I was breathless. I had absolutely not what I expected (and I had already seen the movie!). be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
