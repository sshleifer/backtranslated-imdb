- The Best Bit: When the dark madman (Nicholas Turturro) calls the fugitive (Matthew Modine) "Shane! .. Come Back Shane!" and when the wise old man asks him "What are you doing ?!" he simply replies "Enjoying My Time!" Actually like me at the moment! <br /> <br /> - The most gruesome part: I wondered all the time to watch: where did I see that girl before? where is it ? where is it ? Until I discovered the credits .. OHH MY GOD! She is (Elizabeth Berkley) .. From the showgirl fiasco! But I just couldn't recognize her with her clothes! To tell you the truth I felt a brief tremor. She's really cute and pretty, but maybe Hollywood didn't pity her! <br /> <br /> - The sexiest part: When (Berkley) says "Do you mean the stuff a Boner gives you ?!" <br /> <br /> - The most boring thing: the assistant delayed after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !! ?? also the Mexican smuggler took 3 bullets (at the same car!) and did not die either !! ?? <br /> <br /> - The worst thing: all those people killed, as well as the large department (F) to a boring extent! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful thing: The crazy smart script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations, the acting seemed sweet especially from (Paul Rodriguez) who stole the show for (as he had the best dialogue too!). <br /> <br /> - The most disappointing thing: even if the director did not mess up the wit of the story, but at the same time did not give him a unique touch, an unparalleled signature, a sort of madness like that in history itself. However, maybe the low production was very wrong! And of course the music is easy and without flavor that could be so also because of the economic production! <br /> <br /> - The most confusing part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented guy, but what exactly did he do to be off the Hollywood star list ?! What could be the thing he did (or didn't do!) End up in a light and independent joke like (The Shipment)? !! <br /> <br /> - The most absent scene: where is the Mexican smuggler (Jos√©)?! I thought that we will see him again at the end, smuggling again like the little surviving criminal who, in a brief expedient like this, could materialize the continual disorder of such a world. <br /> <br /> - Most of the questions I had after the end: when will we see (The expedition - 2)? Since I am so anxious to see that atmosphere as a funny little joker! <br /> <br /> These were my answers. If you are interested in providing answers to this questionnaire, please send me an email.
