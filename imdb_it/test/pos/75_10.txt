This often vilified film is a must for Blake Edwards fans, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or Hollywood musicals. Other writers have commented on the changes in tone, the confusion of the plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend. The soundtrack is one of the best by Henry Mancini (and he has written many of those wonderful ones), several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews, Julie's performance is blurred and she is dressed in beautiful clothes, (she is absolutely lovely here ), the shots on the spot are breathtaking, and there are some funny visual gags by Inspector Clouseau. Rock Hudson practically phoned his performance, but it's passably good. A true object of curiosity as it was the last major film that Julie has made for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor of Victor / Victoria. It's nice to watch and listen. When will it be available on DVD ??? When it is, I first want both versions - the longest and the shortest, the director's cut. Since he was electrocuted in S.O.B., they would make a fantastic two pack!
