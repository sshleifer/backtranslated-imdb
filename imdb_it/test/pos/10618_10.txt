This film is absolutely incredible. From the performances of Huppert, Girardot and Magimel, to the script and direction of Haneke there is not a single misstep. The film can embarrass some people with its harsh sexual subject and its slower pace, but it's really a masterpiece of cinema ... so don't let it be a challenging way to keep yourself away! <br /> <br /> Powerful and deserving of every prize won at Cannes!
