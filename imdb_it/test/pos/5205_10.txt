Apart from the low budget, there are never more than 50 Germans in one scene at a time, plus the same two half-tracks, this film is absolute first class. Everything is accurate. This is the point, I believe, from uniforms to horror and disillusionment. All are gray like the gray field uniforms. Gray men with life drained from them. Forget having done Gung I have junk in the United States like Blackhawk and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war movies ever. Only Cross of Iron beats this for tension and history. Please, could we have a correct German language not dubbing with English subtitles in the UK? Without having to pay ridiculous import taxes from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this?
