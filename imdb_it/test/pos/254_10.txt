I just reviewed the 8th MS Gundam for the 2nd time. It is much better than Gundam Wing. I can't wait to get the DVD and see what has been changed by the series. This is nice to see the Gundams clumsily moving across the land. Someone really thought of writing this motion script. <br /> <br /> See this today,.
