I suppose I like this movie and everyone I know; it's not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily" this fascinating and memorable semi-musical satire might suggest that it was appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized Blake's special kindness and clever spirit Edwards humor and solid narrative. The unlikely but delightful plot follows Lili Smith, a fringe spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black and white war; Lili Schmidt passing while Smith is helping his uncle, who is also patriotic, for Germany, but neither cruel nor political, simply opportunist. Lili's goal is William Larrabee, a charismatic leader of the US squadron who can provide his valuable information. The plot thickens when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, has her eyes open to the consequences of her spy and sees the effects of fighting on the wounded in a hospital and understands what it might mean for her men she met and likes. He becomes jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affections, then realizes that he can no longer do what he did and give up the espionage business. The logical end of the film comes after the terrible First World War is over, while singing the soundtrack of the movie "Wishing" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of Larrabee's squadron appear, including his lover himself, indicating that they have forgiven her and their former adversaries; and also Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins the song of "It's a Long To Tipperraree", to indicate that all is well for the world. This is a bold and sometimes brilliant idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of "John Goldfarb" fame; and it is a delightful narrative. Larrabee's squadron, including an intoxicated who continues to crash and other lovable types, populates this animated film; and the sensation of this elegant and luminous film is almost epic, both in its scope and in its realization. The credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for the sets, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production project, Henry Mancini for his sensible and appropriate soundtrack, and for Russell Harlan for his brilliant cinematography. In the beautiful movie, the main actors are Julie Andrews in the role of Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp as Lili Kurt's uncle, Michael Witney, Lance Percival in the role of the inebriated pilot, the splendid Gloria Paul in the role of rival by Lili and many other good actors in smaller parts. It is difficult to say enough positive things about rhythm, or the intelligence of the right side of the broad comedy; this element is introduced by Edwards to increase the horrors of the war proper, for example the almost comical-operatic approach with which men made war in a more innocent age than human civilization. This comedy also helps to pave the way for Lili's conversion from the uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to the acceptance of the reality of what he is doing and potentially of what he might be causing. This is a rare film on the "meaning of life" on Lili's "Americanization", on his affirmation in the real world and then among others before the tragedy can happen. It's disturbing, I find it beautiful in many ways. I consider it the masterpiece of direction by Blake Edwards; and with the title "The Americanization of Lili" I believe that with almost no change that could have been recognized as the shiny sapphire of a film, it is of every level I know.
