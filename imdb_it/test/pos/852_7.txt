I can't really fault this movie. It is literally the first film you remember seeing and brought to a permanent love for science fiction, horror movies and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, seeing him again years later, he held up quite well. Rod Cameron plays a great hunter whose last safari was swept away by mammoths. No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has beautiful landscapes. The acting is of a high standard. I don't think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have ever made a bad performance. Mammoths, when they finally arrive, are quite effective. The finale also has an unusual twist, particularly for a 1950s science fiction film. Definitely worth seeing.
