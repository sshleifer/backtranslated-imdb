Mom should be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title. <br /> <br /> This is a zombie movie far superior to so much of the junk that is being baked from time to time and they all end up pretty much like all the other zombie movies out there. <br /> <br /> It is so different and refreshing that it almost escapes categorization. <br /> <br /> kind old lady who welcomes a disturbing tenant, who appears to be a meat eater, who then infects the old lady who also turns into a meat that eats zombies, or ghouls, exactly which is not exactly defined. <br /> <br /> There is pathos in the story as his son realizes what he has become and, initially, horrified, tries to help her by providing "food". (I won't say any more about this, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It's one of those "quiet" films as opposed to exploding guns, raging explosions, car chases, etc. Boring etc. Which makes so many films all the same junk, but still with enough bloody moments to satisfy horror fans, even adding sadness to the story, along with pleasant touches of humor in contrast to the real nonsense of some so-called "horror" films. <br /> <br /> is a particularly nice shot of atmosphere at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and looks so 'innocent', but , what becomes !! Oh my! <br /> <br /> A jewel of a movie and even if it is not your genre, it should be seen at least once by a true horror fan.
