The Outer Limits is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me very strong emotions. There are, undoubtedly, some episodes of stinker, but it's essentially an old calf turned into a TV show, so it's normal. For the most part it is done in an excellent, well-produced and direct manner, and often includes talented people of great name who seem to enjoy working in a solid translation of short narrative in one-hour television format. <br /> <br /> The Outer Limits tends to focus on rather extensive ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely ends without the voice off, sensing a serious thought. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the themes are hammered a little too heavily for all but thicker spectators. Furthermore, while a certain level of distrust of the government favors an effective democracy, you can unfortunately take several back-to-back episodes that border on the absurdity regarding the distrust of the army / CIA, etc. Another note is that any large group with power (the Roman Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the People's Republic of China and so on) are expressed in a bad light in frequency that varies from once to many times. <br /> <br /> While the show can beat a dead horse if watched enough, the overall quality is staggering, and I am grateful that science fiction has decided to continue broadcasting it until they produce a DVD set of season by season (and I can afford it.
