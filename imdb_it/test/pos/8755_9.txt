I remember seeing him in the early 90s on UK TV and I was caught. The international purpose of the production is breathtaking and to observe how the characters develop during the five hours of execution is magnificent. The scenes set in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest and, as a spectator, there is a real sense of a grounded vision of the culture and atmosphere of these countries during the final stages of the Cold War. The characters of Fazal and Helen develop very well throughout the series and rival modern shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in this area. In the UK, the VHS costs around £ 6 and the DVD costs around £ 10 - a quality deal. I thought that Soderbergh's version was also fantastic, but clearly this debt is due to this huge masterpiece.
