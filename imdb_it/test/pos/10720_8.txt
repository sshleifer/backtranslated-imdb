This is probably the best cinematic representation of life in a Manhattan advertising agency: the pressure to perform; requests from customers and agencies; the parties; the creativity; money; the fresh surface with powerful underground corporate currents. <br /> <br /> Toss in parenting for Dustin Hoffman. <br /> <br /> The film is structured and profound. He follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what is happening; her relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes her friend), and her relationship with her son. <br /> <br /> While Meryl Streep was big, did you set the record for the least amount of time on the screen to win an Oscar? Surely he can deliver when she's up, though.
