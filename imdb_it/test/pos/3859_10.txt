As the mother of a 3 and 2 year old child, I love AristoCats. It is a film that does not contain double meanings, no swear words like devil or rude, no parents who are functional idiots, and no jokes that make crap or flatulence so widespread even in the "best" movies for children these days. The plot is sweet and interesting. The music is fantastic. The romance is quite romantic. Kittens are adorable and the other characters are unique and catch the eye. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. Even the characters are quite well done. I love listening to the velvety voice of Eva Gabor, and there are many others that are familiar since childhood and that fit so well with the characters. It really is a film about love, tolerance, good manners and loyalty. Who does not want their children to be exposed to these values? It's a film that I don't care to watch over and over again, unlike Happy Feet, where I couldn't see the whole thing once because it was so irritating. I would like the production companies to move towards making films more like this.
