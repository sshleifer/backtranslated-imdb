I finally saw the third film in the Mehta trilogy: "Fire". To start, I would say that "Water" was the indisputable masterpiece, at all levels. The fire comes later, with the Earth nearby in order of quality. Fire: there is so much to do in this film that I need some other vision to drink it all. The writing is superb, the script creates friction that starts the whole "heat" process from beginning to end when in reality it explodes in a fire, the conflicts move in the complete rupture of relationships. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a courageous woman: she sees very clearly that she is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society she came from. Today India is changing rapidly, but much of it is economic change. The fact that he encountered such fierce opposition to the realization of "Water" after the script was clarified, shows that there are still many taboo issues that Indians less can not look at in the face, cannot examine or discuss them. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to show a mirror to these problems, he must face death threats. So, although India considers itself a pluralistic and tolerant society, the facts are not always the case. Considering that "Earth" was simply a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence, Fire and Water are focusing on personal, social and religious issues, which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that one artistic dialogue is still many years away. As I write, "Water" is scheduled to be presented in India later this year. I'll believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> The fire faces a similar sexual and emotional enigma that I saw in "A Price Above the Rubies". Whether it is arranged marriages (as it was once among the Jews about 150 years ago, or as it is among many modern Indians), they run the risk of having a bad game forced on men and women; or, simply marriages without love ..... However, this is not the real problem. Mehta is clearly impatient with totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or keep women slaves of marriages without love (Fire). I am not an expert on secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce. The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce) is almost as serious as the sad marriage. In any case, the film by Mehta is a very moving and powerful attempt at sexual discourses that keeps modern relations in India up to in-depth control. That all three of these films made themselves felt in India as an unjustified attack on their culture seems to me to be the predictable clamor of a repressive mentality. Mehta is forcing the problems to be watched, no matter how tired he is. I admire his work and can't recommend his films enough. Superb, disturbing, provocative, shocking taboo.
