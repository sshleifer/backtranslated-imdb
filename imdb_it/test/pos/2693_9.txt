This is one of the most entertaining shows on TV today. It hits the mark 99% of the time. Usually after watching a sitcom after a few years, the actors become cartoons, as if they were trying to become the beloved characters they play. In my opinion, these actors remained true to their roles. The chemistry is still there, the writing has not diminished and I can't wait to see it. The family dynamics still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so exaggerated as to make it seem that the writers are reaching an empty purse trying to keep the show for another season. It is one of the few shows that I watch without the remote control in hand for a quick change.
