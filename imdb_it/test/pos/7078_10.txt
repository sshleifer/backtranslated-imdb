Meryl Streep could be the greatest actor working today. His chameleonic portraits never fail to amaze; it really seems to be the characters he brings to the screen. In "One True Thing", she gives life to a deceptively simple and profoundly complex woman who does her best to play the hand that gave her life. Surviving cancer is not an easy task, and not just surviving, but actually continuing to live one's life is even more difficult - and that's exactly what Kate Gulden (Streep) intends to do. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only keeps her in this exalted society, but shines like Streep's daughter, who learns to see her parents and her life in a new light. Streep is a power plant and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his work here; his "I'll say it once" dialogue once with Zellweger will leave you devastated. Zellweger, however, is the real revelation: his face conveys every emotion, every conflict as he begins to learn the many truths about his parents' strengths and weaknesses. Director Carl Franklin ("The Devil in a Blue Suit") treats extremely difficult narrative material with confidence and delicacy.
