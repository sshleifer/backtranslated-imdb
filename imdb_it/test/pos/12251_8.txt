This is a love story set against the latest television news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle while working at the Washington office of a television network. <br /> <br /> Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the handsome journalist who is treated as a star. Jane (Hunter) is the producer who recognizes that Tom does not have the intellectual capacity to be a real journalist, but he falls for he.Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares his beliefs about journalistic standards is also the man who really loves her. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was nominated for Best Academy Award for Best Actress, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!). She was robbed! This is Hunter's movie. Her character Jane is intelligent, ruthless and totally driven. It is also exhilarating neurotic. His performance is perfect. Watch her face when she looks at the tape of Tom's interview on a rape victim. The scale literally falls from his eyes. <br /> <br /> The performance of Wiliam Hurt is less showy. He plays a man who knows he is a himbo and a scam, but he is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane. He gives a small hint to an extremely calcified man. <br /> <br /> The film comments on celebrities, journalism, integrity and commercial pressures on the news in a medium focused on the bottom line. He predicted that the news would be ridiculed, that the standards would be lowered slowly due to commercial pressures. <br /> <br /> Think of this: this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before the birth of reality TV. Still, he predicted the nonsense of the news. The release of Paris from prison was treated as important news! To see how prophetic this film is, watch the evening news and observe the set, the graphics and the presenters. Tom Grunick and his clones are alive!
