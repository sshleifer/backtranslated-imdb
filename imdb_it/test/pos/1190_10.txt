Treat Williams has achieved a level of celebrity with this film, and really wasted it. Not to be misled by his poor cinematographic choices since then. This film really stood out. "Hair" is a musical that really takes care of the attitude, and probably more of the personality, of the famous pacifist movement of the 60s. There is a lot of spectacular music done in a spectacular way. Unlike the music videos of the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, flash videos coincide with the topic of music. In other words, video makes sense when paired with songs, so you know you could never do it on MTV. The topic focuses on drugs and on being hippies, but it is above all an anti-war film dealing with the senseless tragedies of Viet Nam. One of the protagonists is an Oklahoma boy intent on making a difference, believing in all the patriotic dribbling he is given to eat, and it happens to a New York gang, which are more or less glorious thugs; their characters are really unique, and probably would make no sense today, but this group is grouped by burning their draft cards. What follows in some spectacular scenarios and fascinating scenes that involve not only the three protagonists, but also the other 3 members of the band, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entrance is easily one of the ten largest entrances of all times in the cinema, partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation. Despite their shortcomings, you love these people, a cinematic triumph with a heart of heart and a grand finale.
