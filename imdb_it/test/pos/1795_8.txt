Apparently, Hans's isolation and desperation are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a troublesome wife and a lover's refusal. And despite the complex representation - Hans himself does not make these statements his own - the previous one must be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thought (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer cannot look beyond Hans's gender and sexism to identify the truest cause of his crushed spirit. <br /> <br /> First, it is highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love prompted him to sign with the Foreign Legion. It was much more probable, and partly indicated, that it was a quest for adventure, male camaraderie (escape from the female world of mother and sister) and male identity itself - that both the Legion and the war offered. <Br /> <br /> Secondly, Hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism. Falling from the tricks of a prostitute at work, she not only proclaims prostitution as an oppressive institution, but shows that she cannot even control her sexuality in a professional arena - and is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career. <br /> Thirdly, he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his male sheep-like companions, without making any distinction between his absence or - when she shows up looking for him - the presence. In fact, it is more brutal in his presence. <br /> <br /> Several hours later, in a violent and drunk state, he beats his wife in front of her daughter, who intervenes on behalf of her mother. The terror she instills in her and her daughter are palpable. But both he and the public continue with a grumble of conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is cruelly characterized both as annoying and sexually promiscuous (yes, this could be Fassbinder's vision of what capitalism does to women - possessed, insecure and a commodity - but this absolves absolutely Hans's brutality and exploitation of Fassbinder for his part in the drum scene). <br /> <br /> And then there is this pressure of the male role, which Hans could choose to refuse and protest, but instead accepts. It is too low for a male and too little heroic to achieve the worldly success that the male role recommends. But how can these causes of despair be when he not only acquires his lost love as a lover but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than him., Finally, Hans allows Harry, his war partner, to stay, to convince the wife invites, on the contrary, in their home. With this decision, he not only makes it clear that he is more connected to Harry than to his wife, but that masculine connection replaces his love for women. And it eventually replaces his own life, because it is Harry's superior competence and spirit around the house that drops Hans's star. Hans, the merchant, may to some extent be a victim of capitalism, but more precisely, he is a victim of his own loyalty to his male identity. His inability to let go is the ultimate cause of his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> This is something that is lost, I think, not only on Fassbinder, but also on Han's sister, Anna - though, only to a degree lost. For the support of Anna (and Fassbinder) to his brother - on his mother, he only goes far. He is insistent enough to say that only he can save himself - that his support and love cannot put an end to his self-contempt. Unfortunately, she offers none of this same support and love for his wife who must be much more bitter than Hans, but who, in the end, is able to pick up the pieces, save herself and her daughter, and present a marked contrast at the fall of Han.
