A touching documentary that puts a human face on the tragedy of September 11th, showing how a small community joined together to honor two high school friends lost that day. The film intertwines the lives of Chris and Tom through interviews with family and friends and fragments of old photos. Through their reminiscences we see two tragically shortened lives. The film also documents how, through a series of coincidences, an inspiring memorial garden was carried out through the efforts of many people, both known and unknown to the two victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope, honor and love. This film evokes many different emotions, but the final feeling is one of admiration for the human spirit, not overlooked by the tragedy.
