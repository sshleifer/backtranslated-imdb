This movie is extremely fun - the momma character makes me go back to the movies over and over again! I can't get enough of his dry features ... like when he tells his son Owen to bury his friend in the backyard before he sniffs the place ... and his suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her by giving her nuts savory! It is funny! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like National Lampoon's Vacation, Uncle Buck, or Planes, Trains & Automobiles, this one has a similar humor. It's a nice, healthy laugh ... don't miss it!
