This is the kind of unknown and forgotten movie that you dream of discovering by watching old videos. It is a superb comic gem with a brilliantly amusing writing, set in the wonderful series of characters, a wonderfully inventive and entertaining musical score and a witty and light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch and review. Montgomery is a bit of an actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate the home of a young novice to discover the identity of his ex-boyfriend, a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather absurd, the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the confused plant, Ann Blyth is a marvel as the romantic and obsessed novice, the parade of comic characters of the veteran theater actress, Jane Cowl's lawyer mother and Lillian Randolph's maid are all fabulous. <br /> <br /> Strangely, this earned only an Oscar for Sound, when it deserved the best signs of directing, screenplay and musical score. <br /> <br /> DO NOT MISS: it is one of the best in Hollywood.
