"Crossfire" is a 1947 noir, justly famous, which is a mystery of murder with a strong message. It features Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame, and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk. At first we witness the murder in the shade, and for the rest of the film, Young, as a detective, Finlay, the case manager, tries to figure out which of the three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels ends up dead. <br /> <br /> I don't know of 1947, but seeing "Crossfire" today, we know who did it and why when we see the suspects. I suppose it wasn't as apparent at the time, as these actors had just started. Nevertheless, the film offers a strong impact with its powerful acting, good direction, violence and a ruthless antisemitic language. <br /> <br /> The characterizations are vivid, including that of Gloria Grahame in a rather small role - she is a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspicious soldiers, in a bar and can give him an alibi . The great performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but all are excellent. Robert Young is particularly effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very likable as a soldier who tries to help his confused friend Mitchell, an uncertain solitary man if he still has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Really excellent and a must see.
