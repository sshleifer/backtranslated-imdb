I was struck by the story. He had the "typical" gay predator male and the "typical" Mormon missionary. But everyone also had friends and relatives who balanced their lives well. There are a number of characters, some nice and others less nice, each with their own personal nuances. And, most reminded me of the people in my life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with several humorous moments and slowly evolves into a moving relationship film. History progresses without obvious turns and never talks to you. Makes you think a little while you wait to see what happens. Even when I thought I could foresee that something was coming, I was surprised by the way it was made. <br /> <br /> Not many films make me laugh knowingly at a true gay dialogue and then bring me a tear when I feel the pain of the characters I watched the movie on DVD and I couldn't stop looking until is not finished. (Usually, I watch a movie in pieces in a couple of days.) It's nice to see a movie with gay characters that is uplifting, but not preaching. I highly recommend this movie! And not just for the gay public. Relationships transcend sexuality.
