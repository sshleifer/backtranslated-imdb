The beautiful film set in Hong Kong in 1962 is about a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Mrs. Chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouses have an affair. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow movement and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, life). The film itself has a reluctance and a propensity that suggests its period of time. It's sexy without showing everything. Even Wong Kar-Wai does not allow the public to see how the bride and groom are, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is also made to look elegant with close-ups of smoke curls. A really lovely movie. Get ready for the finale. <br /> <br />
