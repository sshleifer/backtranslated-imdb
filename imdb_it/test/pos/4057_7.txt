It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a knot in the careers of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro. It's a funny film and a guilty pleasure, but not up to the standards of the actors, especially Robert. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and presents some small roles as boys like William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, silent way, while the other is easier and wants to have more fun than criminals in the back seat. Both are after the same criminals behind a huge caper of televisions, video recorders, etc. Then they cross paths and a television station wants a new reality show to fight crime while they are on TV. Mitch hates advertising while Trey adores him with his joke, "It's Showtime!" Their TV shows and methods are shown on TV and are the new "Cops" show. The fun begins. <br /> <br /> Overall, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good film, but not up to the expectations and standards of the actors. However, he moves as he walks and parodies reality TV shows. A nice break from shows like the cops. Really at the end, just a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My vote: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
