This is one of those films where you have to put aside some of its obvious shortcomings (a result of the date and location of its production) and accentuate the positive. In many ways this is a truly superb film. <br /> <br /> Forgive the parody in the summary of a line, but the most serious flaw for an English speaker like me was the horrible subtitle. The print I saw had Soviet "Film Export" subtitles from 1982, which consistently used inverted grammar, presumably to give the impression of the 13th century speech. The real impact of this nonsense is to make it more difficult to follow the subtitles, which means you spend less time looking at the images. Since the cinematic imagination is the strength of this film, this is a real problem. <br /> <br /> The other IMDB-niks have written a lot about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this film (in case the viewer does not notice them for themselves). They also wrote a lot about the battle on the ice scene, which I think is superb. <br /> <br /> The love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely ..... it is almost totally lacking in charm. But it's nice to shiver from time to time. <br /> <br /> I knew Prokofiev's music for this film long before I saw the film. Images and music complement each other wonderfully. And it is the images that will remain in the mind for a long time. Bergman clearly learned a lot from these images - the images of his medieval pieces (such as The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring) that develop and enhance Eisenstein's ideas. This film was made in 1938 in the USSR. In that context it is a masterpiece, even if imperfect. <br /> <br /> For the modern spectator, I suggest you follow the flow and enjoy the many delicacies on display.
