This miniseries is a reasonable following of the original Gone With the Wind. If one sees it for its merit (and not immediately after the original), it comes out pretty well. I'm sure most viewers will doubt Scarlett and Rhett's performance, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. Many of the characters here are new to this plot, so the comparison in these cases (Rhett's mother, uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one will be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of the entire production is the beautiful scenery of the Charleston spring and Ireland. Just watch it for that. Obviously, this was a high-budget TV mini-series. He follows the book for a while, then he has a totally new storyline when Scarlett goes to Ireland. <br /> <br /> Acting is believable if nothing special - the way I feel about Roger Moore after Sean Connery for James Bond.
