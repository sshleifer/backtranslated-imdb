It is worth the admission price for the only Rock-off !! LOVE this movie (even if it is a bit short) and John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (almost recognizable) cameos show that D rock is hard enough for anyone. Even God ... The sasquatch / mushroom scene will become an instant classic (I don't want to say it anymore and I'm accused of putting up spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a couple of nods to D's first screen appearances in characters like Lee and the open mic host. I just hope they played some of the songs on the first album, and even the omission of "the government sucks" from the POD album is a shame. Apart from that, this movie sucks. Obey the D!
