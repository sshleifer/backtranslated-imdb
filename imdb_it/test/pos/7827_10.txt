When I first saw this show advertised on Australian TV in the late 1990s, I ignored it thinking it was capitalizing on Kevin Costner's film "Bodyguard". But then I took an episode and I wish I had seen it from the beginning. The collaboration between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard has been well interpreted and the structure of each episode has been extremely entertaining. It was not an exaggerated TV show that one can say that he spent most of his energy in blowing things up so he could insert that clip into the commercial to attract the audience and therefore not deliver to any other level. The show deepened the lives of the two main characters and this is what made it interesting. The stories for each episode where even well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors. And obviously there was a lot of action and intrigue that is always good. But what was great was that there was humor, and it flowed naturally from the characters, it didn't seem forced. It was English but in a good way, and if this show had been done in America, it would no doubt be on DVD by now. I don't know why British TV production companies aren't interested in publishing this show on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD version.
