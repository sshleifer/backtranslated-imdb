It is the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990s, a time when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the waves air. The best Saturday morning animation producers were at Warner Brothers Television, which experienced a great golden age with the Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini dream team. Along with serious and obscure series like Batman, they have also revived cartoons and extravagants made famous by the Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with his dark adult humor and celluloid tributes of yesterday and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was equally popular reinventing the Looney Tunes for a new generation, while maintaining that mad cartoon-like violence and clever comedy which can hold any age group, no matter how old. Even when Tiny Toons were stretched for a feature film with How I Spent My Vacation, it didn't seem like a longer episode of the television series, a curse that often plagues other feature adaptations of popular animated shows. /> <br /> The Tiny Toon Gang are young outlaws of classic cartoon characters who made the audience laugh in the 40s and 50s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to "earn their degree in Toon" . Summer vacation has started and every character has their own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) start a shooting with a water gun that eventually leads to Acme Acres which is flooded and they both sail to Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on an off-road trip to the happiest amusement park in the world, but Hamton's family is more difficult than he imagined. Meanwhile, in other stories scattered everywhere, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze, Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) tries to go out for a date with her favorite star Skunk and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the movies with a strong mouth Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> While the premise seems thin for a feature film, the numerous directors and screenwriters make sure that all the stories work well together. The best of these is Plucky's ill-fated road trip, which makes good use of a golden comic opportunity: to feel sorry for someone, while laughing at their situation. Plucky's bored reaction to all the bad things that happen to him is a perfect combination of script and animation, all within the confines of a small pig-filled machine. The story of Elmyra is certainly second only to see how a small, almost innocent girl can cause fear in so many jungle animals. The violence of the aforementioned cartoons certainly comes to the fore with the story of Buster and Babs, which makes us smile not only for the hilarity of the results, but also for the nostalgic, since Ruegger and the company probably wouldn't be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment. Almost half of that segment plays like a parody and a tribute to Deliverance, including an intelligent touch on the dujou banjo scene, with the unforgettable theme song Tiny Toon Adventures. <br /> <br /> Part of the universal appeal of Tiny Toons is that humor proves to be very intelligent as it is aimed at subjects with a ferocity that shows that it does not deserve the title of "baby food" with which people seems to slap him. An entire segment with the scanty Fowlmouth label at the cinema teases the yappers perfectly, along with an additional jab on the Lucasfilm THX logo. That scene is made so perfectly that it should be shown before each film screening. There are also a couple of fun moments at Disney World, movie holes and even the Warner legal department. The fact that today's comics are bland and not creative makes those intelligent moments even more precious because probably there won't be another animated series that will come closer. <br /> <br /> After seeing How spent my vacation for the first time in many years, I can say with certainty that they don't do cartoons like they used to. With the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment receives, one wonders if anything like this will ever be realized again. This review is not only a recommendation of a truly intelligent film, but also an appeal to Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to collaborate once again and bring a magical creation to our minds once again. The Lord knows that twenty-first century children need something with the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. It is not a simple grab of money, it is a wonderful film full of spirit, mad chaos and hilarity.
