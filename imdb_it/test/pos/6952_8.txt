Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian companion, Bangor (cardinal Tantoo) in the area where a large dam is to be built; Noel, however, is not willing to give up his land, and will have to fight the dam company to prevent the County from being destroyed. <br /> <br /> "Where the rivers flow to the north" is a compelling and contemplative story based on the memorable performances of Rip Torn (recently seen in the small but juicy role of Louis XV in the underrated "Marie Antoinette" by Sofia Coppola) and in Cardinal Tantoo ("Balla coi lupi", "Segnali di fumo"). Director Jay Craven (who also co-wrote the script with Don Bredes, based on the novel by Howard Frank Mosher) and filmmaker Paul Ryan made this powerful story with unique and contemplative rhythms / images, which remind me of the best moments of Terrence Malick and John Huston. It is an independent period piece that is underestimated of the first half (electric) of the 90s, usually considered as the rise of Quentin Tarantino's burlesque ("Pulp Fiction" is a masterpiece, but man suffers from Orson Welles syndrome) , disquieting of Todd Solondz's suburbs, the dark vision of Danny Boyle in the UK (let's not talk about the movie "Beach" with DiCaprio, though) ... Jay Craven should be more considered on the lists of great indie directors. He has led a respectful and discreet career and it is always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his. <br /> <br /> My vote: 8/10.
