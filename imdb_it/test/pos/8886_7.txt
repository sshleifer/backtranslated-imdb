Inspired by the concept of STRANGERS ON A TRAIN by Hitchcock that talks about two men exchanging murders in exchange for getting rid of the two people who mess up their lives, THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN is an original and very inventive comedy. It's a credit to Danny DeVito who wrote and performed this little gem of comedy. <br /> <br /> ANNE RAMSEY is the mother who inspires the title of the film and it is understandable why she is put under the skin of DANNY DeVITO with her sharp tongue and relentlessly putting him down for any minor infraction. BILLY CRYSTAL is the writer whose wife stole his idea of ​​a book and who is now the lion of a great new author, even though he appears at the Oprah show basking in a flattery that he should enjoy. Thus, DeVito has the idea of ​​exchanging murders to get rid of these disturbing factors. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything and anything can happen when the writer Carl Reiner lets his imagination wander with endless ideas about how the plot develops. And it's fun to the hilt, offering lots of laughs and laughter along the way, as well as a good dose of suspense. <br /> <br /> For devotees of black comedy, this is guaranteed to please.
