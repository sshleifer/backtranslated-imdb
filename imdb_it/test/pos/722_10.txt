I watched this movie without knowing anything about it. I assumed it was a science fiction film of some kind. How wrong I was. The plot is compelling and intelligent, the cast is all charismatic and the whole movie just makes you think about changing. Some of the riddles completely blocked me but in the end the answers were pretty simple. I'm rather baffled by the low score of this film, because I thought it was quite unusual. If you enjoyed the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you'll like it. There are no great special effects or fanciful jokes here. It's all based on plot, character building and creating an atmosphere. It is a film that in the end does not provide answers that can arouse people, but I thought the ending was great. I'm still not sure if the film is based on a true story or not .......
