I have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and moving film. I think that the effort of the director / writer of the film is courageous and stimulating. I love this film not only for the fantastic story (which had to be told), but also for the way the actors made the story. This is not another superficial "gay film" that describes stereotyped characters in humorous situations. This was a memorable and impeccable effort to show people that love knows no bounds and that love is still beautiful and wonderful as always. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart was the ability to relate to the emotion portrayed in this film surrounding the release of one of the main characters. We must all go through similar situations that live in the society in which we live and experience that feeling of detachment from everything that is "right" and "normal". I give my heartfelt praise for this fabulous and courageous story.
