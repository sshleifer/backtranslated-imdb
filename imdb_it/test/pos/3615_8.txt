At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed by the way Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he too really likes the film for his music, the story and the way the story unfolded, slowly showing how Corelli won the hearts of the girls. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon it grew on you. The plot twists were intriguing especially relations with the Germans. I'd like to see it again to follow all the side plots. I also want to buy the soundtrack to listen to the music again.
