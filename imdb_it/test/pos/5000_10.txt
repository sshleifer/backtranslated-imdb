And what is its kind? The backstage shows the story; how is theatrical life behind those Broadway (and other) curtains. It certainly has a lot of competition: Singin 'in the Rain both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (Your name is the year.); Dame of 1934; Noises Off (1992) on the farcical side and A Star is Born I and II from the 1930s and 1950s on the tragic side: not to mention Summer Stock of 1950: the list continues to flow. So what makes this movie so special? And why are there so few comments on this extraordinarily beautiful film? Are there so few people who have seen it? How wonderful to see a young Frank Langella pre-Dracula and pre-Frost-Nixon 30 years old! How wonderful to see the fresh and talented Tom Hulce so pre-Amadeus! And yet another magnificent Stiller! What a wonderful array of talented people at their best for a long time! And such a script! Who was this David Shaber? So full of disillusionment and realistic pathos compared to the usual sentimentalism and sentimental comedy! As exemplified in particular by the episode Star-Is-Born in which the heroine reaches Broadway while the character of Langella must settle for another provincial tour. <br /> <br /> The subsequent hysterical and sadistic insult to Langella against the star- The Latin teacher and her granddaughter in whom she unleashes her fury and her frustration is just one of the many fantastic and psychologically real moments of the film. (The Latin teacher and his love story with life behind the scenes certainly echoes Marlene Dietrich and her seduced professor in The Blue Angel of 1929.) Another in the series of mercenary agents and cold-hearted like Kevin McCarthy who was preceded by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet Smell of Success (1957) and successes by Alan Alda in Clubland (2001) in the history of cinema. The sexual release of the character of Hulce recalls similar episodes in O'Neill's great comedy, Ah, Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And as a tribute to the missing operettas of long ago: The Red Mill by Victor Herbert; Rose Marie and The Vagabond King by Rudolf Friml; The desert song by Sigmund Romberg etc. What satirical insertions of excerpts from great works like Romeo and Juliet. Tributes to the theater itself as driven by the star Langella. The richness and depth of this film are simply endless. And to be saddled by such a title! Who could have a vague idea of ​​what this great film is from such a ridiculous and unbearable title? But on the other hand, what title could be applied to such a magnificent drama that it could have lived up to its exciting emotional content? <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw (2009) Frank Langella in his last spectacular acting film: as Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor after 30 years simply passes from triumph to triumph!
