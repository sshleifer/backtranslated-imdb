I just saw him at the Toronto International Film Festival. The impressive cast of director Neal Slavin includes William Macy (seen in The Contender at last year's TIFF), Meat Loaf (AKA Meat Loaf Aday, AKA Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also starring in Novocaine, also this year Festival). Based on the Arthur Miller novel of the same name, Focus follows Christian but "Jewish-looking" Lawrence Newman (Macy) as he struggles between hatred and anti-Semitism in his neighborhood. Poised between the Jewish shopkeeper at the end of the street (Paymer) and his anti-Semitic neighbor (Meat Loaf), Newman, he finds it difficult to deal with the inner conflict and the conflict around him. The sense of guilt for knowing what is right, but doing nothing fights with the desire to blend in and keep peace with the neighbors. Things get more complex when he meets and marries Gertrude (Dern) that everyone thinks is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband some things about how to judge books from the covers. <br /> <br /> Will Newman stop for the Jew at the end or will he run away? Go see it to find out. <br /> <br /> The acting was fabulous. The writing was incredible. The cinematography was excellent. The sound was well done. Technically fantastic, the film was disturbing. Chilling. Emotionally intense. I found myself bringing the knees into a fetal position a couple of times. I have great admiration for all those who worked on it. I haven't seen such a beautiful film in a long time. He touched me. <br /> <br /> Wow.
