Thursday is clearly derived from the "new wave" of detective movies released since Quentin Tarantino conquered the genre with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but he already has enough ideas to make sure that it remains a small interesting film. Thursday uses some characters mostly in one location. It works because each character is bizarre enough to be memorable, and when put together what you have is a very funny little thriller. There is little substance in the plot, but it doesn't matter, because nobody enters this type of film waiting for an experience of affirming life. The plot follows Casey; a former drug dealer who went straight and now lives as a successful architect in the suburbs with his wife. The couple wants to adopt a child, but things go wrong when Casey receives a visit from his old crime buddy, Nick, who brought with him a case of heroin and a lot of money stolen from the police. Thursday will prove to be a very interesting day for our former criminal ... <br /> <br /> The first scene defines the film pretty well and ensures that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover when a policeman enters for refreshments. The scene is imbued with dark humor and witty dialogues, and continues throughout the rest of the film. Thursday is a very funny film, and scenes like the ones that see the visitor of the adoption appear at an awkward moment ensure that the film is hard to appreciate. It is true that the film brings nothing new to the table, neither cinematically nor at plot level, but the fact that it is happy to bask in its derision ensures that there is more time for the absurd situation of building around the central characters. The acting is pretty decent, with the whole cast clearly having fun with this plot. Thomas Jane holds the film together in the lead role, while the funny portraits of James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke nicely support it. It is unlikely that this film will impress the movie fan, but if you just want a funny movie with some twists and fun shows; Thursday is likely to be sufficient.
