I saw this movie for the first time when I was in eighth grade and I remember it had a profound impact on me back then. I saw again about a year ago (now I am 29) and it still touched me in a similar way. This is a great film that personifies the struggle against the "principle against pragmatism". The character of Voight is the idealistic teacher who will not surrender to any psycho-racist inclination of the superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle over how older people often resist change and, more specifically, cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally come to a boil, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphant. Or does it? The children who must go are better off to know him, more exposed to the "real" world and classical music. The other teacher at the school earned respect for him and learned a lot about himself. A great film with a heart-breaking ending. I recommend everyone who has enjoyed the film to read Pat Conroy's book "The Water is Wide". Will stay with you!
