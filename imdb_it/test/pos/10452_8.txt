This is one of the best and most voted films for teenagers ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw it grow and it was one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "Fast Times", but it's just great. <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this film, as mentioned by other reviewers that begins as a comedy and turns into a midway drama. This is its beauty and what sets it apart. You understand everything. Humor (not unlike "Fast Times"), Drama and a GREAT GREAT soundtrack. I personally think that every child who is about to enter high school should see it, it would give an idea of ​​the journey they are about to embark on. Cmon-what is this child looking at, wouldn't it be able to relate to SOMEONE in the movie? The fact that you become so serious halfway is also beautiful and simply well done. You don't even see it coming. Surely many surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: DO NOT READ NEARLY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> Great, humor slappping (who could forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear him: "Oh my big strong burrito !!" Priceless !! <br /> <br /> Some scenes between Gary and Karin are difficult to watch (especially the final scene of rude). There are MANY MANY women like Karen out there who would have made exactly the same choice she made. Think about it: how many women reject men with gold hearts (like Gary) for the cretins? I know I did, and so I have many women I know. This film will inspire discussion and, despite the countless times I've seen it, it still leaves me full of admiration for filmmakers and artists. Everyone will find someone to relate to in this film or, probably, more than one person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music used is simply fantastic (lots of Cars, u2, many obscure songs (now) from the 80s - a dream of the 80s purists. <br /> <br / > But don't make mistakes, it's not the music that makes this film unique, it's the story itself, simple and simple, one of the best of its kind and a classic movie for teenagers.
