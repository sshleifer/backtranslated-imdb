People who know me say I have a weakness for animated films. <br /> <br /> To be honest, those people are right-handed. My real weakness is for exceptionally well-made animated films, like this vintage family movie by Max and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You could think of yourself, "well if it's so beautiful, why didn't I hear about it?" Right question This film was released the same week as the attacks on Pearl Harbor. The inevitably wrong timing has precipitated the film into relative darkness. Things are looking for though, because it was finally released on DVD with the title "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's funny that the film went through all of this, because it reflects the real storyline. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), I personally think that the main idea of ​​the film is perseverance through hardship and hard times (after all, the country had just come out of the Depression at the time ) <br /> <br /> Our horseman hero, Hoppity, desperately wants to help his endangered community. Problem: every time you try, either through the bad will of others or through simple bad luck, it fails miserably ... and slowly begins to gain the contempt of the people you are trying to save. Even if he does his best to maintain a positive vision, he breaks from time to time and it is only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights good fighting. Just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done, no one is truly self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "Ok", you're saying. "Do you have a good message (actually two). Does it really EXCEPTIONALLY WELL?" <br /> <br /> My Answer: Partially. <br /> <br /> It's not just the message that makes this film special. It is the characterization. This is one of those movies where you can simply see the personality of each cast member in their animation. You almost don't even need the lines spoken. A good way to summarize everything is "energetic" or "lively". Many films have used the point of sale, "amiable cast of characters". Every time I hear that sentence, it always makes me think of this movie. <br /> <br /> Case in point, the bad guys: Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Many movies have "lovable" villains, but I don't think you'll find funny or endearing ones like these. Forget the 3 Stooges comic strip from the 1960s. Swat and Smack are the closest thing to an animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry) that you will never find. Virtually all the funniest moments involve this macabre couple in some way. Yes, I'm rotten no-goodniks, but you still care about them. This is the kind of power you see from a really talented writer, director and crew. <br /> <br /> The film has two short lines that revolve around racial stereotypes (Native American and Chinese). I don't think they were meant to be mischievous; but they are there, regardless. They didn't bother me, but it would have been unfair of me not to warn someone who would potentially be bothered by them. <br /> <br /> So if you share my weakness (and I think you do), give it a chance.
