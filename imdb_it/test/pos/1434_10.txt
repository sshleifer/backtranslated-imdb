Having just stepped out of a drug rehab program for six months and having served his time to distribute cards in illegal card games, Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) has high hopes of being clean and finding new life as drummer of the big band. However, upon his return to his old crime-ridden Chicago neighborhood, he soon finds the growing pressure from those around him, including his wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker), to return to the old lifestyle of the "Dealer" he earned he left on the path of self-destruction which is a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a film has so many great performances of characters like this. Frank Sinatra is as superb as Frankie Machine and realistically portrays the symptoms of an addict going through the retreat probably better than anyone else has ever been done before him. Sinatra seems to possess a keen understanding and awareness of his character here and expresses the constant battle for control over his life that takes place forever in the heart of the man who is Frankie Machine. Parker like his lame Zosch wants to own Frankie forever, to make him "treat" him to make money to take care of her and pay for his ever increasing medical expenses. He looks terrified of everything he sees as a threat to his control over him, like the freedom that a drummer's life could offer, or anything that could change the status quo between them. <br /> <br /> Onlooker Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to have real, strong genuine feelings for Frankie, having no desire to control it but only to help him try the best thing that Frankie has in store for him in the world if he can stand up long enough to wake you up and make it happen. Darren McGavin as the peddler of heroin drugs, Louie, is always there just waiting behind the scenes knowing only the right buttons to push, just the thing to say, to get a former addict back to that old habit, a profitable for Louie but deadly for the addict. <br /> <br /> Even the setting seems to take on a life of its own, constantly dark, gritty, squalid and full of crimes, with nothing close enough to positive things to expect in life, a place where it is all too easy to escape through a bottle or a drug, a quick "correction" that is not a correction at all, but works only to keep one in the dark away from daylight and all the brilliant prospects that the world may have to offer. It's a nice touch that when Frankie is on the right track, the setting always seems brighter than when he starts on the wrong path. While some argue that it is a bit dated, to me this is a brave film that shows a realistic inner war within a man for control over his own destiny, one characterized by the performance of very strong characters by all subjects involved. Having said that, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM gets my highest recommendation possible.
