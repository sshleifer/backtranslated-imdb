We open in a doctors' room of some kind. A girl is escorted to a place in front of the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the obvious traumatized atmosphere of the girls. <br /> <br /> The story is about two girls who were brought home after spending some time in a mental home after an "accident" happened before. They are greeted upon arrival by their trying-too-difficult-to-good-but-so-totally-evil stepmother, to whom the girls obviously hate. Over time at home, the bad stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. And to top it all off, there's a vengeful ghost that's far from helping the recovery of the girls ... <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. It has twists, turns and certainly leaves you much to think about without making any sense. The relationship between the two girls is so moving, it almost makes you cry in some places (I know I had a tearful moment of two, in particular "the closet scene"). But what I love most about this film is the total feeling of terror until the end of the credits. The soundtrack is impeccable, the furnishings at home and the use of color are fantastic. A pure joy for the eyes. This is absolutely not to be missed for all Asian film fanatics. OR ANY movie fan! An easy 10/10.
