Some people go through life, moving from one thing to another without blinking; others attach themselves to a cause, to another person or to a principle and remain immovable, committed to whatever it is - and, figuratively or literally, they give their word and respect it. But we're all different, "Made of different clay," as one of the characters in this movie says, which makes life so interesting. Some people are simply crazy, though ... and maybe that's how you have to be to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to do things ... life: work? Writer / director Lisa Krueger tries, using a light approach to examine the fine line between commitment and the way she "commits" herself - in "Busy", played by Heather Graham as a young woman he is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe even a little crazy. His name is Joline, and this is his story. <br /> <br /> Of course, Joline has always been a busy person; in work, in relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of speech who sticks to it, whatever happens. And when he marries Carl (Luke Wilson), he is forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl - and 597 days in the marriage, he left; to "find" himself and understand everything. When Joline realizes she won't come back, she refuses to give in to him or their marriage. Perhaps it is because of that clay of which it is made. Regardless, he leaves their home in New York City and leaves to find it, which he does - in El Paso, Texas, of all places. But once he knows where he is, he keeps his distance, giving him his "space" and without even letting him know that she is there. Consider Carl as a "spiritual coma" and it is his job to maintain a "spiritual vigil" over him until he regains his senses. And while he looks and waits, his life is anything but boring, when he meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress in one of the local restaurants; Carmen's `Grampy, '(Alfonso Arau), which is something mystical; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has problems with Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who does pinate and takes a fantasy. For Joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but also about herself. <br /> <br /> There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this eccentric film that is more about characterization and character than the plot. And Krueger presents everything very well, offering an engaging and fun movie. His characters are very real people, with all the desires, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic group through which he tells his story. We see it from Joline's point of view, given that Krueger makes us aware of Joline's thoughts and therefore of his motivations, which put a strong perspective on the events as they unfold. This, along with the deliberate rhythm that sets you up to absorb the atmosphere and the atmosphere it creates, makes it a very effective piece of storytelling. There is a fundamental seriousness to this subject, but Krueger chooses to avoid something heavy or too deep and instead focuses on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters. And the result is a well-structured, affectionate and optimistic aspect of what we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham takes over this role right from the first frame of the film to make Joline a totally creative character. He immerses himself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and credible, adding the small traits and personal nuances that make the difference between a portrait that is a simple representation of a person, and one that is real. And to make this movie work, it was essential that Joline be feasible and credible ... and Graham is successful on all fronts. His presence on the screen has never been more fascinating, and his vibrant personality or even the way he uses his eyes is enough to attract you completely. it's all part of the character he creates; there is an appeal to Joline who exudes from her entire face, from those inside and out. He is a nice and pleasant person, and since you shared his most intimate thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job all around, starting with the way the character was written, the way Graham brings it to life so vividly. <br /> <br /> Like Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is totally addictive. His performance is very natural and direct, and he uses his instincts to effectively create his character. It has a charismatic presence, but is less than blazing, and gives it an appearance that is attractive with its feet on the ground. She is pleasantly open and early; you have the impression that Carmen is not able to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that too is part of her charm. And, as with Joline, this character is well written and Velazquez carries it convincingly. <br /> <br /> Overall, there are a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (like Joline's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and in particular Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who manages to create a memorable character with very little time on the screen. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl Editor) and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist). A film that says something about the value of taking a step back to consider The Big Picture - reflecting on who we are, where we are going and what we really need - "Committed" is a pleasant experience; a tour definitely to be taken. 8/10.
