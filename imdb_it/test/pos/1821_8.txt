I really enjoyed this film, it reminds me of my high school days. The soundtrack is fantastic. I'm a big fan of the niche and this is my favorite movie in which it is located. I love the plot, it's a total love story, against the kind of strange things. I think anyone who graduated in the early 1980s (1980-1984) should see the film. I was completely reminded of high school.
