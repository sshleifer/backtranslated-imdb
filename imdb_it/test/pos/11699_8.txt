Considering Mick Molloy's terrible résumé since I went out alone, I had pretty low expectations on Crackerjack. Also the promotional posters for the film made me nervous. In fact, if it hadn't been for the fact of having received free tickets for the preview, I would have resisted the pressure of the lady (who thinks that Mick is a piece - there is a concern) to pay for it. <Br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the film made me worry - it starts with one of Micks' routines tired of "getting angry about petty things", but this was given a clean touch, which at least made a little 'refreshing. The rest of the script was pretty good, and very light - even the typical humor of Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) was delivered well and while I never had to recover from the corridors, it generated much more laughter than I was expecting (and it was coherent). <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the plot - quite predictable, but it has moved quickly between beats and jokes - I have never felt nourished by any element too long or too short; Mick must have worked hard to polish his script. There were one or two "Late Show" jokes and one or two jokes that only the melbourne could have achieved - but certainly there are a lot of general things for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Something that I found disappointing was the relative inconsistency of John Clarke - it just didn't seem to work like the bad guy, but that doesn't detract too much from the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this Australain comedy, and was pleasantly amused throughout the film. I left the cinema with a discreet smile - a rather difficult thing to do in my books for an Australian comedy. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
