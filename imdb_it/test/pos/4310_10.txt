A unique blend of musicals, film-noir and comedy - with some sex scenes staged to a good extent. The only other film that I can think of with a mix of themes and clichés quite similar and wild is the French film Billy Ze Kick - but that has a more surreal and bizarre approach. <br /> <br /> Not that this film would not be surreal or bizarre. Humor is sometimes quite subtle, sometimes brazen in the face - and often crossing the border to offensive. To give an example: in the post-coitus chat with a prostitute our hero Max Müller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder, using the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this phrase means "Shoot!" in German, and this is exactly what a hidden killer does in response. In other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a play on words. <br /> <br /> Müllers Büro is also one of the very rare examples of movies with fun sex scenes. Larry's love story is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehr" (I want more) - while the song is perfectly at the base of the action, the meaning of his words changes a couple of times, alluding to the end of the incapacity of Larry to provide any further services. The main love scene in the film between Max Müller and Bettina Kant lacks such subtlety - this is a mind-boggling thing, especially when Bettina's song slowly breaks into the lament, obviously all in the rhythm of the music. <br /> <br /> inevitable, unless you are one of the most easily offended.
