The scope of the Stalingrad tragedy is concise in the final note of the film: "In the battle of Stalingrad, more than one million people were killed in action, frozen to death or starving: Russians, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Germans, Austrians Of the 260,000 men surrounded by the sixth army, 91.00o were taken prisoner, of which only 6,000 returned home, years later. <br /> <br /> What the story does not tell was that Fieldmarshall Paulus, who surrendered, did not he shared all the privations of his men's imprisonment: he had special treatment as the highest-ranking prisoner taken by the Soviet army when, during his presence at the Nuremberg trials, he was asked about the fate of 91,000 prisoners, he declared that they were fine , was released after the war and died in East Germany. <br /> <br /> The film presents only the first part of the tragedy, the real battle of Stalingrad, for a whole picture, the fate of the 91,000 prison should not be forgotten either.
