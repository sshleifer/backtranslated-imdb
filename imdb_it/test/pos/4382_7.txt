After seeing Fargo "highly acclaimed" and thinking it was nothing more than average, I was wandering if it was a good idea to rent another Coen masterpiece. This time I was much less disappointed with Fargo and I have to say that most of the credit goes to the good lines and good acting of George Clooney. Well done, Mr. Clooney, you produce more of these and less "Perfect Stormish" films. You can act and you showed it here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
