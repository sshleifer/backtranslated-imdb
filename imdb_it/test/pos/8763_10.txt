It is difficult to put into words the devastating beauty of Traffik, partly because I am still trying to understand it myself, many hours after my second vision. First of all, it must be said that Traffik contains some of the most unparalleled and unforgettable scenes I've seen in a movie or a television production. The acting is excellent, in particular that of Bill Paterson in the role of a British minister struggling with his drug addict daughter and an aid agreement in Pakistan that depends on drug-related issues. Another plot line describes these ground-level drug problems in Pakistan, and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main plot concerns the prosecution of a drug importer in Hamburg and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two German detectives while he is on trial. It is a profound result that the interaction between these stories feels natural, transcending the plot of forced plot that is often found in Hollywood movies. It is an even greater result than a work distributed over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so concentrated and engaging, without having to oversimplify. It is devastating, desolate and brutal, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare film that deals with challenging themes with unmatched compassion and clarity.
