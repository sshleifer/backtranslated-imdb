I would probably say that he was on a par with films like "Devil's Rain" and that kind of movie, although it's probably a little better. I love the horror of the 70s and this has most of the elements that make up other films that I like, so it was pretty easy to enjoy them. A family on vacation stumbles into a small town where people seem to be taken by a sort of hysteria. The children seem to be disappearing. After a first attempt to escape from this place, the family is somehow stopped at the edge of the city and finds the way back, but not without first finding a house where the children have gone and their mother and father have died. It seems that we have a different kind of turning point in a center for the elderly in this city, they are all worshipers of Satan and need the boys to renew their lives in order to continue to carry out their service, I imagine. Not that anyone seems too keen to give up their children for this venture. This is quite classy considering that it is scary and disturbing without buckets of blood or the sound events that try to blow people up in today's movies, which seem to have replaced the current fears. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) of "Green Acres" as Tobey, the deputy of the sheriff who reads the magazines UFO, and LQ Jones as the sheriff, and a very familiar character as the father of the blocked family. And Strother Martin plays the doctor who seems to do the double duty without the knowledge of his fellow citizens. This is good stuff but sometimes a bit confusing, but on the whole it works quite well and is recommended for fans of the horror of the 70s. 8 out of 10.
