Haha, what a great little movie! Wayne Crawford strikes again, or rather this was his first major strike, a small, deliriously manic ballpark of manic kitsch disguised as a psychopathic film. It's actually a brilliant ** satire on post-hippie American culture in the flyover country, even though the film was actually shot independently in Miami. Challenge any type of convention or studio-oriented plot that I can think of: AUNT MARTHA, ABOUT A DREADFUL THREADFUL, may not be a very technical film, but it's a small slice of Americana, made cheap by people who were honest, ambitious, imaginative and with steel balls. It took courage, courage and cunning to make this film, which seems to have stood the test of time. This film is fresh, vital, alive, unforgettable and deliciously strange enough to recommend to all those who have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I pulled up last year during a time when I was fascinated by "star" Wayne Crawford (advertised here under his pseudonym Scott Lawrence), a master of what can only be called film Regional making, usually of variety B. He is a writer, producer, director and actor all in one, probably best known for his favorite 80s apocalyptic teenager, NIGHT OF THE COMET. Here he plays Stanley, the pants that wear half of a couple of really wonderful characters, apparently homosexual contemptuous murderers on the run after knocking down an old lady in Baltimore for her jewelry. The naked screen legend, Abe Zwick, is completely convincing as Paul, who poses as Martha's aunt of Stanley, the way of putting on the role of the athlete who convinced Stanley to think he had committed a murder to secure his loyalty. Martha looks as feminine as the sailors of the SOUTH PACIFIC support choir in their coconut bikini tops, yet somehow no one seems to notice - or worry? - that she is a he, has no visible means of gain, seems to spend all day worrying about where Stanley is, and runs around the neighborhood in his bathrobe with a butcher knife. Only in America ... <br /> <br /> As the film opens, the two have just arrived in Florida and settle in what looks like the old home of Ward Cleaver, a well-lit and designed TV house which is so cliche as to be surreal. During a memorable scene Martha and an unwelcome guest sit on the couch, talk about problems and drink Budweiser cans in what is one of the most fascinating and subversely ordinary sequences I've ever seen outside of a John Waters movie. Then there is Stanley, still in trouble since he is a broom with a broomstick with an STP patch on the vest that drives a psychedelic painted van that is as thin as the Batmobile, drinks his milk straight from the cardboard, snorts drugs with bimbos blonde bombshell and put the donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. Opposites attract, I imagine. <br /> <br /> But Stanley also has something he doesn't like when young women stone themselves to try to take off their trousers, and it always seems to be up to Aunt Martha to get him out of trouble that inevitably turns out . The bodies pile up, a nosy nosy scolding them using their house as a flop, Stanley's birthday cake is crushed, and everyone meets at the local pizzeria before heading to the wooden canopy in the back for a hookah party hash where the girls dance in their underwear. Things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a little too friendly with Martha, who naturally prefers to keep people at arm's length when they are invited abruptly for a nice chat. And this is a woman who carries not only a butcher knife, but a charged briefcase 38 in the slip. Eventually the strange duo finds itself stuck with a body, a child and nowhere to go and will end up taking refuge in an abandoned film studio where no doubt the technical crew borrowed the equipment used to make the film. I just hope they kindly asked permission first and cleaned up themselves. <br /> <br /> A word obviously must be said about the relationship between Stanley and Martha / Paul, since to dance around the fact that the two are at least suggested to be a homosexual couple would be to lose the primary essence of the plot. We never see two of them becoming intimate, and even though Stanley mockingly refers to being "stuck" in a scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. Certainly it is not a "gay" film, with an abundant female nudity and an air of 70s misogyny that cannot be denied either. Stanley and Paul never consume their implicit sexuality on the screen, although surely the film would have had the courage to do so if it was important. It is not, the story is not about their sex, it is about the bond they share and how strange it is. I'm not gay, but it's the distinguished people that they are, which are two of the strangest cinematographic creations that have ever lived on my TV. <br /> <br /> The film is unique. It was only made for a few thousand dollars on what looked like borrowed studio sets, occasional work on the spot, and a couple of public places where they could infiltrate a TV crew when no one was watching. The dialogue is completely bizarre, banal and deliciously esoteric. It's a film that will surprise you, not everyone will like it, but for those who have a taste for low-budget horror / thriller films like THE NIGHT DIO SCREAMED, HELP ME! THEY ARE OWNED, BLOOD AND LACE, AND CHILDREN MUST NOT PLAY WITH DEATH THINGS, you have a winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: I would usually say something like "It deserves a DVD restoration" but somehow I think doing it would ruin the sticky atmosphere of the movie. And Wayne Crawford, you, sir, reign.
