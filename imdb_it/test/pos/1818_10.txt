20 years later and this film still has echoes of its greatness floating around. Never has a film surpassed the incredible soundtrack of Valley Girl. The film completely encapsulated the 80s in such a perfect degree that it could only be realized many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A film that has so much character in it, that makes you realize how sad Hollywood has become (in terms of quality). The special edition DVD is full of extras and it's worth buying it because you'll have a lot of material to sift. For sure.
