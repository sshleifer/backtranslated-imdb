Great book, great movie, excellent soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this film that when he wanted to put his efforts, he could act. The ending is a bit schmaltzy, but for the moment it is understandable that the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphic nature of heroin addiction (innovative for the period) is an advantage. Add the terrific soundtrack and you have one of the great American movies.
