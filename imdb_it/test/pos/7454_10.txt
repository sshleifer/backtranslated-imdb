"Duckman" is a great show. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 and after school I rushed home and turned on Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Duckman" and I loved it !! It's a fun and interesting show. It was created by Klasky-Csupo, who are great cartoons creators. They animated some of my favorite programs ever, like "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats". <br /> <br /> I have seen many episodes of this show and I think they are all very funny and sweet. The voice actors have done a great job giving voice to the characters too. <br /> <br /> I wish Comedy Central could bring this show back, along with "The Critic" and "Dilbert". <br /> <br /> But this is a great Comedy Central show. Great job, Klasky-Csupo!
