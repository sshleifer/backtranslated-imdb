Never ever have I been impressed by a film like this little piece out of four groups of people, which faces a crisis, or many. In some ways a bit like Short Cuts, but totally different at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of main characters, who we all learn to know very well while their stories develop, and they are, how people show their positive and negative sides, their weaknesses and their strengths , with lots of drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> The closest equivalent in an American film, I can think, which is much weaker in all respects, is the Royal Tenenbaum. <br /> <br /> Four Shades of Brown, as the title would be in English, tells the story of a stressed hotelier and his wife and elderly parents (who are traveling magicians); on the animal crematorium attendant and his family mishaps; on the members of a cooking class (who speak above all of their displeased lives) and fourthly on the funeral of a feminine trotterino jockey, who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond, singing and appearing in 3D during the funeral, thanks to high-tech equipment that cost his entire fortune (the family becomes nothing, not even the famous horse is given to the family)! <br /> <br /> There is a warmth and compassion in this film, which is full of pain and laughter, which I have never experienced before. <br /> <br /> Many actors were new to me, except Robert Gustafsson and one or two, but they all deserve the great slam that the film took to the Swedish Guldbagge extravaganza (= the Swedish "Oscars") a week does! <br /> <br /> The awards of the male, female and male actor went to this film, plus some others, to boot! <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, go and see it - the hours fluctuate quickly!
