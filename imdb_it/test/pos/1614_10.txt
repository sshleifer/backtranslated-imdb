I saw "Death in Venice" 1971 for the first time about 15 years ago, I found it deeply moving and I often thought about it. Looking at it again a few days ago, I realized that it is near the top of the great works of cinema. With very little dialogue he fascinates a spectator with the beautiful cinematography, the fine acting and, above all, the music of Mahler without which the film simply could not exist. <br /> <br /> "Death in Venice" is a fairy tale The adaptation by Luchino Visconti of Thomas Mann's novel about a famous composer (in the novel he was a writer, but that made him a composer in a film was a great idea that works admirably) Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely based on Gustav Mahler) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. His quest for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere, never trying to approach him. The boy, Tadzio, belonged to very rare creatures who possess an enigmatic and inconceivable power that fascinates you, enchants you, conquers you and makes you a prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of Tadzio's spellcasters. He became dependent on him; he fell in love with him. Was he blessed or cursed for him? I think both. He died for the unattainable, impossible yet beautiful love that perfection itself was. The last image captured by Ashenbach's eyes was that of the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and the golden light of the sun. Nothing could be compared to the beauty and charm of the scene and bringing it with you to the grave is the death that you can only dream of. If he could, probably Ashenbach would have said: "I was able to witness one of the faces of perfection, I could not bear it, but I was chosen to learn that it exists here, in this world and I can die in peace now because it happened to me . "<br /> <br /> Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's haunting short of his Fifth Symphony turned out to be perfect for a perfect movie. It reflects all the emotions of a main character - sobs, yearns, asks for hope and summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to meet beauty you are doomed to die. I could come up with hundreds of movies that use classical music to perfection, but nothing can ever compare to "Death in Venice". I would dare to say that Mahler's music is his main character - he would change and play differently depending on what was happening on the screen. It seemed triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice, what he thought would be his happiness but turned into his death. He looked bleak when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can feel many different feelings in it - tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-loathing, adoration and melancholy, but always - LOVE that gives the purest happiness and breaks hearts (literally). The film for a spectator is similar to what the boy was for the composer / writer / artist in old age. We are enchanted and fascinated by his power and beauty as much as Achenbach was by the boy's mysterious charm.
