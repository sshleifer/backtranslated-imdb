Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation film to arrive, but it is certainly one of the best. It is a key film in the genre Black Exploitation in which it caused a dramatic shift between the previous films, in contrast to the films that followed it. It wasn't necessarily a moving or moving film about black culture and its struggle to overcome issues like racism or something so important, but it was the story of a bad guy who fought "whitey" with his kung-fu army mom. It was a guilty pleasure, very fun and best to watch it with friends. (10 of 10)
