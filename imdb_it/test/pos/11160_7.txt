It is not difficult to imagine what the main problem is for a screenwriter who wants to have 18 characters equally well written with about the same amount of time on the screen in a film that lasts about 90 minutes. It's almost impossible not to resort to stereotypes and this is also what the writer and director Ralf Westhoff does here. Very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and I know in real life, many of them are characterized by only two or three attributes and remain vague. I am aware of this, but I still think that "Shoppen" is successful, that is, that it does what it wants. It is a film with well-written dialogue, extremely good acting and a film that made me laugh very often. I don't think this film wants to do an in-depth analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be a moral commentary on dating speed. It's a film about something that exists and the people and their motivation to use it. Fun and fun.
