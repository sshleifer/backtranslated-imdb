Rosie Perez is the protagonist in this very compelling relationship, playing the role of Mercedes, a young woman from Brooklyn who decided to become a film actress even if not favored by her circumstances, living in East Los Angeles and struggling with a series of auditions fruitless for any kind of part. Mercedes is engaged to a married and washed actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who once performed in a Western television series during the 70s, and rarely since then, accepting him as his lover, partly from loneliness , and also from the hope that the parts of the cinema can make their way because of its "contacts", but the latter are of little importance, since Harry is simply self-delirious in his attempts to recover what he perceives as a cinematographic fame passed. To keep herself adequately financially, Mercedes works as a taxi dancer in a downtown Los Angeles dance hall / bar, at Skid Row, while continuing to pursue her efforts to succeed in film affairs, and is right there at the palace of dance that a young immigrant from Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with and the biggest part of the narrative describes his efforts to please the object of his affections, even if it could mean losing everything. This melodrama, fundamentally rooted in tradition, has a moderate budget, despite the presence of a good number of famous players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci, and was held in tin for about a year before its rather bleak the distribution and marketing efforts of lead on its behalf, the more piety is as its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by the admirably controlled direction of Alexandre Rockwell, a coherent virtue of his work, and in this film showcased by his opening scene, frames that form a montage behind the end credits, with Perez at the Fifth and Main Streets of Skid Row. Rockwell has often shown to work very closely with his cast, and this is true in this case as it allows his actors to create their roles while any advertisement is well refined through the editing process, resulting in an artistic success for the director, despite the negative comments of some traditional evaluators. The score of the film is aesthetically apt, with the contribution of Tito Larriva, who is also the head of the band for taxi dancers. The acting honors here must go to the ever-vital Perez, even if subtitling is not possible. A good test for the quality of each film is given when a spectator looks at it twice in a short period. Sitting through this undervalued job will be considered an acute pleasure for many.
