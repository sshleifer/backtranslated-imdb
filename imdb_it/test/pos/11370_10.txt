I saw this mini series when I was in high school. I remember it absolutely brilliant and compelling. At the time, I didn't know any of the British actors in the series, but since then I've learned that some of today's stars have performed, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many other roles), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare" in Love "among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for creating" Upstairs "and also in many acting roles.) Like the other commentator, I'd like to see him again. the production will remain timeless and I hope it has been or will be published on VHS or DVD. If you have the chance to see it, don't lose it.
