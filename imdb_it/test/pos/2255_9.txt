This film reminds me of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "Garden State" not because of the content, but because it is one of those films that you don't hear about except through word of mouth, or you read the back of the DVD in the video store and think "why not". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (like the films above) for how beautiful and how much I liked it. <br /> <br /> Best view with little knowledge of the film and with only intrigue that guides you to really look at it. Even better seen with someone else or if you know someone else who has seen it - you'll want to talk about it !! It is a beautiful film that accompanies you well after watching it. It is also a smart watch that requires a little effort to understand the parts for you. <br /> <br /> Enjoy :)
