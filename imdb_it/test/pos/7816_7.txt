The cast alone tells you that this will be a notch above the usual Italian western. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy join Alex Cord who, at the time, seemed about to become a celebrity. The result is a film that is both off-beat and down-beat at the same time and yet will satisfy those looking more for a western than for a simple shooting. Particularly interesting here is the character played by Alex Cord. The "hero" in these westerns is expected to be taciturn and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly, has often shone in a passive, even weak position. Much is made of the fact that he fears being a victim of the epileptic attacks that have immobilized his father, and in these moments of impotence he is at the mercy of those who wish to hurt him or those who wish to help him. To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord - don't you like that name? - It is often polished bare-chested as if it were little more than an attractive toy on display. There is also a strong masochistic vein in its nature, the most obvious when used as a punching bag by its enemies and then suspended by the wrists and left hanging over the center of a road. Not only does he often fail to protect himself, but McCord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. Almost all those who help him are killed. <br /> <br /> While "A minute to pray, a second to die" is far from being a complete success, it has a depth and a tone that sets it apart and causes it to linger in memory. It is also a good showcase for Alex Cord, whose career tends to decline after this point after some promising years in the mid-1960s. He must have been about 36 when he shot this film - in his greatest physical form - and his bare-chested, sweaty, hanging-up scene is a memorable piece of cinematic "beefcake".
