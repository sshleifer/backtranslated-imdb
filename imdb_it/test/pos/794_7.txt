This Metro film is episodic, but almost a constant series of pursuits, which mainly seek to escape the police, real or imagined, since Buster is mistaken for a fledged criminal. It's always inventive and fun. His greatest value is in documenting what Hollywood looked like in the early 1920s, since 95% of it was shot off the streets and exteriors of the building of the time. A gem moment and a gem sequence are present here. <br /> <br /> The big moment is when a long distance train approaches the camera quickly and finally stops shortly before - with Buster sitting sadly on the cowcatcher and then moving from a long field to a close in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> The big sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator - one constantly exchanged for the other with races from one floor to another - one of Keaton's great gags. <br /> <br /> The Kino print is sharp and clear - almost untouched. There is a violin / piano accompaniment. This is one to look for and enjoy.
