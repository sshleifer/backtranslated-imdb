What a surprise this movie was. I saw a lot of horror and zombie movies from Fulci and I was amazed that he was the director himself. He also wrote the script that shows that the type was able to create a detailed and complex plot. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the bad inclination that further hinders later screams like "Manhattan Baby". <br /> <br /> The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film that focuses on a small city where young boys are killed. A scene that involves the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to look at, but refreshing compared to the usual cinematographic violence. <br /> <br /> What went wrong with Lucio? Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest that he had reached his peak with this film, and slowly went downhill afterwards.
