I watch many movies, but currently my number one genre is Asian horror. I just bought this DVD and initially found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an intriguing but confusing film, since I didn't understand many parts of the story. But I saw in IMDb Board a message entitled "Explanation of a masterpiece (all the answers to your questions) Loading faster", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed by the high quality of the explanations provided by the user to viewers like me that points of history were missing. I would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest that he write a correct summary of this film in IMDb to help and guide other viewers. <br /> <br /> In the end, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean film, but I don't give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, like the demands of this film, and without the great support of opiemar, I would not be able to understand the story as a whole. I intend to see this film again in the near future. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
