Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) tells the life of the Korean painter Jang Seong-ub amidst the changing political landscape of 19th-century Korea. <br /> <br /> However, the themes of this film are centered on the process of artistic creation through the fire of the artist's desire and the expectations and demands of the public and society. <br /> <br /> Jang seong-ub is masterfully interpreted as a complex character that changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened and tortured soul. This characterization reflects the eager young artist who finds it increasingly difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting creativity be released through drinks, erections and desires. <br /> <br /> Despite this development of character proceeds as a whole, gradually, through the film, Jang's emotional complexity is still interpreted in a constantly oscillating way, building the ending of the film. It is interesting to note that the editing of the film is parallel to the emotion and the fire of the artist, constantly changing and apparently wild, since the scenes pass without interruption from one place to another, without any conventional "hint" to the public will verify this change of scene. For example, many scenes will apparently change into a half-way conversation in another place and place. <br /> <br /> The visual scenario of the film is beautifully presented and also fluctuates from a black and white (and perhaps squalid) scenario in more colorful and vivid environments that once again are parallel to Jang's paintings in simple black ink on white paper or with added color. Rainbows of color enter the film in points while the artist observes nature and in particular women who are then reflected in his paintings. <br /> <br /> The theme of an artist's individual desire to create against the expectations and needs of society is born the film through various points including the class distinction, the domination of the government over the artist, the accepted norms of the artistic elite and the basic desires of the common masses. Instead of creating his completely original works, Jang finds himself mostly recreating masterpieces by other artists throughout East Asia. The question then arises if recreation itself merits artistic merit. <br /> <br /> I hope that I am more familiar with the political events of the period to understand firmly how they are related to history - but beyond any comparison with the current role of the Korean government in artistic expression and / o censorship I cannot comment. <br /> <br /> Overall a very well acted and cinematographic film is often breathtaking. A great movie to watch and then reflect.
