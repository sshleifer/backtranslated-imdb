Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like "Rope" by Hitchcock, you will like this movie. "Murder by Numbers" star Sandra Bullock as a psychologically concerned but brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. His partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Teenage killers are Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt) high school students. These young psychopaths want to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and get away with it, but the proximity of the capture is exciting and exciting for at least one of the killers. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant to the district attorney and the high school custodian who the assassins attack the murder. The film reminds me of several "Hitchcock" movies crossed with the TV series "Law and Order". We see a lot of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the investigators follow and which are not. <br /> <br /> The other plot of the film refers to the past and prison of Cassie Mayweather - a husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the film useless and slow, but I found this in the most intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> "Murder by Numbers" is a well made movie if you are looking for a safe or should say dangerous, mysterious murder. For more thrills and suspense, try "Se7en" or "Dial M for Murder" by Hitchcock.
