There are 3 of these films, all made in the same way and each one extremely fun. Red plays radio Wuth Benton, aka The Fox, who is tricked into solving real life crimes with her boyfriend played by the typical wartime girl, Ann Rutherford. Many of the one-liners and gags are stupid and probably were in the 1940s I expected. But, just like many people made me laugh out loud, which was unexpected to say the least. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong, surprising presence on screen, I say this because I grew up with a much older version of the man whose charm has never played well in my formidable years. I have to give these films the green light, if you're in the mood for this kind of nostalgic food. I almost threw a heartache, but in reality people get wasted and beaten and I dare say, sometimes the suspense is well above average. As with most films of this era, he gets a PI rating (politically incorrect) for reasons you can imagine. War time is fun like that, I guess, and so again are these movies. Look at one, look at them all.
