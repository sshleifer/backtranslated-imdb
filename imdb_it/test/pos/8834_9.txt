Obviously, the answers here were written many years after the release of the film and cannot be taken in context. In 1980, in post-work in England, this film was damn funny. We were happy with something to laugh about and Rising Damp, with its comprehensive mockery of complete social strata, was one of the best British sitcoms of its time, if ever. He struck a chord in almost everybody and in the real British fashion, we laughed at Rigsby in ourselves. America had nothing to touch this kind of humor because self-degradation was not fun for our overseas cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of the best actors in Englands, on stage, on TV and in movies. His commitment and professionalism were second to none. Richard Beckinsale was, even though young, a perfect comedy for Rossiter and should, for all intents and purposes, be classified as a great old man. If he had not been caught so young, I am sure that at this point he would have been classified as one of the greatest actors of British comedy. Frances De la Tour found her best TV moment in Rising Damp and, for me, she never quantified her undoubted ability with additional roles. If you have not seen the film at the time of its release, you are not qualified to comment, simply because you cannot understand why it was fun, the humor of the moment.
