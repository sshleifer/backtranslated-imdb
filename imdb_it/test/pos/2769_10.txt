I love this movie. and the Disney channel is ridiculous for not having played it again. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it !!! but if not, does anyone know where I can find it ?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com write me if you know where I can find this movie. Online or anywhere I told my children about this movie and I think they deserve to see it too. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q !! It was a great film and had great actors and I don't see why the air was removed. If everyone loves this movie so much because the air has been removed. Please consider my comment and all other comments made on this film. Thank you have a nice day.
