Valley Girl is an exceptionally well made film with a great all-round cast. Although the dialogue is a little dated now, when the film was released it was very fashionable. To this day, I know many people (including adolescents) who cannot form a sentence without using the word "like". This is undoubtedly the legacy this film will leave. A rating of 8 was given for this, as, the most excellent film.
