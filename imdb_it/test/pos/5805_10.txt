The show was fantastic and very professional. Madonna is a non-stop, dancing and singing for 2 hours. The opening was pretty good when it came out of the disco ball and even jumping was a really good performance. The whole show was full of energy, so it's hard to say what the highlights were because each song had something special and unique. I saw a couple of live shows from his previous tours (Drowned world and reinvention tour) they were good but you can't compare to that. The dancers were great, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly suggest you see it. You will enjoy the show from beginning to end. Madonna is still the queen of the dance.
