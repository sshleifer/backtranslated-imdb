I can't think of any film that best captures the concept of grace, in a theological sense. The well-intentioned religiosity of a small congregation, gone wrong after the death of their leader, robs them of the same thing they preach: grace. The costly gift of a humble Parisian culinary genius leads them back to their vocation of loving each other, and humiliates an old general who has lost his life. Choices are a central theme, as is grace. At the same time, the artistic gift is recognized as a powerful and transcendent role to play in everyday life and in future life. Unable to improve or ignore. This is a life-changing film for those who hear his message.
