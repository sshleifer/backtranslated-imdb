My wife wanted to see this movie and I reluctantly went. I've never been a big fan of the biographical film - believing that cinema is more exciting when it's not structured in essays. On top of that, even though I like the music of Ray Charles, I don't consider myself a fan of him or his music. I expected you to suffer or neglect this movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a compelling story told in a classic cinematic style. Realism is in the nuances - the inclination of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes as they sing. I literally discovered myself involved in this film during the course of the vision. <br /> <br /> Jaime Foxx, of whom much has been said, is the head of a cast of immortal reconstructors of not only a time, but an ERA, a LIFE that never really existed for those of us under forty years old. This film sinks the public over time without the findings and the wonderful views of the Titanic or other vintage pieces of that genre. This film does not present you the music scene of the 50s and 60s, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> This is a film about Ray Charles, but your appreciation should not be limited to the story of his life. This is the kind of movie, like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, which does what a movie should do - take you to another place, another time.
