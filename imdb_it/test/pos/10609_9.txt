I had no expectations (I never saw the previews of "Marigold") and I liked the characters, the contemporary music and the abrupt dances in this light-hearted film. Although 98% of the dialogue is English (good thing for me), I would like the DVD to have subtitles to help with some of the quick moments where the character's accent can be difficult to understand. I will not judge this film against Bollywood films, but only on its merits as entertaining entertainment (a film of musical people). <br /> <br /> I am fond of Ali Larter as an actress (and her interviews with the bonus material indicate that she is a good person). Since then I have seen this movie several times (it gets better every time).
