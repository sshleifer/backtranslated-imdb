This is at least very close to a perfect video publication. The messianic metal band, rock n 'roll dinosaurs, the biggest and most influential heavy band in the world play their hit songs and reminisces the band's past - what else do we need? <br /> <br /> The video starts from "War pigs" and ends with "Paranoid" and in the middle are included all the biggest and most significant classics of the original lineup: "Electric funeral", "Sweet leaf", "After eternity "," Iron Man "," Children of the grave "... and of course my favorite" Into the void ", I'm glad they didn't leave it out. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> However, this video is more than just music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward trace the group's colorful history. The only thing that bothers me slightly is when a live song is interrupted with interview fragments. For example, it is necessary to inform the song "N.I.B." has its name, right in the middle of it - one above the other? I doubt. It's still a small flaw so it's not a problem. <br /> <br /> The group members also relax on the chairs and talk together: pleasant material for a sabbath fan! I admit I have difficulty following what Ozzy Osbourne is muttering but it's just fun. I had the privilege of participating when "The last supper tour" entered Finland and for me personally this video is an ideal way to remember that magnificent show.
