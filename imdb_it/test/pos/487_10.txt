I grew up in Winnipeg and saw native treatment almost every day. There are good and bad things in EVERY race, why make them all bad? This applies to all today's races. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a university year under his belt before returning to the reserve. How do I know? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he attended high school, and he kept in touch with us the year after he graduated. He was a kind and gentle soul, he could be funny and he could be serious when the time was right. I wasn't very old when he left our house, but I can still remember every time he helped me with homework when my brother couldn't be disturbed. He even taught the third year of the year before coming to Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the film, and the suicide of the police cross is an admission of guilt for me. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the native community, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks like the police do, I knew the person inside, and how he was like a PERSON, not an Indian!
