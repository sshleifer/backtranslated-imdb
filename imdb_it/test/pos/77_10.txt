Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American Rock Hudson pilot while on a mission to Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. The two are well coupled. Julie shows a more temperate side in this film than the good girl she normally plays. <br /> <br /> A semi-German girl, half English who sings wonderfully and entertains troops in World War I, Julie sings some captivating Mancini songs. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some will say it's a "chick-flick", but then? It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. It may not be up to the performance of Rock in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession or Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards made the film in Ireland and the authentic WW series I aircraft was used in the film. Scenery for England and France is absolutely gorgeous.
