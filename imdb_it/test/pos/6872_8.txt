HOUSE CALLS was a fun 1978 comedy about a widowed doctor (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play in the field but cannot help but be attracted to one of his patients (Glenda Jackson) who refuses to be just another notch on his bed. Matthau likes the woman, but she doesn't really want to make the commitment she insists, so she agrees to go out with her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision as to whether or not she wants to commit herself; however, other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are up, even though he is clearly in love with the woman. Matthau and Jackson have a surprisingly effective chemistry as a pair of writers and receive strong support from Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill and in particular Art Carney as inept and senile chief of staff of the hospital where Matthau works. Matthau also has a short scene with the son of real life, Charlie, who appears as Jackson's son. This compelling comedy still holds up well after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth it.
