The story involves an ancient demon who is released on a small town on Halloween night. In all my life I've never seen such a nice film, but it's so funny that you can forgive his bad acting, effects, direction and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season from the original Halloween. And when they introduce the character of Linnea Quigley for the first time, she is naked in the shower for 5 minutes. Goodness, they are no better than this. Grab and buy this tape right away. 5/10
