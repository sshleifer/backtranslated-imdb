I saw this movie with my friends and we all love it! It is so sweet and moving, a true tear-jerk! I was still thinking about the story after I saw the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things that all families go through, it's something that anyone can relate to. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Saturday night rental. With your friends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really like it! : D It is a true story of a real family that would pull at any cord of the heart. Not to mention, beautiful landscape shots and fantastic acting. Look at him, I'm sure you will love him as much as I do!
