In Tweety's S.O.S., Sylvester switches from collecting garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to bring a certain canary bird - and his grandmother, its owner. Uh Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also has seasickness several times. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the spot on the ship that has something to cure his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can shoot! I will stop here and say that this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling with the famous couple of cats and birds. Tweety's S.O.S is highly recommended.
