The happiness of the family is crumbling when, rich father Ward (Michael Ontkean) from the beginning, becomes poor and can no longer support the family. So mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) must take on the role of breadwinner of the family and start working to support the family and, at the same time, periodically alone, must manage family life. Not always so good, but the best it can. Family life becomes difficult when the father discovers that his son Lionel (Joe Flanigan "Stargate Atlantis") is gay and lives with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400") also an old family friend, with the result that father makes it clear to Lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel is the one that most meant to his sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during her growth, since the family neglected her. Anne can't stand the fact that their father cut the ropes with Lionel and then runs away from home. Since this was not enough, his son Greg (Brian Krause "Enchanted") joins the marines and is sent to war. The plot of this film can, on some occasions, feel a little thin, although there is still a lot of realism, which is worth seeing. Given that this film illustrates many delicate relationships and situations, I think it is better appreciated by an adult audience, although it would not be bad for teenagers to see it and have something to think about before adulthood.
