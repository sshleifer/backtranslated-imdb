As a show, it is difficult to criticize Nihon chinbotsu. The Japanese have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that an entire world is a life style at risk - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality it is rather foolish to have a drama in which the entirety of Japan vanishes under the waves; why only Japan? <br /> <br /> So, let's assume instead that we have a cinematic reality, fed by the show (and popcorn), and some may find it quite influential. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, this is more mature and with a better rhythm. The emotional element is undervalued and really works. (It still loses a bit with the musical theme exaggerated at the peak.) <br /> <br /> Is Nihon a credible chinbotsu? Probably not, but the electrifying eruptions and the relaxed pace make the entertainment more pleasant than one night expects.
