A group of heinous teenagers go to a former funeral for a Halloween party. They get trapped inside and become possessed by demons who have accidentally awakened. The possessed teenagers begin to kill others and appear to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and speaks in a very deep voice. The remaining boys who have not yet been possessed are forced to fight demons and try to escape from the house. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent horror movie with great special effects that include Linnea Quigley (who has a couple of nude scenes as usual) digging a boy's eyes and pushing a tube of lipstick in the nipple. There is also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy who gets his tongue bitten. This is a great movie to watch with a group of friends late at night while eating a pizza. However, the terrible acting and atrocious dialogue almost ruin it. Overall, I would like to give it a 7 out of 10.
