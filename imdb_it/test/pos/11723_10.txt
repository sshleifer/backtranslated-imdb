While he was good at Boogie Nights, I think this was Burt Reynolds' best performance. He is also a great director and has made a tough and violent film that does not stop (the death of a 12 gauge magician) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) and one extraordinary jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
