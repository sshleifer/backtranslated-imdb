Probably because this is Columbia's first color film, the colors look different especially in the indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasant. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the film is a very young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw who wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman who begins to fall in love with Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess who runs the sedan. There is a funny character called Nitro who doesn't think twice about blowing it. I particularly enjoyed two moments in the film, one in which there is a huge escape of horses and thousands of horses are seen, there was no computer to help at that time, so I presume they collected all those horses, no easy task. Another moment is the final shooting, technically very good. There is also a fist fight. Seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes, it makes you come to a sad conclusion: they can't take it anymore. Would they be able to if they wanted to? I have my doubts.
