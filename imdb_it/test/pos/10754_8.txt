<br /> <br /> As a Harold Lloyd fan, I agree with the other comments from the reviewer, EXCEPT that I think "Movie Crazy" is his best sound film; "Cat's Paw" is a close second. (But, this is just my opinion). <br /> <br /> This film is a "hoot" from beginning to end and, in many scenes, George Barbier (the swindler who makes him elected mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the film). One wants the character of Una Merkel to be a little more sympathetic towards Harold, especially as the film progresses. Only in the last few minutes of the film do we discover his true feelings for him. (And, even then, there is no "romance" - kisses, etc.) <br /> <br /> This is a movie not to be missed!
