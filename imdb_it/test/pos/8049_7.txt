It is difficult to imagine that "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch", directed by the legendary D.W. Griffith was made back in 1914. It is a showcase for Griffith's emerging style. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a group of settlers called Cameron Brothers and their families who include a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent from the east to live with his uncles and a young wife (Lillian Gish ) that has just given birth. A group of Indians tries to catch pet dogs and is hunted by men. The son of the Indian chief (Henry B. Wathall) is killed during the battle. The Indian chief complicates his revenge and launches an attack against the small community of Elderbush Gulch. <br /> <br /> It is this attack, which is rather brutal and graphic for this or any other moment, which is the core of the image. Indians massacre the cities, women and children, and drive them out of town to Cameron's farm. The newborn separates from the mother and all hell breaks loose. Someone goes in search of help and returns at the right time with the ordeal. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman being pawed alive and there is also a sequence in which we see a downed horse. I've never seen an animal killed so convincingly on the screen. Mr. Griffith was becoming a master at staging large-scale battle scenes, a talent he would use extensively in his epic Civil War drama, "The Birth of a Nation," published the following year. <br /> <br /> Although it runs 29 minutes, "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" is still an exciting and historic film. See if you can spot Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in small parts.
