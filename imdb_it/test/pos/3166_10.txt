Almost four years after the war in Iraq began and we are in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag-wavers who were so sure of the right and the strength of the American way are now chasing the queue, aren't they? You bet. He said this film from the beginning. It's a bit strange how the film, or should I say, director, knew what was coming. It's almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what will happen in the future. There was a time when I felt the hair standing on the back of my neck when GW announced that "the main combat operations ended" on top of a visual of a broken VR that is towed away with the American flag waving in the back - look at the mirror, you have to see it to understand what I mean, but even if you are apolitical or even in favor of war, this film will have an impact on you because it is so rooted in history.
