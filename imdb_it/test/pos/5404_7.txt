This film does not have the exceptional images that American Beauty or The Ice Storm offered and why it was made after those films, it cannot even be marked as very original: the music, although subtly bright, sounds very similar to that of American Beauty. <br /> <br /> The story has some similarities with The Ice Storm in particular (as well as Sigourney Weaver). Perhaps without intention, the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two films above too. Sometimes, the story tends to be a bit more superficial than the bigger and more successful "brothers" having too much success or not offering the most effective dialogues. Here, writing cannot measure with that of American Beauty. But this can be said for most of the films ever made, even the best ones and there is still much to appreciate: he said the soundtrack and (predictable, given the cast) effective performances. To note is Emile Hirsch who will shine a couple of years later in the exceptional "Into The Wild". <br /> <br /> Overall I can recommend this movie if you like suburban dramas even if it's not the first of a must-see list, which would be topped by: 1 American Beauty 2 The Ice Storm 3 Little Children. <br /> <br /> After seeing and enjoying those, take a look at this.
