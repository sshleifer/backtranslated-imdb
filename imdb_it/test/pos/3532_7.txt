Had I postponed the purchase of this since the DVD was released ?? for one thing, because I had been a little subdued by the other two horror films of this director (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also the fact that the film itself was slightly trimmed for blood on the Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! Now I ran into a rental and I'm glad I did? because, not only is it superior to previous efforts (at least, in this preliminary evaluation), but I also found the film as one of the best imitations of THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974). This factor, however, only helped me to remember that I still have to check another example like that ?? The Wes Craven classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), whose 2-Disc R1 edition from Anchor Bay I bought some time ago but, after all, Halloween is fast approaching ... <br /> <br /> However, does the film handle a backwoods atmosphere without disturbing effort (it was shot in the forest and in the mountainous regions of Oregon) ?? with a lot of effective Frisians everywhere but, fortunately, there is not too much violence (even if the last of the villains is sent outrageously!). The main cast of young people here (one of whom played by the son of Jack Lemmon, Chris) is not as hateful as the ones we usually encounter in this kind of genre offer ?? although he lets himself go freely at the tricks that are associated with gestures aimed at adolescents and which, in general, persist until today! George Kennedy appears as a nice Ranger; even if it doesn't have much to do, its characterization has definitely improved, making it a lover of animal and plant life. Also notable among the locals is the familiar character actor Mike Kellin in a beautiful role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous narrative duo ?? his warning to teenagers, of course, is not heard, but he is later able to guide them to Kennedy. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family that the boys meet in the woods, then, eventually turns out to be hiding a skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls shows real curiosity about the presence of intruders, is the rest openly hostile to them? and, in the case of the burly and rough twins, appropriately fearful (one of them is even prone to manic laughter during his furies); at some point in the narrative, the Ranger also offers an interesting explanation of the nature of their aggressive and generally non-civilized behavior.
