This show was very energetic and well played. I saw him in 1998 and my friends and I are still joking. Every time I look it's always as fun as the first one. I also like the way everyone can relate to it in particular ways. I look forward to seeing other scripts and productions of John. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can't find it anywhere for sale, and I've done a lot of research. If someone knows a website or a store to address me, I would really appreciate it while I'm also looking for his other live performances. Please send me a message if any of you have information on the subject. Thank you.
