Most of the criticism of "Attack of Show" comes from people who unfairly compare it to an old computer TV program called "The Screen Savers". People are angry because G4 has decided to delete "Screen Savers" and replace it with "Attack of the Show" based on pop culture. Comparing the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges! <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" is a unique one-hour program covering the current Generation X / Y culture. It features segments on film / television, round tables, video games, new DVD releases, sex tips, new gadgets (MP3 players, mobile phones, etc.), comics / graphic novels, magazines and Internet fashions. <br /> <br /> It's a fun show, definitely worth checking out if you're 20 or 30 years old. I give him an 8 out of 10.
