This is a quiet film. It's a simple story of a writer who can't write his story by going back to his hometown to start but instead entertains a friendship with a strange older man whose life externally represents perhaps the writer's internal state - it's a museum of unfinished ideas, obsolete equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or large movements in the plot. It's a film about internal changes. Being locked into their lives that are not developing very much, the main characters help each other to transform, to stop going off in dreams and get something or at least get a change and give their lives the desired and long-awaited new direction. /> <br /> As for the making of the film, I can only think of a weakness that could also be considered as a feature - we don't have much description of the characters or inner insights of the world. It is very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess their true feelings which are rather hidden but you can still see them, and this is what makes your mind work, trying to understand them, to understand the impressions made by those people, and it is not empty below - the actors certainly hold some of their characters' inner states well. It is close to real life where for the most part you never know someone enough to fully understand them, and this transforms us and confronts our feelings and our choices. <br /> <br /> What is most important to me is that this simple, almost flat story lets you meditate later on your life, your dreams and results, there are or we are involved in routine and pleasures, leaving them 100% or just dreaming, we could do more and move somewhere we would rather than leave food to ourselves and others the stories like "I'll do it someday" - don't move a finger to make it happen really, or "I'm well where am i "why is it easier to follow habits than actually make a change? At least this is the impression he left me and was very current for me, which adds to my appreciation for this film far from the famous. I highly recommend it to all those who love movies designed for the heart, but those who need events and actions should stay away.
