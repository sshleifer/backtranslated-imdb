As someone who was part of a Pan-Hellenic sisterhood, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tuned into this show. After seeing so many "made for TV movies" dramatization and the reality show madness, I was curious to see if the Greek would be able to show the true life experience of college and Greece. <br /> <br /> I was very pleasantly surprised how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying familiar characters of this genre, but was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life is not just about parties and small conflicts. Although these things happen in Greek life, they also happen in any other social or professional circle during a person's life. To characterize it as an exclusive experience for those of a Greek organization would be false. Most stories and situations that take place in Greek can and do take place anywhere, in every circle of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I saw both episodes and my "little sister" to whom I am still very attached and I spent both episodes laughing and they reminded me how they really captured the spirit of our college years and experiences. > <br /> I liked the way the second episode showed how the characters fight with the other facets of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie tells Rusty that school comes first and goes to your brothers for help, has been very faithful to life. You can't stay in an organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his job for his professor was exaggerated, but it was fun. Also the dynamic between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow up and whatever your relationship with your brothers was, it changes so you have to adapt. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Greek is a great show, great entertainment value and enough "real life" in there to be credible and certainly worth it for the time of the spectators.
