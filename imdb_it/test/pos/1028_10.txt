>>> Great News there is a version of the BBC DVD scheduled for July 31, 2006, UK - there is also a release scheduled in the US - no date is known - I can't wait! ! <<<<< br /> <br /> >>>> below is my original comment <<<<<< br /> <br /> I agree with all the other reviewers - it's simply disconcerting that one of the biggest TV dramas has never been released on DVD <br /> <br /> The plot is compelling: the acting is exceptional and the character development is compelling! <br /> <br /> Here in the UK we have a real history of getting TV series and DVD movies through popular campaigns <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to understand why rights owners do not enter a production of DVD? I am going to e-mail one of the main actors of this basic movement and see what happens. Who made the production? was the BBC? RW
