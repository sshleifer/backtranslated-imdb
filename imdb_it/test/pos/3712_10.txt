A beautifully photographed and stimulated short film. In an evocative way, it captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just before and after Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the visual aspect of the film: naturalistic and at the same time poetic. Great job of a great D.P., David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Despite being a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe in the motivation that drives the boy into his odyssey. I understand the younger brother's love for his older brother and I don't wonder why he is committed to doing what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. The boy is tough, and Jonathan Furr's performance is superb, as is Ron Perlman's veteran performance.
