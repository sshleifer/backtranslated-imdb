This film captures you from the opening scenes and never gives up. Look indulgently at seeing the excitement of Janos Szaby coming to America. He is a nice companion. You can't help but love him even when his enthusiasm is replaced by bitterness as his fortunes change. You know that in his circumstances, you would be forced to make the same choices he does to survive. This film comments on the worship of the beauty of society and of all superficial things and is only more true in the culture of the twenty-first century. Janos himself becomes a victim of this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you are young and beautiful, if you could see, you would have the world". And like many a modern gangster movie, when its security is threatened, it pulls out a powerful revenge. His innocence is not entirely lost, however, because it requires a price as high as himself, knowing that he deserves his destiny. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in excellent shape in this leading role. Only a few actors managed convincingly to turn the character from an innocent criminal to a bitter in sixty-nine minutes. Lorre is well supported by all the casts, making this a real feature film and not just a vehicle for a star. With a little less favored dialogue, this film would be a 10. Highly recommended.
