RKS after the success of GHAYAL he started working on this film which was a comedy The film was in production for 3 years and finally came out in 1994 but it didn't work for some reason Before this film, DAMINI (93) released and did well <br /> <br /> The film is a crazy comic film like most of Priyadarshan's movies today but it's fun and well managed. The film has a proper plot unlike the films of today and makes you laugh. Most of the characters became famous, be it the master of crime Gogo (Shakti Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others <br /> <br /> The movie makes you laugh all the time running even if you are too picky and overdone yet it is one of the most entertaining films <br /> <br /> Direction by RKS is very good music is good <br /> <br /> among the actors Aamir steals the show and offers its most enjoyable performance, this is was his first comedy coming out Salman does well but looks amateur in front of Aamir, yet he does a good job and their chemistry is delicious. Karisma is annoying and sounds like a child. Raveena is suited to Paresh Rawal too much fun in both roles, Shakti Kapoor is exhilarating in his top act Shehzad Khan (voiced by Ajit) is very good and Viju Khote is funny too I'm good
