All you could ever hope for if you are a Jackass fan. As always, Knoxville and his team risk their lives and limbs just for our visual entertainment. If you are a fan of the series and the first film you will not be disappointed, as often happens in the sequel. The jokes attract each other twice as much fun, cruel and raw as ever, and the acrobatics and ire are twice as harsh as any Jackass episode you've ever seen. If your fan wastes no time, take a look at yourself because in the Jackaass standards this film is an easy 10 out of 10 only for headlines alone, I can't go into details without spoilers but you have to see it to believe it.
