Extremely overwhelming vision of a war situation in which the couple of Vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) is captured in the crossfire of two fronts. The representation of the combatants as faceless and superordinate authority is often captured in surreal and surreal images and draws interesting parallels with Orwell's 1984, although Bergman contrasts this context on a personal level of a conjugal war that is slowly germinating. This is the reason why innumerable fundamental and philosophical questions about Eva and Jan's marriage are relevant and essential, while the threat and danger from external tears open an abyss in the interior, which was previously covered with gaps. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions.
