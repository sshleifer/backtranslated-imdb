Martin Ritt seems to be a director who has always been interested in social issues (as a child of immigrants, he had every incentive to be, especially since he was blacklisted in the 1950s). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel "The Water is Wide", on his experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world, much to the displeasure of the right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn). What added to the strength of the film was the cultural and historical context: Conroy (Jon Voight) frustratedly tells another teacher how many children don't know about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War, or even where Vietnam is . He proceeds to clarify them on all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, I read a complaint about the fact that when Conroy played music for children, he only played white music. The truth is that you can't blame the movie for that; it was based on Conroy's true experience. However, the film is a real gem.
