I watched this series on PBS in the 1980s and still look at the old tapes every two years or so. Very impressive and sometimes disturbing. This is a very good show because the characters are all well defined and played. You are drawn to the plot and come to take care of these people. The bad guys are almost incredibly evil, especially the sheriff of Nottingham. Friend, I'd like to beat the s - t out of that snotty little bastard. Nicholas Grace does an excellent job and must have had a lot of fun with the sheriff. His scapegoat, Sir Guy, is equally hissing but he is also pathetic. A lot of murders and riots in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of that nature. I noticed that he received an amazing television prize for children. If I had children, I wouldn't let them see it. Even the exceptional use of the locations in this show. Now it's on DVD, so get out and buy it.
