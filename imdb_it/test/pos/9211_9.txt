The 2-hour kidnapping program has just entered the viewing program for the first time recently. I don't know why I didn't do it before ?? James Caan is exceptional and completely believable as the honcho leader of the 5 * Las Vegas complex. <br /> <br /> So often, programs like this have one or more components that are either annoying, or seem to have been chosen because they have to be connected to the producer or director. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the case with this program. Together with Caan, all the main and supportive cast is attractive and credible. The guest actors are well chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I saw are interesting, and the show also features a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is a fun program, and I hope it remains. I don't know how I managed not to see it for so long, but I'm going to do it from now on.
