I served as Corpsman on Parris Island in the late 1960s, just over 10 years after "The D. I." It was shot. I was in some of the barracks where they filmed some scenes indoors. I knew a lot of training instructors and a lot of recruits. I think the film is as close as possible to any film to show the life of a recruit and that of a drill instructor. Without a doubt, I think it's the best thing Jack Webb has ever done. If you've been in the army, you have to watch this movie. It was like this. It shows how important it is to take a group of raw recruits and turn them into men ready to defend our country. One feature I found fascinating is that most of the characters are played by real marines, not actors.
