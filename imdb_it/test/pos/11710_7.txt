Sharky's Machine is a drama set in the early 1980s in Atlanta. He is played by Burt Reynolds as a renegade policeman, who is an arrest warrant in stopping crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician who is on top of a crime that brought the city to its knees. Sharky's connection to bring down this union is a high-priced prostitute who falls in love with during the course of the film. The action sequences are well done for the early 1980s and the soundtrack / score is pretty good. The acting is level B but this is a pretty decent movie to have in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Overall 7/10 <br /> <br /> Peace <br /> <br /> Buggieblade
