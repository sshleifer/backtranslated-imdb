Age of Steel follows the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, devoid of others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being the Doctor's excellent portrait of Tennant. In fact, his sort of pungent horror leads to this writer the shadow of the Doctor of Tom Baker, with his sort of subconscious (as when he marks the periods in which Mickey holds the button in the Tardis), but brings the his posting. superiority to McCoy's doctor as he lets events unite around him. Some reviewers and fans whose songs I read seem a little disconcerted by the fact that such a young actor portrays someone who must now be over 1000 years old, but disagree. Tennant's doctor actually "bears the weight of the world on his shoulders" as he points out in this episode, and you can see this in his almost smug characterization, like when he finally confronts Lumic / The Cybercontroller in the climax. His sort of tired and unreal attitude, "anothermaniacherewegoagain", is refreshing, especially after the excellent pseudo-working interpretation of Eccleston, bada ** of the character's interpretation, plus the man of action of the fresh pseudo-doofus of Tennant. The best time for Tennant is perhaps after the end, when he is restoring the Tardis with his big stupid Baker-esquire smile as the Tardis resumes. Here we begin to have a feeling for this new Doctor, a character that is little more than the different facets of a person's average personality divided into 13 different people; some contradictory, others more pleasant than others, yet all are part of a whole. Apart from this, these two episodes were acceptable but weak. The concept of reviving the Cybermen is very welcome and they look fantastic, but the plot involving a parallel Earth in which this action takes place does not seem to work properly. It is true that the allegory of human dependence on technology and their need to serve it, as the Doctor points out, is exceptional, but this could easily have been placed on contemporary Earth or its surroundings. Some other weaknesses are, as others have pointed out, the ease with which the Doctor and Co. emerge from weak points, that is to say. the radius of death from the Tardis component, the seemingly endless array of uses of the Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they used it to burn through the rope ladder at the end, she barely looked at Who, so I had to explain it was traditionally used as a plot device to eradicate the characters from situations from which there is no other way out! Used here sadly). Some acting was missing, especially Mickey, who really needs his debut, and some of the supporting casts. Lumic was creepy, as it should have been, his voice also sounded like Cyberman-esquire. The soundtrack was horrible, however, with the volume of music that often submerged the scene. Overall, I found Rise of the Cyberman more fun, even though the second half was passable. The accumulation of what we knew was inevitable, but the resolution was disappointing. Too many unlikely escapes, no development of the supporting cast, and not enough Tennant in my opinion. This new show is exceptional, and Davies is leading it in a good direction, but the dialogue (beyond that of the Doctor) must be strengthened, as Mickey's farewells, who were pure, show.
