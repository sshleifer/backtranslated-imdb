Despite all the negative criticisms I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not saying this lightly. I love movies and I'm pretty picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are fantastic, others are OK, some I don't like at all). And, to all those with criticism: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It's light, fun and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies, but I like it. The comedic talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are exploited (completely - for this type of film). Don't compare it to other movies with these famous actors, just have fun. The cast is fantastic and, I believe, the purpose of this film has been fully realized. If you want a really easy-going and very restful night - watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just had fun making this movie, so we should (looking at it). And please don't be so negative. Don't expect DeNiro's Godfather or Meet The Parents performances, don't expect performances from Murphy's comic blockbusters ... It's a completely different genre, and made me relax after a hard day's work. Your sides can't be divided by laughter, but it's still VERY fun.
