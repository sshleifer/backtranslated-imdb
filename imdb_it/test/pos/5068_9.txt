Excellent political thriller on the consequences of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve its goals in finding terrorists. <br /> <br /> The plot is intertwined where two families are adversely affected by terrorist events. /> <br /> This is one of the best roles of Meryl Streep in recent years. Sounds cold, computer, clever CIA director who allows these things to go on. He's out of George Bush's school - Dick Cheney to manage the war on terror. Had her part been expanded, Miss Streep would surely have won an Oscar award. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can't take what's happening. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who really has a heart and costs his life in this well-directed and finely edited film. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin appears briefly in the role of a conniving senator. Mr. Arkin seems to improve with age.
