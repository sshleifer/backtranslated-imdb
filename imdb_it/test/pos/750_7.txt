Personally, I have a weakness for horror movies set in hospitals and asylums, so I had a good feeling to see this "Do not Look in the Basement", even though its reputation is doubtful. Well, I found out I was right! This is fantastic, trash entertainment with a couple of effective shocks and deliciously absurd characters. You obviously have to look beyond the poor production values ​​and the completely illogical plot but, if you can do it (and if you are a fan of this type of horror, this is an essential quality), you will be rewarded with a scandalous "ugly video "in which blood and madness form the main elements. The pretty young nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanatorium where she should start her new job. He finds out that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement Masters in charge seems reluctant to accept the newcomer. Life inside the sanatorium is rather peculiar, with patients running free and each door is kept unlocked. After a whole series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the horrible secrets hidden by the institution ... The initial 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great, as is the completely unbalanced climax. Everything in the middle is practically without surprise or tension, but you wait patiently because you feel the ending will be a lot of fun. Kindergarten patients are textbook mad, but I love them anyway. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still speaks exclusively in legal terms), the unsuspecting Sargeant of the army and the crazy old mad woman. "Do not Look in the Basement" is great low-brain fun, especially recommended for 70s junk cinema fans, sick puppies and other scum types. The mad have taken control of the asylum, yes !!
