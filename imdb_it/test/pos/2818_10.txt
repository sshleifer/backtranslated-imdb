I like to see a female protagonist, in this film her name was Rose. Rose brought many interesting questions in her journey of realization. Is it possible to achieve peace and internal realization through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory that can lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? How far can you control or take control of your environment? How is a "typical" human being equal to or different from Rose? Finally, would the outcome or story change if it came from another country like France or Italy? I loved the fact that this movie caused all these questions in me, while it amused me, stimulated me and kept me to the end! Every time I saw it, I learned more about the film and myself.
