Martino, a young teacher on the island of Elba, was trained by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his man and to say what he thinks, something that puts him in trouble in the school where we meet him for the first time teaching revolutionary ideals. The island is delirious due to the arrival of one of the most influential men in European history of the 19th century. Napoleon is coming to his exile, not exactly a high point in his life. <br /> <br /> With surprise, Martino is chosen to accompany Napoleon who is writing his memoirs and needs help with his project. The young man comes from a family of sea merchants. His brother and sister want him to do a commercial expedition, but Martino has decided that his place belongs to Elba because he will try to assassinate Napoleon. Piccolo discourages him after his mentor Fontanelli is tried for treason and sentenced to be shot by a firing squad. <br /> <br /> Martino finds his consolation with the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his interaction with the deposed emperor a different type of man emerges. Napoleon is seen as a more human person who truly loves Martino's company, not suspecting with the plans the young man's plans for him. Unfortunately, Martino is unable to implement his design because Napoleon has other plans in mind. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, the director of "Caterina goes to town", shows why his initial promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also collaborated on the script, which is based on a novel by Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows he is good at intimate drama and this kind of show. Alessandro Pesci, the director of photography, does an excellent job with the images he was able to get. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, a young Italian actor is the best thing about the film. He is playing against more experienced players, yet he manages to convince us that he is the young idealist who seeks to obtain justice for what he perceives is a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a Napoleon more submissive than one would expect from the interpretation of anyone of this man greater than life. Monica Belucci is Martino's love interest, but has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
