I can't understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently available only through an Australian video company, but such is the unfortunate darkness of this Peter Sellers classic (Leonard Maltin's Film Guide continues to grant the same BOMB review that the gave in the 70s). With so many scene thieves on show, Sellers comes with what could be his most exhilarating role. It all starts with the discovery of a patient who expired at 11:15 AM, but Sellers claims that the body is still alive due to the fact that the new day does not start before noon! The drop that ends for the besieged hospital commissioner arrives right in that room, the DO NOT DISTURB sign still on the door; once out of the room (handkerchief holding his nose), there is a brief conversation with the doctor with him - DOCTOR: "We can't save them all!" That man was at least 85 years old! COMMISSIONER: "How old were you when you died, 63 years?" Harold Gould plays an incapable surgeon who closes his eyes when the knife digs in, Richard Lenz (whose "pompous ass" reporter in "The Shootist" was started in the back from John Wayne) plays the patient who exposes the fraud (he came only for a chest x-ray, until they discovered they had a home). Also in the cast on the screen (and which provides excellent music with a country flavor) is Keith Allison, the former guitarist of Paul Revere and the Raiders, who also worked with Michael Nesmith on some recordings of Monkees (and wrote "Auntie Municipal Court "with Nesmith in 1968" The Birds, the Bees and the Monkees "). Alas, there are some missing images of this print, including a topless sequence with Uschi Digard towards the end, also a scene with actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use green stamps to finance her operation), which is locked up by Sellers in his office, never to be seen again (in the full version, he returns to his office to find out that he wrote in large letters on the wall "UNFAIR PRICK"; his answer? "You have the price wrong!").
