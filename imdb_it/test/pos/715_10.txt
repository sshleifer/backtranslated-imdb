I saw him the other night at a local station because I didn't feel like watching tripe as "American Idol". Peter Strauss gives a great interpretation as a condemned man named "Rain" Murphy who keeps for himself. He admits his crime and does not make the bones he does not feel ashamed for. His cell is devoid of any comfort that other inmates have as books and images. The only time you hear in another area is running. He does this often and can run a mile in less than four minutes. When a college coach hears him, he wants to set him off for a shot at the Olympics. In the beginning, "Rain" does not want to be part of this, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, period. Strauss is very good (what did you expect, nothing less?) And Michael Mann shows hints of greatness that would have come in full bloom years later. This film had a bit of realism (probably because it was shot among inmates). It almost seems like this was a true story. Additional casting is good. There are many noteworthy names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll. <br /> <br /> My heart sank when a pompous board of directors didn't let it run because it didn't make him feel bad about his crime. His final act made me stand up and cheer up. When they took away his dreams, he resumed them hard. This happened when TV movies were actually good. 'The Jericho Mile' is a jewel of a movie. ESPN Classic, PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM !!!
