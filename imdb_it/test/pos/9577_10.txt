In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, a film was made and interpreted by the Americans that is well paced and full of charm, just as the hilarity is almost miraculous. This ensemble was the basis of some other efforts, most recently "A Mighty Wind", which was so subtle that it seemed like a real documentary without the overlay of entertainment, but "Best In Show" hit all cylinders . He's superbly played with some of today's best American actors, Parker Posey, who exudes energy even when she's still, Eugene Levy as a tolerant ordinary man who isn't anyone's doormat, even when it seems to be (or maybe, 'indomitable doormat '). Fred Willard's ingenious drawings, the undervalued performance of so many others, which is a characteristic not normally associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few fun movies I can watch again and again.
