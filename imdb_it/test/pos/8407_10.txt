A letter to the boys. I tried guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to watch this movie. I left the room when it was turned on or jumped on the computer when his wife looked at him. This is his second favorite movie, the first to be the Godfather (which I love). I ended up picking up some fragments of this film and finally, after maybe a year, I sat down to watch it with her. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays a great Rhett and has his arrogance on his knees. Whalley plays a delicious Scarlett. Full of fire and sulfur and NOTHING will stop it. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when you are abroad (in Ireland?) And the government is going to take down a peasant's house because they are behind the rent. Rossella gets angry and pays the entire debt, earning a huge name in this small town. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is that you could try this movie ... especially if you're a fan of Gone With the Wind. It takes a while to get used to the new actors, but I think you'll find them refreshing.
