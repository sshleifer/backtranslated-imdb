"Purgatory Flats", recently shown on cable, is a small film that contains a lot. Harris Done leads with style. The script by Mr. Done and Diane Fine is a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you'd like to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young doctor from Los Angeles who made a mistake and lives to pay it. After being released from prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he is forgotten. Wrong choice! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Immediately after finding a job as a bartender, Thomas meets a young and pretty woman, Sunny, who, clearly, is someone to stay away from. The young doctor is called to help as Sunny's boyfriend Randy is killed by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We know Randy's family. His uncle Dean seems to be okay, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Everyone in the house is connected in more than one way to the single Sunny. <br /> <br /> Performance is good. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who was supposed to attend his L.A. instead of making a detour to the small town. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape from her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, Brian Austin play the Mecklin family well. Nicholas Turturro also makes a good contribution as a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> The film shows a director with a promise that will go far judging from this well-built film.
