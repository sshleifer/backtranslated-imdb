Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, "Crazy From the Heat," (which by the way is an incredible read), and DLR says this was his favorite movie of blacksploitation as a child. In fact, he says he always imagined himself as a black guy at Southern Cal. Mr Roth said: <br /> <br /> "We have seen every image of Blacksploitation, and those films have had an enormous influence on me Trouble Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore making his Dolemite atmosphere-I saw all those ... "<br /> <br /> Continue saying: <br /> <br />" Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the originals. It was a blue cartoonist, who was blue humor, as did Redd Foxx in the first party albums, so he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent, his answer was not "Bonds". James Bond. "His answer was" Dolemite, motherf *****! ". We would wait for that sentence in all his films. "Get Whitey" will appear in every single movie at least once, and we would wait They had cars, they had shoes, they had guns, haircuts, slang and scams, and we all we knew that all those blissful giggles at the end of the movie were white bull *** * He's trying to feed the hungry kids, but he's actually a pimp ... bull ****. This was designed to make it appealing to our moms and dads so they let us go see the picture. "<br /> <br /> Spoken like a genius. So, after reading about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book, I immediately bought it on DVD and I really like it. Yes, it's super low budget, and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino's films, I can see a lot of similarities, especially some of the 70's of fusion / funk ala-jaco pastorius throughout the film, and I also love the scene where the two cops 'rap him' for the coke and then one of them snorts a lot as if he had done it a thousand times before, and says something like "Aww yes ... that's the real mccoy!" "... and then he keeps talking and he still has some coke on his lip. CLASSIC! Part of the violence is a bit exaggerated, but shocking, which I would consider a positive quality. Not as predictable as I thought it would be. Very soon will go and get "The Human Tornado" 10 out of 10.
