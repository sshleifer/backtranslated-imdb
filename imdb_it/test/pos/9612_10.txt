This film is the best kung fu movie of all time. Although there are no special effects and threads like those used in Crouching Tiger, this film uses ingenuity and creativity to create memorable fighting moments, and the fighting scenes are well choreographed and narrow. There is a lot of action in this film with many beautiful scenes, but the story is very good, with many twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have a real depth for them, as the motivations for their actions and personalities are revealed in a much greater detail than most kung fu movies. In the film there is a really fantastic filming job, with my favorite shot that starts up close on our hero's face showing his reaction, then pulls back quickly to reveal the scene in front of him which is the cause of his look. Originally, I bought the film hoping to see some great fighting scenes, but on more visions I learned how interesting acting and history were. Overall, a great movie.
