I saw it for the first time on January 5, 2009, and after a day I looked at it again and I want to watch it again. He loves everything (well, almost, so 9 stars) about it. No color, nice naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, working with the camera, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen a little longer and the music stops. After all, this is not a musical. I like the acting of Anna, this naive gangster girl, as she talks, holds the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not so funny, even if I laughed a little at times, it's so thin. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Even if the nouvelle 3d seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, because they are stealing ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. It makes me feel so warm and ... romantic. Yes, I would recommend this movie for romantic souls with a taste for such popular art films. And I disagree with those who compare it to Pulp Fiction. It is not about action and twisted history, even if all the cartoons intersect. It is a calm film and perhaps too slow for most people. It's about the characters, their feelings, very subtle. However, probably this review will not help anyone (my first), I just wanted to express my appreciation. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: This film does not have a Goofs section. I wonder, did anyone notice that hand in Part 2 when the kidnappers decided to go home? He looks like a part of the crew, hehe. I know I should post this better in the forums, but I don't agree with some policies here.
