When the first trailer of this film was seen by myself, I was curious to know which corner should have taken the plot. After all the plot of having one's childhood back to the present leaves many options open. However, Bruce Willis does a great job in the role he was assigned. I was surprised to see how well he could play in this part. This is also a good move for my career as many others have said, but after seeing it I agree. This film is primarily concerned with remembering the child you were and understanding that you are not the adult you planned to be. This is a wonderful story and a compelling story that makes us all think. We usually dislike the "What if ..." movies. For example, Waterworld attempted to answer the question "What if the world should be covered with water and ...?" But honestly, nobody cared. However, this film affects everyone in the theater. It is true that small children may not fully grasp the idea of ​​growing and making all your dreams vanish, but it leaves a great impact on adults and on the parents of those children. This film certainly deserves to be seen. Although it will be the second time better because you won't think much (about how the baby came, and why and all these things). Relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave that cinema. Take that piece of your childhood that you have forgotten and enjoy.
