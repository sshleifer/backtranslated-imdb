I am so happy when I look at (Ray's) for Sidney pottier of the 21st century (Jamie Foxx) at all times who played this role as proof of his brilliant acting ability to take a stand next to big Hollywood actors by his support golden for the strong abilities of the African-American actors of all time and periods from his eternal work as proof for the eternity of Ray Charles as proof for their legendary appearance at all times from their success for the Oscar-winning as (best actor for the role of protagonist) a (better mix of sound) between reality and cinematographic scenes on Ray and Jamie as a mix between two copies of Ray (ray of the past) and (ray of 2004 played in the person of Jamie Foxx) It was beautiful from director to choose those songs to be adapted with dramatic scenes in the incidents of the film to enter the atmosphere of success in the legend of the corn with the movies of the legends of Hollywood from 1893 until today and the s a cunning to choose Sharon Warrne in the role of Ray's mother, who succeeded in this role with a brilliant analysis for the core of her character that Ray's mother was the turning point for him when she grew up to be independent on herself to take her place in this world and be an icon in her talent as (Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington) and at the end of this film receiving the honorable Gerogia report and their decision to take her song (Georgia in my mind) The national anthem for this state has made its promise for his mother to be alive so far from his songs legend and brilliant life.
