The thing that makes "Fire" even more attractive to look at than its magical art is its touch of feminism and rebellion. In my opinion, the same character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of Indian women's protest against Indian society. The name of the film and the scene in which Radha crosses the flames in her kitchen are the symbol of Lord Rama's wife of Lord Rama, Hindu Mythology, who walks through the fire to prove her immaculateness, as for the same narrative that appears also in the film. The film could be a great source of inspiration for women, particularly those on the subcontinent, to seek their freedom and to gain control of their lives.
