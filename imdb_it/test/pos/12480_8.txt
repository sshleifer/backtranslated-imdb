Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a silent example of French transitional cinema. A film between the realism of post-war cinema and the full of magic and vague nouvelle symbolism. With some commercials of classic American films (but not imitating them) the director tells us a story about love, crime and the importance of points of view. We can also find great actors (Suzy Delair is impeccable). <br /> <br /> It's also interesting, how can we find the aspects of this film nowadays. The legacy of Quai des Orf√®vres is palpable in the tradition of Woody Allen. Immerse yourself in a criminal situation in a picturesque setting. The naive ending is also typical in the films of Steven Spielberg. And finally I would like to emphasize, the feeling of deja voo during the photo session between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant) in which the first confesses to thinking that her husband is unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her. That scene is exactly the one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
