I spent many sleepless nights after seeing 2001. Not only for the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also for the way in which it brought me (a restless soul) a little clarity on how to which I observe the universe. It has changed my way of thinking very deeply. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> The Space Odyssey is not something you can simply "go" and see ". One must be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact, I don't think it can be understood, at least not all at once.It is a philosophical journey to infinity and beyond, a masterpiece of its kind and even after 32 years it is technically quite impressive until the powerful musical soundtrack with Richard Strauss's "Also spracht Zarathustra" and "Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss. <br /> <br /> Take all the time you want, but in the end you will have to see this movie, if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you too. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I'm just crazy ...
