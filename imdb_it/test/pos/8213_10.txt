At the end!! Sandra Bullock is really a beautiful woman, but I finally found a film that becomes an actress! Forget the predictable meat of Keanu from SPEED, forget the predictable forage of Kleenex of WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING - this puts it to the test! <br /> <br /> And it's fantastic! A techno-feminist role that works really well on the screen, on a topic very close to the bone. The issues raised do not seem at all unlikely and the whole experience, aided by an excellent supporting cast, represents a couple of hours without ribs. <br /> <br /> You can never get into another chat room again, in fact I'm getting quite nervous just writing this review ... um ... hello!
