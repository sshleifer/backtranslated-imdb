Wow! An incredible lost piece of Australian And a lost 70s glam-rock movie in one. This film guarantees the vision simply to see what can be done with an almost inexistent budget, but with a lot of enthusiasm. As a review of the story of Oz, the film ends up becoming too obvious but is saved from its eccentricities. The chance to take a look at the way that glam rock manifested itself in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film was in double exposure with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of Oz film. Although not as frivolous or as well built as RHPS, it's hard not to have fun with Oz. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Oz has aged well - perhaps a by-product of what is determined in the real Australia of 1976 is. The passage of history shows that many of the ideas explored will eventually enter the mainstream. The availability of the film to highlight gay characters is remarkable, especially since it dates back to the "revolution" period due to the Australian push for gay rights. <br /> <br /> The exhibits range from an exciting exaltation to a finely nuanced splendor. Management is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two. In some ways, these flaws add to the charm of the movie which is mercifully unpretentious. Just like the Australia of the 70s, this film has a certain naive charm. <br /> <br /> There are several links to the original Australian Rocky Horror Show set-ups that will keep the obsessive on tiptoe. <br /> <br /> Oz is certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favorite worth reviewing. Laughing at the atrocious 70s fashion, swinging along with the AusRock soundtrack, leaving every expectation at the door and Oz is likely to delight.
