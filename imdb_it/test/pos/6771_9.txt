Not quite sure how I came across this film, but I'm so glad I did. Initially, we were discouraged by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read (especially at the weekend) enjoyed this film. I found the fantastic script and the way it was delivered in such an unpredictable way added to the puddles of pee on my couch. It is not entirely sure if it is so funny for the native Danish as the comedy seems to be improved by the subtitle tone and the ambiguity of the translation. I have not seen many Danish films (or none at all), but judging from this film I imagine that they are not bound by the same political correctness that elsewhere (gawd bless them) making Eigel's breath a breath of fresh air, because let's face it special needs are fun. There are so many great one-liners in this movie that puts American sitcoms to shame.
