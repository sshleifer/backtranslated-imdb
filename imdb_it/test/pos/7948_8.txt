SPOILER ALERT - AND IT REALLY MEANS IT !! READ NO MORE IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO HAVE A BIGGER ITEM REVEALED !! <br /> <br /> Ok, first I have to say that I have a relatively high tolerance for depressing films. I will watch and appreciate movies about the horrors of real life (like war and the holocaust) or where death and sadness are important to the plot, BUT I hate movies like MAGNOLIAS STEAL and TERMINI DI FONDO where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character. So, no matter how well this film is made, it has a MAJOR attack against it because one of the main characters dies of an illness at the end (although they never say what it had in the English subtitled version). > <br /> So you might ask, "so if this kind of film suffers so much, then why did you look at it in the first place?" You'd have an excellent point to ask, even though I hope it's not really a blow! Well, when I found it in our local library I had no idea what it was all about !!! The film was not specifically intended for export, as the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japanese and the box was printed entirely in Korean. Well, being a fan of movies from any country (I've seen movies from at least 30-40 different countries), I gave it a try. <br /> <br /> Well, apart from the mandatory death, I loved the movie and so hated how it ended. While I usually hate Hollywood's miraculous endings, I wanted to see the guy saved through a new drug or experimental surgery. I was really tired of having to die - especially because he looked like one of the most beautiful people I've seen in movies for a long time. His smile was infectious and I really wanted him to take the girl eventually. Oh well, at least I can appreciate the message of the movie that you have to seize the moment. Great acting, music, etc., but it's not the most satisfying ending for me. This film was good enough to encourage me to try a little more Korean cinema.
