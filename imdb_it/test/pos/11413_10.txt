Don't listen to most of these people. I'll give you a better review of this movie that my friend and I love! This is Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who is a babysitter at the Mendrakis home and someone intrudes. If you're wondering how he got into the house, he probably went through the garage. so anyway, don't listen to "the worst acting". he has extraordinary acting. with a great story. I think there are 2 benefits that Jill has. 1. is a fast runner and is on the athletic team. 2. it came out alive! lol. <br /> <br /> is a cool and rather scary movie. take a look, you'll be happy with this masterpiece. don't listen to other people on the site. is very good. trust me, i'm good at reviewing movies. I'm a future film critic. I absolutely want to buy this movie. and you will do it when you see it. it's incredibly fantastic.
