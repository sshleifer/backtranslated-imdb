Contrary to the comment published directly below, The Big Trail (1930) was not shot in a three-camera process "very similar to the next Cinerama". That was the end of Napoleon (1927), a completely different film! The Big Trail was shot simultaneously in both 35mm and 70mm (Grandeur) versions, and both versions are shown on Fox Movie Channel from time to time, so it's easy to compare them to each other. The Grandeur version (transmitted in letterbox @ about its original 2-1 ratio) is more impressive from a cinematic point of view, but suffers from the same problem that plagues the first CinemaScopes, a lack of close-ups forced by director Raoul Walsh due to focus problems. Scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can get closer to the players, thus achieving a greater sense of involvement for the viewer. Looking at the two versions at the same time, we get a precise idea of ​​which shots Walsh has chosen to shoot closely, in the standard version, but it was not possible, in the Grandeur version. There are also a couple of sequences involving El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith, and some deals with his wife and a jackass, which are in the Grandeur version, but missing in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For the disc, The Big Trail is the only one of the three Fox Grandeur films that survived in its large original format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies from 1929, completely lost, and Happy Days, which survives only in standard format.) Other studios have also experimented with large films right now, but the only other known in both formats is The Bat Whispers, shot in both 65mm and 35mm and published by United Artists. Other films were Billy the Kid (1930) by MGM and The Great Meadow (1931), Danger Lights (1930) by RKO and The Lash (1930) by WB, which can be seen in their standard format versions on Turner Classic Movies. Even Wism's Kismet (1930) was shot both in large and in standard, but seems to have completely disappeared; is said to be lost. <br /> <br /> Why didn't the cinema work in 1930? The theaters were staggering (pun intended) under the impact of the stock market crash of October 1929, and the dizzying costs of installing sound equipment, and so were opposed to taking on the additional expense of installing new additional projection equipment and new larger screens to accommodate only a handful of films, photographed in a variety of different systems that were not always compatible with each other. It would not have been until 1953, when Fox, now Twentieth Century-Fox, would have tried again, and this time he will succeed, with the introduction of the big screen CinemaScope.
