I saw this movie on TV in the 1960s and still stands up well after the brilliant performances of DI Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comic vein) on Gomer Pyle USMC. I wasn't in service, but my brother had registered a drill instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Other family members who were Marines told me that Ermey and also Sutton were very clear in their roles. The only thing missing in "The D. I." is the language In 1958 they could not yet use bad words on the film, yet Jack Webb came across damn hard without it. I think it's his best role ever. In Dragnet he was pretty stiff, I admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but he used it only to perform "The D. I." Never forget the funeral of the dead flea! The romantic part was just to lengthen the film, but it didn't really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good but he never passed this film in his career. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was John Wayne of TV. He took it a little too far in some episodes of Dragnet, but not in "The D. I." After 40 years I hoped that the film could compare with "Full Metal Jacket" and others; and did it!
