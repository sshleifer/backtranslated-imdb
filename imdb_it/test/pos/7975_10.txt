This is an excellent film and I would recommend it to everyone. Mr. Drury's acting is top notch as ever and goes well with the other actors in the film. I can't give away any suspense or drama found in the film. Hell to pay is a must-see movie !!! The plot was very suspicious. I would watch this movie over and over because it has all the elements of a great western movie. It was very authentic in showing the components that deal with this film that includes guns, horses and clothes. The soundtrack is fun and adds flavor to the film. James Drury has the right touch when choosing a movie to get involved with. This is another winner for the Western genre. !!!!!
