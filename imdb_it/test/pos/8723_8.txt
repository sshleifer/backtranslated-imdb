As much as I like Walter Matthau, I felt that most of his roles were adapted to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role requires much more acting than in most of its other roles. I liked the fact that the film was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid engagement in a relationship. His main purpose was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be engaged in any way. The alibi - using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At one point in the film, the fact that Mr. and Mrs. are actually deluded into believing they are actually married. The ending was good, because a middle-aged man found that pursuing someone his own age was more useful. The film was fun, funny and did not end with the sermon.
