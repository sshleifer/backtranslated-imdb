We have just seen this film premiere before its release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was a general agreement on two issues: there were excellent performances in a first-rate drama by the two protagonists and others: and secondly, marketing for this film will only bring disasters. We saw a filthy poster with chains and suggestive comments that implied a sort of sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the film has a certain depth and some thoughtful ideas. The sad thing is that people looking for nearby porn will be attracted to watch the movie and will be disappointed because it will be too "heavy" for them, while people who appreciate it would not be pecked to death by entering the theater showing it. Sin. A good wasted movie.
