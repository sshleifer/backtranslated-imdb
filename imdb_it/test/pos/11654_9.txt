"Dead Man Walking" is a film not about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death penalty case: the murderer, the families whose children were killed, the nun who becomes her spiritual advisor and what happens . It tells the story with little fanfare but much compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (not often, it's never an easy movie to watch) I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here. So, revealing that it could be a documentary, so compelling you can't look away, so subtle yet so powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It doesn't matter if you are for or against the death penalty (or even don't have an opinion), this movie will surely make you think about the problems. It takes a brave writer and director to watch this material in the face without even blinking once, and everyone involved in the movie does it outside - there's not a single scene that sounds fake. A masterful film, but don't expect to see the light ... for some, the final scenes might be more graphic than anything imaginable, even if no blood or violence is shown. You are attracted to this film and become a participant, and there is a character that almost everyone can identify with. 10/10.
