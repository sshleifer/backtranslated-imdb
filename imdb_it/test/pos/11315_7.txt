Seeing this film brought back memories of 9/11. The first thing I remember of that morning was seeing the television images of an airplane flying in a large building, and my immediate thought "It must be a preview for a new Tom Clancy film". <br /> <br /> This was not a Tom Clancy movie. This was certainly not an English version of "The Sum Of All Fears". The typical Tom Clancy movie or novel has a relatively small cast, a linear plot and usually a sort of resolution. This film has had neither Certainly, what I saw directly on the screen was a small cast, a plot and a vague resolution, but, like September 11th, the point was that reality was much bigger and more complex. <br /> <br /> I work in system planning, and the reality of disaster preparedness training, and the disaster itself, is painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, nor will it be possible to face it when it happens. <br /> <br /> From the argument between the police (not enough to prepare themselves) and the politicians (Giving everyone on the tube a gas mask would cause panic), to the constant announcements of the loudspeaker (You are not in danger for your health, but don't go home before decontaminate yourself), and (Don't eat, drink, or smoke before decontaminating), I was at the limit throughout the film. There is not the slightest desire to channel the surf. <br /> <br /> This film lasted 90 minutes. It may have been double, and still hasn't shown all the possible details. Instead, he remained unspoken enough to allow each of us to imagine the details, each of us in his own way. This made me much more real than any Tom Clancy movie. <br /> <br /> I lived in London once, and just off Edgeware Road. And I took the train from Waterloo station many times. While watching Dirty War, I kept telling myself that this was just fiction. Right now. <br /> <br /> Allah and Jehovah willing, this film will remain fiction, and sometimes in 20 or 30 years, my grandchildren could watch this movie and remember the beginning of the 21st century, and the panic made us feel too much . I hope to the same extent that I feel at the moment, when I look at the Cold War memorabilia with the evil communist regime of the mid-20th century, and I remember the "Drop and cover" exercises at school.
