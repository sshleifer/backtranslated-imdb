This is the fifth part of "The Animatrix", a collection of animated short films that tell us something more about the world of "The Matrix". This time they present Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a story about a detective being hired to find her. With a fantastic animation in black and white and an interesting story, this is again a great animated short film of "The Animatrix".
