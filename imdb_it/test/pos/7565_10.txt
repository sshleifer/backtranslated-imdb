Behind the nostalgic music, we see a boy getting off a train. He comes from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he hasn't seen for a decade. At the train station, we meet the man. He never smiles. <br /> <br /> So we start our journey on "Four Friends", the powerful and surprising film by Arthur Penn. You might ask why I started my review this way. Well, this is how the videotape describes the film. You may have realized that the film will be the story of the guy who is trying to get along with this emotionless man and eventually, he will break away from his cover and exhibit kindness. <br /> <br /> Well, if you bought it, I have a bridge that I want to sell you. See, modern Hollywood would make that movie. Penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to the typical narrative of clich√©s. He always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice's Restaurant" and the underrated "Mickey One") and "Four Friends" is no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie will focus on the guy named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script focuses only on this for about 4 minutes and then abandons it. We meet the adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (whom you could recognize from "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David and the passionate Georgia. The film takes us into the sixties. Now in a minor film, the events would have received attention. But in "Four Friends", these events happen, but Penn and Tesich are more interested in studying the character than in the plot and I think the film is better this way. We know the events; we don't need to dwell on them. <br /> <br /> I know I haven't described much of the plot, but I don't know if it is possible to describe "Four Friends". It is not one of those "high-concept" films that can be described in a single sentence. It is a film of many moods and textures. It is also a truly emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. A film rarely has such power that it can reduce me to tears. The acting is top notch, especially by Craig Wasson, who appears to be one of the most underutilized actors working today. This is such a difficult and exciting performance and Wasson pulls it out. He should have received an Oscar for this. Another great performance is by Jodi Thelen, who has an even more difficult role than Wasson. But she handles it very well and gives Georgia a certain dignity that most Hollywood actresses wouldn't do (they would be too scared to try it, they would be more interested in the image rather than giving a great interpretation, that's not what the acting it concerns ). He also deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four Friends" did not receive much push in 1981. Perhaps people did not have the emotional capacity to handle it. And clueless executives couldn't push it like another "American Graffiti" (missing the "Four Friends" wallop). So they let him die. Too bad, because this is one of the best films of the 80s, a decade in which ever more brilliant garbage was created and a great art like this was homeless. I ask you to give this film a chance. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
