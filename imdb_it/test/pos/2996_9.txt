When I saw this movie for the first time in a department store ... it intrigued me. Considering the fact that I thought I was in love and I was the same age as the young people in that film (although I realize that now I'm old enough to be my parents), in addition to the soundtrack written by Elton John & Bernie Taupin just before "got big" here in North America ... I thought I had nothing to lose by buying it. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> So far, I've shown it to many guys I've been dating since then, and to my current boyfriend ... obviously, they didn't find him as handsome as me. .. I prefer to call it a "chick" movie ... but I keep laughing and crying. This film has been largely overlooked. It's nice to see that it's available for rent in one of the local video stores around here so other people can share the magic. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's a bit far-fetched ... but it gives you a carefree sense of innocence ... and renewed confidence in love.
