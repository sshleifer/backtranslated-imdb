I'll start by saying that I've always been a fan of Bonnie Hunt ... It always adds life to any character you play, and has done a wonderful job in his directorial debut. <br /> <br /> I have to admit this is a funny film ... But keeping this in mind, it's a wonderful story, it touches many emotions and arouses all sorts of reactions. <br /> <br /> This film describes real life as people with real life like situations (But I have to exclude the coincidence that it is the main part of the film) <br /> <br /> It is a story of love ... not only of a man and a woman, but the love of family, friends and loved ones, past ones (Even pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. It is worth the rental or purchase.
