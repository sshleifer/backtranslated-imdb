Dude, I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this film. Ok, it's definitely not a sophisticated work of film art. But it's a lot of fun and bad taste. For beginners, the supernatural pumpkin-headed killer must be one of the most ridiculously foolish and insignificant things he can ever trip over in front of a camera; it looks like something you would see in a ghostly fourth-speed carnival moon. Secondly, moderate gore is ridiculously false and unconvincing, with the decisive highlight occurring when this boring, ultra-conservative woman is electrocuted by a toaster. Then there is always the welcome presence of the always adorable Linnea Quigley, who is memorably introduced by doing a nice, long, absolutely free shower that goes on for two minutes. Surprisingly, we also have appearances by deceased schlock legends John Carradine as an evil sorcerer and Cameron Mitchell as the host of a horror television show. Also, the screaming queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos. The leading child actor Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of an old moldy tree stump. The pretty brunette Rachel Carter opens her shirt and shows off her pretty breasts. Raw special effects are definitely less special. The score is adequately exhausted. Yet on the whole, this film has a certain appealing charm which in turn makes this honey a true and delicious imbalance to watch.
