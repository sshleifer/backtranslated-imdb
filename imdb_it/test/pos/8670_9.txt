I saw this movie yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago and since then I've been trying to find the origin of the strange emptiness I felt. When I saw this film I was struck by the brilliant photography of this company. Yes, it's all true !!! I also found a great job with a big pay, and I live with my Norwegian boyfriend in a nice downtown apartment. But so far everyone I've met left me with that insipid and empty feeling I never had before - this is the movie. Dinners with nothing to say but comments without emotions, long silences, no stress, a creepy calm and frozen smiles of kindness. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly rendered in Den Brysomme mannen. Watch this movie !!!
