It would appear that some previous reviewers had their expectations a little too high in the film. I found the scan of satellite channels for something (not knowing what) and it happened on it. I thought the title could be one of the myriad soft-core porn movies that appear regularly on film channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was some masculine frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft-core title - go figure it out!), This wasn't the film's goal. It was simply fun. <br /> <br /> Don't be deceived by my taste: my recent screenings have included Before Night Falls and Europe, Europe (both geat, IMHO). But I also like the total mental shutdown when I watch a movie. Virtual sexuality has done this for me and it's not a bad thing!
