This is a well-made piece by everyone's favorite suspense master. As usual, technical elements such as camera work and lighting are exceptional (especially for the film). I didn't find the first part of the film very exciting, but the latter certainly made up for it with one exciting scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like about this film was Farley Granger's choice for the part of Guy Haines. Somehow, I didn't find it very credible. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines as the sinister 'bad' Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> In general, I highly recommend it.
