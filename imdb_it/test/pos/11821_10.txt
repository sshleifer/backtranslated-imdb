I had seen The Cure when I was a child and I really enjoyed it then. Now, years later, I got a copy of a copy almost by accident, and I looked at it again. Being a child, you don't have the ability to get the things you want on your own, it's usually your parents' prerogative - but when I looked at it again now I was sorry I didn't do more to get a copy of this film then, and consequently almost forgot it until today. <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie. It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a tough-looking and maladjusted boy - who takes inspiration from his horrible and violent mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy who has AIDS. <br /> <br /> Right, you say. Another of "those". A tearful jerker. A bucket film. A moral queue. Yes, I know, I hate those too. Only this is not. It is one of the very few films among those I have seen that brings out a very rare trick: it transmits a truly sad story (and yes, a moral story) but without a single moment in which it feels disgusting, forced or in some other way " hollywoody ". It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL guys, who interact like REAL children do. And through this interaction, the good-natured and affectionate character of the older boy, Eric, begins to shine through his "tough" character, while he takes care of Dexter, his younger HIV-positive neighbor. . Together, they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which for Erik seems to be around the corner - so that all this stupid AIDS thing will go away and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> Production is first rate. But of course, what this film really brings are the performances of the two protagonists - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Above all Mazzello, which is simply amazing: it conveys a sense of fragility necessary for a sick boy, but at the same time manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. Shines in the scene where the boys face Pony: his impulse to protect his old friend pushes him forward, urges him to say what he says - and only later, the horror is painted on his face, as he realizes that what he said himself is true: his blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments, especially the scenes with his mother: he perfectly describes how this macho, street boy, is left completely frozen and numb in front to his violent and violent mother, and I can't make you a word to contradict her while forbidding her relationship with the sick boy out of fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also offers a memorable performance like Dexter's mother, who eventually becomes, in a sense, also a maternal figure for Erik. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time when I was in school in America and I loved it - it's not a given movie about this guy at all. But the behavior of the children in this film was so real that I could easily identify with them. Ironically, the teacher who showed us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in contact with her) got into trouble for it, as some genitals complained about having the scene when the two guys are watching a Playboy ... Pathetic. Seriously, Americans will never get over this ridiculous phobia, I don't know. There was a hardly distinguishable stroke of a playboy cover in the film and therefore it is not shown in schools ... how sad. Children need to see this movie. It is more stimulating and educational than all the official "after-school" specials put together. <br /> <br /> Oh, and another thing. I know I'm wandering, but still ... The score. It's great. I am a musician and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well-known jazz pianist and record producer. Until this film, I didn't really know that I also made the scores on the films, even though later, when I checked, I discovered that I had unknowingly seen several films on which he worked. Really, a wonderful job there. <br /> <br /> All in all, a solid Ten. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I'll definitely see it with my younger siblings - they can watch a movie like this among all the standard hysterias of special effects they usually see.
