Gilles Mamouni is playing with the public with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his greatest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before getting engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashback sequences without warning, so the best way to know where we are in history is to watch the actor's cut. Oerwise can get very confusing ... Still a strong cinematic debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the fifth element, Messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a treasure to watch ... I felt a little disappointed towards the end so I gave 9 out of 10.
