But George and Gracie are not among them. The film is fun and the billiard scene with WC Fields must be among the most fun I've ever seen, but Gracie and George are more irritating than comic in their roles, partly due to a lack of script and partly to their performance. I gave a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, WC is a treasure of comic timing and energy in this.
