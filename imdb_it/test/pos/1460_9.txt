There are only a few films that can be called "must see" and SHEPHERED is one of those movies. In many ways he was ahead of his time (and it can be said that he was a source of inspiration for many well-known films) Copied by many, equaled by no one, this is really a great film. <br /> <br /> The story is complex, but it is explained as a tense but often entertaining thriller and a highly provocative exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people have to live underground and chaos reigns. C. Thomas Howell is a "pastor" who protects the population of various religious leaders by killing all unsuitable members of society. The whole idea made me think of our society. It's really a brilliant social commentary, which is more than I can say for some recent science fiction / action successes. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not give the feeling that a real innovation was in progress, only boring effects of the video game. But SHEPHERD also marks on the action scale ... <br /> <br /> Not once does this film let the viewer catch his breath. Peter Hayman proves to be one of the few brilliant action directors. We are talking about 100% kung fu fights, high level and down home! It was excellent. Really great special effects, shoot-out, cyber-punk gloomy-futuristic noir style ?? the film really has its elements. <br /> <br /> When it comes to SHEPHERD, it is impossible not to mention how much style it has. The vision of this city is truly amazing. Remember the images of Tim Burton's memorable vision of Gotham in Batman. And these panoramas are photographed by Graeme Mears with a degree of skill that shames Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall. Even the special effects turned out to be surprising. Undoubtedly the scenes in which the fighting occurs are landmarks throughout the cinema. This film is a ballet of exceptional visualization. <br /> <br /> And yet, behind it all, there is an interesting story, carried on by a strong cast. The acting (in particular Rowdy Piper) and the plot are both fantastic and excellently directed. In contrast to a lot of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor, the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit. I'm always proud to see a great movie like SHEPHERD. It is a pity that he did not receive a good distribution and did nothing at the box office. It is a rarity that is worth looking for. This film will impress you and make you feel 10 times more beautiful to have seen it!
