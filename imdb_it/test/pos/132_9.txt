This film strongly demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this against the background of an India that is fighting for freedom from these same values. This film is both political and personal and never too wordy or idealistic on both fronts. It is easy to understand why "fire" caused revolts in India, but still tragic. A real film like this deserves to be seen by all the people of the world, not only by privileged westerners.
