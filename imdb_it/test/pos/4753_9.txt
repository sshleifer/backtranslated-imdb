While both this film and the auteur chase showed a lack of respect by many critics, both are definitely above average. Roy Scheider does a great job interpreting his best type; a tough and courageous policeman who works hard to get the job done despite the drivers and politicians who should support him rather than hinder him. (He starred in a suburban version of this same role as the chief of the town's tourist police in Jaws. Not as gritty, but he "gets the job despite the politicians" and brave approach. "If a man who can't swim and is terrified from everything in the water that comes out on an old boat with an aspiring Ahab and a nerd, to face a huge killer shark, it's not brave, so tell me what it is ...). <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco "He's as good as a surprisingly complex villain; most villains have a certain depth and complexity. This is one of those films that improves with repeated visualizations. Overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of the city of New York: gritty, little glamorous, often dangerous, but full of energy. The story is spartan, narrow and thin, gets the job without extraneous elements.It may not be one of the great ones of all time, but it is an exceptionally good film. <br /> < br /> Each h to an opinion on car chases. Mine is that this is right there with the Mustang fighter vs Dodge Charger in Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to the Mustang in that it was a compact car chassis with reinforced suspension and a small powerful V8 block inserted in an engine compartment intended for a tasteless 6. The Ventura / Novas gained little respect from the drag strip, but with the correct suspension mods, they made accessible performance cars that could handle both on the road and on the track. The mumbling of those GM V8s as they finish is music for the ear of enthusiasm. I heard this pursuit criticized for "imitating" Bullitt's pursuit. The truth is that they are two works by the same master, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and led the chase to the French Connection. In addition to leading most of the chase scenes, he created a dark and malevolent presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as a couple of evil killers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the pursuit has often noticed "realism errors", such as the use of 3 different streets of New York to represent the Palisades Parkway, the end of the chase in an 18-wheeler accident on a road only for passenger vehicles, and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape damage. This is beyond the point. Let's face it: the pursuits of film cars are "unreal" by nature. In Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, however, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni have created much more realistic pursuits, and therefore more exciting, than the fanciful pursuits of flying, rotating vehicles that explode so common in recent films .
