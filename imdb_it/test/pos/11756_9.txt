Those prophetic words were uttered by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beautiful Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failed marriage on the beach. They start a relationship, despite the enormous odds of adultery and racial problems. In Hollywood in the 1950s, the interracial novel was allowed, but only with terrible consequences in the end. Beautiful scenery of Hong Kong (even if some scenes on the beach seem set in the studio), a famous song of the title, poetic script, enchanting background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, exceptional shows, in particular Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did "The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones", still makes this world-class novel more pungent.
