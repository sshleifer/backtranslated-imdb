I'm surprised there is confusion about the title of this film. Clearly, it is an investigation into the nature of modern love. He is suggesting that love is love while the course is good, but in which people reserve the right to put themselves first, and if the game gets tough, they go out and move on to something else. <br /> <br /> This observation has generational implications, since it comes from Generation X, comments on Generation X, and eventually turns to Generation X. It expresses disappointment that love has turned from what the Baby Boomers , the parents of Generation X, had generated their marriages and their family lives, and this gave Generation X the innocent and generous childhood it eventually enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Generation X's attitude towards love is, of course, irreverent, but when decisions are made and commitments are broken, the greatest victim is the children of Generation X. This was clarified at the end of the film, and it was so pungent that it took me a week to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany.
