This film is almost never seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it again and again is a slightly worn VHS copy I made when the film was shown on TV in 1991 here in England. <br /> <br /> the ensemble cast is obviously enjoying itself and this is reflected in the spectator. An extremely sharp script helps things and, once you've seen this, you'll want to watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is the "star" but everyone contributes to a great film, with a fantastic jazz soundtrack to boot. There are emotional moments during the film, but never to the point of a malarious sweet sentimentality - these are guys on the journey of a lifetime, and they convey that wonderful excitement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you can really get to see it.
