Although it is a Christmas movie, "Christmas in Connecticut" could have been done at any time of the year, as it is the story of a soldier who spends what must be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. This is what he thinks. In fact, the woman in question, played by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular column about life on a farm with her husband and child. It has no farm, no husband and no child, nor the many recipes it publishes. They belong to the owner of the nearby restaurant. When her columnist, Sydney Greenstreet, insists that she entertains Private Dennis Morgan, she enlists her boyfriend's help to use her farm and transports herself and the restaurateur there. There is also a child ... well, actually, there is more than one. Chaos follows and the farce becomes more and more difficult to play, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, and even if you are severely depressed, "Christmas in Connecticut" can get you out of it. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful because the career woman has become a housewife. Although not as flashy as Crawford or Davis, she was still able to do what any role required - it could be cheap, elegant, hot, bad, cold and / or sexy and she makes it seem easy. Moreover, it is always attractive and seductive. Dennis Morgan is a beautiful and charming loner; as an added bonus, he uses his Irish tenor. Boyfriend Reginald Gardner is all for business, and you can say that he is not quite right for Stanwyck. S.Z. Sakall as the fake uncle / true chef is hilarious, especially as he prays Stanwyck can throw a pancake in front of an audience. I can imagine the impact that this delightful film had at the end of the Second World War. It must have been a real beacon for the best times to come.
