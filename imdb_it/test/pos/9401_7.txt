I recently rented Twister, a movie I had seen several years ago on TV, and aged well; I found myself laughing out loud several times and, strangely like all these people, in the end I was deeply worried about them. This is the kind of little film made for a cult audience because, rather like Howdy's gazpacho (well, I think that's what it is), it's an acquired taste: you have to be in tune with its peculiar wavelength. The production values ​​could be charitably called economic and the pace and atmosphere take some time to settle, but the film has a "look", especially in some wonderful shots that contrast the dry flatness of the earth with the nouveau-riche opulence of the palace interior: even Michael Almereyda had a good eye. Life with the sodapop tycoon Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his family (two adult sons, a nephew and a housekeeper) seem so detached from life outside that we could be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this film is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as the brilliant brothers without direction Maureen and Howdy), inhabiting their roles so comfortably after a while that you buy the strange premise, which somehow survived the tornado and he is apparently incapable of happiness, these people are fortunate, yet they do not know what to do with their fortune. There are some really great scenes: Eugene's sudden clashes first with his girlfriend Virginia, the television host for children who digs gold, (an acid Lois Chiles), then with his children; William S. Burroughs takes the practice of shooting in the barn and tells a story about a mysterious Jim; Maureen's boyfriend, Chris, proved himself by fighting a shed full of wasps clothed in tablecloths and doilies and old fedoras; Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris are all sitting on the couch (the last three in very light summer dresses, the first in a red blazer and a rock'n'roll gear in black leather) that hold the images of deserts on the huge TV and contemplate the future (the images were made by Bill Viola, who did the video installation in the background for the last tour of Nine Inch Nails). Crispin Glover is predictably magnificent as Howdy: as always, he remains perfectly in character. Howdy has made a cult of his misery and brilliance; it's like the Oscar Wilde of Kansas, striving to live up to his red velvet suit. Whether you're destroying at full force on an electric guitar, bursting a whip while wearing an all-black cowboy suit, tearing down a room, or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the aforementioned soup from a blender launcher, it's fascinating . If you like his job, you will like this.
