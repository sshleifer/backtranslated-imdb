I find this movie meritricito, hesitant, lethargic and cleverly a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script, turn on the camera and act like an idiot. I find the performance, the lighting, the cinematography, the sound and the laws of the film school that D 'Urville Martin made fun. Speaking from a director's point of view, there are times when I just want to throw everything and have fun on the set. This movie looks funny. When other aspiring directors ask me for advice, I simply tell them to watch a film by Rudy Ray Moore. They always remain a perplexed look wondering why not look at the masters Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I laugh and add that you always want to know what not to do in the cinematic story first.
