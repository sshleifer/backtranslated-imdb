I saw this movie for the first time in video form. Even on a television screen, the views were impressive. Seen on the big screen in all its glory, it must have wiped out people. <br /> <br /> As one or two other comments have pointed out, the story of the early pioneers and how they circumvented land problems etc. on the way to Oregon it is as authentic as any film can be. It therefore shows that it is not absolutely necessary to take liberties with truth - something that today's filmmakers should take into account - the reality is sufficient. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on man's struggle against native hostile elements. The subplots are few and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere I saw Paramount's rival on the big track, Fighting Caravans. Despite having a more sophisticated plot, and having better actors, Fighting Caravans lacks breathtaking scenes. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail should be a mandatory view.
