This film was a pleasant surprise because I didn't expect much. I didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in the major pix. While switching to the Matrix is ​​not an advantage in my (hated) book, I'm sure it's an extra career for Hugo. James Purefoy is great at this and Jennifer Ehle is sweet and wonderful. After 30 years, after a few years, it seemed a delight on Carnaby Street, but I liked the thrift store, Janis Joplin's clothes mixed with the modern mentality of sexual and gender blur. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his ads is a lot of fun. Iron John's men's group meetings are a little dated, but I still loved them. It's a sexual comedy of social satire in the best way and reminds me a little of the old "Carry On" movies. The British know how to make sexual comedies and it is an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is too prudent to really understand that sex is fun.
