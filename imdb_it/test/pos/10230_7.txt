I liked this movie. The way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the film, is very good. Also, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was great! I wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except of course for the murders). <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the creatures for this film, although this film probably had a fairly low budget, the mutants / creatures / monsters looked fantastic, especially since 1990. This is definitely a unique film and not a crap. It makes me want to find a reading of the novel on which it is based. This is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and "monsters" are those with humanity.
