Dan Dailey offers a sincere and colorful performance like the great Dizzy Dean. His character management is very faithful to life and captures the flavor of Dean's background and limited education. The film, of course, revolves around Dizzy Deans and reaches fame and his sudden trip to the bench with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his displeasure. His wife is beautifully played by Joanna Dru who gives a very simple quality to the woman who loved and supported the baseball player who rose to "dizzy height" so quickly. The portrait of Dizzy's subsequent career as a sports journalist is honest and resolute, reflecting his problems that stemmed from his lack of education and his colorful language, both on and off air. Dizzy was quite a character and Daily breathed life into his story with admirable skill. If you enjoyed this movie, I recommend the comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953) in which Daily plays the role of the idolized baseball player by his young son (Billy Chapin). The newspaper reassembles a baseball player completely satisfactorily. I strongly recommend the pride of St. Louis to baseball fans around the world.
