I consider Saboteur the first "American" film by Hitchcock, because the story takes place completely in the United States. There are brilliant scenes in this film. Scene of the Statue of Liberty, Barry Kane jumping from the bridge into the water, the scene of the waterfall is incredible. It's not Hitchcock's fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted. Originally Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the main roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper was not interested in making a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of the best directors. Although Rebecca has been a huge success, most of the film's success went to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick won the Oscar for best film for Rebecca. And Hitchcock didn't get an Oscar for best director for Rebecca. Hitchcock began to attract attention after the Foreign Correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a reduced budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to convince Joel McCrea for this film, because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again with a low salary. He liked working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent (1940). But it wasn't available. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings "a competent artist". I thought he was doing his best. He was a lesser known actor who was willing to play a role when many great actors refused to play the main male role. <br /> <br /> Regarding the female lead, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the lead role. They weren't interested either. So Universal decided to give the role to Priscilla Lane. I read in a book that this was one of his favorite movies. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene at the house of the blind. This is my favorite scene. If we listen more closely to the dialogue in the scenes that happen in the house of Uncle Filippo, we will see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) was studying the character of Barry Kane the moment he entered his home. As Barry entered the house, he heard Barry's handcuffs. Through conversation, he realized that Barry Kane is not a criminal at all. We also see his hearing ability through those scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car saying "Is it a car that comes?" Uncle Philip says "2 cars I think." Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane did a great job playing her role. It wasn't a big star. But I thought his performance was really good. Another brilliant scene in Uncle Filippo's house is the scene in which he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin) "Are you scared, Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel?" I thought Otto Krueger played the villain brilliantly. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role. Mr. President in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". I want to mention more about this film. But I think my post is too long. <br /> <br /> Each Hitchcock movie is special in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans will like this movie. I rate 10 out of 10.
