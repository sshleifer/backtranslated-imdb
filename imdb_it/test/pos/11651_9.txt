This film is about a very delicate subject and if you're looking for something that makes you think here you're right. Tim Robbins did a great job and the result is a kind of docu-drama that should be shown in schools (for the strong topics covered). And the actors? Well, they are simply great; Susan Sarandon is really "the face of love" and Sean Penn is incredible as almost always. A must see!
