Valley Girl is the definitive movie of the 80s with captured phrases filtered in this wonderfully acted movie. The characters are so convincing that you forget it's a movie and not a video of a real "day in the life" of any high school, USA. This film is for the 80s what the Brady Bunch TV series is from the 70s. If you don't like it, well then "take me with a spoon".
