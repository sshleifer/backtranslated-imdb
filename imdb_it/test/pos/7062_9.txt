I took it on television one day when I was young and I love it. In the 1970s there were a lot of hobbling comedies that tried too much to be funny, so it was a nice surprise. It is one of the best comedies of the 70s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to the excellent comic performance of Murrary, which is still one of his greatest. This is the film that has really noticed Ivan Reitman as a director. Reitman demonstrates with this film that he is one of the most talented directors of the comedy of all time. While this movie is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so ugly that it's funny, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely terrible. Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
