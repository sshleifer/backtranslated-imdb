If you are a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you are in great luck. This film is a documentary on the current music of Istanbul, ranging from the traditional to the modern. Is very good. You couldn't have done better if you went to Istanbul alone. We receive interviews with Orhan Gencebay, clips of concerts of modern music icons, a road show with a Roman audience (Gypsy), Turkish Hip Hop (surprisingly very very good) and much more. Some of the best female singers I've ever heard. A Kurdish woman singing in a hammam (turkish bath) that rips your heart out. A lot of social and political background. If this is your case, you will have a great time. I can barely stand still in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The CD soundtrack is now available on Amazon. Expensive.
