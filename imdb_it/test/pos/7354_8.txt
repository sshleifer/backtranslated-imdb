After the return of "horror movies" (come on Scream it's not scary!) I didn't have much hope for this low-cost three-story horror movie. But I was positively surprised! Man is scary !!! The first 2 stories are simply brilliant. The first of a new spouse who drives in a dark forest with their camper, when they run into a fierce ........ (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man obsessed with a little girl, who is home alone for a night ... I know it doesn't look special but it's scary. I promise you. The last story is not scary, but at least not bad. It is a motorcyclist and a haunted house. In reality the stories are based on real urban legends (I guess kevin williamson can also steal ideas). Recent this movie is good !!! I'd say it's the scariest three-story horror movie ever made!
