There are several ways to misunderstand this film and some of them have been shown in some of the previous comments. This is a film to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not comparable to the opera, book or other films of Carmen seen before. It is only for himself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because it is the first step to deny films the possibility of being independent creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction, costumes and photography are extremely well put together to obtain a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And this brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichés in the film. Well, historically the film is extremely well studied and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the "black Spain" of knife and espadrilles that Goya portrayed so vividly, but it is also of that part of history seen by a foreigner fascinated by the folkloric side of that society. Honestly, anyone who doesn't want to see any cliché about Spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case those clichés are presented before they become one and the way to see them is to get rid of our prejudices. <br /> <br /> Another important requirement to properly understand this film is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize an actor's performance for not understanding his lines. If all the rest of the public has done it, the problem is probably somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with his Andalusian accent and everything he says is understandable and credible. His Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also gives a convincing portrait of the Basque officer who has become a "bandolero", and his accent is very well learned. <br /> <br /> No less important is having a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "horrible" suggests that the author of the sentence entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had a critic in Spain in one of the most prestigious newspapers who recommended us the photos he found arousing homosexuals, without mentioning them explicitly. And this was absolutely not right for the rest of us, especially for those who had not noticed that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers did not necessarily have to cure. I'm not suggesting at all that the review had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different from those of us who went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got. Paz Vega It's Carmen, and excellent, in the film by Vicente Aranda.
