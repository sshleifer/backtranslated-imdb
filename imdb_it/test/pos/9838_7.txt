This is not a "real" vehicle of James Cagney since his screen time is unusually thin. Frankie Darro plays the boy Jimmy Smith, the head of a street gang of thugs who is sent to reform the school with some of his hooligan friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, himself a ringleader, who is assigned the position of deputy commissioner. When he finds out about the brutal treatment put to the test in the reform school, he is forced to make some important changes with the help of the reforming nurse (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> THE MAYOR OF HELL has a fast pace and is still fun after all these years. The cast is well rounded with: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, "Farina" Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
