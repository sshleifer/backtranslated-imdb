Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera of THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her as much. It is the focal point of a bittersweet love story against the backdrop of the Second World War in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its stunning black and white cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in first place, since I had never heard of it and decided to try it when it is aired on TCM. <br /> <br /> It is a moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away as a soldier in Russia in wartime. He can't forget the memory of his romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably he marries someone who forced himself into her, a pianist who soon realizes that he still loves the soldier he hopes to hear. Their marriage is troubled because he cannot let go of his memory of a happier moment with his soldier. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, accept the idea that it will never come back and is able to face reality and face the situation. There is a very touching final scene in a train station where soldiers arriving are greeting their loved ones and the girl in tears shares the joy of returning soldiers giving some flowers from her bouquets to joyful families. <br /> <br /> fashionable and surprising cinematographic work is what brings the film, as well as the honestly played plot. <br /> <br /> Tastefully done, but perhaps the English subtitles did not tell the whole story because some of the plot elements seemed a little blurry to me as if they had been overlooked. <br /> <br /> In summary: it's easy to see why he won awards at the Cannes Film Festival. It reminded me, in style, of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
