I look at Lackawanna Blues every time he arrives. It brings me happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the midwest. It reminds me of when I was a child, even though my situation was a little different and the feeling is the same. I wonder if everything we'll ever know about families will be lost. The great mothers of the day are under 55 years old. They will see that they know what it takes to be an inspiration to others. I hope I wasn't the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. The music was great in this movie. I really felt like I went to the movies that I would pay to see it. While watching the film for the second time, I realized who the life of this film was. He did a great job writing and producing this film. I imagine it's better to produce a film based on your life than you. As soon as I can, I will get a copy for my home use. I really like black producers or directors who make movies look like they live in the right time. Thanks for such a great movie.
