"Cherry" tells of a naive and unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby but is not quite sure how to proceed. This little sleeper is full of bizarre characters and ironic situational humor. Cool, funny, breaking things, I really enjoyed this movie ... for what it's worth. Recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.
