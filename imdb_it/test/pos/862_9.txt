Wow, Star Shorts are great! Many customers from the State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have achieved anything better then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew that short comedies could be useful. My favorites were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David organize a meeting with his cousin Greg. I think of all that David was the most fun. It's fun when it doesn't make sense. I like music in shorts. This is something to which you pay close attention. They have always had good taste in music. I wish they were still wearing shorts, or that they would bring the sitcom there. I hope they keep making good and funny comedies.
