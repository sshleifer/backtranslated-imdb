Have I seen this film about the most unlikely success? , from a lower league, soccer team. The plot is dense and reads some large curves and turns. Intercut with shots and comments from the 70s. I was stunned by his exciting enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> A great cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazy (drunk) manager, who bumble along holding on to everything that will make his team win ...? I still remember bits like the stolen secret file that Don Revie (Super leeds united and manager in England, loved by fans hated by everyone else) has on Bostock United (the men under the nose) who in his detailed report of their opposition Bostock United, in this the FA Cup final, simply says "Sh-te". <br /> <br /> A lot of other footy gags long before the fantastic "Mike Basset - Football Manager" feature with Ricky Tomlinson. <br /> <br /> Up there with the Gung I have English beating the Germans, at soccer. Good morally. Although the score lines say different, of "Escape to Victory" (I still cheer when England scores) <br /> <br /> and the thankless eternal cry to follow a really bad team in Micheal Palins "Golden Gordon "from the series" Ripping Yarns "(with Terry Jones) the team was called Bostonworth United, if interested. <br /> <br /> I looked up and down for a copy of the Bostock's Cup, even the biography of Nick Hancock does not list it (probably someone -not mr hancocks- error) <br /> <br /> reproduce it again or sell me a copy- PLEASE ....
