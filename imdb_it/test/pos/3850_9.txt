I'm not a big Disney fan, but my 7-year-old son is starting to get into them, so we've created a fairly large collection, and this is one of my favorites. We saw it for the first time a couple of weeks ago and we must have seen it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of the plots, but there is more in a film than that. <br /> <br /> Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler is not far behind. The music is superb - my disabled son always insists that I pick him up and dance with him to "Everyone wants to be cats", that says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as nice. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people have a negative aspect in this film besides the antipathy for cats! And yes, it takes some of his signals from "101 Dalmations", and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (It's been a long time since I've seen it, so I'm not going to compare them), and while "101 Dalmations" it's better somehow, for me "The Aristogats" is a lot more fun. Is this not the meaning of these films? <br /> <br /> In addition to "Peter Pan" (now a 10/10 movie), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41-year-old dad loves it, so you can't ask for much more than a family movie. <br /> <br /> Superb!
