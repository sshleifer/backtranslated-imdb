* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film was when it was re-released on video when I was about 8 years old. Now I'm 17 and I still look at it every time I get the chance. "The Aristocats" was a nice warming film of the heart that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs in particular the one that the kittens sing on the piano. In fact, I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and my friend because I loved it so much. All three puppies are so cute and their mother is one of the most beautiful cats I've ever seen. The cat Ally had a beautiful voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film is when the kittens play the piano. That part is adorable. I also like their journey home. It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I give this 10/10 star movie.
