I remember seeing this film as a child and I was completely terrified, I couldn't look away from the television. This movie has everything for horror fans! This movie had no funny moments expecting a couple of liners at the hands of a henchman (who was my favorite character in the movie) kevin tenney directed this gem and did a great job with a low budget, I thought the end was the only thing that could stop them was to survive the night when they were unstoppable killing machines! the effects of Steven Johnson are excellent. I would recommend this film to all those who love low-budget horror films because, as the old saying goes, they don't make them that way anymore. Even the sequels were pretty good, but not as good as the original. This is a must in every horror collection, buy it if you can find it you won't be disappointed
