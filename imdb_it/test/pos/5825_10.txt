Oz is the intense, adrenaline-fueled TV show. It is a show that is not aimed at a wide audience but at a specific one because its themes are very adult-oriented. Obviously he didn't achieve mainstream success because it was impossible, but he had a lot of fame with his audience and many famous or guest starred actors or became part of the show. <br /> <br /> Oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in the state of New York. There are many different ethnic groups that play a fairly equal role in being represented. These groups are Muslims, housewives, Aryans, motorcyclists, Italians, Latins, Irish, Christians, gays and others. Some have some form of affiliation among them like the Bikers and the Aryans, while the Aryans are the enemy of numerous groups like the Muslims and the Homeboys. <br /> <br /> In the Oswald penitentiary (its official name) there is a policy that does not allow too many members of an ethnic group to enter. It is the maximum security prison and the normal prison where sometimes prisoners are sent or from the show is called "general population" or "gen pop". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill who also narrates the plot before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary type and a biographical one. Hill is intended for wheelchair use as a result of its unknown past. It is part of the "others" group which presents individuals who do not adapt to other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> Of the many groups, the youngest are the ones who are able to avoid having time when the older ones are in conflict with each other. Some of the most noteworthy characters are the following: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is responsible for his Irish colleagues and somehow he always voluntarily gets involved in a lethal activity for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is the Latin watched who has continuous struggles to cope with his popularity within his own band and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys band. It is also very physically quite large and solid. These two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful detainees in Oz. 4) Karim Said is the Muslim nationalist and black who is very defined in his opinions and desires. He fights for the rights of his people on many levels through the show, from his own Muslim group, to his larger black group and even fighting for all groups against the unjust rules of authority. The character seems somehow identical to Malcolm X, the famous fighter for black rights who was also a Muslim. <br /> <br /> All in all, for its genre Oz is perhaps the greatest (imaginary show or show based on ethnic relations). If it does not seem that your type of series probably should not be tried, but if you are interested, then it is certainly worth seeing. The biggest problem with the show is how compelling it is, some may be mistaken to see a lot of this kind of material. The researchers discuss whether it is harmful or not but in the end it is only a reflection of the society of the world in which we live today. This means that it is like an informant and an indicator of an aggressor's world.
