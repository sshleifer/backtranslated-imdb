I'm always struck by the fact that a director (and this director / screenwriter of this case) takes a piece of classic text and makes it live. Of course, Shakespeare's text can give you goose bumps even if hammered of personal importance, but to see a production in which true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more - with the arrangement of contexts or nuances that are not found in the indications of scene is simply terrifying. There are many worrying things about the game. It's a racist game about racism - and this continues to be enough. I never accepted Jessica's desertion from Jessica without an acceptable reason. I have never accepted the position of Christians of hypocrisy hypocrisy. But brilliantly, there is a prologue of text that helps us understand the times and the politics in which the story is set, and fortunately, much of Jessica's part is cut off. <br /> <br /> The text is rather reduced to many cut passages. But I only noticed a line that was cut the moment I expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. This economy and judicious editing gave us a compelling film - not just a comedy movie. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a reason why Antonio is so loyal and generous towards the undeserving / unrelated Bassanio - you can almost hear Antonio's pulse starting to run when he sees Bassanio passing by in a gondola , or that comes for a visit. But it's so thin ... nothing more. I was enchanted. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I heard the arguments during the trial be heartbreaking. And the trials of suitors are hilarious. <br /> <br /> Add all this to the glorious cinematography and costumes that resonate with the times, and you'll see why I can't wait to see it again. It is again.
