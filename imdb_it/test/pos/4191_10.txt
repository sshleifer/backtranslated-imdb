This almost ignored masterpiece is about the Monkees who become aware of being fictional characters in a film (Head) and that everything they do or say has already been written in an (invisible) script that they seem to follow. The head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip to a suite in an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monks have only acted in it. <br /> <br /> They fight in every way possible by doing things that are not in the script. They deliberately flub their lines, walk out sets, knock down scenery, hit other actors for no reason; and eventually they commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. <br /> <br /> For example, in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you look frame by frame, you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and the cameraman, deliberately shooting in a mirror. He is revealing that the party is actually false and is shot in a studio with actors who suddenly abandon the character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells "cut"! <br /> <br /> The Monkees, however, never abandon the character because those characters are also who they really are. This ends up being the heart of the Apocalypse to come. <br /> <br /> At every turn, they realize that their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they had to do in the script movie that they could not escape being in. Do you say they went crazy and walked in the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hanging from the ceiling as a set background)? No problem! Hey, it's the Monkees, and those wacky kids keep the monkeys around! <br /> <br /> In the end, even their death did not free them. This was how the film should have ended, and their still, water-impregnated bodies were fished from the river, placed in another box and stacked in a movie studio warehouse until the characters are back again needed for another studio production. <br /> <br /> This is made even more touching by the fact that the Monkees are really fictional characters who have established themselves in the real world. They did it through the power of their music. <br /> <br /> Ironically, towards the end, Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as an extremely profound revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately no one listens. <br /> <br /> Peter understands: "It doesn't matter if we're in the box (the movie)". It means that it doesn't matter if the will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you let the present moment occur and occur ... You just have to let 'now' BE HAPPEN, as it happens", without analyzing, evaluating or judging whether the experience is "valid" from an abstract definition. <br /> <br /> When you can't even tell the difference, being free or not doesn't matter - tying yourself to understand if you're the "real", you're just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this film at a very important moment in my life. I was trying to figure out how to avoid being just "that crazy and creepy nerd girl" thinking intensely instead of having fun (ie, having sex) like everyone else. But the revelation in Testa broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know. <br /> <br /> For decades I saw "Head" and I wanted to thank Pete. <br /> <br /> Was it a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uhh, what to say, like ... <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
