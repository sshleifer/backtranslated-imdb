Destined to be a classic before it was conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are gaining the attention of computer players, the graphic adventures are an endangered race. With great play on words and humor, The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that people of all ages would appreciate. Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. * prediction * the sequel Escape of Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic. I guarantee it.
