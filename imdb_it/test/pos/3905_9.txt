I remember seeing an Elgabrie Montgomery film when I was maybe 5 years old (if that were the case) and I can still remember this film (in pieces and fragments). it was the movie I remembered all my life because I was so scared. I think I remember the story in part and the house is constantly dark. the main part that was the strangest for me was Elizabeth walking around the house all in the dark and then there was someone in the field outside. At the time I thought I was an old witch, but the memory of it now is so confusing, so I can't remember who it was but it was definitely someone in a field outside ... and that part is what scared me the most . I would really like to see this movie again. if anyone knows how to get a copy, email me at valid908@yahoo.com
