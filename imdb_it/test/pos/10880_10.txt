This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I've played a lot of first person shooters, and I've never really liked any of them, but this game has something I can't understand, which makes it really fun. . Maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game. Perhaps it is the fluid movement of the characters. Maybe it's gadgets and weapons. Perhaps it is the sweet character of James Bond. Whatever it is, this game never seems to age, no matter how many times I've played it.
