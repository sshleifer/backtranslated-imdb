This lasted several years despite the late hour in which he was. <br /> <br /> Like many of the detective films of the 1980s, it seemed cool. Both physically and figuratively. This is not a bad thing though. And the (obviously) low budget actually worked in his favor. Gritty during a time when "slick" was in. <br /> <br /> The wraparound segments of Allan Royal as the journalist gave him a slight margin. <br /> <br /> The only actors I remembered were Scott Nylands (Earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). The barely known cast was a good thing because you could see the group as a whole and not as a group of people supporting a "star". And yes, that's a young Clark Johnson (Homicide) in a recurring place. <br /> <br /> I hope the release of a DVD is in the future. Anyone out there want to get to that?
