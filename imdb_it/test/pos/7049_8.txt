I know it was a goofy movie, but I enjoyed it immensely. It's one of the experiences that makes me smile when someone says "Bill Murray". I almost always like films that involve the loser, and this movie has more disadvantages than you can count. Overall, it's a kind film: some of the adults are not closely related, but laughter is accepted rather than brutal like so many teenage movies these days. Wealthy children across the lake have a beating, but none they know at all. I never went to the field, but I did some things that were quite parallel and most of the "bits" and tricks worked properly. They have even been underestimated at times, but I'm sure it was an accident. The cast performed well, with Bill Murray showing the clues of what he would become. It's not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but, hey, a good laugh should be appreciated these days, but then ... it doesn't matter ................. .... ..........
