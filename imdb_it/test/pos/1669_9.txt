A recent reissue of the French criminal film (original title "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes"), with its famous series of silent 20-minute trumpets, now arrives in the United States with a splendid new Criterion Collection print with improved subtitles and some extras . Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown, Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was blacklisted. Rififi has been well publicized in the United States and has done well in art houses. Later, Dassin became much more famous in the United States for "Never on Sunday" (1960) with his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again spellbound and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Zalba's '64 Greek 'by Mihalis Kakogiannis, which was also a great success in Cairo.) The new DVD Rififi includes a recent interview with Dassin . Previously I didn't realize that one of the main robbers, Cesar il Milanese, was played by Dassin, who intervened when the original actor became unavailable. He is one of the most memorable characters, a secure and stocky Italian cracker who doesn't speak French. <br /> <br /> Although this classic has all the traps of the French noir film: the black and white world of well-lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, nightclub scenes, including a song of the dramatically filmed and illuminated film performed at the club, the faces of stone and the Gauloises in hand or in the mouth - I don't think it is atmospheric or has a look just as characteristic a style as the films of Melville. But there is hypnotic robbery, which still holds up like a tour de force. It goes like a watch, with a subtle sense of the craft and teamwork among the thieves. Some nosy cops are efficiently treated. Things go badly right after coming home and handing out the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a lady a ring with a million dollar bracelet. Has there ever been a robbery film whose perp have lived happily ever after? <br /> <br /> It is the sequence of wordless robberies that guarantees this special place, and Dassin, an American director with an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves full credit for this. He took a novel so conventional that he would reject it and added some key elements that make it special. In the case, he could not pass on the adaptation: he needed too much money. Jean Servais, who plays the protagonist Tony le Stephanois, was a rather unfortunate actor. His sad face is perfect for the role. He later starred in He Who Must Die (1957) by Dassin, who used French actors in Greece for a political story. 'Topkapi' is a rather disappointing 1964 film (it pales in comparison to 'Rififi') which also achieved distribution in the United States. It has a good setting, but it is wasted, made everything tasteless, brilliant and refined. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood opera, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy acronym and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won the Best Film Award at Cannes in 1960); 'He who must die' the political choice; 'Reform' the choice of the kind. A strange piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). The purists of hard Hollywood genre would avoid them and would prefer Dassin's first films, including a prison drama, "Brute Force" (1947), a police film, "The Naked City" (1948); and two hard core noir, "La strada dei ladri" (1949) and "La notte e la citt√†" (1950). Personally I tend to appreciate the French noir and the American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original material of American noir origin - hence my constant fascination with "Rififi". But Dassin is rather unique in not only making the Hollywood noir, but then going to Paris and producing a memorable example of his French fifties derivative.
