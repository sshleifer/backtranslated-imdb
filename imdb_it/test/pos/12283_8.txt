This is a fun project, not a film as the title suggests. Good interpretation of Nadia Dajani that recalls the role of Grace. I follow the re-enactment of what happens to Mike and Grace in New York City. He leaves, but wants to get in touch with her. This project is her way of trying to get in touch with her. <br /> <br /> I saw it on IFC. I heard it will also be released on DVD. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope you find it. <br /> <br /> Take a look and have fun. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
