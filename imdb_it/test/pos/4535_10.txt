Holy Schnikey! This movie oscillates! The Chris Farley and David Spade duo are great together. My favorite parts are "Fat Guy in a coat, Oh my God, Room service and other scenes that will be remembered for years to come This movie has a huge following, I wonder why, which shows that even eleven years later Chris La Farley's tragic death is still popular, he plays Tommy who will make you laugh every time you look at him again, he's a great comedian and he's not, Mr Vanga reminds me of Dan Akyroid while Chris Farley reminds me of John Belushi. together. This film is a must-have and should be in the collection of all Snl fans.
