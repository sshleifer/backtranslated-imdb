Well, I tend to watch movies for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this movie, so I can only recommend it about the value of comedy and beautiful women (read girls) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fun, I know because of the number of people in the cinema that laughed regularly. Personally though, I loved it for Laura Fraser, which IMHO is FIT!
