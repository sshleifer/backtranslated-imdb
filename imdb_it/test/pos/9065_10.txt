I really loved this original script and the different places where I got emotionally, spiritually and simply nonsense. I wasn't involved in the "credibility" in the script or in the actors and I didn't even think about it until I read the reviews listed here in IMDb for the film. Listening to Michael Parness talks about his idea of ​​the film, wanting to see how crazy people, or "f'inghi" people, as he says, falling in love is really interesting. I identified with not having a romance as a novel and liked seeing the dysfunction at best. I like watching David Krumholtz in everything he does and I followed his career for a few years. I think this is his best job and tell everyone, just watch this movie to watch a young and amazing actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz was really a scene thief, and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson. I both laughed and cried in this movie and was disappointed that he didn't win any awards at the festival. I wonder why it didn't happen. I gave Max and Grace a dozen because these independent, unique, creative and independent films deserve an audience. Looking at this film technically, is it really well done ?? the colors are fantastic and, finally, it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie for a while.
