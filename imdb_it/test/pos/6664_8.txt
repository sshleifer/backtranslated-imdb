"War movie" is a Hollywood genre that has been made and redone so many times that cliché dialogues, rehashed plot and exaggerated action sequences seem inevitable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. From time to time, however, a war movie arrives that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to the big screen. The Civil War era "Cold Mountain," with Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film. <br /> <br /> So, once again, calling Cold Mountain "a war movie is not entirely accurate. the film opens with a sequence of beats (quite literally) fast and dirty that shames the director of "Glory" Edward Zwick, but "Cold Mountain" is not about the Civil War as much as the period and the people The story centers on the dishonest Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted by the gruesome war and longing for the beautiful village of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern beauty he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this configuration seems formidable as the romantic interest at home gives the audience enough sympathy to root the tribulations of reluctant soldier on the battlefield. In fact, the previous segments of the film are relatively insignificant and even "Cold Mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, however , while the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the public from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederate) and begins a long odyssey towards home. Meanwhile, returning to the farm, Ada's cultivated ways prove to be of little use in the fields; soon it will turn into something wild. Coming to Ada is the course, Ruby Thewes, hard as nails, played by Renée Zellweger, which helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have caused Ada. <br /> <br /> Within these two scenarios, a vivid, compelling and sometimes very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south takes place. The characters they interact with Inman and Ada are surprisingly complex, enhanced by the wonderful renditions of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's dead father, Ray Winstone as an impotent southern "legal", and Natalie Portman as a deeply disturbed and isolated young mother . All were strongly influenced and changed by "the war of northern aggression", especially for the worse. The dark and pervasive anti-war message, accentuated by an effective and disturbing soundtrack and disturbing and beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the public not so much by the macabre battle scenes as by the scarred earth and the people traumatized for which the war was fought Although the weapons and tactics of war have changed a lot in the last century, the infernal effect on earth is timelessly relevant. <br /> <br /> The director Anthony Minghella manages to keep this mood dark for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather lukewarm climax that makes little justice to the wonderfully trained characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly attached to the beginning and the end of the film, although the intrinsically distant, abstract and even absurd nature of their relationship somehow fits the sad nature of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, "Cold Mountain" has neither the features of a romantic relationship nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain, but also to truly absorb the public in the life of a war-torn people and completely desperate to completely get rid of its terrible repercussions.
