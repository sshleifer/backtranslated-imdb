Honestly I found Wicked Little Things a very nice and funny horror movie. My friend gave me this, and I really saw it as nothing more than a horrible low-class horror movie. Then, after seeing it, I made a very cool and very good mistake and while Ill says that sometimes it seems a bit pointless, and while it may not be the best horror film of all time it is good. I thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother (she seemed very credible and very nice to me). And even if it's a bit clich√© and over the top it's fine. Overall, I have to say that if Afterdark Horror Fest movies are not your style, you should have no trouble watching it, but if you like horror movies, or some evil time than taking a look at Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
