"The Devil in the Dark" is the favorite episode of William Shatner. It's also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the main themes of the series: respect for other life forms. I don't think we can get a clearer example of one of the most interesting ideas on the show. In this episode, Kirk and his crew face a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet. History is an excuse to explore the right that humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Today's concerns with environmental causes make the show more current now than ever. It is extremely well written and tastefully executed by our beloved cast. A memorable sequence involves Spock joining the monster's mind. A lot of tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) adds fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here.
