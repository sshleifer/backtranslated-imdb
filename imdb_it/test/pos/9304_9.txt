There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's film ABOVE AND BEYOND (flag that really flies inter-service propaganda, if you think that you think the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, ran the whole show!), NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably MUCH closer to the brand), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, starring Sam Waterston. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach as the BBC series, but extends it; avoid the "Gee Whiz" technology of the Manhattan Project and focus on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a vast array of mythical but rather typical people who were part of it. <br /> <br /> With the reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy, academic Ivory Tower that strives to relate his physical contributions to his inclinations to see the world in a broader social and moral context ... only to have that struggle won by a dominating lust for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer considered himself a "superior being" by virtue of his vast and vast intellectual capacity. In the end it was the ruin of Robert Oppenheimer; he considered himself a sort of "philosopher / king", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and should SHOULD) "wisely" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world. development and deployment of nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not determine the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not grant temporal power. When it tries to exercise such inexistent power (as Oppie found when he opposed the development of "The Super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who TRULY have power. <br /> <br /> I found myself blaming Schultz's character in one way; his Oppio exposes himself TOO MUCH closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that have torn his intellectual foundations. The real Oppenheimer should have taken a different approach; at first it should have come to the firm resolution that the project would result in the highest good. The ugliness it has produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to achieve that supreme good, and it must be ignored ... at least until the end of the project when there was free time to assess the gains and losses. Oppie made it clear, and it turned out in his controversial post-war statements that science had known sin now, and that was a knowledge he could never have lost. <br /> <br /> As the project progressed, these considerations had to be put aside if it wanted to maintain its sanity. <br /> <br /> Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's character turns out to be weak, a scared little boy who could NEVER have served as "Rapid Rupture Coordinator", as Oppenheimer unofficially nicknamed his post. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman plays the gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a skillful performance, if probably a SMALL BIT over the top. <br /> <br /> Groves was a trained civil engineer, but first of all he was a SOLDIER and a general to put in motion! He is used to REQUEST that things go the way things go ... intensely guided, a child with a dirty and spoiled mouth that has a tantrum at the drop of a hat, that reveres his country and is not too proud to fall on your knees and pray. In other words, very similar to the REAL soldiers (ie not civil engineer), aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it's its only consideration ... feelings and ego are damned, except for its OWNERS, of course! <br /> <br /> Groves could not admit it, but he knew very well that he NEEDed Oppenheimer; the military degree meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds that he had to ride. <br /> <br /> Again ... I have to criticize the script for this, and for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Actually, Groves already has OPPIE PROPERTIES; if he didn't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the mail in the first place. The story tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some of them stellar like Oppenheimer, simply turned away from Groves' recruitment efforts. At one point, Groves was so desperate that he proposed to EDIT the physicists he needed! <br /> <br /> Groves' attempts at the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY ... they only exist here as a dramatic device that really helps make the movie's atmosphere quite ugly. <br /> <br /> Kusak's "Michael Merriman" is a collection of different real characters, but they come from a different period of time. Several research incidents similar to the one depicted occurred in the search for POSTWAR weapons. <br /> <br /> Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but that is, IMHO, necessary and rather accurate. People with weak stomachs will have difficulty managing hospital sequences; they are all TOO MANY. <br /> <br /> The main idea that emerges, but not enough IMHO, is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed were young, idealistic, naive and talented. Most were on their first trip out of the campus shelter. For them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of "excessive" budget or bureaucratic supervision. <br /> <br /> It was not only their splendor, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to do to make the viewer thoughtfully uncomfortable with this movie. Likewise, if you filter the BS of Hollywood (there's really not much), this is probably a fairly accurate view of the interior of the Manhattan Project.
