Fascinating aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best friend George (the deliciously impassive Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer after graduation. Hoops, George and several friends found come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore in her most fascinating), a singer whose family home was threatened with demolition by the greedy clan of Beckersted. Screenwriter / director Savage Steve Holland offers an unbroken, often exhilarating and ferocious, burst of openly amusing and stupid jokes, but still very funny. The constant madness of madness has a veritable vertiginous, good-natured and contagious vitality that it is impossible not to love or resist. Furthermore, the lively and enthusiastic acting of a refined cast of game adds immensely to the crazy parties: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his silly brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as a villain Aquilla Beckersted asshole, Matt Mulhern as the evil Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the exciting cookie, Joe Flaherty in the role of General Raymond, William Hickey as the annoyed Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as the smug preppy bully Ty, and John Matuszak as the biker Stan. The refined soundtrack by Isidoro Mankofsky, the fashionable soundtrack, the Cory Lerios soundtrack and funky animation are all uniformly excellent. The only funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla dress that terrifies an elegant dinner. A real hoot.
