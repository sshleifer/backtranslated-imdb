I read a couple of reviews of this film, which was recently released on DVD by Eclectic. Apparently, the opening titles are in letterbox format, but the rest (most of them) are full screen. The first version of Planet Video in 1982 is completely in letterbox format. Although it was a primitive version, it got the compositions in the right way. Later versions had sharper and better image quality, but they were full screen like the DVD. Any publication of this film should be in letterbox format, as it significantly adds to the visual experience of the old Planet tape.
