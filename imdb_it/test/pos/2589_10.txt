Having just obtained the "Loony Tunes Golden Collection" (which I highly recommend, by the way), I will try to comment on most if not all the cartoons individually. As such the initial statement might seem redundant for those who read more reviews, so I apologize. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Seasoning is the medium short in a trilogy of similarly-minded shorts (the other two are "Rabbit Fire" and "Duck! Rabbit, Duck". Bags and Daffy discuss who should be Elmer Fudd , it makes me laugh EVERY TIME !!! There is a comment on the DVD, a featurette and an option to play music only. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Disc 1: an introduction by Chuck Jones, The Boy of Termite Terrice part 1, clips of the "Two Guys of Texas" and "My Dream is Yours" movies, both with Bugs cameos: Bridging sequences for an episode of "Bugs Bunny show", the audio recording session of Astro Nuts, 2 vintage trailers, "Blooper Bunny: Bugs Bunny 51st and a half anniversary" with optional commentary with writer Greg Ford and the image gallery
