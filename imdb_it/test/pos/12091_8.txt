'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best musical documentaries I've seen lately and it's more than a film about music. It is also a declaration of musical love about a fabulous city, one of the largest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for the history of Europe and for Islam, the city that could build bridges in the future Europe and the Middle East or it could mean again, as has already happened in history the precipice between two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regards to music is that it starts from modern music, and we listen to a lot (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. Then, as a backward move in time, the soundtrack brings us to the roots, to traditional Turkish music, to commercial novels and exotic instruments that are fundamental elements in the panorama of Turkish music. In a country as complex and conflicting as Turkey, the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, such as the censorship introduced by the military government in the 1980s or the relevance of minority songs, especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice who sings in a cathedral-shaped hammam (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> You can love the city and its music by the end of watching and listening to this movie. I've never been to Istanbul but after seeing this movie I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
