My sister, a friend and I went to see this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We all saw the first movie "Jackass" some time ago, and we all had fun. We couldn't wait to do the number two. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end I was laughing hysterically. It is equally shocking and fun, however, and it is definitely not for those with weak stomachs. It's obscene, but it's also revolutionary American cinema ... well, maybe this is a little too much praise for a film in which men intentionally put their scrotum attached to ice sculptures, but it's revolutionary as it shows us obscenities if we like it or not, things that no other "decent" American film published across the nation would dare show us. <br /> <br /> There was only one scene in particular that seemed unnecessarily obscene, and involved a horse - I will not elaborate. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I almost gagged and I almost cried (for a physical reaction to see a scene that involves a leech and an eyeball, not a sadness). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is the movie of '06. <br /> <br /> Does this make me an idiot? Maybe. But if it does, I could really care less.
