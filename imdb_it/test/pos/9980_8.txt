Shia LaBeouf impressed me first with her acting skills, but I can honestly say that I can't wait to make her next efforts ... her portrait of Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old caddy who ignores the insistence of his father on the fact that golf is not his place in life and enters the 1913 US Open tournament in his hometown ... the beginning of the film drags a bit, but it is necessary to set the loser subplot that Shia it works so well ... the whole cast is well chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the real event, has an ending that everyone can find out before seeing the movie ... but also knowing that the 'information does not spoil the fun ... Josh Flitter is delightful as Eddie Lowery, the caddy of Francis, who keeps him locked and loose while at the same time proving to be a priceless part of Francis's effort ... Stephen Delane is as exceptional as Harry Vardon, the legendary g player British olf that Francesco idolatrous but is not afraid. ..and who knows the background of Francesco's origin as he also had humble origins ... Bill Paxton takes a formidable film and it's worth it ... good Mr. Paxton, and good at the cast ... from the imaginary to the story to the people who bring it alive, this is a film to get, have fun and have fun ... it's nice to have films like this that we can feel good looking at ...
