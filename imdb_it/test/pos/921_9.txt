This is a classic continuation for Bleu, the equally excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as the main star, moreover, is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, for only a second at the end. But this film, really red and very sweet even if very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by the ever-growing Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. He leads a full and active life, only overshadowed by his traumatic relationships with his strange friend Mike, who is in England. For some fortunate occasion, he makes himself friendly with the old judge, who spends his time listening to the private telephone speeches of his neighbors. History begins to weave even more, and we see it in court, being almost universally condemned for its pastime. She is the only one to feel sympathy for him, for her cute little dog Rita and her puppies, and for all the people around them. We are also witnessing the breakup of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their argument is also fueled by the telephone scandal ... But the film is not even on this. It mainly concerns solitude and the deep fractures between people, near and far. When he sets sail in England on a ferry, with that lawyer as an occasional passenger, as previously mentioned Binoche who acted in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the Judge when he looks at the news they try to guess if he survived. He did it, and we still feel very heavy in our hearts. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a great story about loneliness, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and alone. Brilliant film.
