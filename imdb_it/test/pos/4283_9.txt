How come people can give this film a low rating. Unbelievable. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can only imagine that these detractors have been weaned on blockbusters and porn. (If this sounds bad, it's because I just deleted my original 400 words right now). I was so impressed with Tom Wilkinson. Everyone greets the boy. This is a performance of remarkable subtlety and great skill. His development as an actor from The Full Monty to this masterpiece of a performance is surprising; one of the best things happening in the cinema over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is a little less authoritative, because of that glow in her eyes that says' do you see me? this cheeky woman here? You can't guess what I'll do next, because I don't even know it! It seems to be something you can't help show us in any role, but still, you are an actor of terrific skill and presence. She is very sexy here, as she needs to be, and fair play for her for this: this is a screen quality that normally, for me, does not have in previous films. <br /> <br /> Like you You might expect, Rupert Everett, required to play a class 30 something in the upper class that could give doctorate-level tutorials in How not to give a hell-of-a -head header total selfishness, delivery. He is so skinny here, for the whole movie, however, I'm worried about him. Even the housekeeper of Linda Bassett is excellent: a rather small role but with an important twist to make, it makes you think about how much talent we have in Britain in terms of character acting. I want to see more. <br /> <br /> The narrative arc is fine; it's a pretty interesting storyline, since no one in the film seems to want to convince Joe Public that there's nothing new under the sun, even if he moves away from the melodrama of the 40s in the last "reel". But it doesn't matter, this is a fantastic 80 minute value for anyone with half a head of money. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes for his first directorial engagement: or how we need more films of substance like this. It shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel, telling a story very effectively and subtly. And congratulations also for evoking an immense exhibition of film art by Tom Wilkinson. How disgusting. <br /> <br /> T.
