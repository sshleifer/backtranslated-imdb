I don't understand why everyone is hating Barney. If you hate the show so much, then DON'T LOOK! It's stupid how everyone is changing the son of "I love you" into "I hate you". If you don't like it, fine. Whatever, this is your opinion. But it doesn't make sense to degrade the show when it's not even that bad. OK, so it's cheesy, and yes, it has its flaws, but it's a show for children. Children don't want to be sad and unhappy, they want to be happy. And Barney helps him. And even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger and so on. And yes, Barney uses magic. But the children see Barney as a figment of the imagination. Children need a place to escape to express themselves. The world is a miserable and difficult place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does this to us. This show is fantastic. I saw Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people find it stupid. But I looked at it and I'm at the top of my class. It may not necessarily make you smarter, but that's not the point. I think Barney's point is to provide a place where children can be children and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where the imagination lives. So many teenagers are now unimaginative and afraid to express themselves. Barney helps to encourage him. Barney helped me not to be afraid and to show me what I am. I'm a sophomore in high school, an AP student with a 4.0, a theater student with a love for theater and art, and a new cousin who loves Barney. I look at him with him, I have fun and I will sing with him. Yes, it's trivial and silly, and whatever, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time to have fun? I am a child in my heart and I love Barney. It's great for kids and those with children at heart. <br /> <br /> It is a great show for babies and small children. So stop hating. Say you don't like it, but stop it with the "stupidest show ever" or "Barneys a load of bull" or whatever. Keep it to yourself. Take a cold pill or something else. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you don't see me go: "Grover is a load of bulls" or "Cookie Monster should die" or whatever. I hate all the BULLSS ** T that people say about books or movies, like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, OK, whatever. Nobody cares. Don't go hate things, because you could offend someone.
