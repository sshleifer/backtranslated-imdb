I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it very well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember very well are the opening sequence and the initials. In addition to that, everyone was expressed. The writing was also very strong. The performances were also of a high standard. I hope some networks report it so I can see every episode. Before concluding, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even if I have not seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network brings it back, I hope you accept it one day before it goes on forever.
