Maybe I was really in a good mood when I saw this movie. but, for whatever reason, I really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes. And with that? It was still a really nice movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there were Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and he played a selfish, sarcastic perfectly. Perhaps this film is not an Academy Award material, but it is certainly a good material. Go get it.
