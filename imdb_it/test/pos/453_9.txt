Being a big fan of Dostoyevsky, I have always been disappointed with Hollywood's middle-aged attempts to enter the Russian romantic aesthetic - a case in point, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I thought the whole problem was a poor choice, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When he was given a smart script to work with, he suddenly became alive and was noble, sexy and confrontational as you might want to have a neurotic Russian officer! So it was a better Dmitri like Major Surov than Dmitri was. But this is due to the fact that the writer Tabori actually gave Yul, as a Russian officer in conflict, the kind of lines of the Russian officers in conflict who are worthy of a real literature, and that have a real meaning in them. and pathos. For example, a proposal for popular music, says in a meditative voice: "You hear a man crying in the dark and if you listen carefully, you know what he cries. You look surprised, Lady Ashmore. Despite what you may have heard, the tractors and the Marxism is not the only thing Russian takes care of. There is always time for music. "<br /> <br /> Brilliant !!
