When I first heard this image, it was simply called "Shepherd" and it was supposed to be the film that would have put JCVD ​​back into the possibilities of making theatrical shtuffs. I was very excited about the whole piece. <br /> <br /> When it was titled "The Shepherd: Border Patrol", I was dancing the tap-tap for the excitement of this movie. With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of the director, and JJ Perry who pulled out the stunt coordination, I almost gave myself a blowjob in anticipation. Pics was released by JCVD ​​by kicking 8 different types of donkeys and Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the bad guy, and I was thrilled with excitement. I thought it would be another epic martial arts situation like Wolf Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then it came out. I ordered it on Blockbuster online for $ 20 and it was ready for anything. The reviews of vandammefan.net have slightly changed my ideas, but I have reinforced. The mail arrived on day 4 and I opened the package. My initial plan was to run upstairs, tear the face from the cardboard packages, then destroy the case with the proper dynamics so that the disk could land in my DVD player. However, I set the case for 10 minutes, then I inserted the disc into my player and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I was crazy to stay in the pool. The Shepherd is certainly one of my favorite movies ever directed at videos and it derails the devil even more than the toilet it is. Sure, some of the fights ran a little short twee, but they were still VERY fantastic. The shootouts were superb, as was Scott Adkins, who SHOULD have been the villain, unlike the forgotten Steven Lord. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Seriously.
