An overwhelming and moving love story with powerful performances by Ralph Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a badly burned man (Ralph Fiennes) who is pulled out of a plane during World War Two and tells his nurse (Juliette Binoche) his story. <br /> <br /> Shortly before the war he fell in love with the beautiful Katherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas), despite being married to Jeffery Clifton (Colin Firth) and the two begin a passionate and forbidden relationship. <br /> <br /> A very obsessive and tragic story of love and desire against some absolutely wonderful places in the desert. You absolutely have to see if you are a fan of Anthony Minghellas work, but be prepared to shed a lot of tears is very moving especially in the end.
