The Falcon and the Snowman is based on a true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee (titular traitors), played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, received their code names from the KGB. Why? Boyce was an avid gentleman and Lee was a coca-cola. The film is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another reviewer asked about their motivation? Disillusionment is not. Ideology is not. (Forgive me my bad grammar,) but I'm making a point here. What was it if it were not disillusionment or ideology? In a word, greed. At the time of the Boyce-Lee case, money has become the great motivator and not ideology. You do not believe me? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring, broken in the late 1980s. Three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the 1970s and 1980s. John Walker, who began his career as a spy in the 60s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. All three sold this country for thirty pieces of silver. If you are not familiar with that sentence, I suggest you read the Bible.
