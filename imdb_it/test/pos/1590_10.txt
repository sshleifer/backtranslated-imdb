Enjoy every moment of this languid show with music to match (Mahler's fifth is splendid, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so well used in this film). There are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overbearing force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the absence of logic for love and adoration. I'm also a huge fan of Bogarde and I think he was rarely so wonderful (try it anyway in "The Servant"). Note: I recommend multiple views.
