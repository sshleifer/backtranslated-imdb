Of course, the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the lingo of time. In this sense, the film is really dated. But as a satirical look at the American parasitic industry, advertising is still coming. But equally important is the counter-message, ie the effect of a lot of money for those who would make the industry more socially responsible? no promoting war toys, alcohol, etc. Thus, the film also speaks of the calls of capitalism. Note, for example, how Putney's dress suddenly changes to resemble Fidel's Third World revolutionary, just before leaving the company. For a moment, it seems that the Swope mini-revolution has been successful among his staff, and he will go on, perhaps to spread the movement. But then, former militants succumb to the fascination of a lot of money and he starts shaking his head, perhaps to hijack a plane for Cuba. Downey's last word, however, is ironic because Arabic (I think) burns the tower of money leaving the smoking ruin the metaphorical structure of (advertising, capitalism). For me, this seems that change can only be successful as a purifying act of destruction and not as a process of reform of a message consistent with the radical spirit of the time. <br /> <br /> Whatever the subtext, there are some really fun moments, especially with the commercials that sound good now as then. Those who compare the anarchist style with that of the Marx brothers make a good point. The launch lines fly often and quickly together with the absurd set-ups. Forty years later, it is still a difficult film to obtain. Despite the cruelties, however, the film remains a work of bold originality with some sincere moments.
