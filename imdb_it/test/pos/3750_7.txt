I remember this old movie. It's a great, chilling, horrendous picture film about a man moving into a Scottish castle, only to find out that there are strange events in the corridors during the night. And there are even more strange events taking place in the back, in the more familiar Hollywood hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you saw in every feature film that ever involved a topio puzzle, including "The Shining". But the final line in this story is about the last thing you'll guess. I certainly didn't see it coming. This is a fine example of how beautiful and convincing a film can be even when the premise is completely anxious, at the limit of ridicule. I would recommend it to anyone.
