I was part of the Space Odyssey cast, playing FIDO in mission control. I just want to say that none of us actors, especially those in mission control who had to react to a green screen most of the time, had no idea how amazing it would be. I knew it would be good, even if only for the pure camaraderie and professionalism that the Impossible Pictures production team provided to everyone involved. but when we first saw him at the Curzon Mayfair screening, well, I was very proud first. I was so happy that none of us seemed to be in Star Trek. Joe Aherne, writer and director, is the most extraordinary man to work for. He practically gets a good team together and therefore only trusts them to do implicitly what they do best. I'm really lucky to have been part of this show. Who knew that something so epic and complicated to understand would become so enticing to look at. and my god is a beautiful universe out there.
