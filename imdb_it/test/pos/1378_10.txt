On many levels it is very good. In fact, considering that it was a low-cost British indie of a feature film director for the first time with a largely new cast, it is a magnificent achievement. I don't know how much it costs. The figure of Â£ 8,000 was advertised in public but you never know how reliable such a figure is. The point is that this film seems to cost a couple of million pounds and clearly costs a small part of these great special effects, a fantastic production design, effective props and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and an absolutely amazing sound mix. That being said, much of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and everyone had something to do. This is a film in which ten men dressed more or less the same way in one place and it would have been easy for them to be nameless, faceless empty spaces, but these were ten characters - mostly done through dialogue and the way in which they reacted to things. During the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole film were like the second act, it would be amazing. <br /> <br /> Before the ship explodes, twelve people head for individual ships or "e-pods" that shoot from the ship. They are not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor clods inside are trapped, cramped and have no idea where they are going, but this makes sense. I like e-pods: they are an excellent idea, very well made and more sensible than a beautiful and spacious escape capsule. I also like the way in which, later, we are told that they are designed for ship-to-ship escape, but they can almost do planetfall in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were damn lucky that their ship jumped so close to a planet. That said, I don't think there are 116 unused e-pods still on the cargo and one has to wonder how he managed to get into an e-pod, but into him. (And it just occurred to me: shouldn't the Captain get down with his ship rather than be the first to get out of there?) However, the e-pods land on an arid planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy and sparsely vegetated part of the planet that could have icy waste and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, it's a planet in a science fiction movie - it will be exactly the same everywhere. We must accept that all e-pods descend a few miles from each other so that the ten survivors can meet each other by shooting rockets in the sky to locate one another. <br /> <br /> The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a good career in action movies if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try to contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they intended to meet . But they can't do it from the planet, they need to go into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units of two e-pods, they can probably give them enough juice to lift themselves up on anti-gravity jets high enough to explode over the atmosphere. Everything can be done automatically, but a "pilot" will be needed to send the signal. The captain bravely volunteers for this, but in a commendably reasonable move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man in the e-pod a little sheltered is ridiculous and that he must be the lightest member of the team. That's Kid. I really liked the way he now points out that his name is David and the Captain starts using it, treating it with dignity and respect. It was a good storytelling and a good characterization.
