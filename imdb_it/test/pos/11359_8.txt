MY DINNER WITH JIMI is a taste of Howard Kaylan, the dizzying and vertiginous race to fame with his 60's band Folk-Rock, The Turtles. Turtles were a sort of "second line" act during the sixties, but the film clearly shows that they could eat, drink and celebrate with the titans of the hippie culture. And not only that, they had musical ribs to support it. Many of the star acts of the time are seen interacting with the band at work and during the game. This provides my only complaint about the film. Almost from the beginning of the film, we see that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate such recognizable stars. Too often during the film, I felt I was watching a catchy display of fake wigs and mustaches. But, if you're a fan of The Turtles music, or The Swinging 60's, in general, this could be the movie for you. And, don't forget to view extras. There is a very funny (and informative) piece of band members, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.
