(Some spoilers) It took 19 years for Bruce Campbell to finally put his masterpiece "Man with the Screaming Brain" on the screen. But Campbell had to change his story by having, due to financial problems, taken place in Sofia, Bulgaria, not where he initially wanted it to be shot in Los Angeles, California. <br /> <br /> In the film Burce Campbell stars the pharmaceutical magnate Willian Cole in the United States who travels with his spoiled rotten wife Jackie, Antoinette Byron, in the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria. It is there that William wants to help finance Bulgaria's almost non-existent mass transit system. <br /> <br /> It is William's misfortune to be involved with both the Gypsy woman Tatoya, Tamara Gorski, and her ex-boyfriend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev, a former KGB taxi driver. The two, William and Yegor, will unintentionally end up shearing their brains, inside William's skull, due to Tatoya's jealousy and revenge. <br /> <br /> After Tatoya kills both William and Yegor, their bodies are handed over to mad scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, by his faithful assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi, to have their brains tested. The dott. Ivanov has this theory because two heads are better than one. And now with the material, William & Yegor, at his disposal, Dr. Ivanov will finally prove it. What the dr. Ivanov will sadly find out that by fusing the two heads, or the brain, their brain waves overlap and cause not only malfunctions, but also against each other! <br /> <br /> William with Yegor's right lobe cast in his damaged brain is out to find Tatoya and make her pay for the damage he caused to both himself and Yegor. Yegor, for his part, is stuck in William's head which he likes and dislikes, both in the food and in the drink, is totally opposite to his. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains that fight for control of William's body! <br /> <br /> Things get even more ruined when Jackie discovers that Tatoya killed her husband William by confronting her in the dangerous and Bravoda's high crime section calls Gypsy Town and ends up being killed herself. Reported to Dr. Ivanov by his assistant Pavel, he is determined, without any body available, to plant Jackie's brain inside an experimental robot on which Pavel worked. The operation is an exciting success but the only drawback is that Jackie, with his brain inside the robot, must have his brain recharged every few hours! Or, like a true oxygen-free brain, it will die along with the robot's batteries. <br /> <br /> Combination of comedies and horror comedy films from the 1930s with William and Yegor turning the Bulgarian city of Bravoda upside down in an attempt to find Tatoya and make her pay, with her life, for the sad state of existence put them both. <br /> <br /> *** NOTICE SPOILER *** It is the dott. Ivanov who saves the day by discovering how to prevent the two brains from fighting, and therefore to cooperate, with one another! This is done by him instead of melting the brain together. Dr. Ivanov keeps them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall between the two non-cooperative gray matter globules.
