Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions of a common man in a compelling documentary. The testimony and repertoire material are a fascinating vision until the end of the 60s and a revolutionary revolution on the world yacht race. The personal conflicts of duty to the family, the self and reputation take place in one of the most memorable and touching films I have seen. I was not familiar with the story of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. The story is mostly respectful of the participants with the implicit heroes and villains rather than ruthlessly exposed. Most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing one to relate personally to situations and characters. This film is a sweet and bitter experience with a fun mix of reflective suspense, joy and drama.
