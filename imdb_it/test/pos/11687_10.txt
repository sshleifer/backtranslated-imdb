One of the greatest successes of The Decline of Western Civilization, the indie breakmain of director Penelope Spheeris, is that it can perhaps attract non-punk fans compared to hardcore ones. More importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely "worthy of the market", when the bands played (or at least tried to play in some cases) in damp and dirty clubs to an audience that had so much respect for themselves same having respect for the bands. For the fans, like me, there are precious interviews with some of the quasi-legends of the punk-scum of Los Angeles, some deaths, some still alive and still laborious in the scene. <br /> <br /> Performances and interviews include artists such as The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (pre-Henry Rollins), Catholic Discipline, Fear, Alice Bag Band and more memorable (in my opinion) being germs. While I knew some bands and interpreters of the film (The Jerks and Black Flag mostly), I had only heard rumors about the singer (the late) Darby Crash, and from the movie in the film seems to be one of, if not the epitome of the punk movement . He does not take himself too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he speaks it is completely meaningless, and the attitude he brings to the stage is both fun and exhilaratingly free. Such an artist would probably frighten Steve Miller and Jackson Browne from their skin. <br /> <br /> The decline of Western civilization may not turn on all non-punk fans looking for this film (it's hard to find on video), but it shouldn't necessarily shut them off either. As a kind of anthropologist who sneaked into the party, Spheeris gets the behavior of these people, their motivations, their likes and dislikes, and the power that was their character on stage and off screen. Some of them almost come off normally, some don't, but they're just offensive to those who aren't too open to things. Furthermore, the film is a must for guys who think they are fans of punk just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want to get the real scoop on movement and the genre of rock you profess to love, give a chance to the pioneers.
