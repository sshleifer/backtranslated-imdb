The funny thing about Barker's Nightbreed is that it's the story of a human being on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters all over the world. In this, the monsters (the night race of the title) are the "good" boys. He shares the sense of celebrating the different, the twisted and the dark with the first film of the Addams family, and much of Tim Burton's work. It also has the beauty you expect from a piece of Barker. <br /> <br /> Especially funny is Cronenberg's performance as the real evil human doctor who is determined to destroy the Nightbreed. As with most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monster castle with torches and pitchforks. Only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and rustic "weapons" with pistols and bombs. And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw the Frankenstein monster burned in the windmill is the real center of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker has done something more interesting and certainly more chilling, work. But it is pure fun, it looks fantastic, and remains light without mocking itself. It's worth a look!
