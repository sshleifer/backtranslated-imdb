Every show is excellent. Finally, a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good-looking people who talk about why they are like normal people. Too bad it was canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, formerly of the Simpsons, have written or executive produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and a lot of similar humor spreads here. Take Agent Steve Cox and think of Troy McClure. However, it has its own unique brand of humor and let's face it, a teenage girl will only love it on faces alone. <br /> <br /> What is with the television that erases the best shows and we are fed by spoonfuls from abominations like those with which my mother has almost slept or whatever is called? Please learn a lesson. Not everything has to be about cuteness or romantic travails or above all reality shows about how to demystify every aspect of life. Some people like to laugh and not think later. Well, my anxiety is over for the day. Now back to the Simpsons. When is it turned on? Oh yes! All time.
