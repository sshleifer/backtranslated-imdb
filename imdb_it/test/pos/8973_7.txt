Well, we certainly saw it and I and many other people expected worse. He also had some good parts that I didn't expect to fail in other areas anyway. <br /> <br /> First the acting was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this film and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue for this movie. If it hadn't been for him, this movie would have crumbled and hit bottom. His performance was not at all sensational, but absolutely necessary. He gave a witty and cynical performance in what most other actors could easily turn his character into a clich√©. Tom Hanks gave a nice loose performance and didn't disappoint, but he certainly didn't impress. What I couldn't stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. It was a kind of mixture like I had never seen before. For example, she is a bad actress, at least for me, she was young for her character and was also false for the character she was playing. <br /> <br /> The direction was average for me. I'm not a big fan of Mike Nichols' recent films and I'm not exactly impressed by this. It was made with a Hollywood style cartoon hat that I couldn't stand. The worst part is that he tried to make a movie really meaningful in the end. I love significant films, but not when a film tries to rush into a scene or two at the end and shows something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the film. This is something that Mike Nichols seems to have done a lot on his recent track. <br /> <br /> The only impressive part of this film was writing. The dialogue was put together very well and was able to let the story develop. The script was what was able to really bring this film to an above-average level. In so many scenes I found myself laughing in part with writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's a little of what we've seen at least. A lot of landscapes were good in the film if you understand what I mean but not much else. I liked that this film didn't glorify everything that America had done. It is obvious that throughout this war in Afghanistan the United States has given weapons to the people who are now against us. This type of film shows that we are too guilty for this. It shows that what may seem good in the short term could turn into something terribly wrong in the future. This film had a good original message, but was not properly published. Overall it was fun though.
