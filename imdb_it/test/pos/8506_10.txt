I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. Both add a little girl at the beginning of the story that grows to have an association with Dorian (this is not in the original book), and this is my only complaint. I particularly like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version is much nicer (I think) and much more ruthless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more faithful to the novel than the novel. In the end, this is a great adaptation of the novel (it also hints at Dorian's relationship with men, as Wylde does, which could not be done in the MGM version).
