I have some good memories watching "Robin of Sherwood" on TV as a child (but I think I only saw the episodes of Michael Praed, for some reason). And recently my brother bought the new DVD-boxes of the complete series. It was good to see him again, and he's the best of all Robin Hood's movies and TV series. The cast is fantastic, and the settings mixed with Clannad's music add this very special feeling. Personally, I think Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie are fantastic in the role of Will Scarlet, The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It is a pity that a fourth season was never held, and I also learned that screenwriter Richard Carpenter actually intended to make a feature film after the events of the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally marry Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect Robin of Loxley (Praed), and he could get revenge on the sheriff. As mentioned before; if the producers of "Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves" had been intelligent, they would have gotten the cast from "Robin of Sherwood", and made the film a sort of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone puts in the bonus DVD material, it would have been nice to see them as old, just like in "Robin and Marian" by Sean Connery. Who knows, maybe we'll see more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. Anyway, now we can watch our favorite series over and over again!
