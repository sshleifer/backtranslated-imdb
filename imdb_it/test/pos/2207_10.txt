Dark and desolate sets, electrifying music that cuts through you like a knife (or a razor), a perfect cast for Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is exciting theater transferred without problems to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our time and Todd is his masterpiece, from Brechtian's opening ballad to the very epic ending of Act I - "A little priest" in which Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims who will end up in their meat pies , this game never ceases to excite, excite and satisfy. Betsy Joslyn also excels as Johanna, herself, as the comedies seem a little crazy. Edmund Lyndeck turns into a bold performance like the corrupt judge he craves after Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's revenge. Lansbury and Hearn command the show as only two great actors / stars can do. Other musical highlights include the "worst London cakes" by Todd "johanna" from Lovino and the opening act II of "GOD SO GOOD", and this is a title to describe this production!
