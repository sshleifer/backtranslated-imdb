Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this frothy story about a mild school teacher (Kevin Kline), who was released at the Academy Awards by a former student-actor-actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film deals with the absurdities that revolve around this scenario - the effect on the city, his girlfriend (Joan Cusack), himself - and the climax with an all-loves-all ending. <br /> <br /> If you are an angry gay rights activist or naive youth looking for an accurate portrait of a man's fight to go out or a "real" representation of gay life, then save yourself and rent something else (maybe Beautiful Thing) or read a book (Giovanni's room). If you can understand that this film was inspired by the piety of Tom Hanks' speech at the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and makes fun of Hollywood culture and ignorance of small towns and you have a passion for the comedy of the 1930s (Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) then have fun! Far from being a pungent satire, the film seeks the exuberance of a farce by Preston Sturges and comes damn close. No, it is not "deep" or "powerful" - neither Romy and Michelle, 9 to 5, or Young Frankenstein - and does not pretend to be; keeps the tongue firm. Becomes too prolific and rude for his sake towards the end and of course some jokes are a bit stale (there is also a dressing room scene that may have been cut) but after sitting through countless comedies that are wrong, it's like a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are wonderfully at play while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add good support. Joan Cusack's excellent performance is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is, well, Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the citizens to whom it makes fun; personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia. I will take down harmlessly on holiness at any time.
