Contains Spoiler The film is a good action / comedy but I don't know if the director has cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy dies too quickly. The end of the film arrives, the bad guy just dies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good and I don't regret having paid them to see it at the theater.
