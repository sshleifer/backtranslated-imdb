Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was obviously "no question" that I had to see this. However, I postponed it for too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing happened" "a complete waste of time". But when I saw the images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. I had no doubt that I was going to rent that movie that evening. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, looking at a very beautiful painting or painting can be wonderful, but watching a movie made with the same kind of virtuosity in each frame adds a new dimension to it. My God ... I really like my friends but it's a pity that I can't share with them the same thing that makes the heart jump for excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. That thing, my friends, is beauty. As this film goes to show, beauty is terribly undervalued in our technologically advanced, intellectually superficial, fast food-oriented Western societies. This does not mean, however, that I reject these frantic societies or despise them (or even Kubrick) but only that they can be much more if only people stopped for a moment and took some time to absorb the pure beauty of the world in which we live. And what better opportunity is there to do this, slowing down the elegant rhythm of this film and letting yourself be transported to that place between awakening and the dream. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place you can get a so-called "natural high". It is something our spirit can do whenever we encounter pure and boundless beauty. And never in my life this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm" as it is called by some or "samaddhi" by others has been more intense. Yes, it's more intense than a regular orgasm ... many times more intense in reality. Many religions have stated that this particular feeling shows that they are right. They are right? For me a direct answer to such a question would do nothing but diminish the impenetrable hypnotic mystery of the universe. In my opinion, the film tries to convey the same mystery through the representation of the black monolith and affirming the following: "Apart from a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the black monolith of four million years has remained completely inert Its origin and its purpose are still a total mystery ". The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I feel when looking at these beautiful visual effects. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery can be frustrating for those who need direct answers to fast food to big ontological questions. But instead of comforting us, we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications contained in these answers. The doubt and discomfort that will subsequently be caused will lead us to focus on our deepest intellectual activity as a source of all these problems, while in reality we only have our answers easy to blame. But this film shows us that when rapid ontological statements do not give rise to anything other than doubts, we can always rely on phenomena to make sense of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself" the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating, but it becomes fascinating, fascinating and maybe even comforting. We don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to let the mystery be what it is, to embrace it too ... we can finally bring our souls to rest. I'm pretty sure, however, that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never be overcome. Especially now that the greatest director I've ever lived is no longer with us.
