This production, built on real stories of Danish delinquents, is an experience through an excellent direction, which acts at all levels and has an infrequent nerve in the criminal series. Every episode is a thrill because it seems that the hole team believes that "this is my life now - this murder or murder is MY responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, you have just wonderfully filled up being entertained because it seems that their attention, intentionally or not, lies on what you DO NOT LIKE to have a good time ... miss this, it is right under 'The quality of the band of brothers and it is an experience to "have seen" - What a wonderful crime time!
