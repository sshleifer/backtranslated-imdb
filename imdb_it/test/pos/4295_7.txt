A well written script. A moving story that shows middle-class English at its best. Some great actors of Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I wasn't familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job playing the wife ******. The director, Julian Fellowes, has not succumbed to the typical Hollywood tricks to give the film a more meaty plot. He has not too dramatized his portrayal of the English middle class. The rhythm of the films does not waver even though it is not a fast-paced film. A good turn in the plot, which is not predictable. A delightful setting in an English country village. I really enjoyed this film. The locations were also very well selected. If you like movies about relationships, this is one to watch. Better to have fabrics ready!
