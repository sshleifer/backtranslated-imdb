A short-lived criminal show that gave birth to three film spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3), this is a quick comedy, with a fast-paced, more successful than lacks rhythm. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen plays detective lieutenant sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who mumbles and gropes his way through the cases, with the skillful assistant of his boss, Captain Ed Hocken. <br /> <br /> The narrative lines are spurious, at best, but it is deliberate, since the goodness here is not in the narrative, but in the plot of a constant flurry of jokes along with some really bizarre and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> Jokes come in many forms, be it word games, slapstick, word games or background gags, most of them hit the place, even if some fall a little dish. It is inevitable with this 'gag every few seconds' approach that some will fail, but the relationship is good. <br /> <br /> The characters are a delight. From the guest star of the week that dies in the first few seconds of each episode, the laboratory scientist who seems to conduct cruel and unusual experiments on shoeshine children that is an oracle form, the writing is witty and sharp as a saber. <br /> <br /> Although not particularly successful at the time, it quickly developed a cult following, many accusing the relative lack of success of being ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience, the main among them none other than Matt "The Simpsons" Groening: and he should know. <br /> <br /> Pinned by today's standards, if you can see through that aspect, you're ready for a surprise.
