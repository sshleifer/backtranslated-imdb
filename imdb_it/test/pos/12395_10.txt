First of all, I voted for this movie 10/10. For me, it's simply one of the best I've seen since I was born (I'm 23, but I've seen numerous movies). The story is cruel, but the reality is, isn't it? It penetrated me deeply and stirred my insides. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no "national preference" (this expression is a direct translation from French) for this film. I mean, it's not because it's a French film that I put it so high: it really caught me when I saw it. Also, I don't know Marcel Carne's filmography well, so I don't know if it's his best film, but I know it's not his most famous film: Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is in black and white, but deals with the intertemporal problems of young people (not acne) such as love, friends and studies in a modern way. It could also be redone frame by frame with real young actors, a Dolby (tm) sound and special effects (a car accident), it would still be a great movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Maybe it is a movie to be seen by young adults (ages 16 to 25) - and above all, of course - because its message is well understood ... I said it was a great movie
