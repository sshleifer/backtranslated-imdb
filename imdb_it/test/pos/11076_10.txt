I just wanted to inform anyone interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my favorite out of time. I admire the work of Nick Gomez and Spike Lee in this masterpiece of a film. This film really impressed me with its reality and its appreciation of the details of life in urban New Jersey. It struck me personally, personally, because I grew up with friends like those depicted in the film. He also impressed me because I spent time at Teaneck several years ago, so some of the characters were kept "real". Sometimes this film looked like a documentary because you didn't know if these were real events. Although films like "Boys in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" capture more attention, I personally think that these films have somehow been "improved" to attract a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an uncompromising piece of reality "in the face". Lee and Gomez have covered every detail of this urban drama with music, clothing, jargon and location. Unlike some of the films I mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they weren't "actors". Nothing has been compromised to make a good "theater". The only misfortune of coming from this film was the fact that many people "slept" on it. I look forward to other works of art by Nick and Spike in the hopeful future.
