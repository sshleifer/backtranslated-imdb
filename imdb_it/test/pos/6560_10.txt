I'm a horror movie maniac, and this must be one of the most phenomenal horror movies I've ever seen. The plot is totally original (who else could think of a city that becomes totally obsessed with a certain symbol until death and madness?), The special effects are amazing and the cinematography could not be better. Some may find it disturbing, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It also makes a good point. The spiral symbol is a bit ubiquitous. The spiral notebook, spiral shells, spirals on cakes. Of all the shapes that they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle) this was one of the best choices. If you can find this movie, definitely see it. It is certainly unique and absolutely unforgettable.
