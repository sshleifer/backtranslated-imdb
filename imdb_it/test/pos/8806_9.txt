Human Traffic is an average weekend getaway for a group of friends, it's a "fly-on-the-wall" view of their lives (and minds) that will show you how this group of friends relate to each other. There are many moments when everyone can relate, like being out of the skull at parties and talking about complete rubbish to strangers. The characters are all people you can relate to and are credible in the roles they play in the film. The situations in which they are found are all situations in which we all found ourselves, and this is where this film succeeds. Sex and drug issues are superbly managed so as not to hinder the relationships between the characters. The story of the film is not everything, but it is not a criticism. This is a film about people. This is a well written film, with a soundtrack to die from. D.J's Pete Tong has put together a superb selection of songs for this file, which makes it one of the best movies I saw in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I was leaving all weekend. Fantastic movie! Jo Brand as the voice of reality - I need to say more! <br /> <br />
