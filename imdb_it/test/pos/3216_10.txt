honestly .. this show warms my heart, I watch it EVERY DAY in the fox family and now that the new season has started I'm even more hooked than before .. the characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real .. me I would recommend this show to any woman or mother and daughter ... the Lorelei are super intelligent and talk about witty girls who will inspire you, and the show is sometimes hysterical and never too serious, but serious enough to make it completely compelling. it's an hour that is an important PLUS because you can never have enough Gilmore! even in an hour. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (the parents of the Lorales, Rory's grandparents) are your rich parents on average .. Emily, president of DAR and Richard, a well-known lawyer and alumni of Yale. Rory is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them happier, of course, Rory's mother is so proud of her, but her whole life worked to challenge her parents and Rory to go to Yale didn't have her helped on that trip but believe me, every episode that she approaches;)
