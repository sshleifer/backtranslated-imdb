Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has some terrifying parts and some incredible performances, yet she should be even better than she is. It has a drama. Some scenes are really suggestive, and if the shots inside the table are boring, other shots at night and at sea are really very exciting. Then there are the almost historical and lively scenes set in Coney Island (even a brief nervous roller coaster ride), and the episode in which two women are behind a net in separate beds, and halfway visitors can throw balls to look for to overthrow them over, and the women (dressed in a succinct manner) make men snap is strangely a kind of way to come. All the while Garbo (in the front row) observes. <br /> <br /> Garbo is obviously what makes this movie much more than another great talkie. She interprets all sides of her character. She is shy and skeptical and in a sort of inner anguish. She laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes outwards. In a sense it is a far-sighted, remarkable film (directed by Clarence Brown, which has a whole series of significant films of this pre-coded sound age). <br /> <br /> Although based on a success by Eugene O'Neil Suona, it is the writing that struggles a bit as the actors seem to go through the steps at times. Marie Dressler is fantastic in that exaggerated way she almost registered. And then there is Greta Garbo, who really has a natural presence, even if it seems like she is exaggerating, only slightly, sometimes (but then, so it is for everyone else). Garbo is obviously famous first as a silent actress, and this is his film debut. The public loved her enough to have made a German version the following year.
