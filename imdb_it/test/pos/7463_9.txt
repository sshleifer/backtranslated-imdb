I'm really surprised how little fame this movie had. I think it has to do with distribution companies and etc. <br /> <br /> Do not be idiotic - if you are looking for good fun, take this movie - this is a very nice movie to spend with a few hours the music is GREAT. <br /> <br /> It's about ..... well girls and boys and what's between them with not too much history but not all movies should be PULP FICTION should they? he is cute and cute and has a good time. The girls are also very beautiful and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Why did I only give a 9? well the story could be little more convincing from the center and on. at some point you start seeing less reliable events. SMALL SPOILER: The child is crying and the father enters and tries to relax him. now I'm not talking about a little cry - hysterical scream and 30 seconds after the father comes out and "the baby is sleeping" - excuse me, when and how did you calm him down, sleep and leave his room between 20-30 seconds. but ignoring this kind of small withdrawal because the film itself is not Docudrama - it's fun and this should be overlooked.
