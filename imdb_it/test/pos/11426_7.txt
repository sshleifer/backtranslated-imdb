Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a movie seems strange, yet it's fun at the same time. It is a well-made parody of what has become a classic silent film and shows Stan's talents very well. While his images with Oliver Hardy were great, these first solo attempts give you an idea of ​​how skilled he was in his trade and how great it would have been if he had continued in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as an individual star on his own. The dance sequence with his wife in real life in the coffee scene is the best part of the photo, and has some pretty fun parts to follow with Laurel's excellent dance moves. And the height of the bullfight is a gem, just as the bull also takes a fall. And I like the irony in the scene where he is buried in hats and shows up wearing his familiar bowler Laurel and Hardy. As much as you love the team of Laurel and Hardy and I feel that there has never been a more entertaining comic duo on screen during the summer, it's nice to see them alone once in a while (take a look at KENTUCKIAN DI LOTTA that Hardy he did with the Duke as another good example.)
