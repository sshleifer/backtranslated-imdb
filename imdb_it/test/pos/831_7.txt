This is the best Van Damme-directed DVD effort I've ever seen. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop the heroin smugglers trying to cross the United States. The action in this film is exceptional and the fight scenes are best classified with Van Damme. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further tests, check "Undisputed 2". Adkins is so good that before I looked at "The Shepherd", I thought that Van Damme didn't seem very credible in beating him on the screen. Van Damme has his value and although he is not as athletic as Adkins, he can still kick with the best of them. All the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the battles with guns are above average even for this type of film. The only negative thing I can say about this film is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think the motivations of Van Damme's character should have been presented earlier in the film, especially as to why he is carrying a rabbit. The reason it does it is very strong but you don't discover it until the end. There are a couple of other things that are never really explained, but this is a Van Damme movie, so you know where the priority is in making this kind of film and it's not character development. Overall though, this is a solid action film that I recommend. So run for the Damme border!
