'Never Been Kissed' is a true wellness film. If you haven't seen it yet, then let's rent it. I'm going to buy it when it was released because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is excellent again, plays his part well. I felt I could relate to this film because the school days I had were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written, that there was comedy and romance that is the kind of movie I love. I loved the ending because even if you know what's going to happen, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your waiting seat - anticipating !!
