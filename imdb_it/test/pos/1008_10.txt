This was one of the few Norwegian films I saw in the future as well. It began as few advertisements with a heterogeneous group at football matches. Then they made a film. Leads are not professionals (and you can see it) but they do a great job anyway and the film completely upset me. <br /> <br /> Norway is famous for making bad movies (no offense) but I had a good feeling with this. Although I don't care about football, I wanted to see it 2. the story is much better than expected and the laughter continues to accumulate. there are a lot of celebrity cameos and Norwegian players. the characters are well represented and you try for them. IF YOU'RE EVER SKIRT WATCH A NORWEGIAN FILM. DO IT BE THIS ONE !!!!
