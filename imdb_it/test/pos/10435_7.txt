I see that there are already excellent reviews of this film, I have some points to comment on, reasons why I thought there was something special about this film ... <br /> <br /> first of all, the film is realistic. It may not seem realistic for an adult who has forgotten what it was like to be a teenager, but this is really the kind of superdrama that goes on among teenagers all the time. second, the good guy, the guy who treats women respectfully, doesn't take girls. it's the same as it is in real life the same! he is too cute for his own good. people are simply selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat boy who had some confidence. I mean, that role is already familiar with the actor, I'm not just talking about the character. overall I thought the film was a positive surprise that it secretly hides among the extravagant male comedies on the rental shelf. don't get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's also a good laugh.
