this film may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything I was looking for in a play. falls amusing moments accompanied by a moment or two of scenes that move seriously, great actors and practically everything that should be a good movie. although David played swords playing his usual snobbish character, he played this role in an unusual performance that I don't think he ever passed until he hit the screen with Joe dirt. regardless of the fact that some people were not fans of Chris Farley I saw this movie when it came out and I and my friends talked about it again ... 11 years later. this film was the one that finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal. he's the best comedian I've ever seen in my life. in the words of some it could be clumsy, intelligent, funny, serious, crazy, sober, and at the same time moving or depressing. not the same words but the message is all that matters. one of the true great actors of our time, and one of the real great comedies of all time. along with good acting, good story, hilarious moments, serious scenes that sometimes led me to cry. this film sits atop the hordes as a film that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late Chris Farley. no actor has captured my interests in a film since then. because no actor sooner or later put so much into his films. this movie is worth it, if you haven't had time to watch it do it the next time you rent a movie.
