It might be a little creaky now, and it certainly will never have the impact it once had, but this is still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson could do once. Looking back now for the first time since its initial prominence, I was not struck by the frills of horror - bizarre, but amusing, and Vincent Price has never sounded so genuinely, non-rural (sic!) Menacing - of its absorption of the horror film, which allows Jackson, behind the genre and the trick, to give us a boldly revealing portrait of male sexuality. <br /> <br /> Because THRILLER is not really a horror film, in the sense that horror is not really about horror: it is that secular theme, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The film opens in a cinema, with Jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with images and an aggressive gender response. Sure, she's on a date, and she's less scared by the movie than she knows will be expected by her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The mainstream images of the film that they watch, the group atmosphere all suggest socially conditioned expectations. This leads her not only to think of the body with disgust - from which all the rotting ghouls; the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death - but the sexual ritual does not only concern her fianc√©, but her peers, her society, and therefore her view as a group violation. <br /> <br /> It's brilliant, disturbing stuff, the best thing the director Landis has ever done. Jackson, the most famous artist on the planet, was still willing to show that the fixed image of a star contained multitudes, not all reassuring. The song itself held up very well, the disquieting and insistent bass rhythms, the extraordinarily salacious texts, the splendid '70s ecstasy that sticks the choir, encroaching eternity, revealing the milky desire behind the fear.
