I thought this film was written intelligently and very well played. It is a film that far surpasses other films in terms of originality and fun. Rupert Grint played the part in a wonderful way, and has a general talent for acting. The almost obsessive mother added a lot to the plot, and it was a character that could almost be hated instantly. This reminded me, in a sense, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not through the actual content of the film, but the premises and the general tone of the film itself. "Driving lessons" is a story about growth, to which many may find it very easy to refer to because of the oppressive mother, lack of freedom and self-discovery.
