Alfred Hitchcock's surest story of a film he made twenty-one years before is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock told himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it is certainly not a bad film, he seems to be right. Having said that, this remake, although definitely better, is not yet among Hitchcock's best works. This certainly does not mean that it is not good, it is only more than a little too lenient and that it drags it down. Hitchcock seems too enthusiastic to drag certain elements, and these are parts of the film that are not entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. Some of these dragged sequences, like the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because they help establish the different culture in which our American protagonists found themselves, but for every restaurant scene there is a 'sequence work and it is the latter that worsens the film. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife who go to Morocco for a vacation with their young son. While there, they meet a French man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, things go wrong when the French man dies from a knife to his back, shortly after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday then turns into a real nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which forces them to cut him short and go to London to try to find him. The film has a very powerful degree of paranoia and manages to keep it all the way through. Indeed, I would say that this is the most paranoid film that Hitchcock has ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's films, this is very electrifying and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the aforementioned opera sequence that stands out as a time when tension is widespread. There is also more than a little humor in the film, which gives a slight relief for morbid events, and actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was lent with excellent support from the fantastic Peter Lorre. This film does not benefit from its presence, unfortunately, but it is compensated by the performances of the extraordinary James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who will always be a contender for the crown of the "greatest actor of all time". His collaborations with Hitchcock all have fascinating performances, and this is no different. (Although his best performance remains that of Mr Smith, he goes to Washington). Stewart transmits all the courage, conviction and heart of a man who lost his son and would do anything to bring him back brilliantly. In fact, this is one of the best things about this movie; you really are able to try for the loss of the couple in everything and this serves to make it even more electrifying. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a rather strange casting choice for this film. She's definitely a good actress, but she's more connected to musicals and seeing her in a thriller is pretty strange (even if she manages to flex her vocal chords a little). <br /> <br /> As I said; this is not the best Hitchcock movie, but there is a lot to appreciate and although I would recommend many Hitchcock movies before recommending this, I will definitely give two more thumbs.
