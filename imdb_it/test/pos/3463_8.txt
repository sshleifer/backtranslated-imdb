It is rare that I have the opportunity to review an IMDb movie that relates to my life so closely. However, as someone who lives with a cerebral palsy (although less serious than Michael, one of the main characters in the film) I don't want to give this film a 'free pass' just because it deals with a topic that rarely comes close; and when it is, it is normally treated with pungent seriousness. There were minor problems with the film there; and I would like to address those first, so that people are clear that it is not my situation that has tarnished my judgment on this overall excellent film! <br /> <br /> * Parts of what I felt were shamelessly pleasing to the crowd, to the detriment of realism. If I had a pound for every time a well-meaning member of the public talked about racing with the electric wheelchair for me, I'd be a much richer man; but speaking personally, this fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than in the reality of what really happens. The same thing with the passage of time watching disabled people go to the pub - it's not a big deal for those of us who do, as much as it can be admirable for strangers looking inside. I appreciate that this is from Michael's previously protected perspective; but I still think that he would focus more on the experience, rather than reflect on how important it was that it was actually there in the first place. As a result, the time spent seeing them was a little too much fun. <br /> <br /> * I heard that the terminal nature of Rory's illness was brought to our attention too late; which means that it was used as a low-cost sentimental device between the two, rather than something that everyone knew from the beginning should have been addressed. <br /> <br /> To balance those criticisms, I must also compare a lot of praise. Although I thought that some scenes that showed how to deal with normal life were an excessive touch; the script also ventured into some difficult places that I never expected, and I get a lot of credit for it. For example, raising the question of love and relationships; and shows the everyday apparatus often used to help and assist the lives of non-skilled people. Moreover, despite the tacit emotional shock tactic of death that is coming upon us, the film as a whole is far less rich than anyone has the right to expect this type of film to be. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker can and has performed variations on her autopilot role for those that look like years; but Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that needs to be noticed. Inside, I'm doing somersaults that a group of people somewhere has finally made a film by doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled people.
