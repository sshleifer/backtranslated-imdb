I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to realize about his overall impact on me. I say this because I know that this independent film has a limited budget / resources, but nevertheless, it looks like a convincing and well-done work. <br /> <br /> Pleasant from start to finish with many relatively unknown actors that I can't help but believe that they will make a big noise in the industry in the years to come, Eddie Monroe has not failed to maintain my committed interest and my emotional meter dance. It is a well written story with a surprising ending despite my efforts not to be caught off guard. <br /> <br /> Many of the cast names listed for this film are names to watch for in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina has recently passed, and if it is true it is a real tragedy since his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. Congratulations to Fred Carpenter who really brought out a winner with this!
