As far as I know I have seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I should say that this was his best "pre-zombie" offer. In fact he beats his next films with low hands. This is a story of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's not a mystery how they died, I suppose, it's more who does it. Is a woman that citizens have always considered a witch? Is she a young woman who lives in a modern house on the outskirts of the city, who did a lot of drugs? Is he the village idiot who gets caught early because he is in the wrong place at the wrong time? You will only know if you look, and look what you should, because this is a high level yellow-yellow, or should I say, a "yellow". I've seen it before, but it's been a long time and after a second viewing it was still as powerful as it was the first time. For those of you who know Lucio Fulci just for his zombie movies, well, open your minds to this because it's worth seeing and while the "monsters" in this are human, they're as bad as anything overwhelmed by his latest movie . 9 stars out of 10, see it! Please....
