Can a black youth with mental problems be a catalyst for bringing people together in a South Carolina city? The answer seems to be that, despite his handicap, James Kennedy, he understood much more than what was given credit and went on to become a fixture in the sports scene. Furthermore, the film tells how many of us neglect people with problems that can be helped if we only have the patience that Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a film formula inspired by a true story. Still, the film is not a complete failure due to the inspired performances that the director managed to get from his wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> Coach Jones is instrumental in bringing the young man, whose name is Radio, because his passion for collecting them, involved in sports, a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has only had difficulty in his young life. Coming from a lack of experience, Radio, lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the intentions of the coach. The radio is seen by school children as a mascot, at first, therefore, his sunny disposition makes him win everyone's acceptance because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body. <br /> <br /> The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who make a great couple as a coach and Radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our times, is never boring in what he loves with his presence. He gets the essence of the principle coach who sees the possibility of making amends for something that annoys him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at its best to play the young man with mental problems. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does an interesting job as a mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress interprets the high school principle in style. Debra Winger, has only a few scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> "Radio", while being sentimental, will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people in our society that we know nothing about and how fast we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts many ideas in perspective for us.
