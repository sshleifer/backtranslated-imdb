This film is full of fascinating situations and healthy young people who look good in the eyes, whether they wear clothes or not. The strong superstructure of its plot is supported by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. And so the classic tales of disguises and other jokes found in such carefree plays like Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night Eve and As You Like It are successfully used in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job in advancing the plot with their blocks and dialogues and customs. And the idea of ​​a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another fascinating training film.
