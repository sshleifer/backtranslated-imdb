Madonna goes into action, again and she fails again! Who's That Girl was released just a year after the huge Shanghai Surprise flop and two after the famous cult movie Desperately in search of Susan. He chose to act to forget the flop of the previous film, without suspecting that even the latter could be a flop. The film received a bad acceptance from the critic and the American public, while in Europe it was a success. Madonna says that "Some people don't want her to be successful both as a pop star and as a movie star." The soundtrack album, in which it sings four tracks, sells well and the title-track single was a worldwide success, just like the World Tour. The truth is that Madonna failed as an actress because the script it was rather weak. But it's not so bad, especially for those who love the 80s: it's a ramshackle, trashy, colorful and joyful action movie! In the end, it's very fun to watch.
