a frighteningly real drama, there isn't another drama out there that scared me to death like this, the characters aren't the typical Islamic terrorist, you have a boy with blond hair and blue eyes who is as stupid as he seems, he is a converted Muslim. A respectable businessman who pretends to be Jewish and a Frenchman who converted to Islam, but has clearly brought the word of the Koran to a whole new level. The hero of the plot is Darwyn, who is an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated the terrorist cell, and has to do all sorts of terrible things to keep from being discovered. The first episode is a small taste of what must follow. Even if they are Islamic terrorists, the drama has a unique way to emphasize that not all Muslims are extremists, which is comforting for those interested in racism, considering that half of the terrorist cells are converted to Islam, makes you think that maybe they are afraid of. The most chilling drama I've ever seen. The reason it is so chilling is that you never know who your friends, your husband or your neighbors really are. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, at any time.
