I've never read a good review for "Vanity Fair" and I can't understand why. For something that has been "accelerated in ten days", everything turns out surprisingly well. Although we admit that "Becky Sharp" is a better film and Miriam Hopkins is a better Becky, there is nothing to stop this from getting a solid 9/10. Sometimes, Myrna Loy may seem too pretty and cute to be a real whore, but other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The transition to a more modern environment did not work against "Vanity Fair" and the only thing that really causes a conflict is casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than five feet tall, and even a few of the top men were very tall - all this together to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's Wife" because no matter how bad the main character is, you must love it. And you know she deserves her well-deserved punishment, and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. Although based on the same story as "Becky Sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical. For the value of pleasure, the end of "Becky Sharp" is ultimately more pleasant, even if aesthetically, and from the flow of history, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the best, that you want or less really it.
