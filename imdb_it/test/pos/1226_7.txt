This film is made up of about six men who are charged with transporting money from the bank to businesses. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war serving his country and is now being helped to earn a living by his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) making sure he does not lose his home. Mike tells him that this was not the life his parents expected for him and that he would have to live a better life than he is now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Telling Ty that he and Jimmy have always been a family to him and that they would do anything to help them, Mike tells Ty to plan to do a robbery. The money would be about 43 million divided into six ways among other transport men, even if Ty doesn't like the idea he tells his friend Mike, on condition that nobody gets hurt. Last night Ty was forced to talk to a well-being woman who is putting up his brother in foster care giving him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life. Even if at first the plan seems safe, greed is not everything when it comes to taking lives. <br /> <br /> When it comes to shots, both inside and out, so when you don't go with a piano it is difficult to play the hero and stop the people driven by greed when it comes to having large sums of money . This film has a starred cast to interest you in Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. Recently, I only remembered it in "Stomp the Yard" which spoke of a boy who lost his brother and lives his dream of going to college. This was probably one of his best movies I've seen it in and this fits the character so well that it's nice to see it again on the big screen in action.
