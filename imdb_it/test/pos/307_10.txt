Spoiler. This review has been modified due to the word limitation. <br /> <br /> `Horror. Horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> The phrase that is famous as "Here is watching you, kid" or "Are you talking to me?" or "May the Force be with you" or "I'll come back", means a little more than a few lines. When pronounced, it remains in the air with an importance and a meaning that does not go unnoticed. What might make some spectators go crazy is that they might never find an answer to the horror unless they look at the movie again and try to closely follow every single frame. <br /> <br /> What, exactly, does this line of dialogue mean? The horror of which we speak is the reality of war. The reality of moral men is so easily corrupted as to ignite their innate instincts and kill comrades without any sign of guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, "The horror. The horror". is the realization of Willard's corruption. He mercilessly killed a cold-blooded man as part of his assignment. This is not a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases a character gains something, either emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. But Willard earns and loses both. He gets the awareness of having lost his moral. And this is a shocking ending. <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is the tribute of Francis Ford Coppola to the artistic side of cinema. This film is completely different from "The Godfather". It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and therefore symbolic, and, in the end, original in its unique perspective of the spiritual side of war. This is not so much a film about the Vietnam War as a film about the war within us. At first it seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an army lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who hides somewhere in Vietnam with a mass of troops that more or less they act like his slaves. <br /> <br /> Willard carries out his mission "with extreme prejudice", boarding a boat with four soldiers, including the boat captain, the chief (Albert Hall), the chef (Frederic Forest) and a very young `Larry 'Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in' The Matrix '). <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is in many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. While our main character, Willard, continues his journey, he encounters a series of original and strange characters, including Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange surf fetish, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) , whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of Jeremy Davies in "The Million Dollar Hotel", one of the worst films I've ever seen. Davies failed to establish any connection with an audience; Hopper. It's like the poetic atmosphere between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter who goes back and forth and speaks in foreign languages. In this case, he's translating Kurtz into Willard, though I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard. <br /> <br /> Many movies are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse Now" has many. Kilgore descending on a village in Vietnam reciting Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" remains one of the most remembered scenes in the history of cinema. There is sharpness, brutality, an ironic tone, and even a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels on that beach and says: "I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells of victory", we all create a smile. <br /> <br /> I won't lie to you: Apocalypse Now 'is a strange film. It is not exactly the easiest thing to analyze. The end could frustrate some viewers if they don't understand the meaningful speeches of Marlon Brando. But all that matters, what really matters, is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. Horror is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, "You have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me." Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the public to judge. For many naive spectators he may look like a mad fool whose power has come to his "But that's not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to convey. Fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how good he was and how badly the others were. Walking through devastated villages he eventually realizes that we are the naive, living our lives in a crazy paradise, we are totally naive in our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit, seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes how easily he can be hit by something. He could have ended up like the people around him, and he also realizes that the people who did it are people who have abandoned their morals and have them. or left at the door. Many people think horror is one thing. They are two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how naive he is and the reality of the impact of war on men. And after Willard kills Kurtz and hears Kurtz's words of death, he understands that too. He realizes the effects of the war. Seeing so many soldiers without any sense of right or wrong makes them understand the horror of what war can do to a man. And what he did to him. Horror. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
