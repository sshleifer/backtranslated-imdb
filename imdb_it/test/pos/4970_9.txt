Deep Blood ... It's one of those movies you're here for and you say it's not another idiot of Italian Jaws! Well, Deep Blood is far from that. It is as cheap as film production can get and on the other hand it is also creative. In Jaws and all the other shark movies, we've all seen or seen them using all the fake sharks, and in Joe D'Amato's film he took a new approach using all the footage for his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons why I like Deep Blood so much because it didn't use footage material. <br /> <br /> In Deep Blood an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark, in the classic shark by Joe D'Amato Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> It seems that an elderly native American warned a group of young people of this great evil in the sea, and years later, friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along the coast. Now it's up to the few remaining to make sure this monster is killed, even if it means going overboard to do it. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato Directs and produces this film under his company the Filmirage. Released in 1989 and later used in Bruno Mattei's Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5, along with many other shark films. The voice of the sharks of Joe D'Amato is a great film and all the Joe D'Amato fans of the spectator of the shark movie should give it a try.
