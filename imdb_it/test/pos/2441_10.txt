This film has not been seen by me in several years. He arrived on Disney Channel early in the morning. I stayed awake watching it, and found it even more fun than the first time. History, scenery and characters are as good as they come. I know that if someone takes the time to watch this movie, they will surely find it worthwhile to see it a second time. It is very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this film to anyone, because it is both fun and educational for all concerned. <br /> <br /> s
