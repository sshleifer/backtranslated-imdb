This film is a mystery. It's not scary, it's spooky. You'll probably skip in some places and for some you'll be scratching your head to figure it out. He explains his mystery through the protagonist Eve and his psychotic college project in an asylum, Don. He needs you to look for some clues to take revenge on his mother's murder, and once Eve agrees to help him, he opens Pandora's box completely and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I will not go to Malachi, but I thought that the way he played was a complete genius. I know that movie buffs won't consider this movie with the same prestige as the other classics because it doesn't have anyone very famous inside (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent, but maybe she should have asked her sister to show her face just like that the film could get some recognition) but I think the way the Malachi finale works is something to talk about. I recommended it to my friends, certainly the purchase or the rental price is worth it.
