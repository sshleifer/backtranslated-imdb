The Custer Legend, at Warner Brothers Epic. There is no kind of casting against this guy, with the eye-catching Flynn like the blazing Custer in this wild tribute, not only for Custer, but for the men of the 7th Cavalry. The story traces the life of the famous "General Boy" from his turbulent days at West Point to his last fight at the Little Big Horn. Great freedoms are taken with the facts here, and we are presented with a Custer that is much more sympathetic to the drama of redman than the story refers to, but this is done on such a large scale, the battle scenes alone provided work for any extras in Hollywood.
