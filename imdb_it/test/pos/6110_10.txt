After watching Desperate Living, I became passionate about John Waters films. I heard about Pink Flamingos and I had to watch it and boy was it worth it! Believe what you hear, it's rubbish! It is chock-full of everything that is actually the main plot of this film. Contains the following: Incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken fuck, nudity (like you've never seen before - watch out for the birthday party entertainers), food poop, fire, towing stuff, perversion, transsexuality, fettish , cross dressing ... ... get the picture. Above all, this is a must! Just watch out for the birthday party entertainer and the Divine wonders that surround the park!
