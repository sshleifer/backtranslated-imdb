This is a masterpiece of film production, with many themes simmering and boiling from time to time in these warts, and they all study the years of bohemian war, self-indulgent that embrace the aerial bombardments of London and the exterior tranquility of a coastal refuge Welsh - the boundaries between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience against practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism against heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A mature and subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings the underlying tensions into dramatic concentration is well served by perfect performances (apart from the strange inappropriate smile to which Keira Knightley is inclined, although perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often talk about it ). But above all the exquisite visual composition of every moment, with the inventive and elegant use of the foreground, camera angle and lighting, including fake pointillism films, is a wonder and a joy to see. It's always nice to look like a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the most engaging narrative of some of that master's works. A very rare type of film these days - it keeps attention and arouses emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative and superficial shortcuts.
