This show is amazingly fun! I started watching in 2007 and had never heard of it before. After an episode, I was captured. I'm never at home watching it, so my wife bought me the whole series on DVD. Laughter without stopping, should I add anything else? I wish it was still on TV, because it's definitely worthy and much better than shit currently on TV. <br /> <br /> I would like them to make a film, seriously, who wouldn't see it. The name of Kevin James alone will bring a huge fanbase to any movie, the guy is (it hurts his stomach) funny. <br /> <br /> Just a really good, realistic show. If you have the opportunity to buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
