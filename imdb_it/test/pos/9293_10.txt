This show is up there with the best Comedys made in Australia as it teases practically everything that many want of our audience. Some of the best pieces of the show are the advertising road test that verifies how an advertisement would do in real life. What is really nice about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people (hunters) who like to do what they do and who don't. This show has a lot of bits in it that can break down anyone like the advertising street test I mentioned above, Mr 10 Questions where he asks 10 questions very quickly in front of famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and the Beach boys, temporary ones like The Chasers Emmys and those who have been there since the beginning like the one we learned from current business this week. Overall I consider the thin show 98%.
