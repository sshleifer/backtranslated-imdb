It's not as good as the movie, he said it's a cute children's show. Okay so the Emperor has returned to slip and become a selfish spoiled brat again, accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something fun. It has a lot of jokes for parents and still holds the attention of children. It also boasts two of the film's original voice actors. Earth Kitt who has been in numerous films, but I'm sure many people know Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I was wrong to write), which has also appeared in many films and TV series, but is widely recognized as The Tick. It is indeed a rare and wonderful combination. If for no other reason I strongly recommend comic book fans to watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo. To sum up, fun show for children, with lots of jokes inside for the grown-ups to laugh together. If you are looking for educational value, this is not your show. If you're looking for something fun, this is a great Saturday morning choice!
