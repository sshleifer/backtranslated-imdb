If you like shooting at Westerns this is a keeper. I thought the movie was fun to watch and see people I hadn't seen in a while. I'm not an expert but I liked acting. The city and the props etc. They seemed to adapt to the time and the kind of city you would discover at the border. This is not a Westerner, not enough people and budgets. The costumes and firearms were correct for the time! I expect to see the young actors in the film in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were fantastic. The members of the SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) who contributed to this effort were really good. I hope to see more.
