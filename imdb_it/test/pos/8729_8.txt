I'm surprised by the relatively low rating of this film. It's a compelling comedy and a love movie with someone besides Billy Wilder but he does a great job and even won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> It is Ingrid Bergman's first film in the United States since the 1950s and even though she is no longer the young bomb she played in her early films, she has a rather delicate role. This film proves to have more talents than its good looks. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn who won an Oscar in this, her first film, as a supporting actress is very good as the last sophisticated but modern eccentric mistress of the dentist playboy, love and leave them to Walter Mathaw . Goldie is enthusiastic about all the senses in this role that, with an exceptional cast, made her a slap for this first career award. <br /> <br /> This film is not true, but it is a gem that has remained the test of time very well. I'm not sure why the average is so low that I give it a solid 8.
