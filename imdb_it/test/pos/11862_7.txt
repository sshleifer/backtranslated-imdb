One Night at McCool's is one of those movies that starts with a huge amount of promise but, as the film goes on, it becomes foolish and loses the way for the big season. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to do it her way by showing off her body with every man she meets, who all fall under her spell. There are some funny moments in this, but they become less and less as the film deteriorates into a farce comedy. Michael Douglas, who plays the killer, is as good as Liv Tyler is, although he seems to have gained some weight since he arrived. This is ok but it's just memorable for the scene where Liv Tyler washes her car, you'll understand what I mean when you see her! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (only).
