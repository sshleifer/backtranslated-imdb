seriously people need to rejoice and just accept that fun is fun, and this movie is h ** exhilarating. Better than the first and Knoxville really grew a couple for this film and did the most crazy acrobatics of the first one. If Ebert and Roper (not saying that I'm a big fan of them) can look beyond the pure idiocy of this movie enough to give him 2 inches up then I think others can do it. I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I was pimped and it's rare that a sequel is better than the original. This new belief exceeds the first great moment. so do what I did, relax and relax, try not to vomit in some places and laugh out loud.
