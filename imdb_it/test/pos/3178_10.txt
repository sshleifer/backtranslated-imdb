Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool / channel that opened the young minds of black culture. Attention and perspective were a message of positivity for our people and we hope for change. I recommend this selection for every American family to experience struggle and reward. The show never had the chance to blossom into the idea of ​​middle-class blacks to become business owners. The question was so compatible with the situation of real life that had an impact on the lives of so many. I sincerely hope that the whole volume can be restored and put on DVD so that Americans can have fun with their families. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
