I recently purchased Lost Horizon on ebay, with vivid memories of the number of things I will not miss from childhood (I am an ancient 29). I have also recently finished the novel on which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a real hidden treasure. A wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a wonderfully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated by the original film (and now a rather separate entity from James Hilton's much more intellectual and inspiring book). Sally Kellerman in particular has a radiant presence like the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, who gradually warms up the charm of Shangri-La. Only Liv Ullmann reels in her wooden portrait of the school teacher (a role much more suited to a type than Julie Andrews. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are all nicknamed is not important as it is almost impossible to say. In terms of quality, the music is far superior to the lyrics, but it's still a lively and exciting film that really deserves an appropriate DVD version and much more recognition.
