I managed to get a broadcast of the original BBC of this movie on video and I loved it so much that I had to try to locate the original video in its original box; thanks to Ebay. <br /> <br /> Suppressed in any format since 1990, this exceptional wild animal film is finely constructed and well acted. Directed by Stewart Raffil (MAC & Me), the hopping Tigers scenes that cross the wilderness of Alaska are nothing short of stunning and its timeless story of a hunter trying to survive alone in the icy expanses with two young cubs tiger is moving every vision. <br /> <br /> Because no big company has chosen this film for distribution on DVD is a great wonder; but it makes it even more special to know that it is difficult to identify. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie by chance or eventually chase it to add it to your collection, make sure you never make it disappear from your grasp. Films of this caliber, as shown, do not come often. <br /> <br /> A true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly worthy of its praised comments, "WHEN THE NORTH WIND BLOWS" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.
