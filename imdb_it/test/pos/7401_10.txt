Seriously, I really don't understand why people here are wrong. I mean, <br /> <br /> the idea of ​​a killer snowman devastating a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd. The good news is that the producers realized it and made a comedy in the wake of Army of Darkness. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second part of the film, when the small killer snowballs attack, I laughed. For example, put one of the small creeps in a blender (a la Gremlins 1) and stir. After that, it turns into a snowball and screams in a high-pitched voice "It was fun!" <br /> <br /> Bottom line - incredible movie, rent it.
