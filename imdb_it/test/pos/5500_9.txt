'In the Line of Fire' is one of those Hollywood movies that appears on TV quite a bit, but even though I've seen it a few times, I usually end up sitting again for everything else. Why? - All right! Clint Eastwood is very good as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and fuller than usual. The character, secret service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that it was in the details that he failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and is now forced to confront a professional murderer who openly declares that he will kill the president. However, the film does not make him a depressed, brooding and obsessed character. He is charming and handsome, and he is as realistic as a boy who has lived a lot in life and feels comfortable in his own skin. It is even quite convincing when flirting with the rather young agent played by Rene Russo. The murderer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life or death. He even takes the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The film is always pleasant and offers all the goods - suspense, action, romance and drama - all in the right amount. It's a funny movie that is really helped by the great actors in it!
