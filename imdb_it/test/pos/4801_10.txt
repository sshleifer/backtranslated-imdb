Octavio Paz, Mexican poet, writer and diplomat, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said of "Nazarin": "Nazarin follows the great tradition of the Spanish Spaniards, originated from Cervantes." His madness consists in taking great ideas seriously and trying to live accordingly. "A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a marvelous representation) tries to live according to the principles of Christianity but is expelled from his church to help a local prostitute to give her a shelter after committing a murder.Nazarin wanders the country roads of the twentieth century in Mexico, offering help to the poor and begging for food, his two followers, a murderer prostitute Andara and his sister Beatriz which is a failed suicide at desperate for love, they consider him a saint but he does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation both from the church and from the people he meets on the road He ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not being able to forgive his attacker . <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story in a way of a Christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and iron for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. I consider Bunuel one of the best directors ever. I've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life, but they share his magic touch, the masterly combination of gritty realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his curious mind, his sense of humor, and his dark and shining fantasies. With great pleasure I add to the list of my favorite films the surreal tragic comedy "Nazarin", little known and almost unknown, but incredibly candid and moving.
