I do not think so! I mean, yes, if you compare this film with The Godfather, or maybe an older film like Casablanca, or maybe even a more recent movie like The English Patient. It doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but doesn't that mean this is a bad movie or not? I think the reason this film is underestimated is because many people always compare it to other great Oscar winning films (you should never do it), which makes it difficult to understand the beauty and realism of this film. In the categories Best Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this film really deserved all of them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best interpretations. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that he wasn't his son because he was so real! I've never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. There are some actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help it, I think it's fantastic). Meryl Streep, even if she has a supporting role, is incredible and real and you can't help being attracted by her talent and the way she makes it her and real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mother and father was beautiful, so I say good job to the cute little Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> As I watched this movie for the third time, alone, I couldn't stop crying. I tried but couldn't. Thank god I was alone! This is probably the purest film I've ever seen. Other films nominated for Best Film were Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed because I didn't see any of them, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great but when I heard about Norma Rae I only thought of Sally Field. I think that considering the other candidates, this film deserved five Oscars, and that it will continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just like it has done for the last 28 years. Good job to all the actors and actresses of this film for giving us great shows and memories of this film that we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
