I saw this film at the Locarno Film Festival in the Italian part of Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai is good looking. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its good times. <br /> <br /> * spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> It has some good cinematic moments, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Even if my general feeling is too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too many dialog boxes. And almost nothing to dance. <br /> <br /> Clearly a Bollywood film like Lagaan or Devdas is a rather different type of film than Chokher Bali.
