I saw this movie by accident while I was in Paris. I entered the theater by accident and when I realized that it was not a preview or a short film, I was conquered. <br /> <br /> Paulina does a phenomenal job of keeping your attention with her acting. I can't say enough how impressed I was with his interpretation of this real femme fatale. The rest of the cast also behaves very well. Don't get me wrong, this is not the greatest film ever made, but since I knew nothing about it, I was left with a lasting and very positive impression. <br /> <br /> Finally, I DO NOT speak French in France paid for once! I haven't stopped talking about this movie for 3 weeks after seeing it.
