The 2005 edition of the Royal Rumble was broadcast from the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The two best WWE championships were defended, The Undertaker was fighting Heidenreich in a Casket game, Shawn Michaels was facing Edge in a grudge game that had been accumulating since last October and, of course, every man for himself over the rope lines Royal Rumble matches itself. Who would take the price this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of contenders. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who took the popular victory in the main battle of the event, but not without controversy, or should I say, a failed end. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista should have unloaded the young Smackdown! stand on top of the rope but everything went wrong and both fell to the ground. The referees acted on their feet, as we had a lifting competition similar to that of Bret Hart and Lex Luger in 1994. This brought out the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac came down in the ring as only he can but got badly injured in the ring. It was rare to see Vince McMahon sitting, with his legs out, telling the two men to restart the game. Batista then had to make the first time and throw Cena on the floor to seal his future with a league game at WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> This year's Royal Rumble undercard had a very solid top line , with many of the biggest WWE stars competing in matches. Each brand had two great encounters each. <br /> <br /> Raw opened the evening with the match between Shawn Michaels and Edge. This was a good technical race. Back and fourth until Edge got the shot. This was a smart booking decision and kept Edge as a contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The second game of the evening was the fake Casket final between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The game was not a classic, but then were the classic Casket games? It was fun. Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane brought out the coffin in a big pop. Undertaker didn't surprise anyone when he got the victory, slamming the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre feud. <br /> <br /> The first of the two league games of the night was John Bradshaw Layfields' defense of the WWE championship in a triple Threat game against both Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This match was very good. Once again, not a classic but fun though. JBL took the victory after winning Kurt Angle. His celebration was short lived, however, when teddy Backstage Long informed him on No Way Out, he would defend the WWE championship in a Barbed Wire Steel cage match against the Big Show. It is not a very nice way to spend a Sunday evening. <br /> <br /> And of course there is no show without Punch. Punch, of course, is reigning over world heavyweight champion Triple H. The 2004 revenge of Unforgiven with Randy Orton was much better than the original match. It's a shame because they don't seem to click on the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did. Orton played the role of the concussion very well and went down for The Game. <br /> <br /> So the first big of 2005 was good. It has achieved its goals. The purposes ended and new ones began. We were now officially on the road to WrestleMania 21.
