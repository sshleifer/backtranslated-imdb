The few reviews I found online on Barnens don't really make it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already passed and I could not cancel it. I am very happy now that I could not. It's an extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done it. But I will say that I do not understand the comments that it is sad, shocking, strange, clinical, depressing or pornographic. It is certainly very unusual, which I suppose may make it seem strange to some people, but the other criticisms must reflect the problems of the reviewers, because I have not seen anything of the film that I have just seen. I'm not attracted to boys, so nudity doesn't seem at all pornographic - it's just a kid trying to figure out who is without help from the irresponsible adults of his life. And it's Sweden, not Utah, so topless women aren't a big deal. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me most is the positivity of the film in its representation of this lost boy who goes into a sort of Odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences, looking for - and eventually finding - if same. It is fascinating, completely original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> It doesn't surprise me at all that Barnens won three major Guldbagge awards for Best Film, Direction and Actor, but I am absolutely amazed that the actor who won was not Tomas Fryk, the boy who fearlessly Reine's interpretation must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, the deranged boyfriend of Reine's mother. I don't understand it at all, but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie.
