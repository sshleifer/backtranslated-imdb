I never saw it in the theater, my second vision was tonight on a big screen DVD compared to the old VHS tape from the rental shop. <br /> <br /> Saucey for the moment and I'm sure the Hayes code has been pushed to its limits. <br /> <br /> Hitch's pallet here is the "game" between two fighters. And yes, if Guy immediately calls the police on Bruno, the film is 63 minutes shorter, CIAO people always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in a person's shoes and made the right choice? For the love of God it is called poetic license ... However, as Guy sees the situation in which he found himself, he takes upon himself the rectification. He does not solicit help or lie to his would be a new wife. His defense of him starts the final show with Bruno who feels he still has a card to play. <br /> <br /> For the cop who shoots an innocent person during the pre-cam days and before the rules of engagement type of what happened. In the post-world Rodney King, a presidential candidate supported the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man. If you have not seen or seen the outrageous behavior of the police is blind or you have a pending question for the academy. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie ... <br /> <br /> Go watch it.
