I saw this movie that now matters and can't hurt me. It's like a fucking drug. I know many people don't like it, but there is something that attracts me. Every single performance is spectacular, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show. She not only acted in the role of Akasha, she became her. His body movement and beauty have been captured in an exceptional way. It is also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian queen (No, I am not predjudice against the whites, I am one). It is true that we do not know what color the ancient Egyptians were, but this was a nice change. Stuart Townsend has made me completely forget the portrait of Tom Cruise from Lestat and Marguerite strikes again. All in all it was a good time at the cinema. For those who haven't seen it, make sure you look at it with an open mind and don't take it too seriously. I mean, it's a vampire movie that turns into a rock star. Take it that way.
