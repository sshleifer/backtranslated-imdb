Peter Coyote was the only name I recognized from the cast list, so I wasn't too keen on watching this movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I watched it late at night. T.V. I would recommend this movie as a good late-night view. It's better than a bag of this kind. The plot is excellent, the acting is not brilliant, but it is not bad. I don't usually like flashbacks but they work in this movie. As I said, I didn't recognize any of the names, but I recognized Michele Lee, who gave a decent and hard-working performance, like the woman who wants to be next to her man, who is lying to her. (Was it Knots Landing?) Anyway, she's wearing very well. Note: you could have more fun if you lose the first few seconds of the credits. I did it and it helped me. When you see the credits, you'll get what I mean. Wayne Kennedy's character, which is really weird, takes this to 7 rather than 6.
