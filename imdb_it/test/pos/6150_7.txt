Instead of looking at the recycled story of "Pearl Harbor" with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving some people thrown in so that the film's creators could say that they contributed to the spread of the story, along with nothing other than CGI explosions that fill a romantic and mushy triangle. One should go see Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This film takes place during the historical period of World War II that the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the Nazis. It was a part of the story that should at least be told once to the outside world. A love triangle unfolds among the main characters, but one of them does not die as conveniently as at Pearl Harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. The film is a tragedy after the tragedy, without even a bittersweet ending, with our hero who does not enjoy the glory of taking back his country, the return of love from his current lover, the return of love from his reunited lover, or even the return of unconditional love for his long companion life. He is heartbroken and feels no worse in the Russian labor camp. This kind of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it were their script. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes plays on the sentimental, but also shows the humanity of the people. Overall, a film worthy of note.
