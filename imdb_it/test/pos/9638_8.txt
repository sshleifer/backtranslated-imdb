In my personal opinion, "The Patriot" is one of Steven Seagal's best films. I've heard that it's the worst ever, it's not like the SS etc. I do not agree. As a highly spiritual person, a great Seagal master has established a good tradition in action films. He always has a good background, great action, high professionalism and an intelligent message. This film has it all. You have good shooting scenes, great aikido. Although there is not much, he shows us his peaceful side. This change in his film only demonstrates his spiritual growth (he does not kill Chisolm's partner at the end). <br /> <br /> "The Patriot" is certainly one of the best films from the "director" point of view I've seen lately. You have great panoramic shots of Montana, we see the true American nature and the beautiful wildlife (among others - horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film I had a great opportunity to listen to the classic western-cowboy-western music (but not the country). Similar music has been heard in "Back to the Future Prt.3". The acting of SS is greatly improved by his latest films. His role is not familiar to him (as opposed to policemen and commandos), but he does a good job playing the retired-from-government doctor. His acting is convincing and his jokes are good. <br /> <br /> I was really happy with the cast. LQ Jones demonstrates that life and death walk together on Earth, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and intelligent scientist, Camilla Belle makes a great appearance as McClaren's daughter. <br /> <br /> Mr.Seagal discusses the much debated "Real American" Tradition and the militias, providing their own point of view (he likes the Constitution, but chubby bearded men have nothing to do with this ). The positive points also concern the system and the nature of medicine in the east-west. <br /> <br /> The best of Seagal. And opening up new horizons in his film career. <br /> <br />
