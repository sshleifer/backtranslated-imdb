Not having heard of this film, it was a surprise when it was recently shown. Gary Ellis, the talented director of "Tough Luck", does wonders with the script written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The film involves the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Archie, the young hustler at the center of this story, has been involved in all types of petty crime. In fact, at the beginning we are witnessing a battle that leads him to leave New Orleans as quickly as possible. Ends in the carnival run by the mysterious Ike. Archie falls in love with Davina, the woman who should have been wise to stay away. The result proves a fatal judgment for Archie who then becomes the object of a double crossing all around. <br /> <br /> The director should be praised by the casting of Norman Reedus, who is obviously loved by the camera. Despite his nature, he feels for him because we know his heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as the exotic Divana dancer who, despite being Ike's lover, invites Archie to fall in love with her. Armand Assante is barely understandable with the strong accent he pronounces during the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> "Tough Luck" shows a new director, Gary Ellis, who shows that he will do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing.
