This film is a classic seventies cop who for some reason has been sadly neglected. Basically French Connection meets Bullit. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider plays the role of an elite detective group, known as "Seven Ups" <br /> <br /> One of their men is discovered during an undercover agent and is killed . <br /> <br /> Scheider and his team must find his killers. They are involved in a battle with the crowd. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film must be the car chase, obviously included to cash in on Bullit's success. However, this machine chases Bullitt because of its length, speed and sheer excitement. It is a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends unexpectedly and spectacularly. Don't miss this little gem !!
