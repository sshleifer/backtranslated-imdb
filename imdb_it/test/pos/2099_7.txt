Like another poster in chap. 56 (a local television station in Boston) showed him several times over the years on Saturday afternoons. They paired it with the first sequel "Return of the Ginat Majin". <br /> <br /> I haven't seen him since then ... but he never left me. Apart from the atrocious dubbing and faded color, this was a beautiful fantasy. Technically it's not horror ... until the statue comes to life at the end. It's just a village dominated by an evil man. There is a giant stone statue there that the villagers continue to pray to help them ... to no avail. But things go too far, the statute comes to life and destroys the bad ... but then it starts chasing even the good ones! Well done with some fantastic special effects at the end (LOVED as he got rid of the bad villain main). There was also a worked enchanted forest in which it was also interesting. <br /> <br /> No masterpiece but an unusual fantasy / horror movie combo. It's worth taking it, but not if it's the dubbed print.
