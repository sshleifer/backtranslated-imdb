Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it is difficult to divert your mind from this attractive beauty (giving a perfect performance for images), since it simply has languages ​​that wag its tails. 'One Night at McCool's' is a crazy and extravagant black comedy with old-fashioned nuances linked to its familiar but elegantly elaborate and chaotic narrative, which has three men who crave one and militate it to its advantage. When you see Tyler, I don't wonder why they are infatuated and would they do anything ?? that's all to see "she" happy and live "her" dreams. Just like Tyler, there is something pretty heady about this feature as we see people like Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who is great) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the casually hired assassin, but a questionable hairstyle ) really have fun with their roles. The consuming plot opens with the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) who tell their story of how they came to meet this divine presence and the final effects it is having on them to lead to a crazy climax. There is a chain of unpredictable events (ranging from fruity to sensual), in which everything would link virtually to a certain ironic (snowball) twist for the characters (who see them abandoning their reserved comfort zone for satisfy this girl). Directed by Howard Zwart is briskly balanced between the rapid-fire gags of the script and the frantically amusing, though complicated, situations. One of the best comedies under the radar of the last decade, which will take you under Tyler's control.
