Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelamn to heal his vampirism - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) appears looking for a cure for his becoming a werewolf. Even the Frankenstein monster is discovered, but in reality it does nothing. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a Universal horror movie from the 1940s. Trying to cure monsters with science is actually an interesting idea. Even this film has some good sets (LOVE the castle where the doctor lives), tons of atmosphere, it's very well directed (excellent use of shadows) and has some pretty good special effects. <br /> <br /> The acting is all good except Carradine - he tries but I could never accept him as Dracula. Even Lionel Atwill intervenes to play (as always) at the police chief. This is pretty much forgotten and derided as a stupid movie, but I think it's very good. It is also the last time that the universal monsters were made seriously - the next film was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a fantastic film, but the accent is more on comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real flaw here is that there is a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: why does Dracula try to bite the beautiful Miliza (Martha O'Driscoll) when he is cured? And why (and how) does the doctor take Frankenstin in his castle? Still these are small complaints. Recommended.
