<br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time shortly after it was released on video in 1995, I quickly dismissed it, saying that Julie was not a Daniel, she never really gave her a possibility and said it was horrible. /> <br /> But here he is, 5 years later, he's on Disney and I'm looking again. And I'm finding that it's not as bad as I did to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just like Kool as always, the soundtrack is still there as pleasant as ever. And the character of Swank is not so bad, his acting is pretty good considering the script. Beats the third installment by a large margin. So my initial score of 4 was raised to 7.
