This film was a heartfelt piece of cinema that helped show the dark side of childhood and the little things that shaped who Tom Hank was. Using a very cryptic story, they were able to give you an idea of ​​what really happened to Tom Hank as a child. And while scenes like the flying car could never happen, they helped show how even rejection can help tell the truth. In all conscience, I could not evaluate this value below 9 out of 10, great performances of all the actors, and while many may not have understood the cryptic end in which the brother is murdered by his stepfather, Tom Hanks covers using an unlikely story about a flying machine, pay close attention to the small details, like the turtle he still has, even if his brother has flown away. Really, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition for this.
