It is a good movie? It's hard to say - but in 1953, for many people, it was an extraordinarily effective film, full of suspense, scary and then, surprisingly, really moving when "the old gentleman" meets his unhappy death at the end of the film. /> <br /> Yes, what lurks in the maze turns out to be a surprise and, for many people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogenesis) was very real at the time the book was written, and in fact has some basis. Not that this would translate into what we see in the film, of course. <br /> <br /> But working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest set designers - and the person for whom the term "set designer" was invented - creates a very disturbing mood which was strangely irresistible. Sometimes, of course, the film is very silly, but it has its moments.
