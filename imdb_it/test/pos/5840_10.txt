The unforgettable "Oz" by Tom Fontana is undoubtedly one of the greatest television series ever created. Brilliantly written, recited and directed is the closest to perfection in any art form (film, television, literature, music). Breaking in its extreme brutality, it creates a prison world full of different characters ranging from the compassionate to the terrifying dish. It is a spectacle that no matter how brutal it is, one cannot look away from it. The combination of professional theater actors trained with film and television actors allows a range of different and all original performances. <br /> <br /> And while the show is universally praised and has / has had a loyal fan base, one cannot feel that it was underestimated during its television run due to other HBO dramas such as "The Sopranos "," Sex and The City "and" Six Feet Under ". And while all those shows are true borderline masterpieces on their right, many people forget that it was "Oz" that was HBO's first film in a one-hour television series. It was a brave and risky first entry and with it HBO hit a big slam. This is as good as it gets.
