When I saw the preview of this movie, I thought to myself, "here's another stupid TV movie that was written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera", but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen interprets (and shows that she can really act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love and marries a man (Now and again Eric Close) but begins to lose faith in him when he starts a series of rapes to have place in his community. At first, she is blinded by her assurances that she is innocent and by her love for him, but over time she continues to be suspicious of him. <br /> <br /> Even if the melodramatic TV movie looks like the set-up of another boring movie, it's really much better, because the characters are well played by Thiessen and Close, and the script of the movie allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you'd expect; these are not just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to move the plot along but real, three-dimensional people, and we are really at the heart of them. And the film is smart enough to be able to provide an exciting, engaging climax to the story without resorting to stupid action scenes, senseless clicks or cheap melodrama. Instead we share the inner conflicts and fears of the protagonist, and we are given a realistic portrait of how he might be able to solve them and do the right thing. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to take a look, please do so. Production values ​​are not exactly top-notch (after all, it's a TV movie), but if you can look further, there's an excellent story to appreciate.
