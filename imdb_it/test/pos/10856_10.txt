Among the first 24 lesbian films in my library, I have to evaluate this as the number one movie of all time. This film will go down in history as the best of its kind. It's a story about a girl (Rachael Stirling) that goes from riches to rags and stables to the stars, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) that makes her entrance and exit from her life. It is set against a Victorian background in the 1890s, which makes it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry. This film did not save money on music and costumes, and the makeup worn by Rachael and Keeley while on stage in theaters only added to the diversity of the film. <br /> <br /> No matter what kind of movie you like, I can guarantee that this movie will not only amaze you, but will keep your attention through all three episodes. This film will be played and appreciated for decades to come. The uncensored DVD version is a must for anyone's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best casting choice in these two roles, and they played very well.
