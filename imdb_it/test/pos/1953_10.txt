Apparently this film was based on a true story. I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. But he really reminded me how when I see that someone has been murdered in the news, it's unbelievable how much I don't care. Of course, I think it's terrible, but honestly I don't care. I go forward. It seems the murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. Nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. So what's the point? <br /> <br /> The killer of this story is John, and for the sheer volume of the film he hides himself with another killer named Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is older and you can see the generation gap. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asks John if he loved the girl he killed, he simply replies, "He was fine." The film seems to offer only one solution: life is more important than death. A character's life is spared, people get second chances and a hopeless case is killed. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good. After watching this film, I came to the conclusion that Crispin Glover is a brilliant actor or a terrible actor. I have no idea yet. It was my main reason for seeing this movie, though. But the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> Although fashion is really 80s and the characters sometimes mention current problems, I think that River's Edge is today more relevant than ever. > <br /> My vote: 10/10
