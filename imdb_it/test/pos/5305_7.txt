As a longtime fan of Studio Ghibli and in particular of Hayao Miyazaki's films, I went to the film on the day of the inauguration. When I came out of the theater I had the strange feeling that something was missing, this "magical" feeling that I was experiencing in all the Miyazaki films, but I couldn't say why this time it failed. After thinking about Ghibli's other films, I might know why: this film had most of the elements of a great anime by Miyazaki: cute characters, a wonderful key animation, a fantastic soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the hot story which tells giving you the feeling of watching a high quality Japanese animated film. However, two elements were missing: a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple plot as in the case of "Totoro", so a complicated story as told in "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke" is not really necessary, but since other hand, this story was just too superficial. I couldn't connect to the main characters because there was no character development, the dramatic scenes were limited and didn't last very long. I really hate to give only 7 stars for a Miyazaki movie, because I would immediately give 10 stars to all the previous films, but this time it wasn't just this wonderful "ghibli experience".
