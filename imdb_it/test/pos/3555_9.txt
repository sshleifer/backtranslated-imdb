After reviewing 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I'd finish them all now. Dads Army, it's my favorite sitcom of all time, it's not half-hot. Mom is also a classic like You Rang M'Lord. I don't consider Hi-Hi as a classic, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> It is a holiday camp similar to the Butlins, but instead of the red coats are the yellow coats. It is run by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well-meaning man, but he has the personality of a sock. The staff includes the entertaining animator Ted, his partner Spike (he ended up being thrown into the pool almost every episode), the yellow jacket Gladys, the careless waitress Peggy who wanted to be a yellow coat and the Punch man and Judy Mr Partridge who hates children. The situations occurred mostly around the pool, where someone would be thrown in each episode (with clothes there of course). <br /> <br /> It's not a classic, but it's still fun. Jeffery Fairbrother came out halfway, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, was welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Peggy's Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.
