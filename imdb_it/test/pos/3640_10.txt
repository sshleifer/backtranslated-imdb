This film, based on a true story by Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson from the 1980s tumult in South Africa. I put it on the scale of American history X as regards the description of how a young man can be seduced by the Arian doctrine and how the "certain" segments of the Christian church teach a false doctrine of race to justify an injustice. <br /> <br /> It is a strong message of forgiveness and redemption, it is a rarity in today's films. The violence is well done to show the gravity of Gerrit's crimes and the magnitude of his transformation. <br /> <br /> A word about Jan Ellis who played Gerrit Wolfaardt. It transports you through the darkness of Gerrit's beginnings to its illuminated transformation. He went to some obscure places as an actor and must be praised for his performance. <br /> <br /> Another outstanding performance was that of Mpho Lovinga who plays Moses Moremi, a victim of Gerrit's crimes. He was able to tear from some pain points that really touched you while watching his performance. <br /> <br /> Great movie to show the kids.
