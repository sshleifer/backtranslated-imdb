I saw this movie when it came out and I never forgot it. My uncle Antoine is much, much bigger than the sum of his parts. The film, freely, speaks of a preadolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical but below is a current building. The MUA has a slow pace but patience, the reward is coming. I think the film was subtitled and as with all non-English films I saw that it is worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably dubbed films reflect the attitude of a new director and actors, with the further need for lip-synching lines that do not fit perfectly. The English-speaking amarcord is a disguise, for example, while the subtitled version sings. My uncle Antoine deserves the time to find him and watch him in French.
