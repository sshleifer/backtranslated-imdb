This is the first Pepe Le Pew comic and in some ways it is very similar to the following ones, but in some other strange ways it is not. While the object of Pepe's affections is a cat, strangely it seems to be a BOY cat! The whole situation occurs because a cat is tired of being mistreated by others and dresses like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk, so it can be left alone. Unfortunately, this attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the action is rather typical until the very funny and unexpected ending - and this really makes this one of the best cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from the following examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this a caretaker.
