The mystery of the 1930s comedy on "The Crooked Circle", a band of hooded criminals preparing to plot the murder of someone who has sworn to oppose them. Pleasant but really insignificant little film, the film works simply because the cast directed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver came out of that series) and supported from a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't therefore miss the name). A long moment of fun, the film doesn't make much sense with the wrong identity, secret passages, spooky music and people who are not what they seem. It is the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a night vision when you are nostalgic for the late show.
