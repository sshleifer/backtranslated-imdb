I can understand how Barney can be boring to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was simply created from the beginning and simplicity is not bad, especially for the young people who entertain. Personally I find this show a very underestimated period. Barney & Friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut (and almost 21 years after the debut of the character in home video), it shows continuously that it still appeals to small children. Perhaps less than in the early 1990s, when Barney was the Hannah Montana of the time, but it is still a classic. As a Barney fan, I feel I should defend him in a way that doesn't look like spam. The way the purple boy teaches things can be simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather have them talk about the war? Being grateful to someone (a dinosaur in costume, but still) is there to comfort children and just let them be children. In this day and age, I feel that we are running our children to grow up and Barney is there to say that you can still be a child in the heart. Furthermore, many of Barney's lessons on current episodes of plagiarism, being honest and yes ... even death, could attract everyone, not just their target audience. Furthermore, our children must learn to be kind and respect others for what they are, and help them do so. In short, Barney could be annoying to some people and I fully understand the reason, but I cut him some flexibility. All that he and his friends (along with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is help kids not only learn the necessary skills, but also have fun and watch even the positive parts of life. If more people listened to their children's favorite character and looked at him through their eyes, maybe we wouldn't be so negative about him and maybe about life itself.
