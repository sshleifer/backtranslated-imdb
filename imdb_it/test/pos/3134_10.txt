Along with The Sun Shines Bright, even more undervalued, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well played by the members of Ford's "joint stock company", including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond and Harry Carey, Jr. Like almost all of Ford's films, it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of the Indians than most of Ford's films. Ford, despite all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American democracy.
