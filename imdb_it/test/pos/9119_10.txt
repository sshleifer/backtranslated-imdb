I saw this movie in a stroke of luck. I was on 42nd Street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started handing out free tickets for a preview of this movie. I gave him an opportunity I didn't expect much. I saw on the walls of the subway station not give any justice to this film. <br /> <br /> The film is about a young rocker who embarks on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal. Leave it there. The film is a heavy and very funny comedy. If you're old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the 1980s, you'll love this movie. Jack Black is an extraordinarily talented comedian and actor and assuming that he really wrote and performed the songs in this film, he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is definitely worthy of an eye!
