Don't forget the lover on the side !! It's a "hottie", Karen Parsons is delicious, she's wonderful, acting, beauty and style. It's just his job! I, well, now here's a show that the writing hits you in the intestine and while you're bent in two, it kicks you in the ass! In quoting Peter's wife (The Associate / writer / Producer) who said while watching the "previews" for the upcoming "new" shows at an ABC network party, he looked at her husband after the preview for "the job" played and said: "This doesn't look like there's anything else on this network, you guys are in trouble." It means it looks very good! But it doesn't look like the usual "brilliant sitcom" or the exaggerated drama that they (ABC) regularly find themselves comfortable with in the Air. "Since I saw him, after the first episode ended, I made sure not to lose that week next week, I was immediately addicted to" The Job ". Sharp humor and cynicism, situations outrageous and writers laughing out loud make this series a success !! <br /> <br /> Then I felt the anger and the feeling of being disappointed, that the show has just taken off and I wondered which manager, have you made that decision to break down one of the main milestones of comedy for their network? <br /> <br /> I have talked to other people about it a little knowledge, others not, but I know that the stupid network does not He promoted quite strongly, or I should say visually enough. If they did it would have worked at least 3-5 seasons, maybe even 6. I just believe that knowing the shortcomings of the network and being too subscribing to a 'formula' or another that have lost the boat with this There was so much spa Uncle for expansion, he had just started. The situations were fun and serious, fast and sometimes slow, even if it didn't maintain a good rhythm. a few years later, I finally found it on a new DVD for $ 50.00. For me it would be worth $ 1,000.00 to have this in my entertainment library. I watched in amazement as I passed the two seasons for the third time on DVD again and the final episode "Betrayal" was entering a total dramatic segment with them discovering a murder victim, it was better than most of the victim of the Unit drama and 'cop' show on the air now !!! They entered the grave scenes as a heart attack and credible, they did it as if they hadn't even skipped a beat. Just like he had to be serious, I'm so impressed with the "versatile ways" that Tolan and Leary shared in storylines and scripts. <br /> <br /> In another offensive of the "entertainment week" I learned that the beautiful wardrobe, the silk ties and expensive clothes with pressed shirts and ultra-fashionable footwear ... it was all sold for the cable film "In the cut" (2003) for only four hundred dollars, that's all !!! ! I'm sick. Have you seen what everyone is wearing for every show? A good coat on its own could work so much. <br /> <br /> This was Denis Leary in some of his best. I recommend this fantastic police drama for the eastern coasts or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that people from Ireland were joking with Leary about the 'Bath' episode, repeating the lines to him from that, because they saw him over there. (****) A superbly intuitive and comical New York Leary / Tolan police show.
