CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is a perfect film. An impeccable film on all the faults of humanity. Outside it might seem like a film about death, but in reality it is a film about life. I simply can't recommend this movie enough. And don't be afraid, dear readers, it's not a depressing film. As said, it is a film about the brightness of life trained under the guise of death. You'll laugh. You will cry. You will realize that life is fragile and short. And you will leave the vision with a better understanding of how precious life is. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films)
