'Thursday' is a good film, but we recognize too much from other films of its kind and therefore it lacks originality. If you've seen "Goodfellas", "Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction" and a lot of other films inspired by the latter, you've seen almost every part of "Thursday". There is a scene that involves tortures that also have the same dialogue as Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs". <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie. Since not all parts are taken from the same film, the complete thing has some new ideas and touches. The opening sequence to begin with is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They start arguing with a clerk at a service station for a cup of coffee and end up with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a policeman. We already saw a suitcase with a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall), but worked with Nick. You don't know anything. Then Nick calls him and says he's coming. We find out that he has fucked his friends and that the problems are about to start. <br /> <br /> Exactly what happens is not for me to reveal but we meet other characters, all interested in money or drugs Nick also had with him. Casey sucked at everyone who came down. <br /> <br /> Very funny moments, lots of blood, a very funny sub-plot that involves the actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (even if you really think about it, see what's coming) this is a good movie with some very nice performances, well directed by Skip Woods.
