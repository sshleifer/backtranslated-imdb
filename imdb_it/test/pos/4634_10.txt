If you're a "son of the 80s" like me, you'll probably remember this 1981 Disney movie - one of Disney's first Disney-branded movies, and Michael J. Fox's feature film debut. I remember watching this movie over and over on HBO when I was in middle school and recently found a very old copy of it, since Disney stopped producing the film several years ago. Needless to say, this is a really fun movie to watch. Five university teams decipher the clues in an evening race around Los Angeles, trying to reach the finish line first. Watch the cameo by Paul Reubens. From poor music to the disco scene with the fat twins, this is a quintessential 80s movie you will love.
