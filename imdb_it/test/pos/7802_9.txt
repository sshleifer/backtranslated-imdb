Soon it will be 10 years since this film was released ... it still makes me laugh .... If you like this movie, try the new Hera Pheri .... it's fun. And my favorite piece of the movie has to be when Salman realizes he has no bullets in his gun while he has the upper hand and he has a pistol point ... and actually he says it out loud !!! U just want to taunt it .... but you know you can do it only if you stop laughing !!!! Fantastic movie .... 10/10
