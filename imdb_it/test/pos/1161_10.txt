I really like The Wind and the Lion. It was a good movie. I thought that since I was young and done so long ago I wouldn't want it to be so beautiful, but after seeing it, I was amazed at how beautiful it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it likes. I liked it because it showed how the Arabs and the people of Morocco were treated during the early 1900s by the Germans, the French and even the Americans. If I were a high school history teacher, I would certainly show it to my student's point of view, from a high school perspective. I give this film a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents loved it so much they bought it themselves. My 3-year-old cousins ​​also sat and looked at him. <br /> <br /> Systemoffell
