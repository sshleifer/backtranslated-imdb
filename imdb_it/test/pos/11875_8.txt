ONE NIGHT A McCOOL'S (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, the director of "One Night at McCool's," this film is "a dark comedy on the power of women over men and how a group of people can perceive different realities: it is the same story told from three different points of view, and every time we tell the story, we try to reveal a bit of more about what really happened, that nobody really knows. "<br /> <br />" One Night at McCool's "marks the directorial debut of Zwart, an award-winning commercial and music video director who started making short films when he was eight. I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to the cinema. We have seen so many examples of how these guys plan to make another advertisement or a music video for TV with their productions. Zwart resists this trend. It captures a specific humorous truth in "One Night at McCool's", from an inventive and complex script by the late Stan Seidel, although it is often a bit perplexing. <br /> <br /> "One Night At McCool's" presents three men sharing their separate experiences on a particularly beautiful young woman. In a sense, this film is the comic version of "American Beauty", but in others it is a world apart. <br /> <br /> "It all started one night at McCool's", explains each of the three men to their various listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon), a tender at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who remains until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a fatal female, appropriately named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, since an individual treats her unkindly. He gets up for her, and before you can say SEXY, they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him. At first, Randy is reluctant: "Sex and violence, all in one night is a bit too much." But who could transform a jewel like Jewel into a jewel. <br /> <br /> Jewel changes the life of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, she pulls him out of a hole of pain since his wife died. For Carl, she makes him forget his loving family and his pretty little suburban family. For Randy, he lights some fires, both positive and negative, later persuading him to contact a bingo playing a hit man named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to end his deceitful ways. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note how the film perceives the three different chronicles: even the Jewel costume is related to the man who tells the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful and fascinating gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and a lot of neckline. Randy doesn't know what to do with her, an awakening to his otherwise boring way, to life anywhere. The most intriguing element of this film is Jewel itself, however, delightfully played by the always delightful Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She is not really interested in men, but in what they can offer her. His motives are too simple, not sincerely diabolical or evil; she is simply a young woman who has learned from an early age that she manages to get what she wants from life through her beauty. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of fun with its material. From the enthusiastically funny cast, to his violently hilarious confrontation, "One Night at McCool's" takes advantage of most of his humorous ideas. What makes the film even more fun is the way in which the views of the three men differ. Even the actors have a lot of fun with their characters. Goodman is curiously whimsical; Reiser adapts quite well to its eccentric and nervous part; Douglas is smart and mysterious in one of the most entertaining performances of the film; Dillon gives his character an arrogant personality, even though Randy is not a brilliant person; Liv Tyler is dazzling. Inietta Gioiello with the perfect amount of vainglorious charisma and tempting spirit. It reminds us of the intimate performance of Mena Suvari in "American Beauty". <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" is the first film to come from Michael Douglas' new production company, Furthur Films. It is a creative, genuine and sexy production. Along the way we often get caught up in the tortuous structure, but this is a natural response to a film that intentionally weaves different points of view on a single story. The film ends with a note that is both black and comic. This is another of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; that is, the black comedy. Many films of this kind are too black or too unconventional. "One Night at McCool's" is one of the few that really works. <br /> <br />
