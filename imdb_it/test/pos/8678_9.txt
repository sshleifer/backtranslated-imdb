Andreas arrives in a strange city. He does not remember where he came from or how he got there. He is ordered to get to work and get his apartment in the city. All his collaborators are kind and polite with him, they say hello and smile when they pass by him. But later, Andreas discovers that the city is not as pleasant as it seems. Coming home from work, he sees some people wearing gray clothes, cleaning up the damn mess of a corpse, apparently the victim of a suicide that jumped out of the window. The procedure is performed with a calm mind, as if they were emptying a basket. The following day, Andreas meets the fully alive suicide victim at work. More and more Andreas discovers the meaningless atmosphere of the city. <br /> <br /> Den brysomme mannen could be the best Norwegian film I've ever seen. The original and artistic direction is usually missing in Norwegian films, with few exceptions. The plot is also very original and could even be called postmodern horror, since the film presents us with a terrifying thought of facing a world completely devoid of feelings. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more it becomes meaningless. I'm fascinated by the way the director manages to create the feeling of a universe unveiled, a nightmare, from which you simply can't escape, even with death. <br /> <br /> go see it, it's really worth it! I gave it 9 out of 10.
