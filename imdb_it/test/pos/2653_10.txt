There is really no way to compare this film with any other film, because nobody has ever done anything like that and nobody will ever do it. And it should really be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At least it deserves to be seen with an excellent sound system. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie the day it was opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science fiction and wanted to see a film about "space". Remember that this film was made before the first moon landing. <br /> <br /> We sat down, waiting for it to start. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no oncoming attraction. The owner of the Cooper Theater, for some reason, chose to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights still on, so we all got up, we never did it in a movie before or after and then we sat down again. Then the theater became completely DARK and the strange opening began with the white screen barely visible. <br /> <br /> The overture ended and my place began to VIBRATE when the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first low note, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing "Also Sprach Zarathustra "for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun. <br /> <br /> (I highly recommend that you watch this opening, this movie, in a DARK room with your subwoofer up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theater.) Sure, there is It took a while before we arrived in space and the film that followed was nothing but a science fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, very undervalued and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in amazement, breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> I saw 7 more times in the next year, always in a real life-size theater, like all the theaters were before the multiplexes. I may have been "tall" once but I didn't go to see him again and again because I was "tripping". I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO BEAUTIFUL; the sound you could hear in your bones followed by terrifying silence; unimaginable and unimaginable places; affection for HAL that turns into terror. And, of course, was the WTF really Kubrick trying to cross me? Years and years and many other visions later, I understand it too, I think, as always. Read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search the web, you'll find "explanations", which is not my purpose in writing these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope is to encourage you to look at it with patience, enjoy the beauty of the way you would like to watch a sunset while listening to the best music you know (for example, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it as if it were a wonderful meal, sip it like a good wine; watch and listen to the clues and hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your conclusions. Stanley Kubrick wanted to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and wanted you to think about where you were. a human being, where you came from. <br /> <br /> If it's too much work for your brain, and you can't see, hear and meditate on the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, I lose my frankness, but your life is as significant as it is that of a tapir or a pre-monolith monkey. If you want a carefree escape, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries and sensuality and you can have an open mind this movie will add something to your life.
