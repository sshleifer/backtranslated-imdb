This first (and hopefully not the last) feature of Wallace & Gromit is up to expectations. There are lots of jokes (a bit cheeky) and some great tributes to science fiction films of the past. With the flurry of terrible and formidable movies spread out from Hollywood, it's nice to see a movie as beautiful as this that is fun for almost everyone. If there is justice, it will be at the top of the box office and will at least be nominated for the best animation at the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are very funny. This is one of those movies that the whole family can enjoy. Fascinating, intelligent, fun and well done, what don't you like?
