This film has some of the best dialogues ever written. The really good lines are all given to George C. Scott, a man who knew what to do with succulent dialogue. I've just seen this movie again, for the first time in 20+ years, and the dialogue is as good as ever. The bizarre events at the hospital are so imaginative to dazzle you. They often involve such wonderful poetic justice as to be close to genius. I love this movie !!
