This is a film that is much more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 1950s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS - with most of VALLEY's excesses and laziness being a little improved for the public of 1959. Like this next film, both are about three young women who are on the fast track to success - even if this time it is in the publishing world instead of in the entertainment sector (even if one of the women of THE BEST OF EVERYTHING has Broadway aspirations). <br /> <br /> The film begins with Hope Lange joins the company for her first day of work. Joan Crawford is assigned to a nail-hard boss, appearing in her first leading role in recent decades. Despite how ugly Crawford looks, Lange is determined not to give in - to do it in this job. And, as time goes by, he moves quickly through the ranks, from the secretary to the publisher. At the same time, his two new roommates also try to level up: one across the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy. Like VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, everyone has their ups and downs (mostly low) but at the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will do it - battered and bruised, however. <br /> <br /> In this film, men are mostly pigs. The only guy that looks decent is played by Stephen Boyd, so of course Hope Lange neglects him for an ex-boyfriend who's not right. As for the guys played by veteran actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how Crawford has become so bitter and mean. <br /> <br /> This film has it all - adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc. and it is certainly NOT an artistic triumph. However, thanks to excellent production values ​​and a juicy script, this is a joy to watch. Just don't expect Shakespeare !!
