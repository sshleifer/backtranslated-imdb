Fran√ßois Villon was a true poet and rogue who lived in Paris in the fifteenth century. However, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually a fiction - from a show created in the early twentieth century. While in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI, he actually died at thirty and was never involved in all the intrigues as in this film. In fact, he wrote some adorable verses and was often on the wrong side of the law - not the combination of a patriot character and Robin Hood as he is in the film. Provided that you know that the film is almost 100% fiction, then it is worth seeing it - do not assume that it is a good history lesson. <br /> <br /> In THE BELOVED ROGUE, Villon is played with a wild abandon by John Barrymore. I was also happy enough to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was the brave dwarf, has played in tons of films over the years and has had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to movies. Mack Swain is best known as the silent film in many of Chaplin's short films and played his partner in THE GOLD RUSH. All four of these men have done a good job and have no complaints - even with Barrymore's rather exaggerated treatment rather reminiscent of a performance by Douglas Fairbanks. However, the performance with which I had a serious problem was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call this "unclear" would be a gross euphemism. He played the role of a high school student who thought he was the stereotype of Richard III, who roamed and behaved like a demonic caricature. While Veidt has been wonderful in many, many movies (both silent and loud), but here it is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's full of greedy adventure and action - like a bold movie minus the sailing ships. The sets worked well for all this, as they had been used the previous year for THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were set in the same period. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is one of the last great silent films. There is much to love and the film is a beautiful combination of romance, comedy and action. It's worth seeing, even if it loses a couple of points for Veidt's overacting as well as the way the movie plays fast and free with history. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was also made twice as IF I WERE KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are the closest to the original game. However, in total, six films talk about Villon and tell, more or less, variations on the same story!
