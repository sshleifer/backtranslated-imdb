So, after years and years, I finally tracked down this movie! I was dying to see how he lived in my memories. I distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two crossed wooden planks in the mine, staring at them with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most chilling blow of my childhood, I remember the chills running down my spine. Looking at it now, obviously it's not at all scary, but rather unconsciously strange to see the same images again. If anyone wants a copy, send me a private message. <br /> <br /> The story itself is standard BCFF stuff. It is strange, however, that the message is not clear this time - there is no real morality as such (except that "ghosts are here to help us?" Or "not to be biased against ghosts!"). There was not even a greed / capitalist corner in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. However, a huge act of irresponsibility on the part of the captain, encouraging the two boys to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only in a mine, but in a new mining pit, which is totally dangerous. The captain encourages children to go down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. It's also a bit strange that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just to help the adults trapped to direct. Oh good.
