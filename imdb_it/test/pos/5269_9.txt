I am impressed that "Hail the Woman" was created for nothing; released just a year after American women got the vote, this turgid drama makes a serious appeal against the double sexual standard that judges women's sexual behavior harder than men. <br /> <br /> SLO SPOILERS AHEAD. A prologue, set in the colony of Plymouth in 1621, shows a pilgrim girl sentenced to flirt with a boy; the boy is not penalized. Now we come to Flint Hill, in New Hampshire in the present (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a biblical bomber: what we call in Britain and in Australia "a God who bothers." Beresford is determined by the fact that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) has become a preacher, regardless of how David feels. As for the daughter of Beresford, Judith ... well, Beresford is sure that women are not important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers. Apparently, God told him personally. <br /> <br /> David's evangelical career is compromised when he imbues Nan Higgins, the stepdaughter of the local blacksmith. (The character of Tully Marshall is identified in the credits only as "Odd Jobs Man", but a close up of a check reveals that his name is Jake Higgins. The prejudices of 1921 require that he be simply Nan's stepfather, not his biological parent.) To save his son from the scandal, Beresford buys Nan's stepfather by check. Nan goes to the big city, to melt into oblivion like an unmarried mother. <br /> <br /> Judith is naturally dismayed by the limits imposed on her by her genre. (Or rather, according to the perceptions of others). She meets Wyndham Gray (excellent interpretation of Edward Martindel), an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes. But Judith is informally engaged to Joe Hurd, who cannot stand such absurdities. Hurd is played by Vernon Dent, a burly performer now remembered only for comedic roles (like a second banana for Harry Langdon and as a villain in the Three Stooges movies). It gives an excellent performance here, in a role beyond its usual range. Unfortunately, in real life, Dent spent his last years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. Eventually, Judith ends up working in an orphanage. Being 1921, I expected the orphanage to be for whites only, so I was pleasantly surprised when it was discovered that it included a Chinese boy. (And unpleasantly surprised when he is used as his ass for a racial joke.) The film makes a strange mistake here. In a Christmas sequence, we see the lover of the orphanage reciting "A visit from St. Nicholas" ... but (in a dialogue title) attributes to Santa Claus Seven reindeer instead of eight. This is followed by a short animation sequence, showing Santa with six reindeer attached to his sleigh. I assume that the animators (both by chance and to save money) have omitted two reindeer, and the title sheet has revised the poem to match the mistake. <br /> <br /> Lloyd Hughes was generally an insignificant and insignificant actor. His most famous performance is his role in "The Lost World", where he is easily overshadowed by a wild brontosaurus. For his scene culminating in 'Hail the Woman', Hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. In his interpretation of howling father of the gospel, Theodore Roberts was accused of exaggerating to the point of making his role a caricature. I disagree: unfortunately, in decades of this film, I continue to meet crazy "saints" exactly like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them, and firmly convinced that they have God's authority to do it. /> <br /> In the central role of Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor offers a sensitive, realistic and intelligent performance. I don't usually like Vidor, who tended to play glamorous roles but not enough to justify them. Here, the physical appearance of his character is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> The entire film is impressively directed by John Griffith Wray, a director who deserves to be much better known. Unfortunately, Wray died at the beginning of the talkie era, around the age of thirty-five: if he had lived for another ten years, he would surely have directed several sound classics. In 'Hail the Woman' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions: I was particularly struck by a scene in the New England forest, when Vidor and Dent had a fight in front of a huge uprooted tree. (I wonder where this film was actually shot.) "Hail the Woman" treats unpleasant topics, but it deserves to be much better known, and I will evaluate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.
