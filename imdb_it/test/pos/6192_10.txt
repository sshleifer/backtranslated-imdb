The problem with this series is that it is too real. I'm watching it on Amazon "Unbox" and having just finished episode 2 I hate, absolutely hate, Fark, the leader of Cell. I can't remember any television series that has ever had this emotional impact. Remember the old tag line for horror movies "Just keep telling your movie"? Well, I find myself repeatedly reminding myself that it is the "only TV". But obviously it's not just TV? The possibility of a cell like the one depicted here that actually operates in the United States is certainly within the range of plausibility. This is what gives this program its bad authenticity. And that's why I hate him so much.
