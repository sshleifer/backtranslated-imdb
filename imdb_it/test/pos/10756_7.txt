It must be admitted that Harold Lloyd's best work ended with his last great silent comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After that he went into sound films (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC Fields) and did better than Keaton, but not as good as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his films as a producer (but he scoured his films so that there were five years between productions). Laurel & Hardy were under the protection of Hal Roach, so the production standards for short films and sound films were pretty good. Fields worked for the first time with Mack Sennett, who with Paramount, and then with freelance. Lloyd tried the road Chaplin took, but with less success. <br /> <br /> He produced his films, but unlike Chaplin he did not own his studio. Even his first two choices were not good (especially "Feet First"). But he began to choose more wisely and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's-Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and perhaps "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock") were his best sonic deeds. They are all fun, but no one lives up to "Safety Last", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Speedy". <br /> <br /> Of the four best sound films, "The Cat's Paw" is the most controversial. Ezekiel Cobb's solution to free the city that elects him as mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005. Or is it? When a film is made, its policy is dictated: "The Cat's Paw" dates back to 1934. That second year of the Roosevelt New Deal (also quite controversial for heavier government involvement) saw films like "Gabriel Over the White House "and" The phantom president ", where our leaders have taken extra-constitutional actions to free the nation from internal enemies (and to force disarmament around the world). Cecil B. De Mille also entered this act with "This Day and Age", where a group of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, the use of violence to force anyone (even a bunch of henchmen and charlatans like Alan Dinehart's band) to confess is repulsive. After all, the Supreme Court has protected us from confession under duress. What we forget is that the reforms we are thinking about did not occur until Warren Court and Burger Court made them. For example, although Mr Justice Sutherland's opinion in the 1932 Powell case ("Scottsboro Boys") ensured that every criminal defendant had the right to defend himself, Gideon v. Wainwright did not extend it to the ordering court for the defendants until 1962. The Miranda Case, with its well-known anti-self-incriminating warning, is from 1963. Nothing similar was deemed necessary in 1934. <br /> <br /> If studies other films from the period up to 1954 (and even in 1960) tricks are used to obtain confessions - Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes to witnesses in "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster holds a gun for him. When Lancaster leaves, Douglas grins to confess under duress, only to see that the gun is unloaded. Suddenly he realizes that (legally - in 1948) he confessed without compulsion. I hate to say that to all the civil libertarians who read this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd does to Dinehart and his friends in "Cat's Paw" conclusion was not only legal, but would have led to their prison sentences in 1934. We can call it heavy, fascist or horrible, but it would have worked legally when it was thought.
