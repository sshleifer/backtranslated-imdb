Another slice of darkness and denial that lies beneath the surface of the American suburbs, Imaginary Heroes tells the life of the Travis family, who is recovering after the suicide of his oldest son. <br /> <br /> The couple in the middle of the film is mother and son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both played in different ways following their death. While Tim experiences drug prescription and sexuality, Sandy regresses to his previous self, smoking marijuana and dealing with an old act of infidelity. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and Tim is well explored, especially when referring to both of them being marginalized by their own family: Sandy because of his relationship and Tim, initially, due to always being at the shadow of his most successful older brother. Sandy Ben's (Jeff Daniels) husband has a considerably shorter time, which, in a devastating depiction of denial, orders Sandy to prepare an additional plate of food for his dead son and put him in his old place at the table. Michelle Williams's older sister, Penny, has been signed and could easily be excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> Despite its long runtime, Imaginary Heroes does not explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve, while some of the black comedy of the film does not translate as one might like to like Dan Harris, writer / director. And the representation of a disturbed family dynamic is not represented as strongly as many other films out there with similar ideas. But despite some problems, the central performance of Weaver and Hirsch is astonishing, and they easily bring the film to its conclusion with subtle success. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
