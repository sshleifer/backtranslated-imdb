One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As obscure and obscure as anything produced by German expressionists, but with fairly discreet and naturalistic exhibits for that day. No camera that attacks and no involuntary laughter due to histrionics with wide eyes. Sjostrom gave a convincing performance like David Holm, drunk, mean and terrifying. <br /> <br /> Set mainly at night in a squalid Swedish slum, the film had a claustrophobic feeling linked to the set, aided by low key lighting and extensive use of the iris. <br /> <br /> There was a deep, and typically Scandinavian, sense of desperation and desperation for the narrative: the film begins in a rather gloomy present, and then we told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks in flashbacks - a rather complex narrative structure for 1921), where his character is offered numerous possibilities for redemption, but he does not accept them, and we know he will not take them, because we have seen him drunk, wretched and bad as always in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as the one I saw throughout the cinema. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing are narrow and intelligent, even by today's standards. In several cases, Sjostrom skillfully sets the public to suspect one thing, and then brings out a surprise. The ending may not be a surprise to some viewers, but I didn't see it coming. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a complete restoration and a DVD version. Or even a poor version of the budget. It just needs to be out there so people can see it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which goes up to 10/10
