The first time I saw the poster, I was stunned by its tranquility and beauty. Then the city of Istanbul has been haunting in my mind ever since. <br /> <br /> Not much dialogue, not a lot of music, the whole film was shot as elaborate and aesthetic as a sculpture. In reality it is a landscape. <br /> <br /> There are actually a lot of things in the film, but the director deliberately omitted the most dramatic parts and left them to our imagination, thus creating a really flat life. ** (slight spoiler) You can see Mahmut's ladylove crying in the toilet and then he goes out without a word but not their fight; one sees Mahmut accompanying his mother to the hospital but not his struggle for illness. The most dramatic scene in the film for me is Yusuf who laughs out loud for the little soldier he bought for his niece, ** and at that moment it almost took my heart to see this boring and lonely life explode like that. /> <br /> With all the banalities of life grassed, history presents us with the pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regrets ... And while the story unfolded, I finally grabbed their desperate situation in which their emotions were really no way out if no external things intervened, which is exactly the attempt of every solitary to keep at all costs, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I have just finished my second vision. Last night I curled up in my quilt, took Vodka next to my bed and spent the whole movie in a trance. I heard two real lives, one off screen, one inside the screen. I felt free from all those solitudes and anxieties because the people inside were experiencing it. I just got out of all those things. <br /> <br /> We cannot deny the universal problem of communication, and loneliness also puts us very far, and becomes a vicious spiral. I bet Mahmut hasn't yet found a way to live in the end. That's why he came out of his room to try to find the answers from the outside world, the coldness and the landscape.
