At first the film seemed a little slow. But he picked up speed and reached the point. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist supported humanity and the reasons for the "gadget". I liked it. It is very close to reality like any film on atomic bombs that had to be dropped in Japan. I recommended it to friends. I was particularly pleased with Dwight Schultz's acting ability.
