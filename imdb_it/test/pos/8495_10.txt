This film inspired me to be a better person. In life you do not know who you will meet and sometimes our prejudice will make us harm a person in a wrong way. I learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this film. I also learned that difficult love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where to find the soundtrack of the film. There are songs in this soundtrack that I've been trying to get for years. I can comment on acting for a second. Jamie Fox was exceptional. The man became the actor of the actors. The performance of Regina King was also fantastic. If I can get a woman to look at me like she looked at Ray ... I can only dream. I spent $ 18.00 for this movie and I don't have much money, but I'm willing to watch this movie again and again. This film touched me.
