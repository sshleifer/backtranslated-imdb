For me, "Late Chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first Naruse film that I completely enjoyed, but because it was as technically modern and innovative as its 30 years of work I've seen. This does not mean innovative editing in the way Godard would introduce it with "Breathless" in 1959, but exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> The editing was as fluent as in the best Hollywood movies of the 1930s / '40s, but at the same time incredibly suitable for the way he was telling his story. Unlike them, she never intentionally emphasized anything or tried to make herself "invisible" but, along with cinematography, made me feel like I was traveling on a delicate stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a light touch of hand or the almost imperceptible rocking of a cradle. In this sense the film was comparable to the work of Ozu and Mizoguchi, but somehow even more subtle. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera-work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943) which is revealing a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us. <br /> <br /> I feel that the editing and the cinematography of Naruse are the most interesting aspects of his films, raising the meaning of the stories beyond the obvious. The wonderful sets and settings should not be forgotten either! I found the story itself rather conventional. <br /> <br /> Narrative and its characters have been introduced in a very interesting way, and I thought that the first half of the film was creating a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations. Unfortunately the second part of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and formal with respect to the installation (although in itself it would have been perfectly suited to any other less complex film). Somehow I felt that he failed a little in an attempt to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Maybe he should have kept them intact. This criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film, especially since the procedure still remembers the way Ozu dealt with the plot in his films. Unfortunately I have not yet had the feeling that Naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in the conclusions of his films in an equally sublime way. The best efforts I have seen to date - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Cloud Dispersions / 1967) - have sustained the energy that he had built during the narration, at the same time offering poignant and resonant endings. <br /> <br /> This is already more than most directors are able to do, and in my opinion the basis for a true mastery of the cinematographic medium. In this regard, and considering the resonance of the last two films I saw from him, it may have already become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have at the moment, is where I am going to see more of his films on the big screen.
