If you like subtle psychological dramas / thrillers, this is a movie for you. Whoever wants to see a normal erotic thriller based on sex and crime surely won't understand this film, as Colin Firth obviously did when he called it "junk". But Jennifer Rubin is still the real star of the film. She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! Together with the tortuous plot, it becomes more and more psychological and makes you think of yourself, directing, photography and above all music make this film a masterpiece. Even the small parts are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is fantastic in her little scene. I hope it will soon be released on DVD and that the soundtrack album is a dream come true !!
