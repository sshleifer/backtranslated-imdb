Since Mr. Bean hardly ever speaks, I strongly recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding your finger over the pause / play button. At the end of the lesson for any age group, simply spend 5 minutes pausing and playing the DVD, encouraging students to shout the answers to "What is this?", "What will happen?", "What's happening? "," What's wrong?? ", Or any other question that elicits answers from the new vocabulary and grammar of that lesson. <br /> <br /> Because everyone watches TV, normally shy students become vocal. Since the DVD can be started or stopped at any time, it is a perfect "filler" for embarrassing "between" times when students are starting and coming. <br /> <br /> I have tried other DVDs, in particular "Tom & Jerry" cartoons and DVDs by Red Skelton, but no one else was as good as "Mister Bean" in keeping the students' constant attention.
