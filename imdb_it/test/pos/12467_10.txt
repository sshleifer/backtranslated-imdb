Director Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire), beautifully filmed and acclaimed, creates a story that brings back the entire legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of the monkeys with reverence and dignity, and with a purpose that never was seen in Tarzan's films. Christopher Lambert makes his starring debut as the young Lord, raised in nature by a gorilla female after her parents die in Africa. Later he returned to what for him is an alien world, that of class and privilege, he feels totally out of place. Once he learns what happened to the monkeys that raised him and their world, he realizes he has to go back. A sad but triumphant story told against a backdrop of fantastic panoramas. This is one of those movies that is a must for every Cinemaphile collection.
