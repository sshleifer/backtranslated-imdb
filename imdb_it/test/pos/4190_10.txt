The cinema of the 60s was as long a time of revolution as politics and music. The directors had dared to make avant-garde films that discussed taboo subjects only previously allowed in exploitative films. Starting from "breathless" and underground American cinema (like Kenneth Anger), films have become increasingly experimental. All this accumulated when Hollywood realized it had mass commercial appeal with "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) releases of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "The head" was created when The Monkees' career was seriously falling, which is what is damn one of the best psychedelic movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, there isn't really one, as many have said. It involves The Monkees moving from a surreal scenario to the next. However, these sequences are obviously tinged with LSD and basically make fun of the way The Monkees felt tired of being limited to their prefab reputation. It is a pity that the film has not found the public. The teenagers who loved them had started a new fashion as they always do. The psychedelic / Haight-Ashbury crowd that the film was picked up would never have been caught in a Monkees movie. It's all their loss. This film may be a plot less, but it is certainly not meaningless and is put together in a very intelligent way. The crew subsequently built both "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The film was later taken up in a Raybert retrospective of 1973 and received a very positive response, which granted him the cult he deserved for a long time. Ironically, The Monkees would have fallen victim to the same commercialism that they protested in this film with their subsequent 1980s meeting. (10/10)
