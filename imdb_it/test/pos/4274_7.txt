This show is really the Broadway American Idol. He sang, the British boy, a boy who is sometimes handsome and a super-pretty woman. <br /> <br /> Of course it's different because there's a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). <br /> <br /> I gave this show to 7 because there are a couple of tweaks that I know many people (including myself) would do if they worked for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges who decide who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who makes the house. The sing-off doesn't really make sense. The person with the least number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another thing I would change is seeing them act on the show. What is Broadway without acting? The last thing that needs to be changed is the song that eliminated people sing at the end. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they go out. Since they sing it every week those songs eventually become annoying. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm not a fan of the film, Grease, but for some reason I'm passionate. This show is very underrated. It has so many performances and memorable moments.
