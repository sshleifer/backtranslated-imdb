Have you ever wondered what it feels like to feel FREE? I am sure that each of us knows the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage. HARI OM shows the public what freedom really means. In this film, freedom is described in the form of style represented by the discovery of India in India. Isa discovers her true inner love when she is traveling in rickshaw with Mr. HARI OM. Look at life in a different way and portray the freedom that every woman limits in herself when she is in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely "worthy of a watch", and I saw it for the first time at the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), and left the movie theater with complete satisfaction. <br /> <br /> "Watch it"!
