This is another of Hitchcock's top rated films and rightly so. This is a story of two men meeting on a train and jokingly exchanging murder fantasies. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to problems with the law. Another rapidly evolving Hitchcock film with many fantastic scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worth mentioning). It's not a movie you can't miss - it's a shame that nobody reissues it on DVDs with a lot of extras - just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all there is out there now.
