If you liked movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll like LOVE Two Hands. It has the same kind of black humor wrought on it and will entertain you throughout the movie. As a Pulp Fiction, it has the extravagant scenarios in which the characters enter and behave with them. Together with Gallipoli and Picnic at Hanging Rock, this must be one of the best Australian films I've ever seen. He is also the protagonist of a young Heath Ledger before he became really big in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly underrated film that I think is just as good as Pulp Fiction and the big ones. You have to see it!
