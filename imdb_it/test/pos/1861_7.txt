The wife and wife of real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly act in Creation, which tells the period of Charles Darwin's life before the publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, his infamous tome that changes evolution natural selection. Darwin's research has created a huge rift, a schism among the believers of his days and scientists. At the time he was told to go to war against God and even to have "killed God". <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devoted and loving wife. A revealing scene at the beginning when he is leading the dinner in prayer and Charles cannot say that "Amen" foreshadows what will follow and of the strong differences between the two. She is convinced that she will be eternally damned and bring bad luck to their family by rejecting God. <br /> <br /> Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, his faith and his even stronger reason. There are some beautiful moments in which he observes the animals, dissects their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives, explaining the selection phenomena to his children, the eldest, Annie, with a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with the first orangutan of England, Jenny, playing with him as if he were a child, deciphering his every look and action. <br /> <br /> Annie, the firstborn, dies later and Charles becomes haunted by his death, having been closer to her. In my opinion this part was too long, bizarre and pulled out. I don't like triumphant scenes in which it seems he is losing his mind and being chased by the ghost of his daughter, who screams and sings. Although Charles thinks his wife blames him for his fatal illness, he says very poetically: "The truth is that if I knew what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow." Their bond is solid and indissoluble despite the tremendous differences of belief. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he gives his wife the last copy, telling her he can burn her if she disagrees. Continue reading it nights and finally present him a package, the book ready to be sent to his publisher. In the end, reason and perhaps even love triumphs, while making his most convinced opponent complicit. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating that Darwin received a complete Christian burial at Westminster Abbey, proof that his land - revolutionary ideas were obviously controversial, but had already been recognized as a vital knowledge for progress of the human race. <br /> <br /> The film draws heavily on Darwin's family life, his joys and his problems. I really liked this aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary, I quote, "Hitler's passion for table tennis". This is true in some respects and I cannot disagree with his desire to have learned more about Charles Darwin's theories from this film than we do. However, it remains a well-executed and impeccable vintage drama. <br /> <br /> My vote: 7 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 14
