The 1973 LOST HORIZON musical version is ALL TIME's most wonderful and campy captivating film. The 1973 musical remake of the novel by James Hilton on the legendary SHANGRI-LA! it is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and texts by HAL David. A strange mixture of drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the peculiarity of being the ONLY anti-war musical fantasy ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but it made a lot of money abroad. Only in America has it failed. Very different and unique in his approach as a musical film, he deserves a much better credit than what is given. As a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure and both Frank Capra's 1937 film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a talented director and filmmaker. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it is a wonderful place. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARE THE JOY and LIVE TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER evoke a happiness that Hilton spoke about in her novel. Why should Shangri-La not be a stupid place? The two love songs, I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY and the deleted I COME TO YOU are the sensitive points in the photo. There is a tranquility and a soft spoken quality in both of these songs that is very much in line with the philosophy of history. Furthermore, THE THINGS I WILL NOT MISS is a good duet with a strong melody. It is a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can criticize Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman while she beats, sings and dances on the tables? They are a wonderful team and the number is well staged. <br /> <br /> I've always found it interesting in this story how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a kind soul but rather radical in his vision of the whole humanity. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be redone today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis on the protagonist, RICHARD ONWAY's conflict with what he left in the outside world than what he found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, for the film to be credible, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as a suffering amnesia in the end, as if it were in the book. Nor were the film versions of LOST HORIZON faithful to the novel in this regard. Conway found Shangri-La or was it imagined? Have they all died in the plane crash? Every man has his idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway that wants to believe in Shangri-La and return to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway does not want to leave paradise, but is put under pressure by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both have been able to probe James Hiltons's ideas about a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti-capitalism in its theme where money and materialism are not the motivation. Human goodness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with one another is the rule. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. Try to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and can hardly be criticized for not having success. It must be remembered that in 1973 LOST HORIZON was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for the characters to go wild in the songs of a musical, much less to be nicknamed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for exhausted critics. Expectations were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get them both. Ross Hunter has had decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his next film after his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT. The film was the greatest money maker in the universe up to that point and the success of that photo triggered a decade of catastrophic films. For years AIRPORT has been the most watched film ever shown on television. He was nominated for 11 Oscars including the Best Film Award. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. LOST HORIZON's imperturbable sentimentality almost didn't have a chance after the breaking of the censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence were a new frontier between the late 1960s and the early 1970s. The public flocked to movies with content that they were not used to seeing on screen. The most sumptuous musicals were no longer welcomed, no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be appreciated and appreciated on several levels. It's the quintessential film par excellence with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and bizarre humor. It is unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced up to 45 minutes into the film. Change course halfway when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves to be rediscovered. A lost and legendary treasure that deserves much better than its reputation.
