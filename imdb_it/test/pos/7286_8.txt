It became extremely difficult to find a good horror movie, I thought this movie was a good thriller. They could have better production values ​​but what kept me going was the suspense and turns. I had real reservations before seeing this movie (due to the cover). I was afraid it would be too bloody and bloody. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many scary parts, there is also a lot of suspense and drama. <br /> <br /> Acting in Dead Line was better than you'd expect from a micro-budget horror movie. The characters were believable <br /> <br /> The movie is really thrilling and pretty scary in moments so it makes you take your place until the credits roll down <br /> <br /> because of his production values ​​(the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.
