Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew who was writing the poison, so everyone was suspected, with another masterpiece, the Quai des Orfevres four years later, in which we know from the beginning (or we think we do) whodunnit. Louis Jouvet, with the best billings, does not appear for forty minutes, a time in which Clouzot has created an environment rich in Music Hall, music publishers, etc. And a nice cast of colorful characters; Angela Lansbury (Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris in the same year) Suzy Delair marks as a singer whose desire to improve her fate inspires the jealousy of her husband / companion Bernard Blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch just to find him he's already dead. From here things go seriously wrong, his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his predetermined alibi is out of the window while, unbeknownst to him, his wife confesses the murder to the neighboring photographer, a lesbian in the closet in love of her, who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve Delair's scarf and as long as she's there, thoughtfully cleans her fingerprints on the murder weapon, a bottle of champagne. At this point the investigator Jouvet gets involved and from that moment on it is about keeping the plates turning in the air. Clouzot's production was relatively small, but practically everything was, as Spencer Tracey said in another context, "cherce", with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still to come. In short, this is a must for lovers of French cinema.
