This film must be seen for music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. The cantata can be appreciated alone, but having seen the film helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is a fairly standard anti-German war propaganda. An amusing anecdote is that later Stalin was so anxious to gain time by appeasing Hitler at the beginning of World War II that Eisenstein was seconded for a short period in a German film, as a penance. <br /> <br /> Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), after gaining the nickname by defeating the Swedish raiders on the Neva river, the Russian resistance of the flies against an invasion of the Teutonic knights, and concludes the his victory with a stern warning to other potential invaders. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians taken as slaves by Mongol soldiers, and does nothing to stop him, since the Teutonic knights are his priority. Historian Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the Mongol khans, like his father before him, while working to consolidate the future independence of his kingdom.
