I didn't expect much when I rented this film, as many independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days (well, even Hollywood movies), but this movie was fantastic, really great, it's too bad it didn't reach a huge audience because it is simply superb. I really love Alice's determination, she really makes me look at my life as a gift, and I see how privileged I am just to get an education. But apart from that, this film really shows that a good artist can tell a good story, no matter what the budget is, it's an excellent film and everyone should watch it, love it and surely learn something from it. I don't have to be roger ebert to know that it is one of the best films I've seen throughout the year, and certainly one of the most truthful.
