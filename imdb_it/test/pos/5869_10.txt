I was recently given this movie on DVD and initially I wasn't sure if it would be interesting (even if one of my favorite actors has a starring role). In fact, he is well on his way to becoming a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all: fortunately, it is not * the same as the book, whose ending is excessively melodramatic. Secondly: it is one of the best films I saw about the First World War. "What?" you might ask "It's not a war movie!" True: we do not see battles or bombings, no trenches, no gas. But it shows the cost of war, the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it, and the impact this has had on those close to them. <br /> <br /> First we see Helen (Sarah Miles), the widow of a baronet, waiting for her release from a psychiatric hospital. All the women in the film seem to be widows: some of the war, but Helen's much older husband, Sir Thomas (we see him later in a photograph) got sick and died while he was at a party, hence his guilt - hit exhaustion You are lost and alone. The thread around the hospital camp evokes prison camps and trenches: like many of the men in the outside world, Helen suffers from a kind of shell shock. <br /> <br /> Outside the hospital, he must find his feet in the outside world again: a world that we experience through his eyes as bleak, desolate and hostile. His mother is unable to provide any real support. A widow herself, she set aside her emotional defenses, behind which she hides to avoid facing her daughter's anguish. (Like many people, especially at that time, he seems to find mental illness embarrassing.) Ledbetter, the hired driver, becomes a supportive presence and helps Helen adapt again to life, but she doesn't realize that she's becoming dangerously obsessed from her. This is a superb performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, a former sergeant major who runs a boxing club and has set up his own car rental business. Superficially, it looks hard and strong, reliable, but there are cracks under the surface: it has not really adapted to civilian life. Invent (for reasons that he later explains) a family and family life that he does not have; he has brutal explosions with his colleagues and sex without love. Approaching Helen ?? a woman who, even with the greater social freedom of the post-war period, could not realistically hope to get married? exposes lines of psychological disturbance that tear him to pieces. These days, one could diagnose PTSD. <br /> <br /> The same applies to the other man in the life of Helen, aspiring politician Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, handsome, but also very young. To say the least, his girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), does it as a mom, combs her hair and makes sure she has a clean handkerchief before going out. He is known by both Ledbetter and Helen: the first had served during the war, and Helen had met him in political circles and considered him a "popinjay". However, he and Helen begin a relationship, with Helen intending to support her political career, financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, a veteran of Stanhope's theatrical success in "Journey's End" by the Sheriffs of R C, makes Hugh more than an immature cadet. There is a revealing and underestimated scene in the back of the car between Helen and Hugh, in which they quote Brooke's "Old Vicariate of Grantchester". You ask, of your war experience, "Was it very bad?" He can't answer. She says, "Well, you're back now." But his answer, in a low voice? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder ??" ?? is the key to his character. As the light and the shadow flicker on his face, we know that there are horrors that cannot be translated into words. The disproportionate losses suffered by minor officers of its kind ?? left school or university and are you expected to drive from the front? are well known In a nervous speech (during which Helen reassures him) to local politicians at a dinner party, he reveals that he will be independent, no longer as a liberal (the party that brought the country to war). His emotional life is damaged like that of Ledbetter. He cannot easily extricate himself from Connie, who depends on him emotionally and financially: reading between the lines, he is probably a war widow (perhaps of a former partner?) With a child, whose drawings we see on the wall of his house. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The crisis between the trio is slowly growing, with a frightening scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car, and Ledbetter listening to Hugh and Connie when he is driving them, while Hugh tries to convince Connie that even as her relationship with Helen develops, they can continue to do theirs; which, at least, will continue to support it. Jealousy, obsession and his belief that he must protect Helen from a duplicated gold digger lead Ledbetter to confront her and Hugh violently at home. <br /> <br /> The ending is completely different from that of the novel, and it is better for this: it is dramatic, but less melodramatic, and maintains a non-sentimental tone. We started with a character who was recovering from a mental breakdown; we end up with another suffering. Helen, one of the senses, is now wiser and stronger than both men, who have not been able to completely adapt to the so-called "hero-appropriate land", to which they have returned from the nightmare of total war. The new ending is open: one feels that, at least, he will face whatever awaits us, without illusions. In this, it reflects well the reality of the time, in which women (Helen, Connie and many others) had to collect pieces of a world in which too many men had died or returned home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back now." ?? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder ??"
