Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre film, and this film proves it. Turn into a very realistic performance like a small horse trainer and single father, playing no role in sugar. <br /> <br /> It can be, in turn, with a tender and adorable heart, so ironic to his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he does not want his young horse racing is overworked and injured in short-time races, but seems willing to risk the horse's life when he enters the big time. <br /> <br /> This is just one of Matthau's wonderful interpretations, and it's a of those that I highly recommend.
