I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it quite well. If you ask me, it was a pretty good show. Whenever I think about it, I don't remember the opening sequence and the acronym very well. In addition to that, everyone was expressed. Moreover, the writing was very strong. The performances were also of a high standard. I hope some networks report it so I can see every episode. Before concluding, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I'm not sure I saw every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network brings it back, I hope you accept it one day before it goes on forever.
