Imagine a world where everyone treats everyone well, no swear word is ever uttered, office quarrels are non-existent, and your boss regularly invites office audiences to self-cooked dinners where you can talk about the latest interior design styles . Everything is clean, pleasant - well, just cute. In other words: you're in hell. After being abandoned in the middle of nowhere, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), in the mid-1930s, began a new job as an accountant in a small, clean city. From the beginning he feels a stranger in this world of his own, impersonal, of superficial kindness, surrounded by a pleasant but lifeless internal architecture and in the same way by colleagues. The food has no taste of anything, the drinks don't get you drunk, no child anywhere; after the first stages of adaptation, Andreas looks for ways to escape the new world. He no longer knows where he comes from, but he still remembers the rich tastes, the true feelings - anything beyond the flat and non-committal life he is leading now. THE BOTHERSOME MAN echoes the ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here cruelty is the omnipresent simplicity without commitment. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, it is not a narrow-minded bigotry, more a tale of our civilization than the urban free world to adapt. Mostly reminiscent of the ingenious scene of the FIGHT CLUB, in which Edward Norton walks through a fake IKEA catalog. Seasoned with macabre humor, this Scandinavian laconic tale convinces at all levels: history, characters and relevance. A real gem for the screen. 8/10
