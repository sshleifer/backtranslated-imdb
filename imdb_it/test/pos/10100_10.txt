Many horror fans complain that the horror has not progressed in the last twenty years. I was inclined to agree with this until the influx of Asian horror films, a trend that has become patently boring. However, he produced some real classics, and A Tale Of Two Sisters, for me at least, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time. <br /> <br /> Based vaguely on a Korean folk tale, it tells the sad story of two mentally disturbed sisters who reside with their father and stepmother. After having some problems on their first night at home, they decide to stay together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. The tension rises and there is the inevitable click. But what happens next requires more than a pair of eyes, as the plot takes several twists, and the fears become more exciting and real enough. In the end, you may need a few moments to absorb everything and put it together in your mind, but it is exactly this combination of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to look at again and again, if only to make everything work.
