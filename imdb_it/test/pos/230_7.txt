To be brief, the plot is very thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth and an impossible young Phil Silvers keep the film afloat and sometimes lift it up in the air. Some of the songs are terrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a railroad disaster) but most of them are very funny, and Hayworth's scene performing in the absurd set for Kelly's rival must be seen to be believed. Another gem is the perfect faux-NYC set in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, considering these attractions, is the terrible male "cavalry" towards women. The fat cry and transparent obsequiousness that has gone through masculine charm then (in the movies, at least) is presented in its most filthy form here. Some of the men are like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> A little disappointment is that Eve Arden is trapped in such a small role that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential interaction between her and Silvers, a lost opportunity.
