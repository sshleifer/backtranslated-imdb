A documentary about a nomadic tribe in Tibet that comes out in a dry lake to get the salt doesn't seem very tempting. But this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural party so take part in a quick bite of humanity. Superstitions, epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people that truly believes in following their own unique life models are something that the West had in the times of Homer, but which is, unfortunately, completely foreign to most of we in the "developed world. We have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well-established models of life, often with terrible mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society. The directors have woven us into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich men. and discarded it, and showed us that there was more to life than the shopping center and pop culture, so unplug the land lines, turn off the cells, turn off the lights in the driveway and sit back and relax on an adventure timeless.
