I feel a bit disappointed with Tarantino since his death. But I insist that it is only a little, because I can appreciate the amount of work in producing such a tribute to acrobatics. Inglorious Basterds has certainly brought Tarantino to the highest levels in my universe. This film can be summarized (even if inadequately) in one word: "RAW". <br /> <br /> There is intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, since the beginning of the film one feels compassion towards the victims of the Nazis and places himself in the fictitious dimension of Tarantino of the historical context of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Characters are unpredictable, funny, scary, brutal, sexy and other adjectives, I'm sure they slip my mind that they are just as appropriate and positive. I will not enter the appreciation of each character, but the other comments of the other users summarize the appreciation of the various performances. <br /> <br /> The dialogue evolved from the classic provocative style of Tarantino's "bad ass" seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. You can hear in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other films. In fact, many dialogues were close to cinema lessons for the public, the setting partly takes place in a premiere of the film; a reference to a film is near every corner. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see that every language presented (German, French and English) is used fairly fairly and naturally. I speak both French and English very well and am often disappointed by the way the English-speaking characters in French films misread, and by the way the French-speaking characters in British / American films misread. Surprisingly, Tarantino managed to get his actors to act naturally and gracefully by his actors. It helps put the public in the context of the historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> Images / photography are beautiful, with scenarios that convincingly convey a Europe of the 1940s World War II. The clothes are perfect and the violence transmitted orgasmically / realistically. No punches are withheld and the Nazis are often tortured. This makes the film not open to all audiences; graphic violence can shock the most sensitive demographic data. <br /> <br /> volumes can be written on this film. But the film is so beautiful, that during the premiere of the Inglorious North American Basterds at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, I had to pee, but I refused to go so as not to miss a scene. I hope the image conveys how strongly I feel about this film, and I am a difficult audience to satisfy.
