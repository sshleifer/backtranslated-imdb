Jimmy Wang Yu, an authentic Asian superstar, directed and wrote this film that I only saw in a dubbed videotaped version. The widescreen form (Shaw Scope!) Was lost and the original actor's voices were absent, but it's still good to see. The story is the usual martial arts school that fights rascals from Japan's plot with our young hero who eventually wins by beating lots of assorted thugs. <br /> <br /> Combat improves as the film unfolds. At the beginning of the film he looks stiff and boring, but then there is a great scene in which Wang Yu fights hordes in a gambling game and then comes across a snowy scene and takes other enemies with knives, sword and fists. This part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Quite good, but it would be interesting to see a widescreen version not double if there is one.
