After getting passionate about the mini series, "North and South", I couldn't wait to go on, "North and South II". Then years later, came Book III, "THE SKY AND HELL - NORTH AND SOUTH - BOOK III". FINALLY, the last episode arrived for the ongoing saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so entranced by this series that I recorded every part of the TV and then managed to tie up family and friends and I looked at it AGAIN, whenever someone wanted to see them. My tapes are old and I want this trilogy on DVD. If you lost Book III, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it turned out. Do yourself a favor and request this set on DVD!
