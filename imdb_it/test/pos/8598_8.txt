Well, where to start? I came across this in 1993 and I just hit "record" on the VCR by habit, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" is not safe ... but if you've had a bad day and you're in the mood to collapse in front of something not too intellectually stimulating, then I temporarily suggest that this could only be your "thing". <br /> <br /> We have a lot to offer here: a great title track, more stereotypes than you can shake a stick, an unconscious comedy, the sharpest fight scene of all time and much more! David Hemmings interprets the diametrically opposite of his role in the 1960s classic "Blow Up" - still a photographer, still stimulated orally but not "enough" the same. <br /> <br /> John Philip Law is easy to beat as an actor who makes a log look like wood but it wouldn't be nice to see how he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role. <br /> <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? Suffice it to say that it was his only film role! The real star of this film, however, is Ethel Evans, who plays a, we should say secretary (?), With the moral of a cat alley and an ambition to match. The way he manages to reconcile his present life with that of a future with his comic future is actually very moving in an earthy, cruel way, that is-will-be-be. <br /> <br /> I love this movie when I'm in the right mood ....... and I won't touch it with the proverbial overhang when I'm not. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast for maintaining a (relatively) serious face during filming. <br /> <br /> A "classic" in the school of Edward D Wood of film companies!
