This has no relation to Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. The two videos share only the general concept of people who have simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. So, if you were really amazed by the story and the dialogue in VC 1 (yes, right), and you expect a continuation in VC 2, you just have to be warned. All the actors and actresses are new, but he has the same excellent director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But like VC 1, there are a lot of beautiful women and a lot of sex scenes that push the soft core envelope almost as far as possible. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you liked it, you will like VC 2. If you don't have it, but as the really good softcore sex, take both.
