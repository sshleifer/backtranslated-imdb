I wasn't sure about this movie before it was rented and I made sure that Hilary Swank always gave excellent performances in her films. He seems to rely on moderation to get the emotional impact he does. And you didn't show me that I'm not wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film also had fantastic performances by all the other cast members of both language and non-speakers. I must identify Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their exceptional acting skills and the representation of true human feelings and shortcomings. The whole film worked almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I have to applaud Tom Hooper as a director and Avril Beukes as a publisher to keep a multi-layered story revealed smoothly while maintaining the dialogue and action that moves in an understandable fashion. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was surprising and I had to press the pause button to enjoy the photograph. <br /> <br /> Because a film like this can never be nominated for an international award. I seem to press the high value button on all the points. It wasn't just a movie, it was a real life experience in a country that came out of apartheid. A life of poverty was all around but celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
