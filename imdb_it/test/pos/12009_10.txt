I grew up out of Naila Germany (where they landed), every detail of the film was 100% authentic, the power lines flying, the nosy neighbors, the grandmother who told the children that they couldn't watch West German television, etc. . .This film brings back many good memories to European ones, a great production from Disney ... The same film in German has Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner who use their voices to translate the English version into German ... for the Also in version German use the Cookoo birds, a bird native of Germany as background noise to let you know that you are in Germany ... I showed this move to many of my German relatives and I loved this movie. made a prototype balloon that they had to give up because the materials they used were too porous and the other 2 balloons they used for the escape. The burner problem was solved when they overturned the propane cylinders.)
