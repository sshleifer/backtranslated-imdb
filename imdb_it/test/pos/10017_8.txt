I went into "Night of the Hunted", not knowing what to expect. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> It is essentially a thriller where this girl who remembers nothing is "saved" by a boy who passes by. The two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to understand what is happening with her. Through some flashbacks and sad memories, they eventually reach the bottom and the ending is quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> I really liked the setting of this: a desolate and postmodern Paris is the background with a lot of gray skies and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and a lot of nudity. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly it was made in 1980; seems a little ahead of time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, children.
