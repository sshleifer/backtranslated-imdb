The only Zeppelin movie I saw before this DVD is the movie "The Song Remains the Same" from 1976. We used to spend hours around a friend's house watching this, but I never liked it and I hated fantasy sequences .. .. <br /> <br /> So what is this DVD about? I didn't know it existed until I was looking for the Physical Graffiti CD ..... "When did it come out?" I thought <br /> <br /> For some reason I thought that Page was not a great live guitarist, but to say that watching this DVD changed my opinion is a huge euphemism. <br /> <br /> There's "White Summer" since 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar magic. <br /> <br /> There is a 1975 acoustic set - "Bron-y-aur Stomp" has a bright finger-picking sudden section. <br /> <br /> The performances 'In my Time of Dying' and 'Trampled Underfoot' (also from '75) are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham tearing things apart like no one else has ever done. Demonic possessions of rawk !! <br /> <br /> The magic continues in the 1979 Knebworth section. The yield of "Achillies Last Stand", considering their various drug-addictive states, is just a beggar's belief! A song of complex guitar overdubs, Page has arranged them in a way that allows them to punk out live - the effect is absolutely fascinating. 'In the evening' - I've never liked it on record but it flows here. 'Sick Again' - large piece of sleaze rock. The Knebworth movie is very interesting, cutting through the big screen, various rash and impressive bootleg movies. <br /> <br /> Plant is incredible in all performances. Page, despite being painfully thin, looks like a six-year-old who enjoys the Knebworth concert the most - and makes the vision contagious. <br /> <br /> One thing that baffled me - The "black dog" '1973 performance sounds very' encamped '!! Robert Plant has always loved a bit of trita and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and today they deserve an arrest. All very different from the one with muscle binding: a studio version $$$. <br /> <br /> I love this DVD. It reminded me how good the good Zeppelins were.
