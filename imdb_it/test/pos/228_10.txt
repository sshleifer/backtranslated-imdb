To say that this is a good show is to say nothing. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant films. The writing is superb. Even if the show is built on one-liners, they don't become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing the muscles of the play to its full extent as if saying: nothing is seen yet. The format was decidedly refined to introduce Naked Gun. When you watch these movies, notice how many schticks have been taken from the TV show. The brilliant part is that they must not be changed too much. The show was really a test case for bigger and better versions that will come later.
