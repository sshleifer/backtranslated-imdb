Having long disdained network television programming, I remember the first time I caught an episode of "Police Squad!" It was totally by accident. It was during the initial network of the ABC series in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping through the dial one evening when the "Police Squad!" Credit sequence suddenly appeared. On my TV screen. I immediately recognized it as a broadcast of the opening credits of "M-Squad" starring Lee Marvin, one of my favorite cop shows of all time. I stopped surfing. Then, of course, the headquarters was tossed around, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. By now I was saying to myself "What the heck is THIS?" Then came the "special guest star" Georg Stanford Brown, who was flattened by a precipitous fall. I was hooked from that moment. The episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment", with its comical references to "On The Waterfront" and "Muhammed Ali", but of course the most memorable were all the gags seen and not sequitur. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their loose parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" were a real revolt. "Finally," I said to myself, "A television program on the net is really worth watching !!!". You wouldn't know it would be canceled a few weeks later. Leave it to the networks - I should have known. Anyway, I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as fun today as they were 27 years ago. "Naked Gun" movies were also fantastic, but I really missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what did they think OJ OJ would play in that part?), And in particular "Johnny of William Duell "" the shoe shine.
