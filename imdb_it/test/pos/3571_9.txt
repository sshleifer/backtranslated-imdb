'Bluff' was shown for several months in the cinemas of Bogota, and today I finally had time to see it. I really didn't know what to expect, but I was very happily surprised. It's a criminal comedy of the same kind as Snatch, etc. And he manages to balance the suspense elements with comedy well. The style of the film is quickly affirmed with cheerful music and the Argentine narrator who does it directly with the camera - strange the first time, but later adapts naturally. <br /> <br /> With my Spanish far from perfect, I still found the plot and dialogue quite easy to follow, and much of the comedy is situational. My Colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot in the various portraits of people from different regions and social classes who passed on to me a little, but for example a well represented representation of a pompous idiot in a position of power is fun in any language. <I think it's thanks to this film that it has something global: I was not often reminded that this was the Colombia I was watching. Yet it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotoos live like some of the characters in this film, and it is not a bad portraiture of the BogotÃ¡ or Colombia society in any way, just a * selective * portrait - like any film supposedly depicting a situation / culture "real". <br /> <br /> I don't know how much of the comedy would be lost in the subtitles, but if it is your country, surely you go and take a look: it is a very smooth and funny film with great elements of black humor. And all in 90 minutes well packaged.
