I'm a big fan of Gone With the Wind, and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniseries and I loved it. This is a sort of following. As if you weren't expecting it with that ending "Frankly dear, I don't care." Timothy Dalton was as exceptional as Rhett, though no one will ever replace Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on the other hand, could give Vivien Leigh a run for his money (although I feel almost guilty also to say it.) His attitude and presence in the film fits the character to a tee, making you love and hate her at the same time, which is the way most of us also hear in the portrait of Mrs. Leigh. The film moves slowly, mainly because it follows the book so closely and has not been published as a film. Excellent choice by the manufacturer. I think this film deserves recognition for the great storyline, the revival of characters who have been gone for almost 50 years, and for something that even Margaret Mitchell could be proud of.
