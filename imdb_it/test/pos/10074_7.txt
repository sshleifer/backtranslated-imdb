I saw this movie the day it was opened in New York, at Ziegfield. At the time Madonna was not really the cultural icon it is now. He had a couple of successes, he was very good at "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her in concert at Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is that girl?" gives Madonna a real role to play, which is not just a variation of her personality. It makes the crazy / heroin routine better than you might think. Griffin Dunne is very popular as the man around to witness all the scams. <br /> <br /> The story involves a huge cat named Murray, a future bride who slept with every taxi driver in New York, a half-father-in-law and a key. There are lots of car chases and cops following their path. All the elements of a dejected comedy intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is seen briefly. He shares a glass of champagne with cables and has the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with a rainforest and everything. <br /> <br /> Compared to most of Madonna's films (the ones I've been able to tolerate anyway), this is fantastic. In itself, it's not so bad. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was bad.
