What do you do if you are Aishwarya Rai, coming out of a hit movie like "Devdas", with some skeptical critics still relentlessly dissatisfied with your stunning performance or convinced by your strong stage presence and stellar acting skills, what do you do? Go home, sit down and pout? No. If you are Aishwarya Rai, you sign up for the next highlight of the coming period and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the praise, compliments, great scripts and equally great roles. And that's exactly what he did and in "Chokher Bali - a game of passion" in which he plays and shines like Binodini, a young widow who causes controversy long before her time. Directed by Rituparno Ghosh {who later will direct it to the ideal "Raincoat"}, Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali}.
