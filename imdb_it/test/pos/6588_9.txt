This film came as a gift - an unexpected late-night offer - so unlike other reviewers I didn't have any preconceptions whatsoever. I found myself glued to my place while the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own development. I was attracted to recognize my deep love and my humanity as I wanted the "good" to prevail, but also forced to recognize ironically that sometimes I was on the side of the "bad guys". The film is quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and this more than because the film begins and ends in an elegy. Far from being depressing or confrontational, for me, the film recognizes deep suffering - and therefore, by its cyclic nature - with births and rebirths and even deaths - the film celebrates the fact that to quote an Australian poet, there is "sometimes happy". Oh gods, I think he just wrote a love letter for this movie - but here it is. Hola!
