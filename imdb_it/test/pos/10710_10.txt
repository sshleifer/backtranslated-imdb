Actually I discovered Favela Rising through the IMDb website. I have a particular interest in Afro-Brazilian culture and films. Favela Rising is one of those gems that gives new meaning to human transformation. Well documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary is the story of Anderson Sa, a former drug trafficker from Rio De Janeiro who, after the death of family and friends, becomes a Christ, Malcolm X and Ghandi all in one. He formed AfroReggae, a grassroots cultural movement that uses Afro-Brazilian hip-hop, capoeira (Afro-Brazilian martial arts) and other art forms to transform hopeless and more angry youth into life-loving individuals , vital, vital and affectionate. > <br /> A few years ago I remember going to the screening of City Of God (Cidade De Deus) and I left the theater completely numb. The images were grim but stunning and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. I remember how desperate some situations in the Favelas were and how decadent the company was due to government negligence. How drug trafficking was a way of life, how indifferent the citizens of the slums were because death was an everyday event. As the city of God, Anderson Sa talks about how the people of the favelas were also desensitized. He talks about police corruption and how communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that they could not visit family members in other Favelas that you had to meet in a neutral place. Unlike the basic City of God Anderson Sa movement, AfroReggae provides solutions to anger, despair. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the documentary in which Anderson, in the spirit of a preacher, approached some young people and asked them to join AfroReggae. These tired young people were so scarred by everyday survival and violence. Their behavior patterns were drug dealers and this was what they aspired to be. Anderson then said that drug dealers don't live very long. There was a certain reluctance, of course, but five months later he was able to convince some of the young people to join AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The images of Favela Rising are incredible. It is clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only great storytellers but also visual artists. This is a documentary you can't miss! There are some truly magical and transformative moments in this documentary. I don't want to ruin them for you. I want you to see it for yourself. Please tell your friends, academics, young counselors, family members of this wonderful film. It will make you worry about the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I'd give him eleven stars!
