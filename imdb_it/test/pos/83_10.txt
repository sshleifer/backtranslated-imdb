Channel zapping one night I just caught the beginning of this movie and it got me excited from the start. It tells the sad story of a foster child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from Adam's past. I won't reveal you anything else, but it is a very in-depth film and will surely intrigue you. This was one of the best roles of Jimmy Smits in my opinion.
