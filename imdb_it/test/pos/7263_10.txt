I normally hate vintage movies. Living in England is a nightmare right now if you have an allergy to the dramas of the period - which I do. However this is the best. He doesn't take himself seriously and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are fantastic together, Liv Tyler is good even if his English accent is shy !! <br /> <br /> The film has everything for someone who just wants to go to the cinema to have fun. He has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean, but hopefully they will. It would be a pity that the American public lost this film. It shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not involve constant oath and sex. Both are present in this, but in a balanced format. The gentleman's gentleman's representation of Iain Robertson's camp is ingenious and the two brothers in the upper class set are hilarious! <br /> <br /> Since the trailer for "The Spy who Shagged Me" is a marionette for you to say ... "If you see another film" .... this spring, Plunkett and Macleane make it. It's fun, action shots and, of course, Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent to change!
