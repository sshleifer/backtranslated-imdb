I just saw this movie tonight. Upon entering it I thought it would be nice because I really like Natalie Portman and even Susan Sarandon is a great actor, but it was much better than I could have imagined. You get out of the movie feeling strong. The acting was excellent, and it's something that can be hard to find lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and as a university student at New York University, I think it's great that she goes to school instead of just being an actor. However, returning to the topic, the film keeps you interested all the way and I think everyone should go and see it. I would give more details, but I don't want to give the film away.
