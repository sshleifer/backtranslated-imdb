As a fan of robocop, I've always loved this movie. I saw it when it came out, and in the end I bought it on DVD from Brazil, it was never released in the United States on DVD. I like the film, but like everything else in this world, everyone has their opinion, loves it or hates it. no matter what a movie does, someone will always say "why didn't they do it another way?" in other words, you can't please everyone. if you love Robocop, you will love this movie. for me, it's so unique that it's not poor, or as stupid as a lot of cheap movies. this film has always interested me. I can see some scenes that Robocop borrowed from here, but tell me which movies don't do it? many films use other ideas from other films and sometimes change them. Funny movie!
