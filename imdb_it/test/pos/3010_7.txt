This started excellently. Photography and audio are the best I've experienced for years (okay, months). Especially the use of "hot" and "cold" colors in single sequences is surprising. Also, to make Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to do with it. <br /> <br /> Now for the negative aspects. The script was horrible. The part of Lopez turned out to be irrelevant or completely useless for the plot. She seemed the protagonist of the film only to sell herself and the photo. The three beds seemed too obvious. The baptism of the child Carl was a psychologically too underlined way to undertake the reason why Carl "worked". And so on .. <br /> <br /> However, the film had a great way to show where Singh comes from. Why do the most talented directors seem to emerge from India nowadays?
