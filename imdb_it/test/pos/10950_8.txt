A lot of action, a poor love story, unexpected actors and great fun. The special effect is acceptable / decent, some of the fights are quite accurate with some interesting acrobatic moves. The general story moves, and it's bad enough to ask you when the inevitable is going to happen, even if there's a little twist (just a little). The general ingenuity of the film makes it rather extravagant at times. Pretty chicks also what you want most. PS. if you see a movie like this again, try to review it based on the category in which the movie would fall (not necessarily where it was destined to fall). that is, do not bombard good common sense movies!
