When I saw that this film was broadcast late on TV, I initially decided to give it a miss. I'm glad I started watching. Yes, the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppet shows. Some of the actors / actresses come from his other productions, obviously he used the same composer later, since the cheese soundtrack could only come from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend. Take from all this and you have a movie that shows intriguing possibilities. Is there a planet on the opposite side of the sun? Is it a duplicate land? Is everything upside down and in this case they speak English backwards? I love this dated SF, if only for the wonderful models of cars, planes, buildings and spaceships of Gerry. Some of them are not as far-fetched as they seemed then. And did you see the European Space Center logo? Very reminiscent of today's Euro logo. Stop believing and spend a couple of hours looking at this, you'll be glad you did.
