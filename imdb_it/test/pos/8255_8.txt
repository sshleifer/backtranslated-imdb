I recently purchased this movie on DVD at a discount store for $ 5. Although it is a no-frills DVD on the Geneon label (only the movie that starts playing immediately - no menus, no special features) the image and sound quality were EXCELLENT. The film is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan, whom I must admit I haven't heard of, is the protagonist - Pinky Green. A charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but he is not allowed to do it! Portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the role of the villain, even with the great charm for which he is famous. Bad, but with scruples like when he refuses to deny Pinky his "love at first sight" for the job. Whack, in England, apparently is the right part of the take and not a bullet in the head like in American gangster movies! The entire supporting cast does a great job producing a very credible film. <br /> <br /> What is perhaps the best, in my opinion, is that the whole movie is pretty funny and understandable (I often find myself lost in the confusion of the plot and various characters) with NO special effects. No blood. No violence. Not even a single car chase! Only a well written story, well acted, well directed and well photographed! If I had any complaints about the movie, I would question the music. What is bluegrass music doing in a bank robbery story that takes place in England?
