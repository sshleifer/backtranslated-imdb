I'm a professional musician who was inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing guitar after hearing Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. Although I don't play in the same genre or style, that man's impact was enormous. Now, almost 20 years later, I finally saw something more than the not so beautiful The Song Remains Same. Again, I saw many bands perform, some small - some of the current "masters". No band, no where, in no way EVER been able to pull out the magic that can actually be enjoyed watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant can be a little too much at times, and you can almost feel Page's annoyance for him by forgetting the lyrics, but it doesn't matter, I guess, especially for the time. The genius of Bonham shines more on this DVD and then on any album with Zeppelin, the Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is pretty ordinary, but the magic of this DVD is the way the four perform together. The world loved to imagine being in black magic (k) etc. - it was just a matter of interest for Page. The magic (the warning I say a lot), is that this DVD captures a rare look at the crudeness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are playing. It did not matter. <br /> <br /> A quick breakdown. The first of the two DVDs is where the real magic is. You should be able to sense the power and crudity that Zep had in their early days. At the end of the second DVD, Page is struggling with his sanity during Knebworth's songs. (It is no secret that at this time he was seriously dependent on heroin). So, I'd recommend the first record to ANY music fan, and the second for the only real Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> I could go too far here for some guitarists, but I would say after seeing this, Page is certainly more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yes, I said it. And if you don't agree - watch the DVD.
