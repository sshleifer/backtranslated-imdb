This documentary on the dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well done. However, I found myself looking at many of the pieces with discomfort. The film generally took a rather confident stance on everything it said and showed, but inevitably much of the behavior of the animals, their mutual interaction, appearance, the way they moved, what they ate etc. . guessing - sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence, sometimes just guessing wildly. But the viewer is never made aware of this, the film pretends to actually observe the real dinosaurs and their real behavior, etc. This probably makes the view better than comparing mountains of disclaimers, but makes it a bit too populist in my estimation.
