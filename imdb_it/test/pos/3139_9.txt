Wagon Master is a truly unique film among the works of John Ford. Especially since it is the only one based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was developed by Frank Nugent and the director's son? Patrick Ford is transformed into a screenplay, and because of the director's personal opinion about it, Wagon Master is the film that John Ford called what he "came closer to being what I wanted to achieve", to say it is not saying a little, but as Ford once confessed to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite was still My Darling Clementine and not others. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has all the ingredients you would expect to find in a John Ford movie. Wonderful cast that gives its best, you don't have any major star, except the most "Fordian" of all the actors ?? Ben Johnson. Very peculiar little characters, which provide a compulsive comic relief, and Wagon Master has several such as the horn that plays Listerard (Jane Darwell) in his shot but very inspired concerts. And last but not least, the legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth passage through Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two friends Cowboy Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) were hired to become Wagon Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers headed to Silver Valley, a place that is to them like a promised land. On their way join a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women, who are presumably his wife and daughter and who are called actors. They are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently kicked out of the nearest town and have no other places to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens until they meet Cleggs, a dangerous family band composed of a father and his three children who are fleeing from the Marshal of the city where they recently committed a murder and a bank robbery. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master is neither more nor less than a most precious pearl in a necklace of the wonderful westerns by John Ford. A must see 9/10 <br /> <br />
