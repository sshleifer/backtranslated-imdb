"Witchery" is a decent Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this and unfortunately he is one of the best actors. Linda Blair is definitely terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... is really hilarious! The plot of this film is also ridiculous. It has holes, which you can't help but notice, but it remains fun throughout. <br /> <br /> Witchery's blood is scary. I loved the part where the old bag is "sucked" into the trash chute and ends up in the fireplace to roast! And the part where the lady "took advantage" of the Devil was damn scary. I would say this is a must for the gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a disadvantaged and well-made film, look elsewhere. But if you like old-school Italian sleaze and top gore, "Witchery" is part of your shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low rating here! What were you waiting for people, "The exorcist?" 7 out of 10, children.
