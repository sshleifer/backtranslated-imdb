Annie Rooney lives with her father and brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she is constantly involved in many clashes with the other boys in the neighborhood. Annie secretly has a crush on Joe Kelly (whose younger brother Mickey is the head of the band where Annie constantly fights), who is in a band looking for trouble, says officer Rooney. Kelly sponsors a dance, where Tony plans to shoot Kelly to even get him to make him look crazy in front of his girlfriend, but Agent Kelly is instead mortally wounded. A Tim (part of Kelly's gang) is told by Tony, and by his friend Spider, that Kelly shot his father, so he pursues him by taking revenge. Annie learns about it and goes to stop her brother, if he is on time. Great mix of humor and heart in this film, even if the plot doesn't start until the film's 40 minutes. Pickford is fun (even though he was 33 years old playing a girl no more than 12-13) and he identifies himself with his character. Haines does not play Kelly as he should, but is able to make the audience feel for him on an emotional level. The scenes in which the officer tells Annie about his father's death and the ending really put a lump in your throat. The mix of all types of children during the film is fun to watch. Evaluation, 8.
