What a joy to see this family grow up and see the same children acting in this series eight years later. Anna (Lexi Randall) is a beautiful girl, she works for a doctor in the city. She is in love with her son Justin, who left the army and was wounded in the war. And the youngest daughter of Jacob and Sarah, Cassie, is a simple girl, so honestly honest that she is often embarrassing. <br /> <br /> On a cold winter day a stranger shows up at the farm. He is slow to reveal his identity. When they find out they are Jacobs' father, John Witting, they thought that long ago difficult questions about the past are hard to come by. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is magnificent as a loving mother, who wants only the best for her whole family, and is constantly fighting with the forces that tend to separate them. Sarah, talking to Jacob, said: "It's all so fragile, this life. Anything can happen in the blink of an eye." "I could have died in that blizzard." Think of Justin and John probably a lot more sick than we know. The moment passes, so it's too late. It's a pity, don't you think? "<br /> <br /> Life lessons about honesty and forgiveness make this a meaningful evening entertainment.
