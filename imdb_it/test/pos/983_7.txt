Ok, I admit that if I didn't have children, I would never have seen this movie and never seen it. But considering all the rotten children's movies I've seen (like SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), this is a significant improvement. And I had enough that I wasn't completely bored by my skull or contemplated suicide (something I did repeatedly in the other two films). Of course, the shows are quite large and the plot is rather stupid - but it's a film for children. And, compared to other films of the genre, this is definitely better than the average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines seem to have some talent and will probably continue to have careers after puberty - at least on infomercials or voice-overs. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a movie to watch with your kids, you could definitely do a lot worse!
