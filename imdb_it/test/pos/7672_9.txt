I came across this site looking for a video or DVD of the 1959 Porgy and Bess version with Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life. If anyone finds it in a movie format please let me know. I always talk to my daughters about things they think are new and that, in fact, have already been done. We went to see a live theater version a couple of years ago and all I could talk about was this movie. Unfortunately, my daughters can't remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. in any production, even though they heard about him. Needless to say, they are not familiar with the other great actors in the film. It is a great oversight not to have this classic movie (due to the cast) in a home movie format for collectors and future generations. However, in my opinion this version was the best!
