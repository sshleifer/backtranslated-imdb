This film is certainly well built, starting and ending in the dark, with a focus on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, initially the "angel" singer later the infamous spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. While it was rejected by critics in the 1970s as exaggerated, the "cinema vulgaris", and lacking in structure (among others), time showed them that they were wrong. Blake Edwards has certainly produced a film that is almost lyric in quality. <br /> <br /> The film flies and swirls (aerial photography, Julie Andrews on the move) and fascinates. One just needs to buy into the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission went wrong. Facing the lukewarm chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one must believe that these are lovers - that in all innocence they fall in love with each other. And in the end, love is much more important than the victory of wars. And so it is maintaining innocence. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of sober acting, and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful comic elements (foreshadowing the French henchmen of Victor / Victoria), interesting diplomats (remembering The Tamarind Seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of good will. <br /> <br /> Suspend all disbelief and this movie will take you away. The song by Julie Andrews who sings war songs and the disturbing 'Whistling Away the Dark' is reason enough to turn on the TV, just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number, like the number of 'Jenny' in Star! works. <br /> <br /> This film has, like a good champagne, aged well. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same applies to the transfer of the Star laser disk! on DVD. These are both interesting pieces of Julie Andrews' meticulous and then undervalued works.
