"Hit and Run" is a shocking story played by the ever marvelous Margaret Colin as a society woman who "has it all" until she hits a child in her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that he goes to ask for help and returns, but is frightened by angry passers-by who think the batter has left the scene. This was done on days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story. <br /> <br /> Colin is guilty and palpable anxiety and makes her act so strangely that a detective gets to his far right. Her lies sink deeper and deeper into a self-disdaining hole, making it worse. <br /> <br /> This is a very inspiring story, and you can't help but feel this pain of the lady, wishing in everything that would have simply come clean. <br /> <br /> As a TV movie, thanks to Colin and a strong script, this is a TV movie well above average.
