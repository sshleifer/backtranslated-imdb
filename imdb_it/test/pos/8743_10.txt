Traffik is an excellent miniseries on drug trafficking in Europe. This is the PBS series produced in Europe on which the film Oscar nominated Traffic is based. If you love Traffic then Traffik is a must see. <br /> <br /> In general I strongly recommend this miniseries to anyone interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. The script is exciting and unexpected as it passes through the lives of drug dealers, traffickers, farmers, policemen and police officers. Unlike other films that sensationalize the drug problem, Traffik presents AS IS.
