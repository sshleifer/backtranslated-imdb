So he is not a prize winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a movie that was simply silly? "The Villain" and this could be at the top of the list. My husband says that "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those films that if "you've been there and done that" you will think of this parody of cocaine of the 80s culture is a revolt. I think the whole movie is simply fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes .... There are gags going on that you have to look to appreciate. To say that the film does not follow the book would be true, but then many really good films also take liberties with the published word. I recommend this film to all the old "stoners" among us. We may be smarter now, but we will continue to recognize and laugh at many people we have known (ourselves?) In the old days.
