I guess it's the first time I see a Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle movie. I really liked his role as a butcher. The way he moves is very funny, in my opinion, for example how to handle the knife and how to draw a cigarette. I think he's a good actor; his facial expressions are perfectly suited to the role he plays, for example how he winks at the public at the end. But one could add that it was probably not too difficult. However, I think he deserved a longer career. As you probably know, he was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that he was involved in a scandal. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum are employed in a shop and rivals for Almondine's affection. After a heavy struggle for food, Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father, the shop owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school in drag, and the struggle for Almondine continues. (Some of the character names are different in the version I've seen. It seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones.) <br /> <br /> There are a lot of horny gags like food fights and pratfalls, but they are well done in my opinion. And there are some gags that I liked a lot, for example how do they run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee grinder?), Or when Fatty wears a coat, although obviously it's not necessary, or when Miss Teachem, the head of the female school, spank Fatty, and he spanks her back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also fun in this, his first film; a good addition to the cast. In the first half he is a customer at the store, in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I liked his stunts, for example when Fatty pushes him from one room to another in the school, he doesn't show a simple corpse but he lands on his hands and on his head and makes a little pirouette. Pay attention to a scene in the food fight: Alum throws him a bag of flour, but misses and hits the shop owner instead. This makes Buster laugh, which must be a rarity since he normally always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably already know - gave him the nickname "The Great Stone Face"). (Another note: Al St. John, who plays Alum, was the nephew of "Fatty" Arbuckle, and later became famous for the role of "Fuzzy" he played in many westerns). <br /> <br /> I don't like it as much as I like, for example "One week" and "The Balloonatic" (a film that Buster made later, without "Fatty"). And it didn't make me laugh out loud often - but it made me smile a lot, so I gave it eight points.
