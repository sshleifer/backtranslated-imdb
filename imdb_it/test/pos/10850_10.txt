I love this movie. I watched it over and over again when I rented it from Netflix. It had a lot of substance and meaning for me. I think a lot of people will have fun. I have read and seen many lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say that they are improving the way they are presented. They have a tendency to have a more positive lifestyle for the lifestyle and the feeling is of gay women. It's nice to see two women coming together and being as happy as others in this society. I think more and more films with this theme will enrich our theaters and TV screens. Many producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and healthy lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals and families without hesitation.
