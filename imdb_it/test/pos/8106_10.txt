Before seeing this movie I didn't really expect much from this, even though my friend advised it differently. Because of this request from my friend I decided that I was really watching this movie. The moment I sat down to watch the movie, I was absolutely stunned. From the credits I was falling from my seat; I could not contain myself. The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish barber, who returns from fighting in the war. Because of the heroic barber, he manages to save one of the Germans and in so doing he gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle that the Jews had. But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested, but only then to flee to the borders of the Jewish suburbs, "The Ghetto". Because of this escape, the German army began to look for which meant that Barber and Stolz were arrested but again fled, only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently took his poetic. ***** THE SPEECH THAT CHAPLIN MAKES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC, COMPLIANT WITH THE MORALS THAT THE COMPANY MAY ONLY DREAM. IN THE ADDRESS IT CONTRADDICATES THE MEANING OF THE FILM FOR THE SERIES AND THE SINCERENESS THAT IT HAS MADE AND DEFINES IT WORKS, BECAUSE I HAVE DONE TO WIN BY FEELING GUILTY ON HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES, LOOKING FOR THE SMALLEST THING AS TO BE IGNORING TO SOMEONE TO THE BIGGEST THINGS MORE PROMISED LIKE THE WAR.
