Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at obtaining American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The main actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the film more stature. This is still a good movie with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane who bring their style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director's contempt for the socially suave and the wealthy. He often depicted spies and foreign agents as a beautiful upper middle class people who at the same time grinned at democratic values ​​and concepts like the guilty until proven guilty. These traitors of the upper crust are the last ones that the police pursue or even suspect. Hitchcock had a permanent distrust of the police. He wanted to raise the normal boy, the bungler and the one who doesn't take himself too seriously. We see that he wants Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra mold. However, Bob Cummings puts his stamp on the boy next door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, as the female lead, is the all-American girl who can handle herself quite well when put to the test. Robert Cummings, as defense attorney Barry Kane, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a chase scene in a country reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas of the previous films: the reluctant female who is dragged into the action, e.g. Madeleine Carroll in 39 Steps, and risking their lives to escape the authorities that are right behind them. We see scenes from America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he is accused of. We see rivers, bridges, huts, truck drivers, the Hoover dam and, finally, New York City. New York is a suitable backdrop for the climax as we go from Rockefeller Center to oceanic ships (with a cut to the Normandy ship) and the grand finale on the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with an uninterrupted action. Not to be missed.
