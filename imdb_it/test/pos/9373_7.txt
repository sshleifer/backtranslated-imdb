Crossfire (1947) <br /> Great Message, Great Symbolism, Very Good Movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's hard to go totally wrong with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan all together as the three male leads, and with the director Edward Dmytryk puts together a complicated murder and a detective story. This is reason enough to watch it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You might need a second look to completely capture the plot as it is explained (too much) or shown in flashback (too much) because it's a little complicated for no good reason. But it makes sense on the whole, and soon (probably too soon) we see who is guilty, and also why. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama, well done in the typical noir lighting and full of those short jokes that make post-war dramas, there is the social message, the anti-anti-Semitic point of all this. It only borders on the sermon once or twice, and it's obviously a good point to make us look at its approval and wait for the plot and dramatic acting to take the front row. What they do, especially Young, who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective, and Ryan, who is credible, cruel and angry (Ryan is good at this, his typecasting is reasonable). Mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known acting force, Gloria Grahame, is a large, short, though slightly superfluid presence. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is dominated by the sequence of events and the message, both in effect as we go, it is really easy to look only for the lighting, the work with the camera and the acting , including the classic fight scene that opens the first seconds of the film, all done with shadows. <br /> <br /> The archetypes of the soldiers presented are very deliberate, and this could be something that people at that time were very familiar with and could refer so much to the thread of anti-Semitism. The soldier upset by the shell rendered helpless (but still intrinsically capable), the modest young man without confidence (but also capable), and the tired but outwardly capable veteran are all there. And, of course, the angry and violent soldier who is also a product of war. Even the latter is a responsibility of society - even the army does everything possible to remedy the injustices here, not only because they are criminals, but because they derive from the wear and tear of a long terrible war. <br /> <br /> The public then, more than now, could really get it, but it is there to appreciate again.
