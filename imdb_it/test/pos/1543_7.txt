The premise of the story is quite common; the average family wants to get out of the race for success; wants to find simple life ... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; children in tow. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they rented an old house ... but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are killed and nobody knows how (no matter why). Gerald McRaney is excellent, a familiar face for Lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; since this film was made in 88, perhaps the writer should produce a sequel! <br /> <br /> You will also like Barry Corbin as the eccentric of the city, and Darryl Anderson as a look-alike of Bruce Dern / a mad military man. <br /> <br /> While the plot of the story is a bit exaggerated; if you are a movie fan you will be reminded of similar scenarios by "" Psycho ""; ""Liberation""; as well as other horror stories of that kind. Several photos and sequences will give you a sense of déjà vu. <br /> <br /> Sit down and have fun; if you don't take it too seriously, it's a lot of fun; and better than, for example, the most recent film: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer ""; it looks like they made better films in the good old 80s!
