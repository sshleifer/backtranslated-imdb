This film has its detractors, and Courtney's hairdresser could offend some people (frankly, they need a nice dagger in the head), but the film is first-rate in every sense: captivating, touching, relevant. Finney, of course, is bigger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performances were terribly strong on both tracks, and the character of Courtney offers a lot of dark humor. The period is well captured, the support cast well chosen. This must be seen and savored as a good cordial. I just hope it's already out on DVD ... (* sigh *) ...
