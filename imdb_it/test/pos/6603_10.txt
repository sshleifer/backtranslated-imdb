My son, an avid skateboarder, made me sit down and show me this with him. Since I love documentaries, it didn't take much pressure on his part. The incredible story of all this - a group of dirty kids slide together and end up creating something revolutionary from nothing - well, more than a little wood, wheels and a lack of waves to surf - it just made me crazy. He still does it. I didn't think I would like it the way I did, nor did I think I would have done without looking at Stacey Peralta to rip Jay Adams's fate to pieces. And just looking at the same Jay Adams ... the pure genius of the skating kid and the shrug of the adult's memory. I looked at it again last night for what must be the tenth time and I still get goose bumps as I watch it fly down the hill with Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" in the background. And I ripped again. Not many films have the same impact with me after several views. Brilliant.
