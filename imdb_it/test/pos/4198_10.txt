This is one of those movies where it's easy to see how someone wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I picked it up last night, I waited until she went to bed. She may have been amused by a couple of small fragments, but I know she would have had enough in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in short, or as something of a post-modern journey of acid through film genres. If you're not a big fan of those things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the "aesthetic of acid travel" (assuming there's a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you're a fan of that stuff, you need to run out and buy Head now if you haven't already. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film never received much respect. This probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. After all, it is played by The Monkees - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be a children's bubble, Gummy Beatles for a series television. In their era, they had the same respect, for example, Menudo, New Kids on the Block, The Spice Girls and so on. As another IMDb reviewer rightly observes: "Perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a silly factory pop band torn apart by the Beatles, refused to see (Head)". <br /> <br /> The Monkees and Head have never been able enough to cast that negative public perception. It's a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in The Monkees. It is probably more strange that Rafelson, who directs here and co-produces with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, _that_ Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and co-produces, decided to bring The Monkees in this unusual direction. It is as if New Kids on the Block suddenly released an album equivalent to Ummagumma by Pink Floyd (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, Head's songs, written by The Monkees and frequent contributors like Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a similar quality to Floyd, somewhere between the era of Syd Barrett and the post-Barrett era. This is much more important than any similarity of the Beatles. Some people have complained about the music in the film, but for me all the songs are gems. After all, some people dislike the age of Barrett (or others) Floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with. <br /> <br /> What are you talking about? The essence of it all is that The Monkees is making a journey through various film genres: there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comic scenes, dramatic scenes, western scenes, science fiction scenes, romantic scenes, and more it's still. . Except in the reality of the film, this turns out to be mainly (if not exclusively) in a study lot. At the root, we're watching The Monkees shoot a movie. Obviously all the scenes of the various genres have something surreal and self-referential about them, and they, and single shots within a scene, tend to bring one another using the logic of dreams not unlike the TV show Monty Python. Like a dream, Head tends to waver between a good dream and a nightmare, while it is often one that will make you laugh in your sleep (something I often do, by the way). <br /> <br /> Technically, Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the above. There are scenes with large negative images, there are many very fast cuts (including a large sequence in which Davy Jones and Tony Basil dance alternately in a white and a black room, wearing a combination of black and white reversed in each, which occasionally it passes back and forth rapidly like two frames at a time), there are a lot of bizarre successes, there is an animated cow mouth, there are odd editing devices and so on. For my money, I wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I appreciate. It seemed like a good idea and I still think it's a good idea. I'd like to see films like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. Now that would make the film surreal. <br /> <br /> Interpretationally, some people who are not so sympathetic to the aesthetics of the acid journey have complained that it is basically b.s. offer meanings for something destined to have none. I disagree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic vision; Head was intended to have many meanings and not just films without conventional graphics that have multiple interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have many interesting things to say about The Monkees - the postmodernist film comments on their production status; pop celebrity - long before Pink Floyd, Head conflates pop celebrity and violence, from war images to fan images that cannibalistically dismantle their idols; and naive ideas oriented to the United States of international perceptions and respect - foreigners well armed in a desert surrender to Micky Dolenz only because he is American, then later they blow up a Coca-Cola machine (again in the desert) for him because he is thirsty and I can't log in. The film comments on many other topics - from the big industry to the police, polls, spectators (especially in relation to tragedies), and so on. The head is full of ideas, quite appropriately, with intelligent and multifaceted things to say about them. <br /> <br /> The head deserves to be considered a classic - it's basically taken for the same vibration as the yellow Beatles submarine. Both debuted in November 1968, which was quite interesting, and both were intended as a sort of summation of psychedelic aesthetics. The yellow submarine was not successful enough. The head is all that the Yellow Submarine should have been.
