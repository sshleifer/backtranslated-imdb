This was Chaplin's first photo to talk about and the results are mixed. The film is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially as regards the persecution of the Jews. It was bold and forward to the 1940s and must have horrified a lot of people. <br /> <br /> Compared to previous works by Chaplin, this is rather pale in comparison. The sweet and funny style of her silences, in my opinion, is far superior to her first talkie. There are many meaningless bits that drag on. If this were a silence, it probably wouldn't have happened. <br /> <br /> I find one of the funniest moments to be the moment of the musical barber and the dance of the globe. One of the most touching moments is, of course, the speech at the end. <br /> <br /> The Great Dictator is an effective and sometimes moving film that is a very important part of the history and history of Chaplin's cinema. It's defective, but Chaplin is in good shape.
