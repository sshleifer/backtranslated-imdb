I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said that the best films involve both the joy of making films and the anguish of making films. This film is certainly the first type. Tromeo and Giulietta is a pleasure to look at from beginning to end. The zealous zeal that feeds this Shakespearean shenanigan is infectious. I don't think I've laughed so much since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It's so beautiful!
