This film, also known as "don't look in the basement", is actually not bad. It's a little-known movie even for horror fans, but I found this movie pretty funny. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not without its problems, but think that more people should take a look at it. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanatorium is certainly interesting to me. I thought the acting, which at first seemed forced, somehow improved as the film progressed. It seems that the actors really took part in their roles. There are some good and colorful characters, including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier, one who thinks he's a judge, an adult with a child's brain and an attractive girl who craves attention so badly that he drops his clothes when someone approaches him. The title "not looking in the basement" has as much relevance to the story as "the last house on the left" has on that film. If you like movies with gruesome characters in a mental department like I do, take a look at this.
