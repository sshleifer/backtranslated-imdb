Life was great for the New York advertising artist, Ted Kramer. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, because when Ted came home late from work that night his wife, Joanna, had a full suitcase and was walking out the door. He tried to stop her, but she just entered the elevator and out of Ted's life. Well now, in addition to his work, he now remembers the house as well as their 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife's absence would in no way affect his job performance. He did however influence his performance as a father. He blew up when Billy punched his client graphics! Well, some time later Ted and Billy get a letter from Joanna, and it was obvious from her letter that she wouldn't be back. Ted was upset. Well, he was late coming home from work for Billy's birthday, which upset Billy with him. <br /> <br /> Ted was late for work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had lost a meeting with a very important client. When he got home, he shouted at Billy for hiding the ice cream during dinner. Then later he sincerely said to Billy that the break between him and Joanna may have been his fault, not Billy's; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard, that night, and well, Billy had a first look at a naked woman. When Ted took Billy to the park the next day, he fell from the jungle gym and landed face-to-face on his toy plane. Ted literally led him to the hospital where they were to administer the points. After that, life began to take a downward spiral for Ted. Then one day, unexpectedly, he received a call from none other than Joanna! They met in a corner cafe. At first they have a pleasant conversation, but then Joanna informs him that she came back to take her son and take him with her. Ted didn't want to know and ran out. Well, life got worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him out to lunch and suddenly fired him. Not only that, but Joanna was choosing to sue for Billy's custody, and without a job, Ted had no chance of winning. A lawyer, John Shaunessy, hired a penny: $ 15,000. And this is if they start. <br /> <br /> Ted was also able to find a new job. In reality it was a step backwards compared to what he used to do with a considerable pay cut, but he accepted with great determination. Finally the court date arrived, January 9, 1980. The judge presided over Atkins. Joanna took the position and Shaunessy proceeded to question her why she left Ted and his other relationships and how the failures were. The following day, Ted took the position and Joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. Even Ted's good friend, Margaret, took the floor and really didn't help things. Well, the judge took some time to think about it and sure enough, one day Shaunessy informs Ted that he lost. Joanna obtained the exclusive custody of Billy. Typical! Always in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were simply devastated about ways to separate. They greeted in tears when suddenly Joanna stopped. She and Ted talk a little and, rather than giving away the final, we assure everyone that everything will be fine for everyone! <br /> <br /> This was a great movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He received this Academy Award. I also saw him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, who also won an Oscar for. Meryl Streep was good. He also got an Oscar. Justin Henry was fine too, so where was his appointment? I imagine the Academy had a rule against granting Oscar to children, but the rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment arrived. This film has a great drama, light comedy and is very subtle. It does a good job of keeping your attention. I was looking at Rain Man on TCM the other night, then it happened later and I couldn't help looking. And that's what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or such films, then I recommend Kramer Vs. Kramer! A compelling film about the twinges of two divorced parents fighting for their child. I liked Ted's little talk about governing for mothers all the time. What was sex that makes good parents? Actually, that's how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always reign in favor of the mother because she is a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain, who died in 1984. Watch the emerging JoBeth Williams in the nudist scene in the corridor scene. Anyway, see Kramer against Kramer today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
