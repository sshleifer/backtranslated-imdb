Who said it had to be credible? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before sitting down to watch this movie. You will enjoy the experience much more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the film's most extravagant plot patterns, and simply accepting it for what it is - a great family movie. I appreciated not having to worry about "questionable items" in a children's movie for once. This, for me, is worth the ticket price. And he manages to maintain his health without being obvious: the greatest chidlren will appreciate this film. Quite a good mood to keep adults interested. Great movie.
