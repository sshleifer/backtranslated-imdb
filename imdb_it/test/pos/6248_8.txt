The Lost Oasis of Slausen. . . a place for food, fun. . . and MURDER! After a boy disappeared on his way to a service station, a group of his friends set off on a journey to find him. They come across a wax museum where they think their friend is finished. Unfortunately for friends, however, the owner of the attraction along the way has the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil. One by one, tourists are persecuted and killed by Slausen and his legion of wax mannequins. Can friends escape or fall into the same fate as their lost friend? Following in the footsteps of the great classic wax films (House of Wax, Mystery of the Wax Museum), Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre history and style. As for character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a simple slasher movie. But it goes much further, given that the director takes control of the plot and transfers it to the supernatural thriller it is. The acting ranges from acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from the backwoods-showman Mr. Slausen (played by Western legend Chuck Connors)). Writing moves well and dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into history. Also, some scenes are a bit silly, like the attack of a meow-manikin in Becky. It is nothing, however, that could detract from the effect of the film. As you would expect from a film on wax mannequins, it is full of the endless creepiness provided by the mannequins. It is strange that an (mostly) inanimate object can remain still and somehow be so disturbing. . . maybe it's the human resemblance, or the blank stare, or the fact that you know it's going to trigger an attack. . . whatever it is, the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well for the whole movie. As for the coupons, it's one of the best, and it's one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Mandatory slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: the film is full of fantastic deaths. The gore is not excessive, but it is done well and makes it realistic. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: there is a deep dive scene with attractive lead females (though it is very attractive 'barely begins to describe the fascinating future - angel Tanya Roberts) but that's all a tease because the girls stay mostly underwater. However, they remain dressed succinctly throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his mannequins. One of the best killers in the slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: From the opening scene onwards, the film maintains a great blend of creepiness of the dummies, jump scares from the attacks, and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation. . . it's all very well done to make a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Well, the mystery wasn't exactly the point of the film. . . just the meaning behind all that matters. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dance Scene: all these pretty girls and not a single dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 8/10. Watch this creepy slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
