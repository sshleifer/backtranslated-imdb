A game full of fun, full of foolish or sometimes cruel jokes. Not the best of movies, but definitely worth watching. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming selves with Granger as a particularly delightful and ingenious gentleman. Ava Gardner is as wonderful as ever, with such a delightful character that she is absolutely irascible. The plot is typical, but full of playful surprises, especially regarding the unconventional relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
