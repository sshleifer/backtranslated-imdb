This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You get to the end of the movie and you can't move ... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. Don't plan anything after this movie, you'll need time to think about what just happened. <br /> <br /> Don't come in this movie waiting for the multi-million-matrix style spent on special effects, this movie special effects come from the actors They keep you involved, no, they suck you and they don't let you go for the whole duration of the film. Great acting, great plot ... very nice movie, I can't say enough. Also very original plot, lots of twists and ideas that I never thought of. The finish is abrupt and lets you enchant by asking, was it true? Is it really the end? Good ending, not saying it's ugly ... it just leaves you amazed, and a little downcast. <br /> <br /> Great movie for those who love action, like a good storyline (don't get up for a break in the bathroom in this movie, you'll be lost again) and like mind games, because that's exactly in a nutshell that what is it.
