I'd like to vent my displeasure at NBC Canceling in Las Vegas. The show had been the Top Notch of the last 5 years. Adding Tom Sellecks was great. It really brought a nice addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Reality and night game shows. I mean, are we going to keep old and tired law and order? Not even putting Jack McCoy as a DA can keep the show interesting. Damn, do we keep a quality program like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER should be put out to pasture for. NBC has deteriorated compared to the days of Pre Seinfeld Cheers. With cable and internet, NBC cannot afford to collapse face down. PLEASE BRING BACK VEGAS! I remember when Homicide Life on the Street ended as it did. At least they had a two-hour final. Hey CBS are you listening? Please pick up Vegas, it's a great show.
