This is a great film in many different ways ... perhaps the most important is that it introduces Western audiences to the extraordinary and tragic story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her struggle for freedom and democracy. Wonderful acting, splendid cinematography, breathtaking action and suspense: "Beyond Rangoon" has it all. I've seen this movie several times over the last ten years and every time means more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating on IMDb), but it is because it is not a conventional Hollywood dumbtainment; rather, it challenges the viewer on different levels. I never looked at it without sobbing in the end and promising to live a more meaningful life.
