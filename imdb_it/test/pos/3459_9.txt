This is by far one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The best 20 of my life. I laughed more than I did from the Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy, and I cried more than I've ever seen since I saw The Notebook. If you're looking for a moving film without the cheeky edge ... that's it. It is real and powerful. Watch it and you won't regret it. At first I was reluctant and I only saw it because I had to do a school project on language disabilities. But this film is much more than that. It's about life, free and independent of the way the world would have held you back. It concerns the disabilities that each of us has that prevents us from seeing ourselves and what we lack but letting everything else interfere.
