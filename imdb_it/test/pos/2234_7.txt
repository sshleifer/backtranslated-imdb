This is a fairly intelligent and well-interpreted version of the fairy tale novel of the "modern" woman of the 1930s. In this case, he helps the man who loves to become head of the company while serving as a secretary and eventually wins his love from an intriguing social butterfly. Interestingly, his business acumen is shown as subtly parallel to his housewife prowess, and office women are depicted as the "powers behind the throne". Raised above average thanks to the smart performance of Mrs. Astor.
