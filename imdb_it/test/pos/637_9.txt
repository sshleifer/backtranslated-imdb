It is always a well-known and important directorial device to create the atmosphere of a film in the first 5 minutes. In the crucial opening scenes, the film should establish itself and make the viewers take notice and be interested in the rest of the film. Here, in "Mute Witness", we find an excellent example of this. <br /> <br /> * Scene spoiler * <br /> <br /> In the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens Hitchcock's Scene of a beautiful blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on. He is wandering around, applying lipstick, gorging himself and ignoring the news of a free serial killer. Sure, the serial killer is at his house and checks his moves, knife in hand. He hears a noise, looks into a room, and his companion is in a pool of blood. Right at the moment of his screams, he turns to face the knife-wielding maniac, who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and terrifying act .... <br /> <br /> ... then something strange happens. While the woman is agitated in death, the murderer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim die. Before finding his lighter, his cigarette is lit ... by someone else in the room! The camera turns off, and we realize that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, some shooting, some recording death, and that the lady is taking a terribly long time to die, and is doing a lot of work amateur of this too. When the public understands what is happening and the whole scene is part of a film, the scene full of suspense and horror assumes an element of humor. <br /> <br /> * End of Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. First of all, it perfectly portrays the atmosphere of the whole film. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with some very confusing and even witty moments. - Transmits a central theme (that of the difference between a "film screen death" and a "snuff film death", a problem that is elaborated later in the film), and finally introduces the viewer to the characters, as quietly as possible. <br /> <br /> The Mute Witness plot centers on Billy Hughes, an American special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film, shot in a department store in Moscow. Billy can't talk, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the end of filming for an evening, Billy finds himself inadvertently stuck in the warehouse by mistake, and in his escape attempt, he witnesses two crew members doing what appears to be a porn movie before, but turns out to be a snuff movie. Suddenly, his escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. Without a doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and utterly compelling. The saving grace of Billy and his handicap is the fact that he is unable to make a sound. (In fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it is not full of women screaming). There are some absolutely disturbing moments and some superb pieces of real suspense (the corridoor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). Timing is fluid, and the entire first semester is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film introduces new concepts. While there are still several moments of suspense, the focus is on the twists. New characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous on which side they are. While there is nothing wrong with the second half of the film itself, it is not measured enough until the first half. There are some good moments of black humor that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very difficult comedy moments (specifically coming from Billy's sister and his girlfriend, who seems to be the director of the film on which Billy is working), which almost ruins the film, only because they are misplaced and / or mystified and ruin the rhythm. - In the end, the twists keep coming at a rapid fire speed, and the climax of the film is appropriately tense like the first half. <br /> <br /> There are many things that really make the film work. The communication barriers that Billy has to face, both as a mute and an American in Moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress who plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with a challenging prescence on the screen, a brilliant performance and, finally, the direction as a whole, but above all in the first half of the film, which is really one study on suspense / thriller techniques by Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> As I have already said, however, the disappointments in the film derive from moments of terrible humor that do not really need to be added. There is already a coherent and effective series of dark humor that appears in the film without the need for the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (Sister and Director) to transform their scenes into some unusual sitcom. However, despite these shortcomings, the film is an extremely pleasant thriller and ideal for a group vision on Halloween. (Certainly better than the usual horror slasher film ...!)
