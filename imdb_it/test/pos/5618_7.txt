I think Samuel Goldwyn is trying to do two things in this movie. First of all the film is a tribute to Jascha Heifetz, considered the best violinist of the last century. Second, after bringing the Dead End guys on the screen with his movie of the same title and watching them sign with Warner Brothers, he was trying to create a second band of attractive curls. <br /> <br /> Even though the film was good, there was no demand that the guys in this movie be shot for another feature. <br /> <br /> The leader of the band is Gene Reynolds who once played the violin, but now leads a street band of scapegoats. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin his father gave to young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform the weak protests of his mother Marjorie Main. <br /> <br /> Young Reynolds happens to run into a music school run by the old music teacher himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They bring it in, but they have their financial problems with many creditors led by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This film is mostly to be seen today because it is a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha Heifetz who, as you gather, is the solution in one way or another to everyone's problems. Joel McCrea is also in this film, but he has a rather colorless side like Andrea Leeds's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In addition to Heifetz, one thing the film does is touch, albeit cautiously, on the subject of child abuse and abused spouses. Arthur Hohl is a bad man and Marjorie Main is clearly a very abused wife. <br /> <br /> The cast boys do well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a girl under the name of Jacqueline Nash who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood, a member of Nelson Eddy's nightclub . She had a beautiful soprano since childhood. <br /> <br /> But it is Heifetz who sees the show.
