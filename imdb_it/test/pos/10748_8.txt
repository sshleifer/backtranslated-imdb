I honestly don't know why so many people hate this movie, I always thought it was one of my absolute favorites. the quarrel with the tiger and his men swayed, the battle with pirates with rocking axes, the whole scene with all those who tried to avoid each other at home is pure genius ... ok so he doesn't had the final fight for the perfect ass but the manchus were pretty good. I give him an 8/10.
