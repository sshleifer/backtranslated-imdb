I'm not sure what to do with this movie. very strange, very artistic. not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling storyline or characters. more like the kind of movie you can't stop watching because of the horribly fascinating things that happen on the screen. although, the first time my wife looked at him, she couldn't do it all the way ... too scary for her. it runs a bit long, but still a useful sight for those interested in very dark films.
