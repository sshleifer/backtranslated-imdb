I've never heard of the architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two-hour documentary that takes place very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the North Philadelphia slums to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla, California, as well as to New York to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family members. Louis also has another half-sister, Alexandra Tynge, from his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, an architect colleague. Louis's passion was his art.
