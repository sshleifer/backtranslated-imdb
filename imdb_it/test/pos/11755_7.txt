This film will probably be too sentimental for many viewers, especially for the contemporary audience. However, I really enjoyed this film thanks to the simple charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some really moving scenes between the couple and the talent of these two actors that save what could have been trite lines in the lower hands. The Hong Kong cinematography of the shooting period is another highlight of this film. All in all, a romantic drama better than average, 7/10.
