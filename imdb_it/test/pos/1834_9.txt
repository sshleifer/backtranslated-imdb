There are so many positive reviews about Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt proved not only to be an exceptional actress, but also a wonderful director and screenwriter. This film has everything and is full of humanity, tenderness, sense of humor ... Don't miss it, don't wait any longer. And, as for the negative reviews, don't pay any attention. Some viewers forget that this type of film must be viewed with the heart, not just with the eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or Hai Mail it is their mistake. For me, Return to Me is a real gem, an unforgettable film.
