This movie was fun! Especially if you are between the ages of 8 and 15, Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes form a credible team of eighth grade students who return to an adult who truly deserves it. Paul Giamatti is a great adult that you really want to "get". My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: no swearing or sex to worry about. Recommend it for the 'right' crowd. AP
