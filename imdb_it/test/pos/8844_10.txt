I can't believe I never added my two cents to this movie again! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies of all time. Many film critics and fans talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" for setting trends and being "his best work". Those people haven't seen this version of "The Thing" because it's right there with "Halloween". <br /> <br /> John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that had already been made and instead of "redoing" the film, he made the book on which the first film was based! Brilliant. <br /> <br /> The casting of every man was great, the tension between them was real, he made me scream, he scared me, he made me guess, he made me laugh, he asked me questions, too until today "who goes there?" in that movie. This film had no Hollywood sweet cake or a fun kind of ending, and what a bold move it wasn't to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move. <br /> <br /> I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in southern California. The audience was unleashed at the screening! I've been bringing these memories for years, it's been so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth that this film would not be a success. But with box office receipts, it was a real disaster because of "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist" two excellent box-office-oriented family films in 1982 when this film was released. <br /> <br /> This film was what I was looking for, like a horror for adults, a horror / thriller with a script for adults and real adult actors. Not children playing adults. Not little Miss "big-breasted" screams-queen of the day running around screaming for the title MA real kids with real problems that offer some of the best monologues you've ever heard. Hell, being a feminist, I haven't even lost women in this movie! Okay for Mr. Carpenter, not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless "The Thing" was actually feminine! Something to think about!) <br /> <br /> I saw special effects of that time that I had never seen before, I saw the trick that made me stand up a few nights. This is what today's horror / thriller is missing. Today the Directors complain. Today the Studios vanish. Too much CGI and not enough conviction, too much CGI and not enough history, not enough imagination. You exit the theater and in a week - or less - you forget the film and move on to the next opening of the great film. This stays with you. This is one of the strengths of an excellent film. <br /> <br /> In many reviews I have written that now paying $ 10 for a movie is horrendous. For films like this, you pay and you don't feel downplayed. This movie is NOT for everyone. <br /> <br /> I find it horrible that they make this film a "cult" movie. I find that the public is wider than many people would lead you to believe and although it is not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how a damn good movie on the wrong date can make a good movie look damn good. After the John Carpenter film, many people have copied many techniques, tricks, special effects and textures from this version of "The Thing". <br /> <br /> I am now excited to record and claim that this film is one of the best films of all time, undervalued. Please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please listen to it digitally. You will talk about it for years.
