So keira knightly is in it ... So we automatically compare this film with the attitude. Apart from the fact that this film is also in time of war and its appearance is unknown, these films are completely different. <br /> <br /> Actors work well, I think one good thing is that there is no memorable person, they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie where things happen, then you recommend another one because the story of this film is about human interaction and their structures are damaged by their experiences and how their lives they are intertwined. > <br /> This film has real interaction, perfect moments of pause that make you hold your breath. No, it's not exciting, but it's compelling if you can put yourself in these characters. At times I wondered if this film could have been better as a play than a movie. We expect a lot from movies because everything is possible, yet with theater we allow interaction and rely on belief. <br /> <br /> There are things wrong if you look for a blockbuster, if you do not look for anything and allow the film to take you inside, move, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not judge them as actors but make them become people you will feel really excited. <br /> <br /> CONTINUE! ! Give it a go!
