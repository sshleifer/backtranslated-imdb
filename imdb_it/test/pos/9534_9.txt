What is fun watching casual movies at random times is that you never know what to expect or where the next big movie will emerge. Recently, my vision took the form of stapled classics like "Raging Bull" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but this time my VCR took me away from modern conveniences and struck me right in front of "The Railway" by Lionel Jeffries. Kids ". This is a cleverly directed film about three young children, a mysterious event with their father, the transfer to the open fields of England, and eventually the inherited prizes simply by greeting the trains. simple does not seem very hopeful since it has been lost to VHS rarity for a while, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is much more than a simple children's film "Railway Children" is It was created at a time when purity was more than saying "no", when the family meant everything, and where the adventure was ready for you in every corner of the railway. This is more than an adorable film, it has incredible techniques. cinemas used, keeps the normal spectator glued to the screen with unanswered questions and offers three perfect companions to follow during this 110-minute journey. "Railway Children" is a lost treasure that must be seen by families and movie lovers alike. <br /> <br /> Are there different moments that stand proudly in "Railway Children" that transform this from mediocrity to excellence ?? one happens to be our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample obscurity, laughter and insights into the world around them, but Jeffries' children prove the opposite. From the intelligently spoken lines (both from the acting and from the script), to the sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, until the final meeting in that train stop; these children are more than mere stars that advance a story, they are guiding us with emotion, persuasion and invisibility to today's children. There's more imagination in this little VHS than I've seen in movies for years. A favorite scene that could have been handled in general, which I saw in other films, was Bobby's birthday scene. The way Jeffries makes it float between guests and gifts has been exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited for every scene, as well as for our mind. Another scene that caught my attention was when the children were working on presents for Perks, when he asked a man for a gift, Jeffries simply said "No, I won't. I don't like Perks." Is the children's reaction hilarious ?? providing moments for children and adults to enjoy everything. Shot in the 1970s, this tiny feature offers authentic laughter compared to most modern comedies. It is a creative film coupled with a great choreography and direction. <br /> <br /> I mean, as much as I loved this movie, it wasn't perfect. Jeffries does a great job of keeping us in doubt about what happened to his father, but it seemed that the event had happened, the children were kept in the dark and suddenly it ended in the end. More details for the father, not much more, would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction. Furthermore, there is a scene in this film, one of those great big-screen shots of the English countryside that is simply breathtaking, but when you look a little closer you happen to see the cars in the background. It made me laugh, but it didn't distract me too much from the big picture. Today the cinema is so badly missed, and strangely it seems that only the English have the courage to produce it. Movies like "Love, Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and excitement of community cities, places where everyone knows everyone and isn't afraid to be close. This is more of a theme that the American public could have more than ?? more understanding of what is going on outside, instead of staying with your events. <br /> <br /> Overall, I loved the "Children of the Railways". I didn't know what to expect when I first put it in the VHS player, but from the opening scene, to the explosion of the train, to Perks's birthday, Jeffries showed he could handle the story more easily for children with ease. His ability to make actors feel like real characters, to involve adults less and to involve children as adults was exceptional. This is a film to be considered as a strong alternative to any Disney version. The themes of friendship, kindness towards strangers and forgiveness that follow one another continue to tear the television with grace and power. "Railway Children" is more than just a film for children; it is a feature that should be a cornerstone for the vision of the modern public. Not only does it give a great view to the English countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be bigger with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting any CGI baddies. <br /> <br /> Degree: **** Â½ on *****
