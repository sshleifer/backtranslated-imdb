Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that this double DVD was coming out, I was understandably enthusiastic. I just go here and say that if you're a Zeppelin fan, you have to run out and buy it now! It's absolutely spectacular! "The Song Remains The Same" blows completely out of the water. Because this material has never been published before is beyond me. The movie presented here really shows Zep at the height of their game, which I never really felt was "Song". Jimmy Page is the best ever, without a doubt, and these performances make Jimi Hendrix look like a brat! Looking for the jam session 'White Summer' ... whew! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 out of 10
