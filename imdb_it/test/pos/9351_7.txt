** SPOILERS ** Based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a homosexual murdered by a GI on leave due to his sexual orientation. The film "Crossfire" is about a violently anti-Semitic GI who, due to his own failures and frustrations in life, takes him out on those of Jewish persuasion. Who obviously feels threatened by. <br /> <br /> Floating in a local barman in the DC ear, the sober US soldier Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, locates Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and starts to get a little exaggerated, yet sarcastically, friendly with he. It looks like Montgomery is a little ticked off by Samuels because he's talking to his best friend and GI friend Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel is also going through, which the Neanderthal Montgomery cannot do, for the young and sensitive GI who is in the arts, is an artist and a painter outside, about war, the second world war that has just ended. Just as the shaky peace, if it is what it is with the dawn of the atomic bomb, it is now following it in this very dangerous and unstable world. What really offends Montgomery more than anything else on Samuels is that he is obviously Jewish. That more than anything else is a sufficient reason for the racist Montgomery to want to do Samuels. <br /> <br /> Samules Inviting Mitchell will join him and his friend Miss Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, in his apartment for a few drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation they started at the bar. This has apparently been very jealous and feeling hurt and has rejected Montgomery along with his also drunk but rather clueless, in what Montgomery's plans for Samuels are, friend and partner GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, later that evening were not invited to Samuels' post. <br /> <br /> With the party over, with Mitchell and Miss Lewis absent, the two very drunk GIs rush without too many ceremonies. The fact that Samuels, in the sick and antisemitic mind of Montgomery, stole Mitchell away from him, made him a white frenzy. Montgomery and Bowers burst into Samuel's house by ransacking his well-stacked liquor cabinet with Montgomery by taking a couple of sips, against Samuels's strong objections, Samuels' very expansive and refined spirits and spirits that is very different from the drunk and poor that rough Montgomery is used to guzzling. All this soon leads to a violent and brutal assault on Samuels by the irritated psychotic and drunk Montgomery, with Bowers cold on the couch by all the liquors he has consumed, which beats the poor and innocent man to death. <br /> <br /> The film "Crossfire" then enters a long and boring, since it is obvious from the outset who is the murderer of Samuels, investigating why Samuels a wounded WWII veteran and decorated, who got the purple heart in the battle of Okinawa, was assassinated with Montgomery acting as if he was really interested, yes sure, in finding Samuels' killer, who is actually himself. This so-called voluntary action by Montgomery to throw suspicion on himself that he could be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even, for someone who considers himself pleased to be very intelligent, stupid in him that constantly opens his great yap and spits out antisemitic and racist epitaphs and insults on the murdered Samuels! This only casts suspicion on himself and no one else. I guess that guy couldn't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that Montgomery murdered Samuels who was one of "them" in his sick mind, even killing his friend, scared to death, of being implicated in the murder of Samuels, Bowers! Who in the racist way of thinking of Montgomery is one of "us"! Just because he was afraid that Bowers would talk to the police to save his sad neck and so have the spotlight on Montgomey when Samuels died. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take that long for the Capt case detective. Finlay, Robert Young, to see through the lies and deceptions of Montgomerys and then have him set up with another "friend" of the GIs his Leroy (William Phipps), who was the target of all his stupid and racist hilly jokes, put standing the arrogant insinuation. This made Montgomery return to the scene of his crime, where he murdered Bowers, where a trap was created for him. It was all Capt. Finlay needed to panic Montgomery, when Montgomery saw that the jig was ready and ran straight into the crossfire of a police ambush. <br /> <br /> Dated a little now but very tough in 1947 when it was released. "Crossfire" faced the horrors of anti-Semitism when at that time it was kept under the covers and out of sight, in almost every post-World War II Hollywood movie about the evils of racism in the United States and Europe. Even after the Second World War and with what happened to the Jews. When it should have been given to the very full and honest exhibitor, to the film in public, which he deserved so rightly.
