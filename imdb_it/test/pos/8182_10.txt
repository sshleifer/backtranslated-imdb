The film invites you to compare Shakespeare. Mandarin is well written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. Gong Li never looked better, he never had the glory that China was better represented on the screen. The balance between political turbulence and personal intrigue that the Gladiator has mentioned, but never really delivered, is here in spades. Simply incredible.
