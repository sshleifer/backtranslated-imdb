I'm new to the game, but I would have started VERY first if this movie had been around! I took it in Gen Con last year (a trip made only as a favor to my husband) and I loved it! Even to a non-player like I was at the moment, it's fun and accessible - so much so that in the end I gave up and started sitting in my husband's play group. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away all the details of the plot, but if you are a player, you need to see this movie - and if you are not, you will have a great time despite yourself. There are certainly "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: I wish it were longer and I wish it was available on DVD. Soon, maybe? ...
