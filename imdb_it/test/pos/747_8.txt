Yet another in the long series of "Do not" films from the late 70s and early 80s, but this is much more than that. This film is a low-budget schlocker very undervalued, with a twist. It has the grainy quality and the bizarre soundtrack typical of the horror films of the period, but it is the highly undervalued performances of the surprisingly talented actors / actresses who make this film good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive asylum immediately after being killed by one of her patients and not all that appears to be. It seems that Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious female doctor, took over his duties and started putting his ideas into practice. Each of the patients takes on their own unique personalities and has their own personality traits and flaws that make interactions highly enjoyable. There is the nymphomaniac, the old crazy old woman, the woman with an unhealthy obsession with children, and a man who has returned to his childhood among others. There is also a strange turning point in this bizarre story which later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with patients running free and bodies accumulating. If you are a fan of the cheap 70's sleaze this is the movie for you!
