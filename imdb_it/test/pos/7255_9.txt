When I went to the video rental store, in the days when the DVD was still next to me unknown, I had seen all the movies in the store I was interested in. Or so I thought! The man behind the counter told me he had something for me that I would have definitely wanted. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". At first I doubted it was a good thing, but I trusted his advice and ... man, I'm sure I made this gem! This is one of the best adventure films of the years, if you ask me! Of course, with Robert Carlyle as an important part, how bad can a film be? Surely, Liv Tyler is once again doing what she is good at and nothing more: being pretty. However, it is clear that the cast seems to have been a lot of fun, making this movie.
