Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matte how many times you look at the same thing, the show never becomes monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't even need to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, facial expressions and his own face are so fun to watch. The situations he faces on the show are simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even bigger. There is simply no reason why this show should not receive a 10 because it is fabulous. It is something that could also make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my favorite episodes of all time on the show are: 1) When Mr. Bean is staying in a hotel 2) The one where he watches the scary movie 3) Mind the baby (The diaper scene in particular). In fact, all the episodes are so beautiful that it's really hard to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go to any height to show that it's fun, completely including himself in one of the episodes. the way he handled that situation was simply amazing. 10 out of 10.
