The inspiration for this film was the fact that American gangsters are dressed well, but Australians, well when you can kill a guy as soon as you look at the blighter, then you can dress as much as you want and people won't criticize you. <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes a bouncer and is offered the job by Pando, the local gangster's boss in the cross (Ie, the notorious Kings Cross District in Australia, not Cross's fame of London as many British travelers find the hardest way. <br /> <br /> Because of feelings of love, he fills a job, loses a lot of money and has to take it to Pando before Pando and his enemies can kill him. <br /> <br /> A lot of black humor, interesting action, revelations about the lower part of Australia and human nature, it is very centered in Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (compared to American ones) and British). <br /> <br /> One problem is that each of the elements of the story does not have enough substance and depth, but it is a painting in broad lines that covers a lot of areas not previously covered, therefore as an overall package it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Co Work with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" for your Aussie Crime fest or "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Miller's Crossing" for an International that is about to miss the criminal gang party. <br /> <br /> By the way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just made a large number of really bad movies. Here is one of his great films.
