I saw it today with little background on what to expect from the plot. I go to the cinema as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". I found this a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was as wonderful as ever, Richard Gere is not an over-actor. He kept his and has a certain presence that is always expected. Bring his style to the film. I think it was the kind of love story that isn't always told. It was messy and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and they wanted to wait for each other. I would definitely recommend it!
