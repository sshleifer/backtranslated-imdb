This is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch, with an exceptional cast and a beautiful story, based on real events. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the story of the film is based on real events. It is above all for the most part an adventurous story, with all the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous film set in an Arab world. So, many sword fights, ancient honor, religion and a rich and proud country. But the film is also full of humor, to make the film light and pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> The constant cutting back and forth between the plot of Morocco involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot in my opinion, Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best approach possible. The two things have completely different rhythms, totally different characters, they are completely different worlds! Of course both narrative lines are connected and focuses on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is too big to make it work. It does not always make the film connected and a bit disjointed. The American plot is more often than not political, while the plot of Morocco is purely adventurous and full of action. In the end, perhaps, you might even ask yourself what was the point or Roosevelt in this film. It seems that John Milius is just a great admirer of him. Often the American plot would have taken most of the plot rhythm much more interesting and full of action than Morocco. After all, John Milius has always been at his best as an action director. <br /> <br /> Only half way does the film fill up completely. The larger and larger scale action of the film then comes into play. Above all, the end-of-scale battle does not disappoint. I wish the whole movie were like that. In this way, this film would have been even better known, no doubt. <br /> <br /> The film has a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, which is perhaps much better known than the film itself. The film is also good-looking, with excellent production design and beautiful action and battle scenes. The film costs only $ 4,000,000 but it's really hard to believe, considering the film's settings and size. I mean John Milius his best-known film "Conan the Barbarian" cost about $ 20,000,000 but was much more attractive and looked less impressive on his scale. <br /> <br /> It's pretty fun to see an Arab speak with a big Scottish accent but, hey, it's Sean Connery, so you simply tend to accept it. He fits his role well. This is what Candice Bergen does. It is always difficult for a female character to be credible and work in a film like this, but she manages it. Even John Huston plays a great role in this movie! <br /> <br /> A perfect and watchable movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10
