In many ways, the perfect movie. The "Incredible Journey" and the story of Horatio Alger come together to give a positive turn to the usually depressing subject of existentialism. In essence, the travails of the muppets are reduced to the final song of the film: "Life is like a movie, write your ending, continue to believe, keep pretending". They create their own reality, which has all the characteristics of every epic tale: a high goal at the end of what is necessarily a journey full of obstacles; an ever larger group of like-minded people for camaraderie; a bad series of villagers who are not beyond redemption; and a big budget Hollywood end because, damn everything, they CAN. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could make it. Walk the boundary between sentimentality and philosophy without skidding too long or too hard. Of course, it seems strange to invest such a weight in a film with puppet protagonists, but in the end maybe I'm the perfect puppet, to make these points. The atmosphere of the film allows the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream, the "happy" ending, unnecessary cameos, and burst into a song at the drop of a hat. Usually these aspects are anathema for the quality of the film, but the self-deprecating way in which the plot is provided makes the vision without guilt. One of the few films that can be called "suitable for all ages". <br /> <br /> The other films related to muppet (including "The Empire Strikes Back"), while being palatable, do not touch the simple grace of this film. Take for example the musical number "I hope something goes well", the duet by Kermit and Rowlf. Funny in its vaudevillian foolishness, it is nevertheless a crucial point for the motivations behind life choices. Brilliant.
