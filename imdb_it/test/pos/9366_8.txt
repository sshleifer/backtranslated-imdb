"Crossfire" by Edward Dmytryk is a rare film from the Hollywood of the 1940s. This was a revolutionary territory for Mr. Dmytryk and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with the novel, in which the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, please stop reading. <br /> <br /> The Richard Brooks novel was about the killing of a gay soldier. In the film, the subject was turned into prejudice against the Jews, a theme that was taboo during that period in American cinema. It is thanks to the merit of Mr. Dmytryk that he had the courage to be involved in this film project. <br /> <br /> The film is an exceptional piece of filmmaking, as the director presents it. Obviously influenced by the film's noir style, we are taken to Washington after the war. The opening scene on the brutal murder of Samuels shows such unusual cruelty inflicted on an honest man, whom we do not yet know, or because he was killed, but who did not deserve to die so horribly. > <br /> The basis of the murder is prejudice, pure and simple. We realize how in the mind of an ignorant man, the mere fact of being successful and being different is played in the mind of the murderer. Samuels stands as the sacrificial lamb, in the same way that the gay soldier is the victim of the novel. The parallels are well designed. <br /> <br /> This film makes the vision compelling because of Robert Ryan's brilliant star turn, like Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never as well as in "Crossfire". Furthermore, there is a great appearance of Gloria Grahame, like Ginny, the prostitute with the heart in the right place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast plays like an ensemble. Robert Young, like the police detective in charge of the investigation, is an honest man who has known first-hand prejudice in his family and speaks aloud against it. Robert Mitchum plays a cool sergeant. Keeley who is deeply moved by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it. Sam Levene is excellent in his small role as Samuels. <br /> <br /> This is a film to watch because it is probably the first to speak loudly against ignorance.
