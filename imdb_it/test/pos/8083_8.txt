"The Vicious Circle" is a story of very unknown English mystery. Like many Hitchcock films, he talks about a man accused of a crime he did not commit and does everything he can to prove it. This time it's a Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a German actress murdered by his plan. As an honest man, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, which turns out to be a big mistake ... <br /> <br /> There's really nothing special about this little movie. However, watching the movie is a fun way to pass the time. I enjoyed following the development of the plot. Refined actors are an advantage.
