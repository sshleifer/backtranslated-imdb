there's only so much I can take Filipino movies, especially nowadays where fashion is sex, action and slapstick comedy (which I hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gasp during the film was a great advantage. He has some beautiful cinematic scenes and the editing was great, especially the cinematography. I think Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than having one in the movie Milan. the fact that there are only a few Filipino films that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did a great job in this movie. I really loved this movie, technically and the development of the wise character; the plot was complex and that's what made it great.
