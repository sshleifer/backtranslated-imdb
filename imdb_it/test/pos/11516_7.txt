"Lights of New York" originally started as a brief experimental shot with two Vitaphone vinyls that eventually started in the first all talkie feature film. Helene Costelle was presumably one of Hollywood's most beautiful actresses and sister to (in my opinion the real beauty) Dolores Costello, who seemed to have all the breaks. Poor Helene is best known for appearing in this rather sad movie that bought a revolution in Hollywood !! <br /> <br /> Two bootleggers on the run in "Main Street" convince a couple of barbers from the small town to try their luck at Broadway. The barbers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not realize that their barber will soon be a cover for illegal smuggling activities. They soon understand him and regret the day they left their small town. The only thing that keeps them going is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and they desperately want to repay. Eddie learns about Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello), a girl from her city who adapted to Broadway. Kitty is worried about "Hawk" Miller (Wheeler Oakman) who is always lurking around her but Eddie, innocently, thinks that exaggerating as "Hawk" already has a girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell) but to reassure her he gives her a small pistol for scare unwanted admirers. "Hawk", who killed a police officer and shut down the "feds", decides to frame Eddie. Meanwhile Molly is getting tired of her "Hawks" treatment and after a showdown in which he tells her he is looking for a chicken and not an old hen for which the stage is ready - Murder !!! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is not completely horrible, apart from the gangsters and showgirls who speak in their best voices of elocution and that still happened in the movies in 1930. Gladys Brockwell (if a bit melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (all natural) went well and were the most experienced cast actors. There was no John or Ethel Barrymore to see - Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the darkness from which they had come. Also, I didn't notice much about the "hidden microphone", where people had to be grouped around different objects, such as a phone or sitting on a couch, before they could talk. The people who saw it at the cinema probably started to think that all the cops spoke in that monotonous dish while that trend continued in many early talkies, namely "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case, they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a talkie after all - with a bit of singing and dancing - in 1928. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
