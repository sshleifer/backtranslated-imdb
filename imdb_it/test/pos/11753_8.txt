Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this film, but not in the way we think we sizzle today - it's very thin and superficial - but palpable. Jennifer Jones, in particular, is SO SO HEAT SEXUALLY in this film (much more than a caricature like Monroe EVER) because it creates a real woman - with ALL aspects of femininity: she is intelligent, intuitive, graceful. You wish AND it is desirable. <br /> <br /> There is a scene on that famous hill, where it is lying on the grass, looking at Holden, and the expression in his eyes is X-rated, but in the context of the scene and the character, in complete sense. It is not necessary to have said it all in the dialogue - stated as the stark obviousness in most modern films. It's all there in his eyes - sexy but elegant. What a wonderful and underrated actress she was. (I saw her for the first time MADAME BOVARY and she was equally upset.) I take her to Bergman, Davis or the two Hepburns every day.
