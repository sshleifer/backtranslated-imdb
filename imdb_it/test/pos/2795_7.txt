** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It is really a pity that such a well produced film turns out to be <br /> <br /> so disappointed. I thought it was full of (silly) clichés and <br /> <br /> which basically tried to be tough. <br /> <br /> To the (American) kids out there: how many of you spend your time <br /> <br /> jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds <br /> <br /> ? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphomaniacs during the night - but not with your husband <br /> <br />? For the French: would you really like to ask someone <br /> <br /> to be "à la fac" when you know they don't speak French? <br /> <br /> Would you not use a more common word as a "université"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a while and in a sense I know and understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I like it), but my roommate (German) and I have found this rather insulting in general. It looked like a film funded by the European Parliament, and tried too hard in practice. It had all <br /> <br /> different differences that it tried to tie together (not a bad thing in <br /> <br />) but the result is at best inconvenient, but actually ridiculous - too much <br /> <br /> many clashes that would never have happened. Then the end of the movie <br /> <br /> - the last 10 minutes - ruined everything else. Why is Xavier <br /> <br /> not talking to the Erasmus students he meets in Paris? Why has <br /> <br /> just moved away? Why does he run away from his job, is that <br/> <br /> "freedom"? And in the end, should the new Europe rest on <br /> <br /> a group of people who smoke and throw themselves all day? Is this what it is made of <br /> <br />? <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the acting was pretty horrible. I can't believe Judith <br /> <br /> the role and acting of Godrèche. Why was it made to look so much like Emanuelle Béart? At first I thought Xavier was OK but <br /> <br /> retrospectively I think it was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> And this is really too ugly, because technically (opening titles, <br /> <br /> scenes when asking which cards you need) was indeed <br /> <br /> good ( except for the audio editing of the British brothers) and also the soundtrack of <br /> <br /> was fantastic. So the form was good, but the content <br /> <br /> rather horrible.
