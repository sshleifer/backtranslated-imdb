Father Hood is a funny story about a reluctant father who is definitely a HOOD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles who is always a hood in search of the only great "soundtrack" that will put him on the easy road. His wife died while he was in prison and his two children were entrusted to foster care. When "he went out" he thought that they were probably better off in foster care? besides he still had to mark his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles (wonderfully played by Sabrina Lloyd) breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing children and misappropriation of money that is supposed to be spent on children. She chases her father; tells him how bad the place was and that his brother, Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "only a 7-year-old boy" had been transferred to the institution from which he had just left and persuaded his father to kidnap him. The three begin on an adventure across the country, while Jack keeps telling himself he has to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good at this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a little euphemistic for this criminal character) that is similar to the character of Dirty Dancing by Johnny Castle, except that Jack is more sympathetic in this play and more optimistic of Johnny Castle. Swayze is fun and the rally does comedy quite well! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, a reporter who tries to understand the truth of the foster care system that becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita the con-artist mother of Jack Charles.
