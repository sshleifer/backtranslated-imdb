I saw this film for the first time in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and I remember it since, although I have never seen it since that first time. <br /> <br /> How easily good people's lives can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still is a memory that will haunt me forever. <br /> <br /> The film is fun and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by Anthony Quinn is superb. <br /> <br /> This film should be in all university studies on man's inhumanity to man.
