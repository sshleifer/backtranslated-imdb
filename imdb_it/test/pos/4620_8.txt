All those who identify this as a simple "Elephant" rip-off - there are no other comments that can be made against the film on its own merits as a single film (regardless of the apparent similarities to other films). > <br /> All those who question the validity of the film - in terms of stereotyped characters (mandatory gay, jock, disabled boy, etc.) - I'm not sure how long it has been since you were at school - but regardless of how amateur acting can be - the events that happen are surprisingly close to what could actually happen. <br /> <br /> And all those who neglect the film are so simple: only six teenagers with the normal adolescent anxiety that pushes one to the limit ... someone has stopped to think and has noticed that the girl who has them taken away life was not really one of those six !! As noted in a commentary, it had a screen duration of approximately 2 minutes maximum (excluding the final scenes). I think the purpose of the film is not just to make a matter of adolescent anxiety, and how far someone might want - but also that it is apparently not obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act (suicide) ...
