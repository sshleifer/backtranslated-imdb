This light-heated love story (for Cassavetes) is pleasantly transmitted by two wonderful interpretations by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands has never been more beautiful as a repressed and damaged woman of the mid-1930s who meets her Seymour game. Cassell is a cloud of energy and romantic notions (on his terms). <br /> <br /> There is a great supporting performance by Val Avery as Zelmo Swift and an unusual (as always) Timothy Carey that is worth the admission price. Made between Husbands and A Woman Under the Influence, this is the most accessible film by Cass that should touch anyone's heart (especially Cassavetes' enemies) who claim that his films are too long and heavily heavy at times. Made my Top ten of that year and not seen by enough people. 8 out of 10.
