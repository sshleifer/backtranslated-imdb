Maybe this movie had to be nothing but fun. Maybe it was meant to excite teenagers to all nude scenes. But what I got out of it was something that many people believe. And that is, "The good guys end up last." <br /> <br /> There is a sentence in Angel Heart from the character of Lisa Bonet that says "It takes a bad ass to make the girls beat faster." True. More likely. Women always say they want flowers and candy and courtesy and everything else. But (at least at an early age) they end up choosing the beautiful, slimy, disrespectful and wild type. What they know they can't conform to their beliefs. And that's part of the attraction. After all, what's exciting for a guy who's already in the way you'd like him to be? I think it may have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this film that is camouflaged by sex and nudity and parties and everything that teenagers can relate to, is that you'll break your heart. It happens to everyone and it will happen to you. And this is a strong final statement in the film. But having said all this, the film is fun. It's fun and shows the antics of high schools pretty well. <br /> <br /> This is a rare film that is elegant enough to satisfy the crowd of teenagers it addresses, but also intelligent and moving enough to show what; I like to break your heart. No high school film has ever done better. As I said, I think that writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand. Maybe we all have it. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you happen to see it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night, take it, you might be surprised. It is much better than it has ever been kissed.
