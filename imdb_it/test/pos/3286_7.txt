Wesley Eure is the young inventor Brian Foster, who invented a new crime safety device that comes in the form of a robot dog, the title "C.H.O.M.P.S." (It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., which was modeled on Brian's royal dog, Rascal, can do anything; it has greater speed, strength, X-ray vision and the like. It's just the right thing to save his boss's security company Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain). Of course, a slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the advantage so he tries to get his hands on the secret. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that is too hard to resist. He has a lot of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots), an optimistic attitude, an engaging cast and enough laughter to entertain him. The energetic disco music becomes repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is simple and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In a completely strange but cracking touch, there is another dog in the film (named "Monster") whose thoughts we can actually hear; both his dialogue and the executor who make the voice are priceless. In fact, he even uses a bit of blasphemy and his last words end the film with a decidedly positive final note. <br /> <br /> Eure and the pretty Valerie Bertinelli are very nice young drivers, and their veteran support cast the material with all the taste they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey are also co-stars. <br /> <br /> A rare live-action theatrical adventure for the Hanna & Barbera team ('The Flintstones', which creates cartoons, 'Scooby-Doo', 'The Smurfs' and so on), "CHOMPS "it's pleasantly stupid stuff. I know he left me with a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
