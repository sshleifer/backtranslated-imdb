Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the southern Californian desert using his fake patent documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other. Follows two groups of prisoners (one <br /> pre-sentenced the other after the conviction) across the picture. After <br /> <br /> have been tried by a military court, they have the option of either <br /> <br /> serving a prison sentence or can participate in Punishment <br /> <br /> Park ( a grueling three-day hike through the desert with nothing but the <br /> clothes behind them while being hunted by local law enforcement <br /> <br /> who use the park as a live action training <br /> <br /> terrain). I can't say enough about this movie. Sometimes it looks like you're watching a real documentary. This is one of the accessible films by Peter Watkins plus <br /> <br />. I advise you to look for it. You will not regret! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
