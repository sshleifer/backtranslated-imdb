The film is apparently born of an idea that the writers had when he "saw" one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey enter "our" world to persuade writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If it seems a little too serious, don't be put off. Within the first few minutes we get: Bernice (the vile female vicar) who drops an unfortunate penitent during confession; Chinnery (the veterinarian who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) that attempts to collect sperm from a giraffe; Mickey (often beyond imagination) being, ah, big; and Tubbs (sister consort and local merchant) are sweet as ever - but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> Some of the normal characters are missing, but a new idea from Gents introduces some characters from the 16th century - and we also have the same people in the action. If you are new to The League of Gentlemen, this is an easy and very funny introduction. If you are a longtime fan, this is all you expect - including the joys of Jeremy Dyson. <br /> <br /> All in all, it has the same vaguely surreal humor that is the distinctive trait of the series, as well as some rather touching moments of "introspection". Herr Lipp, for example, maintains a gentle dignity in learning that he is considered by his creators a "character by a joke". While most characters remain as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen. <br /> <br /> This film is a "swan song" for Royston Vasey, but it is also a showcase for the men who prove it (they pant!). They can write other things - and it can be very funny. (But you knew it anyway).
