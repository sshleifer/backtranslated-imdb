As a local performer, I thought "Grease" emphasized what Broadway producers are looking for and highlighted some of the acting population. Even if my favorites didn't win (but they came second), I enjoyed comparing myself with them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer. <br /> <br /> They brought Olivia Newton-John because she is the obvious link between Broadway production and television audiences. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the movie ("Hopelessly Devoted", et al) because these songs will be included in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the B'Way cast looks a lot older, but you have to keep in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked with their tails to be there. If the whole cast was green and fresh, I think it would have compromised the casting process with which the producers choose their talent.
