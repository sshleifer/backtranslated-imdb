I liked this movie for the most part, but I have to say that if there had been someone else besides Bill Murray in the lead role, it wouldn't have been as good. It brings an energy to the role that moves this film one step closer to what it would have been otherwise. I especially liked the jokes pulled on a counselor and there are other fun things in this movie too like the hot dog eating contest. This film would also set the stage for summer camp films with the competition to end. Almost all the films on the field have a plot of this or unruly or troubled children, or a combination of both. Also this series would take a strange change of tone as this one and two are both family films while the third and fourth are more adult oriented, more like the old teenage sexual comedies of the time. He did the opposite of the Police Academy films that went from R to PG-13 to PG movies. This series goes from the reverse to R. However this first and only good thing is worth a few laughs largely due to Bill Murray.
