I found this little gem as an extra feature on my Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray DVD, and I didn't expect much from it. It looked like it could be an interesting short film, so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did. It was really amazing! Although it was created over 70 years ago, the animation was, in my opinion, better than some of those made today with all the effects and computer experience available now. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly simple as soon as we put together a toy dog ​​hears the complaints of its owner for not being able to afford an orange and goes in search to find it. In the process, he comes across a toy underworld with all sorts of nefarious creatures and toys supervised by none other than the devil himself, who everyone wants the dog's orange for themselves too. <br /> <br /> This movie precedes, but does it remind me of a lot of Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass) - a film that I have always greatly appreciated - and to a lesser extent, some of Tim Burton's animated works - The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). I'm sure even fans of one of these movies will love The Mascot. <br /> <br /> In general, an incredible short animation piece that is worth seeing.
