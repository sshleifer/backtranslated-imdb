Meatballs have been a staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it came out and I've seen it dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at his best and is the most moving in the scenes in which he joins a lonely pre-adolescent boyfriend and makes friends with him, while leading his CITs to schemes that were once malicious after another! The cast of characters is fun and crazy and you really care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another party of squalid, stupid, adolescent sex. It's fun and sweet and just fun. Anyone who sees it will have fun. It is a must see. Watch out for Spaz: he is by far the best character! (Especially during camp social - while Bill Murray sums it up for the camera - watch Spaz behind him dance with the poor girl he starts dancing with!) By far, one of my favorite comedies of all time!
