Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films I grew up with, but it has never been possible to obtain a copy so far. I just watched this movie on DVD and thought it was a delightful and fascinating film, with wonderful animation, a good storyline and fantastic songs. If this film was made by Disney, then the film would be considered a classic, but because it was made by a little-known film studio that has long since disappeared, the film slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The film was made by the Max Fleischer studios at their studios in Miami, FL and was released through Paramount Pictures. The film would have had its preview on December 7, 1941, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Although this probably damaged the release of the film, the film was reproduced in some cinemas for up to a year, as shown by some research. The film has been called a favorite by most major American newspapers. The film continued to be republished approximately every year, usually during the holidays like Easter, at least in the big cities. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, this film was re-released with a new name "Hoppity Goes to Town," named after the protagonist of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is a true vintage piece, capturing a slice of Americana as it was in the late 30s and 40s. The animation is fantastic and many characters are very nice. The animation of the humans in the film takes place through the rotoscope process, which means that the actors were filmed and that the movie was drawn by the animators, giving the movement a very real look. <br /> <br /> Fleishcher's studios were one of several animation studios that animated cartoons in the 1930s and 1940s. While some of Fleischer's characters like Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman cartoons are better known, the studio's work is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Almost all in all, the body of work of the Fleischer studios is in the public domain. All Superman cartoons are in the public domain, all but one of the "Color Classics" series are in the public domain, and the film "Gulliver's Travels" is also in the public domain. This film was never released in the United States on VHS or DVD but was released in Europe. However, anyone who looks on the Internet can quickly generate a copy of it. I recommend the research.
