"Prime Suspect 4" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and fierce agent of truth and justice, the investigative superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5 and PS6) with the notable absence of the founding writer Lynda La Plante from the end credits. Merged with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second series of three Tennison pits against the forces of evil while facing middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a myriad of personal and professional problems and resolutions that are sometimes less than ideals. PS4 evokes two stories while PS5 and PS6 are single episodes, each of which finds Tennison seeking justice on behalf of brutal wrongs while fighting war against institutions that are willing to sacrifice the interests of its victims for those of a higher good. In other words, to prevail, Tennison must overcome both evil and good strength, which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series even grayer and the Tennison wars as a matter of principle as to find killers. Very good stuff that only gets better from one series to another. (B +)
