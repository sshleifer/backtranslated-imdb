I think FARSCAPE is the best scifi from Babylon 5 and is one of the best science fiction TV series of all time (ranks over there with Dr. Who, Blake's 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and the aforementioned B5). I find that the characters and races of Farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical "human beings with cravings" found in many series. The effects are quite good and the stories are engaging. Despite missing the bulk of season 2 and part of season 1, I find the character's development very well done.
