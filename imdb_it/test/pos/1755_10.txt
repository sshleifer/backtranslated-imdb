I saw this cartoon as a child, a father and now a grandfather. It's my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great little songs and the excellent drawings. I love the main song that appears throughout the cartoon. I think it's a beautiful little cartoon. Everyone I showed simply loves it. Too bad it was opened on such a bad day (bombing of Pearl Harbor). If it hadn't been for bad timing it would have been a great success. I hope to find a DVD because all VHS tapes don't do it justice. <br /> <br /> I think that if someone showed it to their children, they would get the same result. They will love it. <br /> <br />
