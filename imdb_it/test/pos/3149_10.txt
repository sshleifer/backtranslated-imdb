The Reader is an exceptionally well made and very sweet short film. Each element of the song helps to elicit a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, filmed and written. I was surprised to hear that there were no tests before the shoot, not even a reading. The performances are the testimony of a beautiful instinctive acting in response to a well-written script. The work of the actresses was excellent and there was never an indication that their work slipped into pure sentimentality. Less is much better in this case. This film is a great example of how these low-budget contracts are useful to both actors and directors.
