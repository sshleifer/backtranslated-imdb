Too bad for the poor reviewer who didn't like / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This film has more to say about life and relationships than it has ever seen, yet it is not as obscure or beloved as the "ordinary people" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy. <br /> <br /> Everything looks a bit like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespeare's Midsummer Dream. Beautiful and intelligent women abound, with a wonderful cinematography and a non-offensive script that does not miss a beat. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see it every time this film is taken via cable. It's like rereading a favorite and appreciated book.
