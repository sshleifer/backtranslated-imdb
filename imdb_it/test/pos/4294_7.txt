Although this film is set among the sophisticated upper English classes, it is a simple story of a torn pair. It looks a little dated, being an adaptation of "A Way Through the Wood", a 1950 novel by Nigel Balchin (once very popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite an academic award for the screenplay of "Gosford Park", has a somewhat anachronistic character, wrote the script and directed (the second for the first time). With the DVD version I saw that there is an illuminating audio commentary by Julian. His primary goal was to get his characters right, and overall he was successful. In this he was helped by two outstanding performances by Tom Wilkinson as James, the embroidered city lawyer and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; the execution time is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anne have a home in Chelsea and a comfortable former rectory in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger but has no children. Externally they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Down the street is the aristocrat Hon. William Buel, who is not one for middle-class morality, and is more than happy to take advantage of it. But there is a complication, a car accident, in which an elderly cyclist is run over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover just like the Hon. Invoices. Soon James, Anne, Bill and the widow of the victim (who seems to be James' and Anne the cleaner) are involved in a conspiracy to hide what really happened. The main objective is the corrosive effect of all this on the relationship between James and Anne. <br /> <br /> The third person in this m√©nage a trios, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the casting point of view, his languid and superior way is right for the part, yet somehow it doesn't get enough. In part this is due to the fact that he should be sick for a while and look good when he should be sick, and vice versa. The part seems underdeveloped. Interestingly, John Neville, Bill's father, who has only one significant scene, manages to establish his character magnificently in the time he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five-star hotels and superior restaurants is well evoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian age still exists. After all, however, the film is about what attracts a couple together and what makes them to pieces. When he wrote the book, Nigel Balchin was going through a marriage separation, and Fellowes made a good punch to convey the atmosphere. As he says, his adaptation is quite free, but the central theme is the same.
