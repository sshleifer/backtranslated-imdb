Gary Busey did a great job playing rock and roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has a spitting image for man. Being a garage band in the 1950s is certainly different from today. Having a group of three is usually simple in those days. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, then it was just a quiet country town. His parents were Christians, although his mother was a strong supporter of his son's work. This is one of the reasons why he didn't behave like Elvis. He kept to his kindest ways. This makes it really good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock n-roll, which turned Holly into a big moment. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and her friends. He did a tour with Sam Cooke, he went to the famous Apollo, which the African American public quickly accepted, I liked it! And Sam Cooke made sure that Holly and his band received some service. This is what I call tolerance. It is sad that he, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson had a musical career interrupted by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will live in our hearts. I don't know what inaccuracies there are in the film, all that interests me is that Buddy Holly has overcome the obstacles of music and politics at that time and that the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey, he was perfect in the role and in the making of music. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!
