*Warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a wealthy writer, is actually still just a kid in his behavior. He does not care about anyone except his own needs and could not care less about the consequences of any of his actions. Just as he meets Nimi and his ties with his family and community, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He begins to realize that structures that are simply affordable but lack heart and commitment are de facto alone and impersonal. However he turns away from any responsibility and is reluctant to change his life. But will he be able to settle back into his old life and ignore the bonds he has already - unconsciously - formed? <br /> <br /> Nimi's situation is the exact opposite. It is crushed by the regulations of its Nigerian community, its prejudices and its medieval values. Being a single mother, her position is difficult and becomes even worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white devil (as the Referend would say), a man she can't commit. The women of the community plan to marry her with the Referend to end her single status and give Sammy "a name". But this would mean for Nimi to renounce all independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative for you if you want Sammy to be accepted and herself to become a respected member of the community? <br /> <br /> This film has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with VERY sexy scenes by Matt and Nimi) and a captivating child who enthusiastically combines beautifully colored scenery. Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show great chemistry. It's just great to see them. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy is just to die for. You simply want to adopt it. I love the way Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. They are both at the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about Sex. This scene is absolutely adorable !! <br /> <br /> Almost nothing to complain about .... wait! It's not true. One thing is not good: the film is not long enough! (Well, and maybe the Referend is too bad and too silly to be convincing ....) <br /> <br /> 10 of 10, by all means!
