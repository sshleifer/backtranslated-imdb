Watching the last 2 episodes, I remembered a television additive from my childhood. He showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small saloon, a man enters the bar / salon, is thirsty to die for, his lips are cracked, etc., he has just crossed the Nevada desert and he has no water for days. He gives the barman a fat man "give me a packet of fries" While he eats it, we can feel how much more thirsty he is, we hear a voice in the background that says ... "Continue to build that thirst, build it until you can't keep it anymore ............. then blow away with TEAM "The man drinks TEAM (a non-alcoholic drink) It looks like a dozen bags of chips the thirst is so intense that I can no longer keep it, season 2 has even more twists and then season 1. The ending answers many questions but asks many more questions, we hope to know the answer in season three, but I doubt it because I feel that LOST has the moment goes much further the 3 seasons, if the people behind the camera continue their good work ro. <br /> <br /> I will continue to watch first. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with love
