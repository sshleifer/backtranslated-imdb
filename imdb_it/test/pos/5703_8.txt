In retrospect, the 1970s were a golden age for American cinema, as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese. This IFC effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of ​​what that time has meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The surprising body of work that remains is a legacy for everyone involved in the art of making films at that time. The decade was marked by the end of the Vietnam war and by the turbulent end of those years of Jimmy Carter's presidency. <br /> <br /> One thing emerges clearly, the films of today are not measured with the films released during that creative decade because the industry, as a whole, has changed radically. Today the big studios want to tame the images that will be instantaneous without taking into account the content or integrity, as long as the profits show millions of dollars in revenue. <br /> <br /> The other thing that emerges after listening to some of the best American creative minds to talk about, is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is the only thing that offers its creators great moral and artistic rewards. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a must see for all fans of the film.
