Have you ever found yourself watching a movie or documentary and having to hold back from screaming things like "No! Don't do it!"? No? Well, it's time for you to do it. And undoubtedly DEEP WATER is what makes you start. <br /> <br /> The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the world's first yacht race to be undertaken by individuals in 1968. That word "individuals" is important, since the men who leave for this almost suicidal adventure starts on its own. <br /> <br /> Most men are well known in the English maritime communities (where I throw from), but one of them is the "unknown black horse", and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Fighting financially, Crowhurst enlists a supporter who can take everything from him if he cannot at least try to overcome much of the race. He could take his home, his property, everything. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst now stands between a rock and ... well ... deep water: either try the race with an unproven ship and an untested captain, or lose everything you own (which was significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). In there you will also find the term "untested captain". Not only had it not been shown, he had never been in the open sea! Did I mention suicide? Leafing through the archive footage of the pre and post-race, and those of Crowhurst's friends, family and acquaintances today, Deep Water is put together with skill. Initially seen as a poor nosy who took over, the film gradually shows the limited choices that Crowhurst had after months and months at sea. His ship is losing. Psyche equipment outages stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no way out. It is also interesting to see the psychological interruptions that the other runners have while facing their isolation on board their respective boats. <br /> <br /> The undulating emotions that you will feel while watching this amazing documentary could make you a little sick (not unlike trying to take your legs). And you will probably be frustrated by the choices made; perhaps just as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The ending is surprising also because we see the real ship that Crowhurst sailed, sitting deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ... not unlike other things that seemed deserted and rotting toward the end of this little thought competition. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
