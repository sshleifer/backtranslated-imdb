After reading this documentary, I rented it and watched it with my teenage children. It was incredibly well balanced, showing the perspective of each side and leaving many questions unanswered. This is how it should be. I don't watch a documentary to know what to think. I look at him to learn and draw my conclusions. <br /> <br /> Next, we took a trip to Waco and visited the Davidians of the branch at the fire site. This was a powerful lesson in seeing yourself. And he took home the fundamental honesty behind "Waco: The Rules of Engagement". If you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.
