Chris Morris' TV series of Brass Eye has always generated a large number of complaints, both from the public and from the people who participated. But, none of what he did managed to stir up more controversy than this. 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the extremely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the largest number of complaints received about any TV program ever broadcast. <br /> <br /> The huge volume of complaints that the public made against Brass Eye The special was incredible! Many complaints have been expressed by people who have never even looked at the program! The theme of the program has transformed many heads, but the message has been widely misunderstood. The message was even lost on some who appreciated the program. This was not a show that mocked the theme of pedophilia. The show dealt exclusively with the media and the presentation of the subject. Morris, is and always will be, a satirist of the media. The idea that the program "amuses" pedophiles and children who have been abused is completely ridiculous! Morris never tries to do such a thing. It simply draws our attention to the overwhelming and often stupid media slogan surrounding the topic. <br /> <br /> Using many of his well-known "Brass Eye" characters, such as Ted Maul and others, Morris shows how much the media has blown every little thing on a topic they themselves created and built, and result is fun, if not more fun, than anything Morris has done before. Using his tried and tested formula, Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. In reality, they are made to look exactly like what they are. To delay. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Brass Eye Special must be seen to be believed. And, with an opening line, Morris manages to summarize the entire media situation in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
