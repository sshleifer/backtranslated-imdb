I was in high school when "Flesh" appeared on big screens, but I was lucky enough to see him in midnight cinemas in New York just two years later. <br /> <br /> Meat is the first part of a film the so-called "trilogy" of films, with Joe Dallesandro, as the object of desire. It bears the name "Warhol", but it is more the work of Paul Morissey. Essentially, history deals with the businesses that surround one day in the life of a street-going braggart (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, handsome and a little naive ... but he manages to bring home the bacon to his wife, for reasons that shouldn't be explained to fully appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> Of special note to movie fans is that this film (along with the remaining two of the trilogy), had no script of its own. Warhol's superstars were simply given as a premise ... and the words and actions that the viewer sees are quite natural (sometimes ridiculous or non-sensory). But all in all it works ... "Rolling Stone" noted in his review that the film was better than "Midnight Cowboy", a film of the same year, more polished than Hollywood (Oscar for best film), with great talent ( I also admire the film) ... but FLESH, being improvised, was somewhat more heartbreaking and realistic, without the need for complex secondary plots and any "cause of celebrity" ... or for any reason <br /> <br /> The film grossed over $ 3 million dollars and was an absolute sensation, particularly in the German market (which, ironically, thought it had received a "censored version" of the film due to the post- editing .... see note below). <br /> <br /> Curiously, the film is very "cut and paste" with "pop". "click", "flashes" and the dialogue literally stops in mid-sentence. It's almost as if Warhol / Morissey claimed a simple truth that is a "day in the life" of a superstar, fragments for your voyeuristic tendencies. Much better than Warhol's previous works of 8 hours of sleep, and the statue of liberty as a film of over 20 hours. <br /> <br /> FLESH, in my opinion, is the first of Warhol's films that is actually digestible (given a broad pallette) and Warhol's Factory's first legitimate response to the Hollywood "stardom" phenomenon. <br /> <br /> Like the first of a "trilogy", it portrays a young and desirable male icon, naive, sophisticated, responding to invitations to please his family. The following films would show the "same character" with a different set of values. (See "Trash" and "Heat")
