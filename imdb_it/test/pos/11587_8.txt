The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be eused. This film, along with the winner of the best film of the same year, Million Dollar Baby, caused a sensation that year with their depictions of disabled people wishing for death. Both the defenders of the disabled and (unfortunately for the supporters of the disability) the conservative pro-life groups protested both for the films and for their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire defeat of Terry Schiavo, only to put everything in a historical perspective. Do protests, especially from groups of disabled people, against Million Dollar Baby make sense ?? the film clearly described, without hesitation, the life of a worthless paraplegic. The main character of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes paraplegic, does not seem to receive any kind of advice, no help and immediately wants to die. The film is honestly quite stupid and uncomfortable. The Sea Inside, based on the true story, is certainly much more reflective on the subject. Most likely he entered the same category as Million Dollar Baby without his protesters ever seeing him, an incredibly common phenomenon. The film gives time to many different sides of the subject. And he immediately declares that the desire to die is only the protagonist and the protagonist. However, he is guilty of a couple of crimes and I understand why disability groups might have a problem. First of all, there is the meeting of the protagonist with a paraplegic bishop. I do not look well in the way it is depicted. His orally managed wheelchair is described as an absurdity, and there is almost a comic sequence in which his effeminate toy servants drag him, in his chair, up the stairs. He can't even reach the room Ramón is in, and one of the boys is forced to carry the conversation between them. I had to think, well, maybe if Ramón lived in a house that was a little more wheelchair-accessible, he wouldn't spend his whole life in bed, and could find life more fulfilling (who knows how much the film describes reality). The director Amenábar (The Others) also includes some ridiculous scenes that try to make this film more suicidal, like a transversal sequence in which Ramón seems attentive and the child of his lawyer is born. But in addition to some bad times, the film is very good. It hurts that someone may want to die when he has the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. However, in the end, our lives belong to us. Should we not have the right to choose? The strongest asset of the film are the supporting characters and the actors who play them. Describes how Ramón's struggle and decisions affect those around him with fine precision. Family members in particular are fantastic, and Ramón's last departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and made me cry. My favorite interpretation in the film is from Lola Dueñas, who also gave me the best performance, or at least certainly more undervalued, in Almverovar's Volver last year.
