My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself through the legacy of his famous architect father, Louis Kahn, who died since 1974. The film develops slowly, but perfectly, and what begins as an apparently identity crisis lost at forty years it takes place in a beautiful story with a much deeper meaning regarding the importance of love, loss, family and, perhaps even more important, of our life's work. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Louis Kahn before this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues, one has a very good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt as memories are remembered and the stories told. Sometimes it seemed that these people told Nathaniel how to feel about his father. As I listened to every memory, my personal opinion of this man ranged from beautiful to horrible, sometimes within a moment, so as to get a good feeling for the roller coaster that Nathaniel's emotions must have ridden. <br /> <br /> The last sequence in Bangladesh made the film totally for me. The veneration that the people of Bangladesh talked about Louis Kahn's work has linked all the positive aspects together for me, and hopefully for Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn has finally found what he was looking for.
