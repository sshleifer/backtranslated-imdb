This wonderful film is a love story and shows that not all relationships are meant to last. Although they can be fantastic and they are worth the pain and suffering of rupture. <br /> <br /> Director Pieter Verhoeff gives us an overview of the period around 1900, the way society (mis) treats women and a strong woman (Nynke) takes care of. With great costumes, landscapes, enchanting music and good actors and playing this photographic film attracts you for the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning the ending is a little sudden, a page describing the rest of his life scrolls. On reflection, this is a great (the best) way to have your imagination to create the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> This was the second film for me that made people sit while the credits ran (The first is Schindler's list). Apparently the film has had this effect on everyone.
