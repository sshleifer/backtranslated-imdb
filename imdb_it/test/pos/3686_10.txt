I wonder why he never heard of this movie. It is really a magnificent comedy (I would say a farce, but it is too well played and I will hate to denigrate its quality). A comic study on the travails of mid-life crises, the injustice for gays who cannot recognize their long-standing unions and the general differences of people who cannot adapt well to society, who couples Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett for a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should make another film together. Maudie (Meredith Eaton), an anxious, immature and outrageous granddaughter, is a truly wonderful character. If you enjoyed the Tales of the City movies, you would like this quirky charmer.
