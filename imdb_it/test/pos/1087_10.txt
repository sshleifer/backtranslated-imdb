Satya was excellent ... The company was just as good but more lucid, probably thanks to the money earned from previous films. However, Ab Tak Chappan is even more fun. The dialogue is gritty, raw and sometimes hilarious. Nana Pataker shines once again in a role that only he can satisfy with authority but the supporting cast has a great talent. The direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramatic climax. As a representation of reality it can be too dramatized, but in the end it is a film, so the balance is perfect. I ordered my DVD and I'm looking forward to seeing it again at home. As a lover of this type of gangster movie, this is very rewarding and comes highly recommended for the Bollywood gangster lovers "non-Yash Raj".
