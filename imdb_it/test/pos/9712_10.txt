The sequel is exactly what you would expect it to be. And it's good enough that everyone who wanted to see it should leave him happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that will win an Oscar. But what made the TV show Jackass and the original film was a success, and it made a quantum leap. It's more fun, more brutal and more disgusting than the original. And I loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> The original has had some notable stunts, and there is at least one stunt that this film will be remembered for. It will make you jump, shudder, look away and laugh very, very hard. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably don't need to read this review, or any other, to know if you'll like this movie, unless you've never heard of Jackass.
