I just saw The Big Trail in the Filmmuseum in Vienna for the first time. Immediately I was amazed by both high optical quality images and the unusual format and its wonderfully detailed history. Who ever saw such western documentary style with John Wayne? And there's so much time, you can really look around on the screen, there's so much to see! One is always grateful that the scenes are often static, because every single shot is so well composed and you want to take it. Even the acting is good and fits well. The long run time of the photo is wonderful, you don't want to miss a minute!
