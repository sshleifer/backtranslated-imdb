This is certainly a good film, beautifully photographed and recited in an evocative way. Yet it should certainly be criticized, and Mizoguchi, because it is not without flaws and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really took care of women and wanted to make statements about the lack of understanding and total cruelty of man, yet sometimes he manages to come forward in an attempt to make this statement by adopting the wrong means. This is certainly a case in "The Crucified Lovers", "Princess Yang Kwei Fei" and "Zankiku monogatari". He defines the scenario in feudal Japan, which in the end leaves the spectator with the exclamation in part to the right: "boy, feudalism sucks, I'm glad it's over ...". True, some of the scenarios that Mizoguchi's weaker films present would now be literally impossible. Furthermore, her female characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic sacrifice, which also simplifies the less attractive scenario. Having said that, "Crucified Lovers" is a good film, with so few relative weaknesses, although Ueda's sometimes cold and cynical prose, the writer helps this film to be assigned. I still prefer and recommend Mizoguchi's "realistic", "contemporary" films from 1936: "Osaka Elegy" and "Sisters of the Gion", as well as his latest masterpieces, in which he showed more restriction and subtlety: "Ugetsu", "Sansho Dayu 'and' The Life of Oharu '.
