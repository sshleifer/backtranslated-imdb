This is the first science fiction series I have been keen on since Star Trek, (and I haven't seen Trek in years). It takes the theme of invasion in somewhat different directions, but it did so in a very exciting way. It also borrows from the soap opera format, where it continues during the entire year of the series. The CGI certainly does not overcome the plot or the characters, except for Nim, the rising creature that is a pet with a definite attitude. (Whatever showed what he really thought of the neighbor's yippy dog ​​is A-1 in my book.) It was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br /> I remained at the end of the final asking questions (I hope the smart ones) and crossing the fingers and toes that NBC or someone else (Sci Fi, maybe) will continue to direct the series and answer to these questions. <br /> <br /> A truly exceptional and classy show.
