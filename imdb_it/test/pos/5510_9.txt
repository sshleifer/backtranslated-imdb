This thriller is one of the few (movie) surprises I've had in a long time. Everyone - and I mean ALL - I spoke when he was in the theaters he said was horrible ... but then I got to thinking ... none of these people really understand horror / thriller or metal rock movies - so WHY THE ASCOLO IN THE FIRST PLACE ????? This movie kicks your ass, but ONLY if you can understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - look at it with an open mind and it might just open your mind. ... even the soundtracks are fantastic ...
