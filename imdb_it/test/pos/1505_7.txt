Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian filmmakers at the time of his death in 1996, yet his career had long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre voices that could hardly resist the shadow of his early work. For much of the 1970s to the mid 1980s, he gave birth to stylistically distinctive horrors such as "The City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond", and the brutal mystery "The New York Ripper", fondly remembered from a fan like myself. And while "Cat in the Brain" is part of the era of Fulci's decline as a director, it's a shocking, darkly exhilarating journey that, while a clearly inferior work (the framing, effects and acting are below par), proves an interesting open meditation on the psychology of pop and the ability of the film to desensitize. Make no mistake: "Cat in the Brain" is a total gorefest, and disjointed like Fulci's previous films, but deserves credit for trying to be something more. With a delightfully ironic touch, Fulci plays himself: a director in the midst of filming another violent horror film that comes down with perverse / homicidal hallucinations; after visiting a shrink that puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to intersect, to the point where the viewer cannot discern the two. The recent Grindhouse Releasing DVD mentions "Cat" as an apparent heir to "Eraserhead", and possesses an equally disturbing, strangely funny quality associated with the best surrealist art.
