"Checking Out" is a very witty and honest portrait of a bizarre family that appears to be Jewish. Judaism has virtually no role in the film, but the culture and behavior of American Jews are completely sent ... in a loving way. I would like the film to deal with the religious perspective on the subjects it explores, because I think it would have been interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a Columbo fan so I wasn't familiar with Peter Falk - it's very fun to watch. It's nice to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again - why don't they work more? They are all hilarious. The script is fantastic with a lot of memorable one-liners that I will definitely use with my family. Watch as goalkeeper Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!).
