This multilevel thriller caught my attention everywhere. It is disturbing and instructive to see how perverse human behavior can be. It is also instructive about which past wounds can motivate present behavior. Nobody, except Sandra Bullock's partner, is very nice. However, all are credible. Sandra did an excellent job. His character, Cassie, comes alive with all his pain, his fear and his defenses. She is a survivor and therefore her life experience finally brings her to a moment of recovery. I really enjoyed this movie. Tom Landers
