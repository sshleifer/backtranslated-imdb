I saw it in 1993 on a VHS tape but since then I haven't been able to find it from any source. This is a very gloomy and uncompromising look in the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone with an interest in the Pacific war would do well to watch this movie and see what conditions the other side has fought. From what I can tell, this is historically accurate and describes how easily men can descend into complete barbarism. I understand that the Japanese Army was completely excluded from any supply of the Philippines in 1945, so there is no doubt that many of the horrible accidents described here have happened. I may not have been able to identify with the characters in the film, but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. If I had to compile a list of the ten greatest war movies, this movie would be on it. Watch him if you can catch him.
