All about "Choose Connor" was the top = drawer, in particular the script and the very skilled work done by the 21 year old director, screenwriter, producer Luke Eberl. . . a young talent from whom to expect great things. All the acting was credible, intelligent dialogue, the important theme. I loved it !!! <br /> <br /> I saw him at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival, where he was screened twice and was tremendous with the audience. It is much more than just a growth film - this guy learns a harsh and harrowing lesson about trust, politics and "the system" - how things really work to fit the personal plans of those in powerful positions. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone with a functioning brain.
