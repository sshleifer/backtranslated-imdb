This film cannot be taken seriously ..... the plot is predictable and banal, acting often over the top, ridiculous dialogue; but it all adds up to great fun! At the end of the 1950s, three "career girls" found their way to the big city and all the evils and temptations that their mothers probably felt: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> So there is Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) who has had professional success, but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with its name on the door. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been believable 50 years ago, but now it's just great campy fun! Rent / buy and have fun.
