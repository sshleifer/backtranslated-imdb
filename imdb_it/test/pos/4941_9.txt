When I played the first Soul Calibur on Dreamcast I thought it was fantastic. When I played the second I was hooked. And finally, when Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a playstation 2 and the game. <br /> <br /> This can really make you stay awake for hours, with a lot of characters, lots of unlockable content and not to mention a BIG combat system, this is really the biggest fighting game up today. <br /> <br /> The strengths of the game are above all the gameplay, where two human players face each other, playing as one of the main characters or as a character created and personalized. The Create character option is vast and allows the player to create thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the "Grieve Edge" fighting style (just kicks) you must wear those ridiculous shoes. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the greatest fighting game you could ever want. Now, I just hope the movie doesn't suck.
