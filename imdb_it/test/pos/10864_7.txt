Labeling this film as a "lesbian love story" is as accurate as defining a "straight romance" Pride & Prejudice. There is much more. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is a classic training novel, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal blindness to discovery of himself. There is a stylistic element of the field in the direction of the film, but it is not an obstacle; rather it serves to emphasize the scenic and dramatic parts of the life of the main character. <br /> <br /> Those who know Anna Chancellor from the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will surely be amazed by her here. Rachael Stirling is stellar as the main character Nan, and Keeley Hawes is all good-eyed like her lover Kitty Butler. The chancellor could play the leading role, except for Sally Hawkins who plays Zena Butler. This film is not for the faint of heart, but it is not even a pro-gay advertisement. It's a true story, with real comedy and drama, a compelling story with compelling characters, and it's worth watching.
