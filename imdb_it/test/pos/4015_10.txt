*** Spoilers forward *** My late childhood had two movie icons: Star Wars and this film by the Czech genius Karel Zeman. An encyclopedia by Jules Verne in which 19th century illustrations come to life in an exquisite black and white photograph, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. Verne's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film, as is a modern question about the moral limits of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy into the Verne universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. Also elliptical and elegant is the end of the villain, with an explosion (probably nuclear) that makes his hat fly over the sea. The resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfying, something very rare today, when many films do not seem to know how to end. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to capture this gem in local TV replicas in the late 1970s: it increased my enjoyment of Verne's fiction and cinema. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for Karel Zeman, underrated master of the imagination.
