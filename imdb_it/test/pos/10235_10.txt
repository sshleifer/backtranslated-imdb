Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie, I wore more than one tape as it is. The make-up is fantastic, the story is adorable. It takes several twists and is not as deep as the story on which it is based (Cabal, by Clive Barker), but for a film adaptation it remains very faithful to the original material. The only problem with this film was the unnecessary attempts of the producer to turn it into a movie for teenagers, so the ending changed to allow sequel * eye roll *. Apparently one day we will have a directorial cut that (I hope) clarifies this nonsense. Until then, I'd suggest it to everyone who loves dark fantasy horror rather than Freddy / Jason / Micheal coupons. I really don't know what would be comparable ...
