The CGI feature has just been released this year, but while it will provide children with a lot of fun, for Alvin's fanatics and fan followers who have grown up with versions of the cartoon shows of the 60s and 80s, The Chipmunk Adventure is probably the best animated film based on Alvin and Chipmunks, always. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the animation is always fantastic, the characters' drawings are as they should be in cartoons, unlike the moving film, it's simply fun to watch. there are no celeb voices, no CGI-generated effects, only pure 2-D quality, hand-drawn animation and fantastic colors: bright, bold and beautiful. Jokes and humor are the typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is apt. In truth, The Chipmunk Adventure is all that the live action movie should have been, but it is not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with the Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in a balloon race and along the way, the boys face all sorts of problems and dilemmas that they have to solve in their own way. And no squirrel movie is complete without the strange versions of rock and pop classics. <br /> <br /> The Chipmunk Adventure is for children and adults - another advantage compared to the CGI film - while the 2007 version will gain some new admirers, the 1987 film will appeal to both of us Chipmunk fans. Bagdarasian and Karman provide the helium voices of the film trio. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a must for fans of the same cartoons - you won't be disappointed. If you have seen the live action version, then you will feel that this film is a much better effort in contrast. If you don't have it, you should go and see it again, or even forget about the Jason Lee movie and, alternatively, continue with this
