I saw this movie on 3 different occasions. In the first time, I was impressed by this movie. It seemed like a very nice film. I hated this movie as a sentimental garbage to my second vision. However, my third vision has reaffirmed my belief that it is a good movie. There is a lot of emotional strength in this film, especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr Kramer and Madam Kramer. There are some scenes in which Meryl Streep appears to be a cruel person despite being a beauty in real life. Austin Hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of custody of his son. There was also a controversy over the sets of this film. According to the master cameraman Nestor Almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped hurting himself as Mr. Kramer's character, to show the intensity of his anger, decides to break a hard glass. Fortunately nothing happened to Nestor. Kramer against Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure. how does Mily have to be maintained if there are children involved.
