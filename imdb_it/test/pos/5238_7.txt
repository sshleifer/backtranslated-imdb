Sweeping and still impressive early Western Talkie of pioneering days; other contemporary films on the same line include THE COVERED WAGON (1923), THE IRON HORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931) ?? none of which I've seen, even though I have the latter on VHS. It was simultaneously filmed in the "Standard" full screen report and in an experimental Widescreen process called "Grandeur", but only the first was released on the Fox nude DVD; one can only hypothesize how it would appear in a wider relationship, but the careful framing ?? not to mention the splendid cinematography ?? it is evident enough also in the "Standard" version. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne is surprisingly in the lead (a role that, however, did not lead to the expected celebrity as he would languish in Western 'B' for the better part of the next decade, before John Ford came to his rescue with STAGECOACH [1939]!); however, he and Marguerite Churchill (from DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [1936]) make a nice couple ?? despite its somewhat boring character. The supporting characters include a variety of reserve types: western veteran, assistant of relief from the comedian (with a penchant for making noises with his mouth!), Grumpy and rough coarse (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!) slimy cohorts (one Mexican and one southern, the latter also filling up as Wayne's rival for the hand of Churchill), etc. Even among the members of the chariot is a shy Swede (full of optimism for the promised land, but who is continually slaughtered by his irascible mother-in-law) and later Wayne regulates Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The episodic story turns into a number of alternate, lyrical and action-packed cartoons ?? how we see the potential colonists fighting the elements, the Indians and themselves; the film, however, has a completely authentic feeling that attenuates its essentially dated and static quality. Also, is the editing somewhat unstable (especially during the second half) ?? no wonder, given that the DVD edition of the film only lasts 108 minutes against the full 158 minute version of "Grandeur"!
