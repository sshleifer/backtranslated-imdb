First they came for the communists, and I did not speak, because I was not a communist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics and I did not speak because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and at that moment there was no one else who could speak for me. <br /> <br /> Attributed to the rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> <br /> In the face of intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing, to talk and risk becoming an object of contempt. But when does it become too much? Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler's genocidal policies to flourish, and equal doses of defamation of fear and ignorance made it possible for the anticommunist purges of McCarthyism to destroy the lives of thousands. Inaction makes him no less guilty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a chameleon of a man: silent and indistinguishable he blends perfectly with his surroundings. Lawrence doesn't like being involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he doesn't tell anyone and minds his own business. His world turns into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is mistaken for one of "them". Lawrence's vision of the world and his vision of him are forever altered. <br /> <br /> Although the subject of this film is not new, its presentation is certainly unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice, when placed within a certain context - Lawrence is more concerned with the hypotheses that he is Jewish, than with the opinions of his attackers. He believes that if he corrects this "supervision" that everything will be fine, not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Whether it's an intruder (the only thing I liked about "Fargo") or a rather nice sheriff, the roles of William H. Macy are linked by a common thread - the characters share a subtle, deliberate face that gives them substance. Macy nails Lawrence down to the smallest detail, and says more with a sneak peek or a tremor in the voice of a dialogue page. Showing, rather than telling, Lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer. The supporting cast brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern is as convincing as Gerty, the wife of Lawrence with a past. Trailer park is rough, but at the same time worldly, he also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of "a mistake" and unknowingly aggravates Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is as frightening as Fred, the redneck prototype next door, equal parts of ignorance and poison, which line up close to its virulent cause. In the midst of chaos there is Finklestein (David Paymer), the focus of aggression, and the voice of reason that raises important questions. Even the portrait of Paymer prevented Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to generate sympathy, making his one of the strongest interpretations of the film. <br /> <br /> The tight assembly and cropped cinematography make a clean image with few distractions and mixes an air of claustrophobia with the feeling of the American citizen - it is both comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of accurate two-tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully evaluated soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming. Finally, the setting and the costume recreate the feeling of the era, an essential component in the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The unconventional "focused" approach to dealing with prejudice is a sufficient reason to recommend this film. Just consider the excellent story, the solid acting and the appearance of the film as added bonuses.
