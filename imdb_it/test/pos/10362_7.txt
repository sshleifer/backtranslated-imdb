I liked this movie. Many people refer to it as "Sabrina the adolescent feminist". They do it with a lot of movies featuring Melissa Joan Hart. However, he really surprised me in this film because it was great in the part of Mary, fighting for justice when her roommate is raped. One could say that Hart was extremely determined in this film and proved it. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Mary's roommate. She was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was as good as the arrogant and selfish rapist. Lochlyn Munro has convincingly portrayed his character. The acting in this film is better than most TV movies, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The film was quite predictable. Also, I expected more from the finale, it was too rough. The delivery could have been better. But the performance and the general plot compensate for these problems.
