The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu (1976) is a very underrated work by director John Woo. The film features Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and stars Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien. Many people believe, or have been led to believe with deceptive advertising, that this is a Jackie Chan film. This is not a Jackie Chan film, Dorian Tan is the star but Jackie gives one of his best (most serious) first performances. <br /> <br /> The Hand of Death speaks of a Shaolin disciple named Yunfei (Tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo ). During his journey, Yunfei meets a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (Chang Chung) known as "the vagabond". Both men suffered at the hands of Shih and want revenge. The three team up to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety. <br /> <br /> Martial arts action is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his high quality kicks very effectively as the "eighteen Nordic styles", along with some "southern styles in five styles". Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also offer excellent martial arts performances. James Tien is not the greatest martial artist on Jade's screen but he does an acceptable job. Some of the first fights are a bit slow and seem more choreographed, but the final showdowns with Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Director John Woo offers a lot of interesting character developments in the film, which is refreshing. The cinematography of Leung Wing Kat is very elegant, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. Joseph Koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and orchestral pieces in the "Shaft" style of the 70s is kung fu at its best. Hand of Death is not the usual kung fu comedy of Jackie and Sammo. Hand of Death is a serious story aimed at revenge. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic of the old-school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of his time and a preview of the great things that will come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is shown here before his directorial debut and Chan's charisma and talent can be clearly seen. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death is a solid and elegant old school kung fu movie and a brilliant first work by the legendary John Woo. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Genre Rating 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Wanderer to Tan (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance". <br /> <br /> Tan: "Just an ornament".
