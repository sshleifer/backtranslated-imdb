Those reviewers who complained that this film lacks plausibility or have construction problems did not understand the point. This is a wonderfully camp love story, with lots of games, gypsies! Dance, gypsies! music, which both sends exotic love stories and celebrates them. Buttoned Ray Milland makes a fun sheet for a Dietrich with black hair, tattered scarves and tons of jewelry. The character's impatience to feed Milland and take care of him more closely resembles the good German hausfrau Dietrich was out of the set with respect to his vampire roles. Censorship being enforced, it was made clear that they share a caravan only in Platonic terms, with Milland fighting Dietrich's advances with a remarkable determination for a heterosexual bachelor who could be killed on any day. His only excuse is that she smells, so maybe a stuffy and fussy English could really be put off. <br /> <br /> In the small role of Milland's young companion in his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a field note of a different kind. At first we are told that he loves the hero Milland, and rather, rather, he pouts. When, after being separated, he meets Milland, now transformed into a dark-skinned gypsy with an open shirt on his waist, his ardent appreciation of disguise also suggests that not only is Dietrich romantically in love with Milland. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events, Milland's growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life is quite moving. And when, on their last night alone before escaping, he says that each of them now contains half of the other, the two have become one, and then darkness falls, I think we can assume that the censor has decided to grant them a break ! A joke - at first, Milland, who should be English, refers to a lieutenant, using the American pronunciation. (The British say "leftenant".) Since Milland was English, he must have said so because American filmmakers feared that the American public would be distracted and confused by the British style.
