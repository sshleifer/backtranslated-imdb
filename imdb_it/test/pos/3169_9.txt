For me, the Tempest and its characters (with whom I mean admirals) are like old friends. Ever since I started experimenting the game through acting lessons (I played Ferdinand) I immediately found myself involved in the fantastic world created by Shakespeare. I clearly remember that a student decided not to play Ferdinand after all, so I went on stage and I had the honor of acting alongside an excellent Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the merits of a great friend is that you can never know them completely - there is always something you can discover about their character. A film production of the Tempesta della qualit√† is therefore like a visit to an old friend, dear to the heart: each visit presents a new perspective on the memory we had of work. With Prospero's Books, the ritual and elegance of the show was emphasized, the exuberant celebration of art within the art. Here, we see a vision like esoteric mysticism, with lovingly elaborate interiors full of candles and plaster diagrams on the floors, more Aleister Crowley than the Neapolitan nobleman. He also made me reconsider: why was Prospero thrown out of Naples? His magical power is so palpable in this production that one wonders if it was only politics that condemned Prospero to exile, but rather the fact of his difference from his peers. So, in the real world, he suffered. He was cast out, powerless to change the evil on the right. All the villains in this play, whether they realize it or not, act in accordance with the creation of a more painful infernal world, it is always in the interests of the oppressor to make life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero manages to bring these wicked earthlings to his island, the kingdom in which he has (absolute) dominion. Shakespeare takes his audience to the theater, the realm in which Shakespeare dictates events, words, results. Shakespeare is, of course, Prospero - but what this film adaptation truly honors the text is to make Prospero as comprehensive as a figure of reason, despite being surrounded by what society defines as irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols, magic diagrams, etc.). .). Is it more rational to be a man of cloth and murder, or be a heretic and work for the correction of wrongs? Prospero He is a heretic, for the fact that he abandons his magic is not because books will lose their value in Naples, but since they are no longer necessary - the world itself - it has become the magic of books. <br /> <br /> In Hamlet, Hamlet presents a game to his peers. The game accuses his companions of conspiring against others for their own advancement. The public's reaction varies: while Ophelia is perplexed, Claudius reacts with shocked shock. This happens in the game, and Shakespeare performed this show for the men of his time. Has Shakespeare looked for their reactions? In the storm, Prospero lives the comedy he is building and we live it with him. How do we react? Do you react with simple joy to the happy ending? Are you troubled and shocked by the strangeness of this production, which is entirely appropriate given the starting material? Do you feel sad that this little life, the comedy, is round with a sleep, as transitory as it is eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for the life of humanity on Earth, but man is weak and is not willing to do it in favor of petty power struggles. We have Claudi. <br /> <br /> As a good friend, this film is not without its flaws. I disagree with the choice to paint some scenes entirely in blue. The dance of the sailors is rather tangential. But in the heart this is really The storm and one of its many faces.
