What about a movie like Rock Star? Very much in reality! This is the kind of movie that is almost tailor-made for slamming critics. It is also a film I, like a big fan of loved hard rock - not loved in reality - while all the time I am aware of its many flaws and the film, while a decent effort in some respects has missed the opportunity that he had to escape the grandeur and become a classic of the rock film. Oh well ... <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and I would see it again and again, but I know it is based solely on my personal tastes: Rock Star is a film that will please anyone who has experienced elements of the style of rock or hard rock life and want to walk the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that (long forgotten by many non-rock fans). Time effectively, as I think Rock Star did. This is one of the strengths of the film, the concert footage. You'll feel like you're there with them and how could a hard rock fan not love him? As for setting the atmosphere, Rock Star gets a 10 out of 10. He also gets a 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to let you go and leave yourself with the good memories of the good old days, then this is the movie for you. It's also why I loved this movie like that. <br /> <br /> But it's not a great movie. I understand that and if it was my real job to review films professionally, I should probably be a little tough on this. The problem with Rockstar is the character development. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with character development is this, there is none. None. The film has some scenes - few and far between but are there - that the DO touches the size: WARNING BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples 1) when Izzy makes his debut on stage (including the fall he takes) <br / > <br /> 2) The first "after show" party with Emily (Anniston and Izzy.) <br /> <br /> 3) Backtracking a little - At the beginning when the original lead singer is fired (fired) - the whole "business as usual" tone lays the foundation for what is to come. It is played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is that nothing ever comes. There is little or no development of anyone's character in this film, people's characters are simply touched, but never fully explored. I don't think it's the fault of the actors / actresses, in particular of Anniston who tries hard, they are not given much to work with. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the "formula" of hearing real movies in depth. Rockstar was so sweet sometimes (even towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. And anyway, those scenes that I mentioned were exceptional and very credible, unfortunately there wasn't much else in the film. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer mentioned the lack of accumulation towards the end and I agree, but in reality there was a lack of accumulation on ANYTHING. WHY Izzy leaves at the end? Why does he miss his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of credibility. And frankly, the end was just trivial. It made no sense and had no reality. <br /> <br /> Looking at this, it's almost like watching a movie where the creators said: OK, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc In the end it is no longer a film about a boy whose dream came true, it is just another densely worded love story. And you wonder why so many details are left .... <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not too tough on Rock Star because I really loved it, but not for the right reasons. I would have liked to love it as a great movie about the ups and downs of rock fame. Instead I loved him for his 80s feeling, clothes, hair, lights, life ... Although many others loved him, I suspect that most are people who have lived the life of a fan of rock, like I did or some who play I would have liked to see the movie go through and just be respected to be a good movie, well told, instead of a clich√©. I think one of the problems was length. I hate long movies myself, but this was one that should have been longer, if a movie is really well done, the length isn't even heard - there's only so much to the story to be as short as it was -this is one of the reasons why there does not seem to be much development either of history or of human beings portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> So to relax, this is a movie where you can enter a lot - but not a great movie. Watch it for fun. Watch it for entertainment. Look at it to go back to that big, big space in time when metal was not just a part of life, it was life - and for non-rock fans - to see it to take a small look at a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.
