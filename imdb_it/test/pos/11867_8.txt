Liv Tayler in her sexiest movie! <br /> <br /> She incorporates the role of "Femme Fatale" in a surprising way, while at the same time managing to look like a super sexy woman while maintaining the "sweet girl" position and not being too evil like the others similar films (eg "Femme Fatale" with Rebecca Romijn) <br /> <br /> Until this film, Lord of the Rings was the only film in which I ever saw it (I fell in love with LotR ) <br /> <br /> Point: For LoTR I had given the impression that the role of the pure and sweet woman was the only role that Liv Tayler could play, but when I saw "One night at Mc Cool" I absolutely changed my mind. She is the sexiest woman ever! <br /> <br /> So as a film it is a common mediocre comedy with a "confused" plot
