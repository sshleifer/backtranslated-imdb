Some films have just vanished, but Tourist Trap has stood the test of time and has rightly become a cult. Although not entirely original, he owes much to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which retains his sense of humor, the truly gruesome moments, a brilliant soundtrack by Pino Donaggio and the entertaining performances of Chuck Connors and the cast. Don't let the PG evaluation keep you away, this movie shows that free boredom and nudity are not necessary in every horror movie to make it fun. These elements are usually used to cover up the lack of thrills in a movie. Here, fears are deserved and effective. Also, only Chuck Connors could bring a scene where he has to share soup with a dummy! A classic scene indeed. Now more accessible on widescreen DVDs, this film is a must for 70s horror fans.
