When I saw this film for the first time about 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little more. But he stayed with me. That interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and answer had more to do with actual VHS quality than with the film itself. I purchased the Criterion DVD box set and discovered that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great film. It's inspiring, and I'm sure it has succeeded in its main purpose: propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, who is simply propagandist and nothing else. It's not true. He is a fantastic filmmaker, one of the most important he has ever lived. By now, the world is far enough away from Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein's films as art.
