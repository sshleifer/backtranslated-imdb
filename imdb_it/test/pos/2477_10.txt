Well, I liked this movie, even if sometimes it turns too much into a stereotypical situation. I didn't understand right now if the "Punishment Park" existed in the past, but I think the issue is not really here. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie in a different way. Show how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world driven by violence and that no one can escape from it. If someone refuses to "take responsibility", then you will be expelled from our society ... Our whole history is made up of wars, we should never forget it. In fact it is only when we finally accept the truth that, perhaps, we will change and understand that our "intellectual abilities" have improved. So we could use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In 2 words this movie is a must see, maybe it will help us to accept the truth ...
