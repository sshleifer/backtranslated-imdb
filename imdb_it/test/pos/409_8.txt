Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton playing "The Fox" on a radio show. He writes the mysteries of murder and how 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girl (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write the perfect murder ... or his friends understand it ... <br /> <br /> Very funny and funny movie. Quick movement (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and a perfect cast puts it into practice. Skelton is very good at his first starring role - very funny, fast, beautiful and smart. Veidt is excellent as the villain Jones. Rutherford and Gray are as much fun as Skelton's friends. All three play perfectly with each other - their verbal confrontation is the strong point of this image. Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> It's worth your time.
