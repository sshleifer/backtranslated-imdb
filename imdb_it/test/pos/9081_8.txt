I just saw this move recently on the Encore channel. What a great film, even a great cast. Flatliner is very suspenseful and unpredictable. The film has a great opening scene by the sea, and then a series of scenes that establish the questions about life after death that provide an engaging involvement in history. Therefore, Nelson played by Kiefer Sutherland was the first to pass the test to die and come back to life. Then it becomes very dramatic bringing back its wrong doing from the past to life. So all the characters mentioned above lived the same experience, except for Randy's trick played by Olliver platt. So the story develops into a basic resolution and understanding of life and the presence and meaning of God. David Labraccio played by Kevin Bacon, an atheist, ends up questioning his opinion of God. It's amazing to see Julia Roberts together to Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland at such an important moment in their careers. One may wonder why we no longer have a great film produced. This is one of the best productions of Joel Schumacher. I really like this movie.
