FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 30s. He starred in Edward G. Robinson and it was a very gritty story about a squalid newspaper and their willingness to do anything ... NOTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, an old story of an innocent woman is plastered through the pages and helps destroy her happy life - many years after being inadvertently involved in a scandal. The reason I loved the film was the fact that he didn't punch and didn't punch, showing how low publishers can sell documents. <br /> <br /> Here in TWO AGAINST THE WORLD, it's a remake of FIVE STAR FINAL - with some modifications. Instead of Robinson, this film is played by Humphrey Bogart and is the head of programming for a radio station, not a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same - except that it is a little less angular and lacks some of the grit and sensationalism of the original. This does not mean that the film is bad - it simply does not have as good an impact as the first film. In other words, if you have to watch one of these films, look at the first one - even if this movie is quite powerful and fun. As for me, I loved the story so much, I saw both films and I appreciated them both. <br /> <br /> TWO AGAINST THE WORLD begins with UBC radio owner who complains to his programming boss (Bogart) that all the "high brow" shows he has low ratings. The owner asks for manure - a lot of manure to have more listeners. One way they discuss is to do a multi-part dramatization of a famous murder that took place two decades ago - even though the killer was acquitted and killed only in self-defense. However, they decide to stage the story as if he were guilty and go so far as to send a writer to the lady's house pretending to be a minister (!) In addition to transmitting his name and his whereabouts. Needless to say, this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy. Then, and only then, Bogart feels a real remorse for the production of such garbage - leading to a dandy ending on journalistic integrity and decency. <br /> <br /> Well done, a great idea of ​​history and a message that is just as important today as it was in the 1930s, this is a story you must see. In particular, note the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene in which the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart --- is a big heck of a great example of acting and writing.
