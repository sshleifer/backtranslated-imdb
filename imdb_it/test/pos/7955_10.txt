This film would have shamed Hollywood's typical "tears". The emotions portrayed are subdued and undervalued in a very comfortable way. The plot is quite excruciating with a starring role that has a terminal illness (this is not a spoiler and was set quite early in the film) The method of execution is somewhat unique in most of the love stories you ever have seen - not even a kiss was exchanged and yet you will feel the enormous current of love between the two protagonists. Initially, I thought that this "restriction of emotions" was something analogous to the typical "oriental values", but later I decided not to do it. <br /> <br /> This film is so subdued that if you compare it to films like "Cinema" Paradiso, CP would have felt openly manipulated by comparison, so it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. > <br /> After watching the film, I have the strong feeling that Hollywood loves movies, (or you love movies in all, to be precise) that have exalted romance or passion and label it as "love". I'm sure we all have our own definitions and I would not say that these qualities are mutually exclusive, but let me say that the film will ask you if there is an additional dimension you have with your loved one. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that I really like this film, considering the fact that the film is so simple in appearance, it is paradoxically one of the most "cinematic" films I've seen lately.
