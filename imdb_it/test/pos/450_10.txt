Most people will consider that the greatest interpretation of Yul Brynner was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. He certainly gave him a great variety of moods to test his abilities, from the comic to the tragic, from eager to learning to dominate to hatred. He also showed him as a "talk singer" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his Broadway-winning Tony Award performance, the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance. <br /> <br /> But he made other films that showed his talents and I RE E I. His comical ride in STILL MORE WITH FEEL was pretty good. So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA, or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet he came terribly close to being a successor to Eric Von Stroheim's 50s as "the man you love to hate". A certain vulnerability in his acting and in his roles made him dear to the cinema audience, even after his best years as a star were behind him - and he retired more and more to repeat the King of Siam on television and on stage . <br /> <For me, his best performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, EG Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film is set in rather modern times - the dust that was Hungary in 1956, when in a short time it seemed that the iron curtain was about to collapse under the reforms of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian revolution collapsed due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies have sent tanks to crush the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West stood still and let this happen: England and France had been trapped in the Suez crisis, and the United States had scolded them and Israel for attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three close US allies, the West has found it difficult to condemn the excessive use of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation, and the Hungarians never forgot how they were abandoned. <br /> <br /> In the film Brynner is Major Surov, a Russian intelligence officer who is watching some of the Hungarian uprising leaders, one of whom is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes could receive assistance from some Westerners on a bus tour through Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Kerr). The latter are kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired, and Brynner gets confused with them, hoping for a clue as to where the Robards are. But Brynner is human - he tries to ingratiate himself with these people (who all see him as a monster), and in sequence, when he has drunk a little too much, he confronts the questions that have bothered historians since 1945: How is it possible ( even if we note that Russia had Stalin in office) that relations between Russia and the West have collapsed so quickly? The allies, on the whole, had worked well together from 1941 to 1945, but all suspicions broke out after Yalta and Potsdam. They had to? Surov is a good officer, but is divided in half by the loyalty to communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports, and by his growing sympathy for Kerr, who is hiding Robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the Russian major. And as the film reaches its tragic climax, we see Surov having to decide whether to follow his sense of duty, or have pity on Kerr, Robards and the other Westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real struggle for him - and one that can win too late. It was a great film about a tragedy of post-war Europe and perhaps the most considerate role that Yul Brynner has ever played.
