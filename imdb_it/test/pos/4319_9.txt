"Live Together, Die Alone" is divided into three main lines, and each of them alone would have been sufficient for a great episode. So when you put them all together, you have a great episode ^ 3. It was a brave move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had appeared in only 3 episodes until then, but it worked: the his backstory is absolutely fascinating to look at, both informative about the island's past and the Swan station itself and honestly moving. Desmond and Penny seem to be magically connected to each other, even when they are on opposite sides of the world, and both characters are beautifully recited (it's hard not to cry when Desmond reads Penny's letter). The action inside the hatch is at the edge of your seat, since Locke is determined not to allow the button to be pushed again, convinced that it was only a psychological experiment, Desmond gradually realizes the consequences of this decision, and Eko is locked out and desperately tries to return. The dissolution of the clock and "I was wrong wrong" by Locke are unforgettable moments. The external action sees Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley captured by the Others because of Michael's betrayal (after making a bewildering discovery related to the Pearl), and the return of "Henry Gale" as the leader of the Others. Even the less important plot, Sayid, Jin and Sun who sail to the beach where the others are presumably camping, contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show, the giant statue that is almost completely missing except for one foot with four fingers . In short: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + suspense + the threat of annihilation + a ray of hope = a classic episode of LOST. *** 1/2 on 4.
