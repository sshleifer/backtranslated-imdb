Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us cinema classics like: The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf nazis Must Die, decided long ago to adapt the famous Shakespeare play, "Romeo and Juliet ". This adaptation has decided to revive the story by adding vicious sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, piercings and incest, managing to create a bizarre but hilarious movie. Whoever enters a Troma production should know what to expect, and this is an irreverent and perverse comedy with a lot of political incorrectness. Expect a lot of hints to other Troma movies and a lot of reused gags (flipping the machines and crushing the heads). Many might think that it looks like a total shit that only morons could find amusing ... they might be right, but at the same time they might need to lighten and enjoy the madness and intelligence that is Tromeo and Juliet. > <br /> With an exceptional cast, an entertaining script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), an editing soundtrack and a lot of great visual gags, Kaufman once again managed to flip what's right and cash in all . Grab some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, a Shakespeare adaptation with lots of balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
