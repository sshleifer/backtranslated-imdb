I don't know what this film means, the charisma of the two protagonists, their chemistry on the screen, the chance to see the son of Matthau's real life (you can't miss it) or the performance of Art Carney, but I like it. I've seen it a couple of times and I never tire of looking at it again. Rent and enjoy.
