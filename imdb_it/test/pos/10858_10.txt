I think Andrew Davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book that emulated the rhythm and style of a Victorian novel and turned it into a moving and fun movie. I'm glad to have read (twice) before the book which is usually my case. I know you have to see a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly. But despite this, it is often difficult to read the original material after a film gives the best parts. <br /> <br /> I realize that Davies is a great adapter, but I would like the producers to have chosen a woman to write the script. Davies, as he admits in the commentary accompanying the film on DVD, wanted in particular to emphasize the more scatological parts of the book. I certainly liked those, on the film as in the book. But Davies missed half a dozen moments so terribly painful and painful that he could incorporate it if his sensitivity were more feminine. <br /> <br /> It would also be a problem with his use of the primary symbol of the book, the rose. <br /> <br /> As the script was written by Davies, the result was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think that the last comment of the author of Waters to the symbol of the rose was much more interesting. And I preferred the novel to allow Nan to "come of age" compared to how she chose Davies. <br /> <br /> A quick comment on the four actors who deal with the main roles. They are all wonderfully talented - well, except for singing and dancing, perhaps - and, moreover, their physical presence is so much what the mind's eye sees when they read the novel before seeing the film. I thought they were all fantastic. <br /> <br /> I recommend that every lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction, add BOTH the book and the TIPPING THE VELVET DVD to their shelves.
