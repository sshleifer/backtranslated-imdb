I watch a lot of vampire movies. I KNOW vampire movies. Hammer movies have always been my favorites. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from beginning to end. The dubbing is not great, but I also like the Godzilla films, so I'm used to badly dubbed films. Anyway, I really liked this movie. SFXs are fantastic. Although the part of Jackie Chan in the film has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the film, it's fun. Fang's work is excellent. Acting isn't great, but it could have something to do with bad dubbing. Perhaps the current language would sound better with the film if I could understand it. I'm sure the movie Gone With The Wind sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own this movie on DVD and I wouldn't do it. I sat in my library next to my Hammer Films DVDs.
