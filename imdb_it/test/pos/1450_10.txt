I'm fifteen and I've seen thirty-three Sinatra films (not counting videos from TV shows and documentaries) and I haven't been impressed by just two of them. "Till the Clouds Roll By" and "The Miracle of the Bells" do not count, however, considering that in the first thing he does is sing a magnificent "Ol 'Man River", and in the latter it is not half bad: only the image is pathetic. My favorite records, radio programs, TV shows and movies on Sinatra change pretty much every day - everything takes on a different connotation to every vision and occasionally seems like the best thing I've ever done and occasionally the worst until the cycle returns, but there are a couple of things that go beyond the comparison. When we talk about the film, "The Man with the Golden Arm" is at the top of this list. Everyone who knows something about Sinatra knows that he thought it was his best-ever acted, was nominated for an Oscar, is was the first serious look at drug addiction, etc. The jazz soundtrack is unforgettable, Kim Novak is nice despite a ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and too dramatic, the turtle. as Arnold Stang is funny the fi The first time, but more embarrassing every time, and Darren McGavin is a wonderfully slimy drug dealer, the sets don't convince - at first glance it looks like a strange mixed bag mixed by the great Otto Preminger with a decentralized charm. <br /> <br /> Then come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life - different from music - his acting relationships are always divided in half. Directors such as Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger, all agreeing that Sinatra had worked so much on his films and on singing, would have been among the greatest actors in the world - if not the greatest. Humphrey Bogart also said, "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a man who never took an acting class in his life, he was at the same time producing the discography that would make him "the greatest singer of the 20th century", and he did almost all of his scenes in one shot only. <br /> <br /> In direct conflict with all of this there are those other reviews and biographies that haughtily sniff what this Mr. Sinatra was, and how many "bad" movies he did. The question will never be answered for everyone's satisfaction because the controversies were among Sinatra's greatest resources, and both arguments in a sense were playing in his hand. In any case, right now, in this role, Sinatra is magnificent. A reviewer said in the late fifties: "Sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but there is no one more fascinating to watch". No matter what Sinatra is doing in a movie, it's hard to look away from him. This, of course, is a "charisma" that I've only seen in a handful of other people: Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, perhaps James Cagney. There is no real definition for this and it often makes it difficult to understand if you're really enjoying a performance or just spell, but that quality on display here is what makes the movie. Sinatra is decidedly compelling, real, intense - it transcends decades and thousands of pops of paper dolls with something called quality. Like it or not, this is a one-man show with some actors of characters that run in the background. It covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety, from sweet and solitary tenderness with Kim Novak to the terrifying shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!) Who whines and screams in the agony of "cold turkey". Sinatra was right: this is his best interpretation. No question. <br /> <br /> I was eight when Frank Sinatra died. I wasn't around all the years of bobby-soxer and 'Anchors Aweigh', 'Ava Gardner and' From Here to Eternity ', album with lampposts and' swingin 'lovers, "Kennedy, Vegas, ring-a- ding ding Basie and Mia and Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden in South Africa to the White House at the Sands I can't say I like Sinatra because I heard it at Paramount or because I listened to "September of My Years" in an autobiographical way , the usual excuses. And my excuse? When I was eleven I saw a movie called "On the Town" ...
