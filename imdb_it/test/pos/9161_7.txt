Well, the film is basically about the last days of a specific Russian regiment stationed in Afghansitan, before the main troops retired in 1985. The film accurately portrays the sad realities of the Russian army that made it infamous: "dedovshina" ( officers and non-commissioned officers physically harass, beat and humiliate young recruits), mixed war (you can exchange a day with your enemy and kill him the next day), the lives of women on the front lines, documentary films of helicopter attacks and the coffins that are welded and sent home in C-130 Hercules class Russian cargo planes with jam tracer Stinger missiles, fatigue, boredom, anti-war sentiment, emotional side simply put. There are some action scenes, but they are badly done and often illogical, like Major Bandura's suicidal walk and turning his back on the 10-year-old boy armed with AK-47, the father he just killed. Also the fact that in the midst of a gunfight in the mountains the heavy grenade launcher explodes out of nowhere (and any semi-submerged person knows that it is practically impossible to launch a 40-50 ln launcher into anyone's march). But at the same time the films show that war is a dirty business, where murder is sometimes justified, unbridled destruction of entire villages for little or no reason is normal, indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage inevitable during the war ... for the thought of why the Afghan war was lost. It is not the best war movie made, but it is deep and intelligent enough to deserve to be watched.
