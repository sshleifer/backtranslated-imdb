This is a great movie! It's fun for everyone, even for adults. We have Jason Voorhees / Leatherface as a murderer in this, along with other wacky characters. Very entertaining film for children of all ages. It must be rented every time we went to the video store! Buster and Babs make a nice couple and have to love the duck. Probably my favorite character! I've never been great on the TV show, but this film only brings back so many good memories. Must see for families, show business fans, or anyone! Funny, no matter how small or old you are! BOOK NOW IN YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE! <br /> <br /> P.S. NEEDS A DVD RELEASE!
