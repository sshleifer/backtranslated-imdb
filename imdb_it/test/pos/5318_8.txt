This must be one of the most powerful messaging movies I've seen lately, it was absolutely flawless to the end, surprisingly original and inspiring. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very very powerful. This is a boy who kills his late ex-girlfriend's younger brother, and while being sent to a juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks, he gets a hold on a story and does not let himself go until the end. The murder commits the course of life of every member of his family and of the family of the dead, and while you observe and understand that everyone has his story and his dark side, you appreciate this film even more, it's a tour de force , because those actions cannot be described by simple words. His reason for committing a murder is left incomplete, and makes the spectators think. Acting was practically flawless, and the cast was very beautiful, containing many familiar faces. If you like films that seem stimulating and make you think (eg 'Donnie Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.'), then 'The United States of Leland' is an excellent choice for you, otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you're in the mood to provoke a provocative film. <br /> <br /> 10/10
