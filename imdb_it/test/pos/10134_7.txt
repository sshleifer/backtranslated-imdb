Not much, but a validation of the values ​​of small towns and the embrace of a mentally challenged young man in his heart. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and was surprised by some of the hostilities it generated. I heard that Cuba Gooding managed the part with dignity and respect, unlike the stupid image of Sean Penn in "I'm Sam". <br /> <br /> The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more moving. Sports are taken seriously in the small American high school town (and in other cases, I suspect) and I felt that the representation of these competitive students who opened their hearts to a less fortunate person sounded real, at least to me. <br /> <br /> the coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and the radio, but rather he kindly came to the decision alone under the loving and open ways of Radio. Very well done to everyone. 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more than you in the photos!
