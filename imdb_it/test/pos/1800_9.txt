This is a good movie that is imperfect in many ways with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only had $ 350,000 to work with. This is a movie I loved growing up in the Midwest. I remember that my friends and I had a nostalgic trip to this film 10 years ago. Great things about this movie .... Big cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Negative points of this film .... A small budget that requires too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had more time and money in this film, the results would have been even better. They should have taken the story from an early 1920s perspective and not from a 15-17 year high school perspective. Most of the actors / actresses were in the early 1920s trying to play between 15 and 17. .... (up) The music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks are played all the time in my car. The best scenes in this film take place in squalid Hollywood clubs by the character of Nicolas Cage. I gave this film a high grade of 9/10 for five reasons. Nicholas Cage's improvisation on the spot; The work and camera angles are excellent given the budget they had and only able to have a shot of every scene; The sytles, the music and the jargon are captured perfectly and forever; Once again the music is incredible and carries the story from one scene to another; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could transform a weak screenplay, unknown actors and a very low budget and 20 days of filming the entire film in such a beautiful and memorable film is stunning!
