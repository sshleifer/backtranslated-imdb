I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years ago in high school. I thought it was a stimulating film that made you want to examine the power behind puzzles. I think the kind of people who wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things, or those who get frustrated when they can't solve puzzles. It's a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. so if you want a real record of the things happening in the alleys there, watch this movie. And for those who only watch films to highlight holes in the plot and defects of character, realize that in real life, the same thing always happens. but that's all I want to say about this. The riddles are good, some are difficult, others are not. But the film leaves you even more, more puzzles, more explanations, simply, more. Something more I want to add is that the ideas in this film, the world of the underground enigma, exist, but there is much more. To find it, you can't look for it. Never look for it, it wouldn't be the way to find it. Leave your mark and it will find you.
