I had borrowed Sarah's three films from a friend and watched them while I was sick in bed during a weekend. I really enjoyed each of them. I liked how the last film gave an idea of ​​how Caleb and his sister were like when they grew up. Also, I liked the carry-through of the song "Billy-boy" which was heard for the first time during the credits of the first film, the title "Sarah, Plain and Tall". However, the only thing I didn't like about Winter End was the younger daughter. She was a very pretty girl, but she had only too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to other children, even compared to Caleb talkative but still good-natured when he was younger.
