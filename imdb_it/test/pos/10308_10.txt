Regardless of the accuracy of the facts, Bandit Queen is a true story, it is true because the themes they deal with hold as much truth today as they were back in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and inspiring. The protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood, whose adversities have brought out the best (or worst) from her. Keeping subjectivity aside, there is no doubt that Phoolan's character from a young 8-year-old girl, married to her father to cancel a debt (pun intended), to a gang leader who becomes a leader of the lower caste has evolved into a full-fledged champion. His interpretation is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre. <br /> <br /> I can understand if the western public is not able to appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen must be "studied" in the Indian context, and not just verified in the stereotypes. I might not be able to sell it for its universal appeal, but it's certainly a must for the Indian public, it's a shame that the film has had a delayed and openly censored release in India. <br /> <br /> Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought two odds in India, being a woman and also a lower caste, her rebellious nature and the inability to surrender caused her more experiences horrible of life, which has continued to strengthen it in a self proclaimed goddess. He responded to violence with violence and fantasy became the submissive woman that society wanted it to be. Call it divine justice or judicial failure, if he killed one person he would be hanged, killed 24 and revered, respected and glorified. <br /> <br /> PS # Anyone who has found his "psychotic" character needs to be sodomized at age 8, wrapped by 10 men at once and paraded naked. So they should be asked- How do they feel normal?
