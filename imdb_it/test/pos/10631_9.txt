As with all Haneke films, make your decision - do not let yourself be influenced by what you read and if you are interested in someone who uses the medium of the film for their exclusive purposes, do it yourself. Isabelle Huppert is extraordinary in this film - combined with Haneke, these two never throw their fists. Haneke attracts us with the call of the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but this is an antiromio as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You will have to force yourself to look at a lot of it and the catharsis is much more in the field of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release, but it is incredibly nervous and stimulating; Haneke continues to hold a mirror on how desensitized Western civilization is or has become. People can turn up their noses, but they're just taking what Solondz has done in Happiness a few steps away. Although rooted in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be seen as an emotional metaphor. I don't recommend it, but I don't want to dissuade you either ... it definitely divides people, but since it's largely repressive - it's no surprise.
