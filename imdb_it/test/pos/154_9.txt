No pun intended. I'm not going to ruin anything in the story, but it's safe to assume you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays. And obviously being a priest while being "bad" exaggerates all this. Furthermore, this is Park Chan Wook's most erotic film. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Wook's previous films / works, you know it's very visual (in a good way) and show it again here. While moving away from the theme of revenge of his previous films on the surface, he still has some warmth hidden beneath. And when this boils, some bad things start to happen. But through all that is dark, there are also moments of light (fun). A very stylistic and provocative film that lives outside the mainstream and does a great job ...
