I was pleasantly surprised to find this film as a preview in my local theater. <br /> <br /> We have all seen this plot before (Top Gun, GI Jane, An officer and a gentleman) but a good script still works. This story is basically about training a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side lines. Kevin Costner plays a leader of the highly successful rescue team, Ben Randall, who is forced to lead the training team after a difficult mission. The film takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of the character of Costner and Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I'm happy to say that Ashton is great in this part. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this film and you will probably understand what will happen long before it arrives. However, the use of humor, the exploration of the harshness of training and the fun of watching Ben Randall "do his coaching" kept me pinned down and entertained. I really like watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh, rattle here and there and clap at the end as a tribute to the film. <br /> <br /> We all had fun (despite a couple of difficult moments in the film) and, I think, you will too.
