Wallace and Gromit have been around for some time, but this was their first big screen foray. Fans of British TV series, like me, were eager to see them and the film did quite well in theaters. Much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original. In a world of CG movies like SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion film is a nice alternative to fashion in children's movies as well as being totally different from a cartoon. Furthermore, compared to previous stop-motion films (such as KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen as SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters are better light years - very fluid, natural and more alive. <Br /> <br /> In addition to the quality of the animation, this film also deserves compliments at all other levels. First of all, the voice actors do a great job. Secondly, the script is very simple but also very pretty and fun - with a few double meanings that should probably go beyond the children's heads. Third, they manage to make this not just a film for children, but people of all ages because the film is neither sloppy nor aimed exclusively at the younger audience. In particular, I was fascinated by the fact that the film was incredibly cute - and especially the adorable bunnies. I particularly liked the credits - which made me very happy to have been watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that, unless you're a real stick in the mud, you will appreciate this movie. It's cool, fun and incredibly smart. I hope to see a sequel - and this is saying something, since I usually hate sequels.
