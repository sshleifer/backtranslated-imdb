The character of Ali G works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a film it doesn't work the same way. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - this is a very funny film, full of pungent and witty dialogues, which wonderfully load the modern British chav, providing the viewer with an exhilarating, if not realistic, story. <br /> <br /> A problem with this film is that the script and the content are both fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. When I say embarrassing, I don't mean embarrassing fun at the Office or Extra, but rather, you'll want them not to have it included in the final cut. An example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film is finished, with the notes of "Here's how we do it". Every time I watch the movie, I interrupt the DVD when it says the end, and I let it go. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a good movie, it is worth looking at it a couple of times. The script is fun to a certain extent and there are no problems with acting. However, the key word is refinement. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better television program. Borat is a better film.
