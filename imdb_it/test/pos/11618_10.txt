I finally saw this shocking movie last night, and what a disturbing idea there is, and incredibly bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses. It looks like a movie from the minds of Lynch (in particular ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit and even a bit of "Begotten". What this guy does to his pregnant sister is incredible, but then again, it really happened or it's the left and right side of his fighting brain. This is the main theme of this work of art, to trace a thin line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes surpassed the reasoning and the logical left side. And the music of this film is incredible, a sort of absolutely perfect electronic score. Although this film is totally shocking and rather disgusting in some of the more extreme scenes (including hard core sex) that you will see in any movie, I saw it as a work of art and I loved it. And that music still amazes me, I have to try to find the soundtrack, if available. Watching "Subconscious Cruelty" is a real event, and not something the viewer will easily forget. And a note for the gorehounds, this is a must. <br /> <br /> Attention ... Be careful to buy this film, because some prints have tarnished on the scenes of graphic sex and extreme gore, in particular the copies from the Japanese Release
