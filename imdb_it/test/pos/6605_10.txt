Dogtown and Z-Boys Summary: Dogtown and Z-boys are a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), California, as we know it today. With their essential style, they embarked on a journey influenced by Larry Bertlemen that would lead to countless successes and a couple of failures. After the Dogtown articles were published in a reinstated Skateboarder magazine, the sport was renewed and members of the Zephyr skateboarding team forgot about Jeff Ho and tried to spend the summer holidays for the rest of their lives by joining other teams of skateboards that could afford to pay them as movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard Team put together by Jeff Ho (owner Zephyr Surfshop) and Craig Stecyk (photographer) included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki ( women only), Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All original members, with the exception of Jay Adams and Chris Cahill, are still fine and surfing / skating. Jay Adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time with drug-related charges. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes of this documentary are a kind of read-between-the-line, but if there were a clear cut issue it would be that even children could trigger revolutions. Other topics could include extensive parties in the past that could lead to an unsatisfactory future and, by planning and paying attention to one's resources, a very rewarding future may be at hand. <br /> <br /> Other works: Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries she has written, produced or directed. Most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigade and Lords of Dogtown. He has also made films with the theme of growing up as a teenager in America, films like: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America, and The 70s: The Decade that Changed Television. <br /> <br /> Subjects: The subjects of Dogtown and Z-boys are the original members of the Zephyr Skateboard Team excluding Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in the interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up in the 70s by reading Dogtown articles and skateboarding enthusiasts. Dogtown area skaters, but not of the team, were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the subjects who spoke so that the audience could see who was talking and get an idea of ​​the character, but it would have been immediately inserted into the archive footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could better explain the emotions of the subjects, like when the unfortunate life of Jay Adams was a topic of conversation, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator of the film and explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the moment the Zephyr surf team was composed, to the creation of the skateboard team, to all the Z-boys who left the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way. The films of the subjects they were talking about were all in black and white and all the archive footage of the Z-Boys browsing or skating were in color. Obviously the movie from the 70s was grainy, but this only improved the film. Respondents were mostly shot in the same area where they appear, but everyone was out. The whole movie was very well controlled, even the archive footage I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Wither" - Made by Aerosmith "Toys in the Attic" - Made by Aerosmith "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper "One Way Out" - Made by The Allman Brothers "Lollipops and Roses "and" Whipped Cream "- performed by Herb Alpert" Into the Void "and" Paranoid "- starring Black Sabbath" Godzilla "- Blue Oyster Cult" Aladdin Sane "and" Rebel Rebel "- David Bowie" Fastcars "- The Buzzcocks "Gut Feeling" - I Must "Give You Money" - Peter Frampton "Funk 49" - James Gang "Ezy Rider" and "Foxy Lady" and "Freedom" and "Bold as Love" - ​​Jimi Hendrix " Sidewalk Surfing "Jan and Dean" Achilles Last Stand "and" Hot on for Nowhere "- Led Zeppelin" Six Underground "- The Sneaker Pimps" Surfrider "- The fantastic" Cat Scratch Fever "and" Motor City Madhouse "and" Wang Dang "Sweet Poontang- Ted Nugent" Us and Them "- Pink Floyd" Bad Boys "- The pretendants" Maggie May "- Rod Stewart" I Wanna be Your Dog "and" Gimme Danger "- The Stooges" Children of the Revolution " - T-Rex "Bad Reputa tion" - Thin Lizzy "Disco Inferno" - The Tramps "Hannah" - Rob Trower "Rocky Mountain Way" - Joe Walsh "Old Man" - Neil Young "La Grange" - ZZ Top > <br /> The music in the film make the film. Each of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that otherwise would not have been called to mind.
