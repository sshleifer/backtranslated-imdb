Even after all these years, this remains "a perfect movie" for me. I still remember sitting in the theater for a long time after he was finished, stunned by the experience, overwhelmed by emotion. I own the DVD (of course!) It's seeing at least once a year. It is incomparable and I cannot add much to have already written about its excellence and beauty. So happy that others love him as much as I do! One note: the author of the book on which he is based - Michael Ondatje - was enchanted by the film and said he would have liked to have thought of some of the adorable scenes written exclusively for the film ... the way Kip "invites" Hana by his side with a trail of small candles and the way he organizes Hana to see the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.
