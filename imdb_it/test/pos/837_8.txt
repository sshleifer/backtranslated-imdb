After finishing the Zero Woman series, I couldn't wait to see the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; both based on Tooru Shinohara comics. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see them in order, as this is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> Start great while The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) is running away from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to make her a cuff, but she cut off her arm and got away with it. If this is not bad enough, later a dog digs his arm and is seen trotting along the street before finding a place to enjoy his treatment. <br /> <br /> Scorpion could also return to prison as life is not a picnic outside. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn't put her out; and then the gang leader takes it when he gets rid of Tanida. But, they don't hold her back long before she escapes and seeks revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon they will fall like flies. Some certainly deserved it by wearing flamboyant clothes with shirt collars so large that they reached to the shoulder. The lady (Reisen Lee) turns to avoid being killed. <br /> <br /> The police arrive at his last kill and traps her in the sewer. She has been there for a week and the cops discover that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has provided her with food. (The story of O Yuki (Watanabe) and his brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but only secondary to the film.) They try to burn it, but this is The Scorpion, and she has unfinished business. > <br /> It is not the usual mix of sex and violence, this is a slow story that is beautiful everywhere.
