While watching "Wirey Spindell" I couldn't laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey certainly had a lot of acting from boys and women, but I was confused as to why the actor who played Wirey in H.S. he was 10 years old. Then the actor changed his age up to 20 years to play Wirey when he was a senior in HS ... but anyway, I thought it was funny.
