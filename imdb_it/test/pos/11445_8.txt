"Night of the Demons" by Kevin Tenney is a horror movie that reminds me a bit of "The Evil Dead". In Hallowen night, a group of teenagers organize a party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of the city. Led by Angela, they perform a sheriff's ceremony and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that populate the place. One by one, the uninvited evil force owns teenagers, turning them into bloodthirsty demons. "Night of the Demons" is a perfect film horror. It is scary, bloody and rather atmospheric. The characters are well developed and Steve Johnson's blood is pretty good. There is a macabre impaling, a tongue that is bitten, the fingers pushed into the eye sockets, etc. , where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) sticks a tube of lipstick through the nipple is a real blast. Take a look. Followed by two sequels.
