The talents of Abbott and Costello shine in the happily childish version of "Jack and the Beanstalk". The use of tone and sepia color, music and choreography, singing and dancing, the crossing of players from one role to another, as well as various other aspects of this very beautiful film make it obvious that the techniques and the styles used for "The Wizard of Oz" have been played here. And this works well for our intrepid duo. There are some other things that make this movie a gift for me ... Buddy Baer's, Uncle Max's Jr. "The Beverly Hillbillies", appearance as a policeman and giant. Pat Costello, Lou's brother, having been involved in writing the script. These things help make this movie fun. However, it has the negative side. I think the choreography is badly done. But the nice melodies and the accompanying voices help to diminish the rather sloppy dance numbers. To be precise, some of the players, the couple in love (prince and princess), are not very good at their trade. But these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise pleasantly pleasant walk along the yellow brick ... er, I mean ... climb the magic bean.
