This event defined an age of wrestling entertainment that, I believe, is not equaled today. The colorful characters - with their stereotyped clothing - have brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by the company and overexposed. Wrestling had a little innocence then. A child could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer. <br /> <br /> Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), even though I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I liked Warrior a lot because of his mystique. Hogan was the brand hero who created an impressive public image. The Ultimate Warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man of few words - a hero out of the limelight for a different audience. <br /> <br /> This rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this duality in me that is given over to every fighter. I had a place for both. Because there was also bloodshed in this long and heavy battle, the stakes were high, at least for me as a child. On a similar note, due to Hogan's defeat, this made him more human - I remember feeling sorry for him. <br /> <br /> All these emotions at stake in the youth soap opera have made Wrestlemania VI such an excellent time to witness this game.
