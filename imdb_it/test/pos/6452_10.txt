City Streets is incredibly modern technically speaking of a film made in 1931. Even those who couldn't be hypnotized, fascinated by the powerful magnetism of Gary Cooper, galvanized the attention of the public. The plot is quite elaborate and clear. The scenarios, the furnishings, are exceptional in every detail. All the actors are above average. I keep guessing how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could have been so brilliant. I couldn't find a flaw, realizing that the scenes on the road (bumpy ride) with the big screen of moving images in the background was the best they could get in 1931. All in all, I found this film superb and so alive thanks to the charisma by Gary Cooper.
