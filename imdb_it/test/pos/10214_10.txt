Featuring extraordinary and wonderful characters, a new mythology, superbly designed and executed sets, Nightbreed is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the lack of a well-known leading actor led to the darkness of the film. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps the director's homosexuality also led the film to be inadvertently censored by the film's white audience. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless the film is a treasure of the monster movie / superhero genre. <br /> <br /> A sequel with Highlander style flashbacks at different times in history would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Another idea would be the basis of the new Midian. Perhaps in Texas somewhere or in the swamps of Louisiana with crocodile men and a bizarre circus on the road.
