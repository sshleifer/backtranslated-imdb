Eve opens her eyes, because of the great scenery and the music without music in the backgrounds, we hear. This film shows a good aspect of the fact that the human body is the creation of God and, looking at it well, viewers can gain greater respect on the legendary story of Adam and Eve (whether it is true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe in) from watching this movie. Actress / model Egertoft's imitation of Eva is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and I can't imagine having another actress like Eva. This film for me is really useful for the kind of stress relief therapy. We never felt so calm before watching this movie. This film is a masterpiece, God wanted this film to be made in the first place! <br /> <br /> Razbin!
