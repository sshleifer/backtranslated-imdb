He just went to YouTube and finally saw this Oscar-nominated animated short directed by Richard Condie. Previously I had seen his funny Getting Started there. In this, a couple plays Scrabble. The wife continues to shake her eyes while her husband has nothing but E on his side. The wife leaves the vacuum cleaner in her bed and bathtub for a while (!) Before taking her husband by her side. Shortly before this, the husband captures a TV show called "Sawing for Teens" with the stars that see something and the husband who gets his saw. That program is interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war (the journalist is a skeleton here) while everyone panics outside while her husband falls asleep during this period and thinks a parade is happening while he and his wife continue fighting over the game ... There are a lot of other bizarre things going on before the final touching arrives. Funny enough and worth seeing for any animation fan out there. I can't wait to see more Mr. Condie animated short films ...
