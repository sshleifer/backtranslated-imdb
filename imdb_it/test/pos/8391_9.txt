While I completely agree with drvn below about Mary McCormack doing a lot of milk on TV, the rest of the show is fantastic! Phil Hartman was a great teacher, teaching celebrities the details. Foley is crazy, but in a good way. You never know which self-destructive humor will hit you later. As for the game, it's fun, full of jokes, and great for any beginner who might also have an interest in the game. Too bad it's not active anymore :( I just checked the program until August and it doesn't seem to be programmed for any time in the future Bravo Bravo! You deserve a beating!
