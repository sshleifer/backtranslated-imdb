The crazy race of Scottish warriors, stuck in the depths of space, poor in food and without budget, started ten hours up to three, which will help these men to seize, with visual effects that suck, but I liked the strange fact, if I met one then I would have run away, but not if I had Scottish mates, we would have sworn and avoided that fate, so in the end it wasn't ruined, it was a DVD I'm glad I watched but if they ever make a sequel, they download some actors, not all were equal, some were good, with feisty acting, some were wooden, and perhaps they had to compress it, but the action kept me looking at everything, shooting, screaming, it didn't stop, I'll tell my friends not to fear, and I will look again in another year.
