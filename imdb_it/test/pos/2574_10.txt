If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal shots of women and rape of children, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man take revenge creatively on the treasure of a wife who left him, this film has it. You have already heard the wonderful music that keeps the pure emotion. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can arrive in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is an unexpected test of a wounded person who is healed. Perhaps we who ask ourselves why we bask in the abundant profane will learn that love can be above the loins in the heart. From the pounding rhythm, follow the rhythm to the point where love is sacred.
