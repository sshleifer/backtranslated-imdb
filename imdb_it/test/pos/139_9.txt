They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer, to hide some details from the public to tickle their sense of imagination, immerse themselves in their fears and let them give life to their darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> It was not the case when I saw Bakjwi, under the American title Thirst. Now play in some theaters near you. It seems that the directors didn't want to spare you any details. There will be blood in this film and YOU will try to look away. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the review visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi .html Thanks and I hope you enjoyed reading above.
