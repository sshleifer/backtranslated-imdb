It's the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney was on a mission: to satisfy families and children around the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he created a character as big as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Two films were designed by Mr. Disney himself: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie". This review will focus on the functionality of 1928, "Steamboat Willie." <br /> <br /> Since I heard about this film as a child, I've always wanted to see this movie. Well, in 1997, I rented an old VHS that had a lot of old Disney cartoons on them, starring the Mouse !!!!! Baby mouse!!!!! And guess what? That brief was there, and I loved it !!!!! Shortly after I took the tape back, it played on the old Disney Channel (note: the "old" Disney Channel) at the beginning of a Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a great cartoon; this paved the way for Disney's bigger stuff from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, indeed !!!!!
