It is worth boning the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. Three main female deities - Sita wise, feeding Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer - as well as three main male deities - the tomb Rama, the playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender - are all cited. Knowing folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience gives a richness to the story of today's history. In fact, a fairy tale is staged for the first time on stage, as part of a spirituality lesson, and then in the "real life" of the film. "Fire" speaks against misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native, and does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of viewer's awareness, making it a deeply satisfying presentation. This is the best movie I've seen in the last ten years; very highly recommended!
