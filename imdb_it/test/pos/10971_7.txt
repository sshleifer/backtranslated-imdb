This was really a pleasure to see; the dialogue was - for the most part - absolutely exceptional (I thought that the roles of women were a little better written, which is a nice surprise). Even the performances were uniformly very good. Frank Gorshin exaggerates a little when he goes into his various disadvantages, but it could be his overcompensation for what I see as weakness in the way the character is written; it is VERY good otherwise. Harry Groener does equally well with a slightly underwritten (Tony) character, slightly exaggerating some of the character's most angry scenes. Ursula Burton is excellent as Sister Theresa, really bringing the film through some of her weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a bit underutilized here, although I enjoyed their work as always. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I couldn't help thinking that Grant reminded me a little of Catherine O'Hara here); Cloris Leachman has rather tears in his role, with reasonably good results. <br /> <br /> I'd like there to have been more than one safe hand behind the camera, though. Sometimes the framing or staging seemed a little off, or embarrassing. Close-ups seemed abused (or misused) by me. And we don't always move from one scene to another as easily as we would like. Some of the "robust" approaches to the federal agent (music, costumes) were too exaggerated for me too. And the few fantasy sequences didn't really work. But there are things that have been VERY well done; the opening sequence set in Buffalo around 1970, for example. And frankly, all the scenes about Teresa's church work (I suspect the writer and the actress really appreciated the character, which helps). The scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are VERY good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably a bit excessive - there seem to be too many schemes to keep them all straight at times, and coincidences have to be a little too much. And I was a little bothered by the ending (should we really cheer for their biggest scam but be successful?), But the road race is a lot of fun. It would be nice to see more independent films like this one. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
