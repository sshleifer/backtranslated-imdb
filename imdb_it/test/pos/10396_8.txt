This is a special film if you know the context. Antonioni, 80, had suffered a stroke. Mute and half paralyzed, his friends - who by the way are the best in the world of cinema - have organized for him to "direct" one last significant film. The idea is that he can conjure up a story by simply looking at it. So we have a film: about a director who evokes stories with simple observations. And the question of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film emerges giving us the tools to bring it into being through our imagination. The result is pure world of cinema: every person (except the director) is adorable in appearance or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely and live in a dreamlike and dreamy world of sensual encounters. There is no nuance, no suggestion that something exists but what we see; no desire is at work except what we create. <br /> <br /> I don't know of other films that manipulate our visual desire so well to make us create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. No one understands Van Morrison visually like him. Morrison's Celtic spatial music is based on the same idea: the sensual touch that implies but does not touch physically. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's red wife appears, appropriately as the shopkeeper, and also directs a weak film that is on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 3 of 4: worth watching.
