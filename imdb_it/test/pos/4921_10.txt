This is a classic animated cartoon from the cartoon series! Most main characters get a lot of time on the screen as well as making extra characters! The film's focus is on the holiday of superstar characters and everyone has their own unique summer fun! It's very fun from start to finish! It has excellent colors, great music and believe it or not I saw it more than any movie. It's great and I think it's perfect!
