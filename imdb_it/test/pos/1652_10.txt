Fantastic movie! One of the best noir films ever made. Bad boys, bad girls, a robbery of jewels, a twisted morality, a kidnapping, everything is here. Jean Servais has a face that would make Bogart proud and the rest of the cast is full of character actors who seem to know that they are on something good. Grab some popcorn and have fun.
