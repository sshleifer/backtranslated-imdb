slow but smart. passes you as if you had lived it. full of thoughts that provoke art race ideas and to be cool. the thing that hit me hard were the rock n 'roll lifestyle ideas. <br /> <br /> all the performances have been improvised I will say it again ALL THE PERFORMANCE HAVE BEEN IMPROVISED as a trick, but it is not that it makes these characters real and like someone with whom you would like to hang. this is also a fantastic thing when you think about how strong the character is in this movie. right from the start in the title sequence, he immediately establishes Ben as an outcast from the way he moves through the crowd <br /> <br /> Ok breaks like this if you are a person who lives the jazz / lifestyle you will like cool rocker if you are smart and you understand the great cinema from total crap you will like it and if both could be you prefer <br /> <br /> but if none of these then you will probably think it is boring and say that it does not "a row" and write a shitty review like Ben_Cheshire
