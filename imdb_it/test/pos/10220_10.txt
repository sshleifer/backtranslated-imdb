The movie "Nightbreed" is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but there's something in this film that is more atmospheric and different than any other horror movie I've ever seen. Many horror films I saw I enjoyed watching, however, because they are based on horror, I know the stories are unreal, because they are fictitious, so I can't take them seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre in that it has a feeling of realism that I've seen in very few other horror films. <br /> <br /> The story of this film about how a man is killed and ends up living with the undead in an underground shelter in the cemetery with undead monsters is the kind of story that a person could get from a dream nightmare as a truly unique and original plot. Most of the horror films I saw are all fake, but because Nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and ingeniously directed with superb acting, especially by Craig sheffer (Aaron Boone), amazing special effects, fantastic lighting and fantastic dialogue, I found this film having a sense of depth and maturity without a silly parody of fake horror, whatever the number of other horror films. Nightbreed, in addition to being horror, contains elements of thriller, romance and action all at once. If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you watch it, since I consider it a 10/10.
