LISTENING to power in 1933, Hitler and his "National Socialist National Socialist Workers Party", which of course we all know as the Nazis, increased their grip on the country more and more over time. At the beginning of their trampled trampling of the German people, they called all the artists, journalists and directors in their Nazi headquarters, so that they could be informed of what the newly declared "Reich" ("Empire") of which They expected. <br /> <br /> WHEN the Master director of the silent Impressionist and Expressionist era of German cinema, Mr. Fritz Lang, was called to meet Herr Goebels; he listened carefully and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the office of the Propaganda Minister, Herr Lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Not even returning to his residence, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least until many years later, he remained in France and eventually emigrated to the United States of America. <br /> <br /> MR LANG went well to work in America, creating a variety of high level films that are more pleasant, solid and substantially literate for many years.In this title smörgåsbord is the lucky subject of today, WESTERN UNION (20th Century-Fox, 1941). /> TYPICALLY, a film about the Old West and Pioneer Days required both quality and quantity of casts. WESTERN UNION qualified on both requirements, we are treated with a good host of talents and a support cast that does almost every minute and each scene is a delight for our senses. <br /> <br /> INTRODUCING the poster are Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore. The others in evidence are people like John Carradine (playing not a vampire or a another scary guy, but u n doctor), Geor ge "Slim" Summerville (character veteran, Silent Film veteran and Keystone comedy graduate of Mack Sennett), Chill Wills (always supporter and former singer of "The Avalon Boys") and the robust villain Barton MacLane . Added to this mix, we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard's brother). <br /> <br /> PROMINENT in those American Indians present are: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. Furthermore, a great representative of the North American Aborigines is that great, singularly impressive and memorable example of Red Man, Louisiana Native, Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera DeCorti of Sicilian immigrant parents). <br /> <br /> The shots of the beautiful outdoor scenes were made on site in Arizona and Utah and made available in the highest grade of Technigolour available. (There is no Monument Valley, but then, this is Mr. John Ford's province.) In some ways this film is a much more surprising realization than we might think; because it took a sort of history of the pulp magazine, adapted to the tastes and idioms of the pre-war America of the late thirties and early forties. All this was done by a German born director who had been to Hollywood and America only for the shortest possible time. <br /> <br /> in his final analysis, WESTERN UNION, while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the Western genre; we simply don't care about scoring in all the categories necessary for a fantastic movie night! SO, who really cares about small details like "accuracy"? <br /> <br /> Let's give Mr. Lang and 20th Century-Fox a rating of ****! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We have just seen a special on the PBS WTTW station, here in Chicago all that concerned all the film actors, directors and other craftsmen that the Nazis came to power to take refuge in America and Hollywood. (It seems that film people and scientists were the biggest export for Germany at this particular time, as the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future people of NASA, came from Europe right now ). <br /> <br /> POOL SCHNITZ !!
