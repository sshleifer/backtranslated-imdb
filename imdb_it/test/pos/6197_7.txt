If you look at this series, you will receive 10 interesting chapters on the history of a sleeping cell and each character. And more intense with an FBI infiltrator. <br /> <br /> Beautiful story, good characters and acting, but something is wrong (for me, of course). The final is wrong. You wait for ten chapters hoping for a great final (it doesn't matter if they meet your goals or not) but ... well ... I think it's not enough. It's a small final for a great series. I was also hoping for more definitions on character stories. <br /> <br /> But again, it's an interesting miniseries. If you don't want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), look at it. Do 7 of 10.
