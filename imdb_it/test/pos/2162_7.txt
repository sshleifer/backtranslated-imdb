Here is a lesser-known 1950s sci-fi with a slightly different twist. A son of atomic researchers is kidnapped and detained to obtain a ransom from the atomic secrets of the Father. <br /> <br /> This science fiction atomic thriller is closely connected with large production values ​​and above-average acting, even as a child. The Atomic City actually has a cinematic appearance unlike many other science fiction 50s of this period, which came out more like an episode of a television program. <br /> <br /> The Atomic City was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay - how many other 50 years of science fiction can boast an Oscar nomination? <br /> <br /> Great pace, narrow direction and some superb shooting on location in the "real" Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico, it's worth it. Collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes an excellent dual function with the Atomic Man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
