This is the best three-dimensional experience that Disney has in their projects. This is certainly better than their original acid travel movie from the 60s that was in place, it's better than "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" (and much more fun), barely squeak from the 3-D movie of MuppetVision on Disney -MGM and can even beat the captain EO 3-D "Movie Experience". This film relives some of Disney's greatest musical hits of Aladdin, La Sirenetta and others, and brought me a smile in the face for the whole show. This is also a film totally for children, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"
