THE ASCESA by Larisa Shepitko (1976) is an extraordinary and exhausting account of the partisans' struggle against the Nazis in the German-occupied Belarus, The Ascent reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but in an unusual way both are steeped of religious symbolism and ready to recognize the existence of the less than great Russian collaborator. The real battle is not with the Nazis, who roam in the background as mere extras, but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his unbeaten death. With its numerous references to the Crucifixion, history takes on heroic proportions that glorify the suffering of the martyr and his influence on future generations. A remarkable job.
