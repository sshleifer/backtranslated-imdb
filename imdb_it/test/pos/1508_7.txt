The one who says that Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splatter is probably crazy. The Italian director is a legend among hardcore-horror fans, and his work overcomes the barriers of the genre (who can forget his western, crime or fantasy flicks). This is probably his best film, and unfortunately the last one. A horror director (Fulci like him) starts having hallucinations on gruesome murders. He goes to a psychiatrist, who makes him believe he's a criminal. At this time, the doctor starts a long chain of serial crimes. With such a plot, the film should have been filled with something. And there are rotating corpses, broken or loose heads, stab wounds, beheadings, chainsaw dismemberments and many others. of boring sometimes, the film is saved from excessive violence that surely will please drug addicts.
