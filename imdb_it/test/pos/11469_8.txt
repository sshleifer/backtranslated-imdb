This film has had many ups and downs ... The plot is strong, while it tells the story of Ma 'Barker that grows, and then his misadventures with his boys and the FBI ... Teresa Russell is very talented and the her beauty still shines through, like Ma 'Barker, in Public Enemies. The direction of Mark L. Lester, although not as good as in "Commando del anni '85 was still very interesting. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts, plays a short-lived part as a security guard, transformed into a hooligan (and lover of Ma Alyssa Milan plays a prostitute, who hangs out with the band, Frank Stallone, plays a thug who helps the band, and while one of his exploits puts one of Ma's boys in difficulty, he finds himself in a final way , so to speak ... <br /> <br /> I was perplexed, intrigued and fascinated, throughout this film ... So I wonder what movie all the others who have voted so low watched! .. For all those who wonder ... Um, the FBI was actually so ugly at first, it didn't have submachine guns like the outlaws, and therefore they were at a disadvantage, every time they went into shootings with gang of that era ... since it represented the 1930s, I felt that it was more realistic than many other films made depicting that era ... It's in some ways that it could happen like a train accident ... You don't want atch, but JUST have too..joy !!!
