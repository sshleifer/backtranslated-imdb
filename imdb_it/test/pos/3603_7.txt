Just exactly as director John Madden established himself with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian officer and a Greek peasant in an honorable story: "Captain Correli's mandolin" escapes me! Witness: a shaky, insubstantial accent by Cage between the horrendous over-acting, with Cruz - more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino in front of Johnny Depp in "Blow" - basically a performance repeated under the guise of a Greek nurse ... yes, it was painful. But there have been saving graces. <br /> <br /> The story itself is thrilling and tragic, and Cage has some (- redeems, this is!) musical skills. Subsequently, a superb performance by John Hurt (father of Cruz, the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as Irene Papas, both as village elders, as well as Christian Bale (son of Papas) among the freedom fighters of the village , to go far against the counterbalancing embarrassing performances (especially at the beginning) of Cruz and Cage. Well, the last two seem to grow in their respective roles as the film progresses, but it is soon a grinding of teeth. Finally, the scenario itself and the photography could get a technical award, and this provides pleasant distractions when needed. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets his interpretation of the Doctor who makes this film worth seeing. The real test of a supporting actor / actress is if the film would be the same without the character in question, and in this case, surely it wouldn't be ... even close. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value, but for the additional factors mentioned above that help increase the level. Look at it if you don't. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
