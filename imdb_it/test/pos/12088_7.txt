First of all, I would like to emphasize that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Not only did he have great music, but also the shots and editing were wonderful. However, all these positive things about the film do not change the fact that he interprets the Orientalist clich√© "The East meets the West" which annoys many Turks like me. Okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very elegant way which is a good thing, something that would show Europeans and ignorant Americans that this country is not just about killing Armenians and Kurds. However, the problem of the film is that it looks at what it calls "east" from the eyes of the "west". I mean, as a jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no east and west, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by the rulers in the "western" countries to keep fear and hostility alive so that could it continue to rule the world and "keep the cash flow"? <br /> <br /> Why don't you think about it?
