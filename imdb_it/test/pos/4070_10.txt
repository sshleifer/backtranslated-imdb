That's exactly what I expected from this. Relaxing, fun and fun. The acting couple was fantastic, as was the selection of the scene. I recommend it personally. It is a kind of film that can be seen by the whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or bored. This nice movie will make you smile, and you'll laugh too. And the action scenes are tasty. Classics of modern American comedy. And very well done.
