On a dark and gloomy New Year's night, a sick nurse, her slowly declining life, asks to be introduced to David Holm immediately. We still don't know who David Holm is or why this nurse wants to see him, but his only wish to die is to talk to him again. Across the city, nestled comfortably between the gravestones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates eagerly await the arrival of the new year. "Here we can only say when to drink the new year," exclaims Holm, throwing a finger towards the great clock tower that hangs in the darkness. He does not know, however, that he will not be alive to greet him. <br /> <br /> To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. He once had a friend, George, "a cheerful guy" who was "smarter than all of us". On the eve of a new year, several years ago, George interrupted a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the last man to take his last breath before midnight would be sentenced to drive the ghost wagon for the following year, making the orders of Death and gathering the souls of the deceased. "And, gentlemen, George died last New Year!" Holm concludes happily, without bothering to contain his mocking skepticism towards man's beliefs. <br /> <br /> Like fate, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, at the stroke of midnight. While the transparent spirit of man rises cautiously from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom carriage. The driver, a fragile cloaked figure - a scythe squeezed in his hand - gets out of the carriage and approaches. We are amazed to discover that the driver is nothing more than a decrepit George, who is preparing to transmit his horrible task to this year's successor. <br /> <br /> Considering the era in which "Körkarlen" was created, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double exposure photography to create the mysterious ghostly shape of the carriage and its damn driver. Even today, the final result is very effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the ghost wagon that travels to the bottom of the ocean to recover the soul of a drowned man. Another scene, strangely reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in "The Shining" by Stanley Kubrick, involves Holm knocking down the kitchen door with an ax to reach his wife and children on the run. <br /> <br /> Truly threatening and upsetting in his performance, Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" is an excellent cinematographic work, which successfully portrays Holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment and hope final hope of redemption.
