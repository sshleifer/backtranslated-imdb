I took this film on the Horror Channel and was very impressed by the atmosphere and the gothic tone of the film. As a big fan of all things related to vampires, I'm always happy to see a new variant of the vampire myth, in this case, a ghoul-like creature that resides in another dimension of Lovecraftian. The director did a brilliant job of conveying the subject's dark mood, using the decadent art scene as the background of what is essentially a love story that embraces time and space - the pure love of opposing friendship to the desire for blood and life from vampires in history. The characters of the story are transported to another dimension through a mind-altering substance, where a vampire creature that changes shape seems to grant them the desires of their hearts, while draining them of their vital essence. There are some similarities with drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive pieces, always a plus point in a vampire story for female spectators! The special effects and effects of the creatures were well done, and the vampire size design set was very effective. All in all, a pleasant view of vampire myths and recommended to all those who love their vampires with intelligence and not just action. The only thing missing to make it even better would have been a little more eroticism and nudity, as it would have adapted to the plot and themes.
