When I saw this film for the first time I was very impressed by the kind of atmosphere that the director creates. It is also very interesting to see how they envision the near future in the year 1974. If you see the film you will see many sets and costumes that are still called bizarre and modern. <br /> <br /> the film's topic addresses the old question "What is reality and what is illusion?" If you see "The Matrix" you will find many similarities. But the two films are not at all comparable because "Welt am Draht" is art and "The Matrix" is entertainment. If you prefer the first one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I lost my video copy of this. <br /> <br />
