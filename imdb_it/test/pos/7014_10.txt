When the young Frances 'Baby' Houseman goes to summer camp with her family, she never expected to have so much fun! One night, after moving away from a resort activity, he ran into an all-night party with Johnny Castle and other dance mates. Quickly fascinated by the vulgar dance moves, "Baby" is eager to learn when she has to fill Penny, so she and Johnny don't lose their jobs at the resort. But the young 'Baby' soon finds himself in a sticky situation; she fell in love with a man who knows that her father will never approve. However, when Johnny is accused of stealing his wallets, it's up to "Baby" to confirm his alibi by admitting that he was with him the night they were captured. Johnny is still fired for being involved with a visitor, but he immediately understands what error left "Baby". Come back with the famous phrase "Nobody puts Baby in the corner" and show the resort exactly what they are made of. <br /> <br /> A fantastic film, perfect for a girl's night.
