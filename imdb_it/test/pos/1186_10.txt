He could not have come out at a worse time - just as the nation was entering the Reagan years, the boom boom of the 1980s, the time of no regret, no worries. He didn't have a word of mouth and he opened badly. The studio abandoned him. But Hair is perhaps the best musical ever made - with Forman's direction and Tharpe's choreography, it is a surprisingly beautiful, well-acted and well-written triumph that few people remember. The casting is perfect, the musical numbers are unforgettable, and even the downer of an ending does not diminish the indomitable spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you have not seen the best musical of all time. Seriously.
