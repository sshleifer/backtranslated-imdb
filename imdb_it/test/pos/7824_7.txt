Sometimes, you are awake late into the night browsing the stations, bored by your mind, and you want a soft and soft romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. And this film corresponds to exact billing. Of course, the plot was torn from the 1930s ... writing as schmaltzy as legendary Hallmark Greeting Card poetry, and one-dimensional characters were played by a cast taken directly from Central Casting - but it was CUTE, and exactly what I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have a great chemistry together - I liked it on "Picket Fences", and I'm happy to say that they still have it over 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, at 41, is still probably one of the most beautiful men to embellish with screens since Rudy Valentino started playing football on the bucket 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for the casting of that funny man who used to be on roller skates in that show about the cartoon lady. I always thought it was something out of a Hepburn-Grant comedy. GOOD BOY! <br /> <br /> Some will probably say that this was the bravest piece of cinema ever made, and I should probably agree - but come on! It's on the Hallmark canal. What did you expect? Sit down, relax, eat some sesame sticks and watch a sweet movie with two nice people and a bottle of Zinfandel. Trust me, you will love and accept the schmaltz much more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming of Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of ​​tempered chocolate that feeds you with chocolate cake with fresh mint. YUM! (PS: now I have a desire for petit fours. THANKS TO VERY, HALLMARK!) <br /> <br /> I really wish the bad girl had been cast with Rachel Ray, and maybe that Alton Brown food nerd like the announcer instead of the terrifying guy with the Van Dyk beard. Thrill! <br /> <br /> This would have made my night. But hey, take a look at "Just Desserts".
