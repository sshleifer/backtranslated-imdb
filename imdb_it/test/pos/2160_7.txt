Night Hunter begins in '68 when a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) is unexpectedly handed down the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when another vampire hunter Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim) cheats on his family and delivers them to the Vampires, to help Jack in his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every Vampire alive, or dead whatever the way you look at him ... Go to "June 1995" and Los Angeles where the now adult Cutter (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, also known as co-producer, left only four names in the book, including Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together, are the last of the American Vampires. a restaurant, Cutter brings down the party and kills them, a job well done? Wrong as King of Vampires Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls the last four Vampires left from all over the world, the French Tournier (Maria Ford), the Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David 'Shark Fralick) and Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track down Cutter and kill him. Meanwhile, Detective's Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no clue and a nosy journalist named Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) gets involved in the battle between Cutter & the Vampire on which Earth's fate itself rests! br /> <br /> Directed by Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was a pretty fun way to spend 85 odd minutes. William C. Martell's script mixes martial arts and horror with some success, moves at a pleasant pace and is never at least boring and fortunately does not seem to take itself too seriously. The names of the characters that refer to other directors / actors in horror movies are a bit annoying. Some may be surprised how closely Night Hunter resembles Blade (1998), but it was created a couple of years ago, the long moody and lunatic coat that the vampire hunter is a martial arts expert, the scene set in a nightclub and the innocent woman designed in the world of Vampire. Night Hunter does not adhere to the traditional vampire law, for example sunlight only irritates their eyes, they can only reproduce on a solar eclipse (why?), Bets through the heart and garlic are not as good as the way to kill a vampire in Night Hunter is to break the neck. I could have done with a little more horror and a little more blood as he leaned more toward the martial arts side of things. The dialogue is properly vulgar and the character is quite likable in a silly way. <br /> <br /> Director Jacobson does his best to ruin the film, the action scenes are OK but they lack a certain something and for some bizarre reason every time a sequence of actions occurs, it continually shakes the its camera, it is as if the camera were positioned on a full load cycle of the washing machine! Hey Rick, man, he's not smart or smart, he's irritating and annoying. The gore is disappointing with some bloody gunshot wounds and some spurts of blood, breaking the necks of the vampire do not involve much blood, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably does not amount to much Night Hunter is done competently in everything Acting has been bad for most of the time and what happened to "The Dragon" in the name of Don " The Dragon "Wilson? Did he legally change his name? Sign the checks of Don 'The Dragon' Wilson ?! Do you receive mail addressed to him with that name? I think I could do something similar, from now on I want to be known as Paul "The Killer Klown" Andrews ... <br /> <br /> Night Hunter is one of those shitty movies that transcends its limits and its terrible become pure golden entertainment. If you like your movies, then Night Hunter might be suitable for you, if you are looking for high budget thrills in a similar vein (Vampire, veins and blood happens?), Then the sequels of Blade & it would probably be a choice best. What the hell, I liked it so quote me.
