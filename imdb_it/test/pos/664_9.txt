STMD! it's one of the most fun and entertaining low-budget movies I've seen in a long time. The director Jeff Smith (who also worked as a co-writer, director of photography and editor) definitely shows his love for horror films of the 80s little appreciated with this film! Anyone who loves cheesiness, absurd situations, extravagant characters and stereotypes of the horror films of the 80s will certainly appreciate this truly ironic tribute to the past. <br /> <br /> STMD! certainly lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then in some. It has all the "excessive violence" and the "gratuitous nudity" that remind those who entertain the horror films of the 80s that we all love. I had an explosion looking at STMD! From the 80s clothes that the stereotyped characters bring to the splatter of blood to the silly tone I have never had enough!
