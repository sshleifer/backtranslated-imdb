Madonna has been the cradle of the boat for over 20 years, and with it comes a lot of experience - of course - and a lot of knowledge. It was never the one to think about yesterday, on the contrary, it seemed to know what would become popular tomorrow. She bravely takes on all the new trends, technologies and incorporates them into her actions. His world tours have never been 'mediocre'. When performing, Madonna gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. It takes inspiration from the East, from the West and makes it unique. Everything has a deeper meaning and The Confessions Tour is no different. From the beginning, you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair. Start with a bang, then make brave circus poses on a horse high in the sky, do everything you can to entertain yourself. She remakes her songs, giving them a modern touch. She sings on a disco cross, she comes almost to the center of the stage, and with her incredible dance team that knows no fear dimensions, the show is absolutely more than you wanted to. It is a show, an audiovisual orgasm that cannot be expressed in words. Fortunately those who have actually seen see Madonna on stage. Pushing fifty, she is still in an incredible shape. The recent Sticky and Sweet Tour is even more innovative, which proves nothing else, that Madonna is both the only and the only queen of pop.
