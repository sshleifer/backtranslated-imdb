The career of the Spanish director Luis Buñuel lasted almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. Probably his best films were those made during his exile in Mexico, from the late 40s to the early 60s. There he had to manage very low budgets and work in an industry mainly interested in churning out commercial films to an unsophisticated audience, yet somehow he managed to create interesting and stimulating films that have stood the test of time. This film is based on a novel by the Spanish author Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the setting is now in the early twentieth century in Mexico, instead of at the beginning of the 20th century in Spain . The protagonist, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as can be to that prescribed by Christ. The question many are asking is whether such an effort would be possible, without incurring hostility, misunderstanding and mocking one's own kind. As it happens, he suffers a lot of humiliations, yet he remains stubborn (up to the controversial final step) to achieve this goal. I think that Buñuel wanted to show Nazarin as a rather ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) turns out to be admirable. In any case, a great film.
