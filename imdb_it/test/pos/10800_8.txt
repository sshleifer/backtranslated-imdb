It's not a bad movie, but it could have been done without the complete frontal nakedness of a 10-year-old child in one of the opening scenes. This film has an excellent dialogue; which is certainly common among foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to behave as opposed to American actors who leave CGI, stunts and special effects all the work for them. This film is just a good old-fashioned way. Gerarde DePardieux did a great job as always. The costumes and the scenery are accurate with time. My only complaint is that they should have dubbed the English words on French instead of using subtitles; this could only be because I hate reading subtitles.
