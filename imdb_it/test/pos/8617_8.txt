This film was very interesting to me, practically a film within a film, about a very fanciful director who manages to persuade an actress and an actor (who don't appreciate each other) in the production of films about sex . The director is faced with a series of obstacles as he tries to convince the two people to perform beautifully in a film. Sex is Comedy is much more than a comedy, full of unpleasant eccentric moments that the film also addresses the instinctual psychological and innate behavior of men and women towards the sometimes controversial sexual act. I loved this movie, the character played by Jeanne by the beautiful Anne Parillaud performs wonderfully on screen while you share her struggle to produce a cinematographic work of art.
