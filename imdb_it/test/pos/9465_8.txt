I have to be honest, I really enjoyed watching She's the Man. Despite being a typical teenage comedy or if you change the sex of the sexes, you had some nice laughs that I think anyone could get. Both adults and kids would love this movie. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the typical rebellious teenager who dresses and behaves like a boy, and when she is refused to try the boy's soccer team, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove himself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team. Of course, love shows when he meets another boy who thinks he is his brother. He also has a girl who chases her. Well, the tag line says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a fun drama for teenagers that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes has shown something in the film, it's really hard to act like a boy. : D Well, it's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
