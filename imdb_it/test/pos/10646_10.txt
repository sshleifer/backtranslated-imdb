/ * may contain SPOILERS, but of course it doesn't matter :) * / <br /> <br /> Battleship Potemkin is a breathtaking spectacle of disturbing images. The visual direction is (well, and has been) stimulating, the vastness of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly pioneering. What is really surprising is, in my opinion, the depth and effectiveness of a film, devoid of literary script, sound (save the soundtrack), decent image quality, faux-deep referendum (self-) of today , exceptional acting, fiction, etc. What you get is a purely visual experience to remember. <br /> <br /> BTW, the previous manifesto noted: "Eisenstien felt after much suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. What do you think Eisenstein is building a great final battle and then teases you, is a bit cheap, I would have preferred to see a final action scene. "<br /> <br /> I must warn you that the end is not cheap, and Eisenstein was not generous with the heroes. The story, however, was. Potemkin really went through the squadron as was shown in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I highly recommend seeing the battleship Potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema. Watch it with a movie buddy, made me talk for hours. However, if you tend to consider films, generally accepted as "big" or "classic", as "slow" or "boring", this movie may not yet be for you. There is not much low-cost entertainment here. <br /> <br /> For me though, it's a full 10/10.
