With the famous Billy humor, this more modest comedy with strong bittersweet nuances is a great starting point, pleasantly unexpected for Billy Crystal. This film has a number of tearful, dramatic and serious background themes (especially with a scene with Steven Seagal). This film was both funny and serious, a film about lost love, relationships with father-son, husband-wife, friendship and values ​​with a good dose of humor, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as in the new classic genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this film remain solid. The discovery of the talent scout / character agent of Billy Crystal in Romania of a human giant is revealing and the background of the scene of the film agent is fascinating. However, attention remains focused on sensitive bonds of both love and self-knowledge. Eight stars out of ten.
