This concerns mainly love in the second world war, but we must remember that it is also a biographical film for Dylan Thomas and those around him in this particular phase of his life. <br /> <br /> The timing of the film is simply fantastic. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit in those days; smiling and hoping you won't be bombed. Although it may be boring to some, the film has a particularly dangerous side. <br /> <br /> At some point, my heart was racing towards the end when the film reached its peak. It is really characterized by some touching moments that are skillfully handled by the four main actors. Cillian Murphy is in great shape here, as is Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and constitute an interesting watch. The relationship between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley is wonderful and we have the acting to thank (and watch out for a cameo by Suggs of 'Madness'). <br /> <br /> Despite everything, it's a pretty slow movie. Coupled with the fact that it is only two hours away, it is a real nuisance to come to a conclusion. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that have undoubtedly been helped by the splendid number of well-known British names behind the scenes. But sometimes it continues to buzz too much. However, a useful watch. 7/10
