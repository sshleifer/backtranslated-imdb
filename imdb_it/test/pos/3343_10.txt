I saw it for the first time on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was fun with some interesting music. Kristine was on the cover of Playboy and the main page, if I remember correctly. She is really cute and lively and has a lot of charm. The film made me want to see more of it and so I tried to look at it in other things. He is featured in "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" by Steven Spielberg and "The Main Event" by Barbara Streisand and "Meatballs" by Bill Murray, as well as numerous TV shows like Night Court and TV. My friends and I have a lot of fun. But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts attention right where she should be, right on Kristine as the center of attention, probably the most beautiful and most beautiful girl I've ever seen in movies.
