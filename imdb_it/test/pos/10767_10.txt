I participated in a screening of "Fierce People" at the 2006 Woodstock Film Festival. I hesitated to label it as a "prima" of any kind, since it was filmed in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at Tribeca in 2005. He played in several festivals that year. The release seemed imminent, then disappeared. Poof. Vanished. Or so it appeared to the public who went to the cinema. Rumors of a theatrical version or DVD popped up from time to time, but all turned out to be unfounded. So this projection was announced. Perhaps you can call it "re-premiere?" I certainly felt like I witnessed a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I suppose we can characterize "Fierce People" as a drama for growth. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a little farce thrown in. In short, real life. This makes it difficult to classify, which puts it more in the category of an independent film than in a Hollywood movie. But his high production values, his big budget and the cast of star caliber seem to be at odds with the independent label. So let's call it a hybrid. And, perhaps, that's why he was "lost". Meet the categorization. <br /> <br /> Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn never met him. But he sees it and listens to it through the collection of domestic films sent from South America. Dad is a famous anthropologist and made a name for himself by founding a shop with the Yanomani, the "Fierce People" tribe that lives to kill and, well, procreate. All their activities are built around these two "tasks" and Finn is fascinated. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although physically present, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in his little lonely world with his film reels. <br /> <br /> One summer, Mom decides to drag Finn along with her to the wilds of New Jersey. Masseuse, her mother took care of a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a performance tour de force) and invited her to a long phone call in her palace. The "tribe" of Osborne includes an assortment of eccentric kids, servants and idiots from the village among which Finn will find himself part of his anthropological study. Will his experience with dad films help him survive in life as a visitor to this tribe? Will it be accepted? Or will he be seen as a stranger, simultaneously fighting with his own teenage identity? Such is the stuff of fairy tales, and I suppose it would be if it weren't for the dark side that director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn infused into this magnificent story. <br /> <br /> With the voice-over of Anton Yelchin, intercepting daddy's home movie pieces, Finn must learn to go back to being the teenager who never had the chance to be, stop being the parent of his mother, allowing just sober mom to be a parent with him, and learn responsibility on the road to adulthood as it should have taken place all the time. Yet he needs to make this transformation into a dangerous and dark world where playing with fire is folly for this fractured family. <br /> <br /> This is, first of all, a film based on history and Griffin Dunne emphasized so much in the introduction to the film. He bought the rights to the Wittenborn novel even as it was being written, and Wittenborn's script comes to life in the hands of the magisterial Dunne in a way that is a work of wonder. <br /> <br /> This is also largely character-based film, and Sutherland has never been better. His star turns while Osborne stuns those around me and will probably leave you speechless. The character of Diane Lane eventually exhibits so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor doing so well. She is breathtaking. But more than anything else, "Fierce People" is the film by Anton Yelchin. He has a long resume as a child actor but preciously small as a teenager. In addition to the little known "House of D" (also a gem), it is better known as Byrd on "Huff" TV. In January, he will be seen in "Alpha Dog" (he also sat on the shelf since 2004, a film I saw at Sundance this year and in which he is the "heart and soul"). His performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex and extravagant film has remained out of sight long enough. "Fierce People" is a treasure full of lights and shadows, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but above all wonder.
