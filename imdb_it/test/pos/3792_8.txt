In these modern times (as a topic well known to the director of the short film of which this German count will speak ??), politically correct films are the "leitmotiv" of the projects of young modern directors. "Shoulder Arms", directed by Herr Chaplin during the First World War (the film was released a few weeks before the armistice) is a clear example of why the first pioneers of cinema were very bold people, certainly! Was directing a humorous film inspired by the terrible and bloody First World War a complicated question that only a few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could do? venturing into such a delicate and successful venture was reserved only for geniuses. <br /> <br /> As this German count said, "Spallaccio" was created during the First World War, the time when surely the whole world lost its innocence (fortunately not the fat German heiresses of this aristocrat ??) and is an exhilarating, inventive social satire on this and every war. The film is full of great gags and a tangle of cinematographic continuity for a story in which that vagabond will live through risky and courageous adventures in the front ?? who is a hero for the allies ?? or not. <br /> <br /> To mock war trenches, unhealthy, frontal attacks and Germans (how dare you !! ... by the way, there are many inaccuracies in the film ?? German soldiers at that time had mustaches and longer beard not to mention the fact that the Kaiser doesn't have many medals in his uniform ??) in an elegant, amusing and delicate way that is still today a cinematic miracle impossible to overcome. Keeping those terrible war circumstances in mind, the difficult task is only possible thanks to so much creativity and talent. Obviously Mr. Charlie Chaplin has had a lot. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German count must return to the Schloss trenches. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
