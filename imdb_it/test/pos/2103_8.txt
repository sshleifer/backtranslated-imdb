With his re-reading from ADV Films, I had the chance to see "The Giant Majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late-night Horror Chiller theater. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie! <br /> <br /> The sets are authentic, the acting is submissive and credible and the giant Majin is majestic, powerful and unreachable. I loved the subtle touches of fantasy (the enchanted wood, the lucky charm, etc.) And the affection of the god as a little less than "good". <br /> <br /> This movie is begging for a remake in the new century!
