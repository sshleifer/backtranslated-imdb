This is a very modest film, very beautiful with a soundtrack by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a standout number, We're The Couple In The Castle, which is totally evocative of the period and recalls the Penthouse Serenade just like the opening premise (the coming of Hoppity) may have inspired Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg (Woody's Coming) at Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with those posters that have noticed that the name that Disney added to this would have by now reached the "classic" status rather than being dropped into disuse. It is wonderfully inventive, never more than when objects barely noticed in the "real" world take on a much greater meaning - both for and against - in the world of insects. It is actually a classic, even if a minor.
