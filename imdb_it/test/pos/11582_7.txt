I just saw Mar Ardentro and heard that I had to comment on this movie. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in every field and unfortunately it is sometimes able to distort the true value of a film. Many people have been thrilled by the excellent cast and its beautiful pictures / photographic works. Surely Javier Bardem is an actor who brings something extra to every film he makes. To say that it includes the real Sampredo is a bit silly since I don't think any of the reviewers have ever known Sampredo personally. Standing still and using a certain charm is an acting skill that although well executed does not constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem only does what is good ... and that's it. The work with the camera is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the film itself is not able to offer. Here Sampredo is depicted as a man who bends down to die so much as to leave his loving family behind and marry a woman who seeks only when the other will not help him in his search for a dignified death. Now I'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that when you comment on films like this you can hardly escape. The subject of the film is so strong that you are almost obliged to discuss the film in that strong argument. I find it a weakness for the film - involuntarily - it portrays Sampredo as an inaccurate character. Someone who is much more intelligent than his family as portrayed in his simple cousin who does not "get" the double-layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is not dignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who, according to the film, makes the choice "wrong" ending up in a distant state of dementia, thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman who constantly looks for him is almost uninterested in the beautiful lawyer, but is suddenly married to Sampredo when he agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo a calculated figure, no matter how fascinating Bardem is. Argumentive I would say that does not fully convince and I think that Amenabar did not intend to add this unbalanced element to his film. For a young director it is still an impressive film and certainly has its strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo, for example). Camera work is impressive and the film is well acted. But 10 out of 10 ... no the film does not reach that excellence.
