Most of the silent films I saw were of a serious nature, so it was fun to see one with a comic touch. The setting and some scenes of "The Beloved Rogue" recalled the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" of 1923 compared to the street scenes in Paris and the celebration of the "King of fools". John Barrymore portrays the greatest French poet, Francois Villon, in a characterization that varies enough from virtual slapstick to romantically tender; that "the water in the wine" was a little early in the picture was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> It seems that times never change, and it is interesting to see the film make a convincing remark about a century ago - Paris has the madman to reign for a night, while elsewhere he always has one. As is true. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the film was a bit surprising for this viewer, I only saw him as Major Strasser in "Casablanca", strangely one of his last films. Like King Louis XI, he is a monarch obsessed with astrology, sly but suspicious, and it was a bit unnerving to see how he looked like Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character from the last chapter of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. The confidence that a King of France should have endured did not exude exactly. This is why the rise of the Duke of Burgundy (Lawson Butt) seemed all the more plausible, until Villon presented himself on the occasion to put one over the two sovereigns. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that the use of the titles was excessively spare, used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them, however, one would have lost a curious nugget. It seems that Villon made his exile from Paris to the Lame Flea Hostel! <br /> <br /> The print I saw is of exceptional quality, the first film presented in a hundred of action and suspense movie DVDs by Mill Creek Entertainment, which is saying something about a movie that has now octant 'years. It's great that the films of the era of silence now find a wider distribution in this type of commercial format, making them accessible to a new generation of movie lovers. <br /> <br /> A question: did it appear that Conrad Veidt was King Louis chose his nose on purpose, or as an involuntary gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room?
