How to summarize this film? it is simply impossible. Why should you see it? perhaps for history, most likely for the actors (Giorgio, Caterina ...), especially for the universe and poetry. This is a story. Sad, sometimes dark, but a fairy tale. I LOVE this movie !!!! I'm just waiting for the DVD !! Thank you sir Boutonnat.
