This is one of the best television productions of a musical ever. I listened to Merman's cast album, Angela Lansbury's album, I saw Tyne Daly live and saw Rosalind Russell's movie countless times. I think that Bette is the best, and therefore tied to the best. It captures not only the skill, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I've never been a Natalie Wood fan, so I really liked Cynthia Gibb, in what's probably her best role. Everything from costumes to set designs to supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always reliable Christine Ebersole are difficult to reach. There had to be a television production of Mame a few years ago with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Auntie Mame.
