I also saw this film in a film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible features, the short films are often double those of small budgets and poor acting, A.W.O.L is still a small thriller aimed at "The Outer Limits". The performances are solid, not that one would otherwise expect from Morse or McGinley, and the direction is strong and with money. Personally I find it difficult to reconcile the comments of the previous poster with the film I saw. A.W.O.L is rightly written by Shane Black, who, as is usually the case, plays with the genre both by paying tribute to the sensations of the pulp of the stories, while simultaneously winking at the public and never taking itself too seriously. All in all, A.W.O.L turns out to be an extremely well executed and amusing film.
