If you love the drive-in cheeze of the early 70s you'll love this. How can you go wrong with a low-budget bloodshed movie in an asylum? You can not! Crazy people and sharp objects are always a fun combination. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been shot in someone's home for about $ 320.65. For me this is just advertising for the fun of watching this kind of thing. The gore is a little milder than others of this type, but there is enough to keep us sick of bloodthirsty (like me) happy. Some horror films drag parts and let me wait for something to happen. That's not the case. The characters are fun enough to make each frame pleasant enough. There is never a dull moment from beginning to end. The end of the mind that is melting in the end is simply incredible. I liked it so much that, right after the credits, I looked at it a second time. It is a must see for any respectful drive-in horror. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 on Drive-in Freak-O-Meter ... display request <br /> <br /> Yea I love you..I love you ... now take your Thorazine and put your clothes back ... please .... 8)
