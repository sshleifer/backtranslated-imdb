I didn't see this film until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic films. Since the series "Batman", "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other pitiful -13 bombs, I dodged everything at all costs. I would like to ask myself, "why can't someone make a film that is classified as R and remains true to history, how difficult is it?" And in the end my prayers were answered with Blade. This film comes directly from the pages on the screen with pure violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good versus evil, etc. Yes, of course, many action movies contain all these goodies and many of them have bombed. But not Blade, the film was shot right, without exaggerating, offering a good duration and never a dull moment. Blade II is beautiful, but not as nice as the first one. Blade is really one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen in a long time.
