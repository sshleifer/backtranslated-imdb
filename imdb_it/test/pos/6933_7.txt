I am a greedy for B movies. I love the old Drive-In rate like this movie. This film, made for little money, seems to do something that some films in bigger budgets fail. It's cheezy. It's bloody. It doesn't have a real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I was laughing or covering my eyes with shock. There are some great effects like a shot from a guy's mouth when he is stabbed in the chin by a knife and he sticks it out of his tongue and slams against the roof of his mouth, and a lousy one with a guy who gets his eyeballs pulled out. But there are also a lot of zombies, and some psychopaths killed after the Chainsaw massacre, and a demon possessed a scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers cast as they torture and kill people. He has a great job with the camera and some interesting editing tricks. This is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still modeled after those supernatural zombie movies of the 70s and 80s and still has a cheeze factor that ranks high. Don't expect Romero, only Fulci of second choice. I'd say horror fans will like it, and it's fun, cheeky and a quick ride through B-movie Land.
