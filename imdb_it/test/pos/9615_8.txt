The skeleton of the plot is that the main character must win a public kung fu tournament with high stakes. The flesh of the story is composed of MANY fights, a love triangle, betrayal, rivalry and revenge. <br /> <br /> There is a lot in this story. The main character is very nice as a country boy, even moderate, mild and very hard. A good versus bad film is only as good as the bad and the main villains are hard and intelligent, not to mention ugly, devious and deceptive. <br /> <br /> If there is a weakness, it is the scene where the main character's boyfriend is imagining her and the protagonist running towards each other in a flowery field and hugging each other when they meet. I thought I was watching The Sound of Music for a second and almost lost hope for the film. Fortunately, the film quickly recovered with a fighting scene.
