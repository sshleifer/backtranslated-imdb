An obsessive love story, in which the characters were extremely convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel who wouldn't be (at the time he was shot) the first character you think of for a role like that. And yes, he managed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. I can only say that this film should have been published in the United States, instead of thinking of a remake. It is simply so French, almost perverse .... yet so true ... this film should remain intact ... <br /> <br /> A director who should surely get more projects as this type of subject requires right amount of ingredients not to make it a flop
