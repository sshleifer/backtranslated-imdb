039: Anna Christie (1930) - published on 21/2/1930; displayed on 3/10/06 <br /> <br /> October 24, 1929: Black Thursday, the stock market collapses. Now the country and indeed the world will look to Hollywood to escape the Great World Depression. <br /> <br /> BIRTH: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yasser Arafat, Bob Newhart, Barbara Walters, Doris Roberts, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney, Gene Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In the end, our Odyssey takes seriously with the first Greta Garbo sound film, a simple character study called Anna Christie. An excellent interpretation of Mrs. Garbo, who showed immediately that her talent could have gone back to the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix does not seem to have them in stock. One thing I noticed more and several times it's the way the Swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter J with a Y sound. Anna ends up being the only character I liked, I didn't care much about her ex-father or her suitor. Sound recording systems seem to be improving (no one leans in to talk about the mystery), but the camera is still not moving, we will be sure to see it change as our odyssey continues. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Our first movie of the 1930s is the first sound film of the silent star Greta Garbo, Anna Christie This is a very simple film, with only about five different places where we spend long periods of the film's 89 minute run time, often c on a static camera. It was nice to see Marie Dressler also in sound, and quite funny as what we hear is an endless chain of sincere and still drunken insults. I really liked Garbo's performance, as he supports the film even in the most tortuous moments. I didn't like George Marion or Charles Bickford very much, maybe because I didn't like either of them, so I was relieved and excited when Anna finally defends herself and shows them that she doesn't "belong" to either of her estranged father or her Irish boyfriend tied to the muscles. It's also nice to see that the famous silent screenwriter Frances Marion didn't miss a passage from silence to sound. <br /> <br /> Last film shown: Speedy (1928). The last film in chronological order: The Love Parade (1929). Next movie: The Blue Angel (1930).
