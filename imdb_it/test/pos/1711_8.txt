If (as I just mentioned in THE GOAT) Keaton follows the comic book tradition by disagreeing with the law, this short by Langdon (the last one released before TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic maneuver - be married with a tireless wife, and try to escape for some secret two-stroke dating. Laurel and Hardy did it in several films, like Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with this - why do these characters always marry such bad women? And there is an interesting sociological question - why don't you find comics married to male counterparts to these shrews? I don't remember anything, except in a scene by Carol Burnett, in which the two most evil members of two couples discover that they prefer to have someone return the best (a sort of reciprocal sado-masochism, but also the reassurance that their non married to a guy from Namby-Pamby). As for the fact that comics marry shrews, I suppose you can imagine getting what they deserve. Or them? Does Ollie really deserve a wife who tosses pots and plates at him? Yes, he went to that convention in SONS OF THE DESERT that ruined his plans, but he wanted to take some private time - there's nothing to suggest he and Stan betrayed their wives. It is actually cream from Mae Busch because she lied to her while Stan collapsed and told his wife the truth. <br /> <br /> Here the wife of Harry (Alice Ward) is shown at the beginning talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control. We see Harry at his job (it's Saturday morning and work ends at noon for the rest of the weekend - this was before the idea of ​​a five-day job a week and 40 hours a week in the industry). He works in a foundry where he hits the red-hot metal in shape (an early joke about Langdon - he is a small, light man, not a muscular guy swinging a club). He just lost his tram trying to give light to a man. Call home to explain things and get some luck from the lady to be two minutes late. <br /> <br /> On the way home, Harry meets his friend Steve (Vernon Dent) who has met two cute and sweet girls who would love to have a date. Harry is hesitant but agrees to do so after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for the hot dogs for the quartet - he has a 1926 silver dollar in his pocket). But his plans seem to derail when his wife discovers his hidden "hideout" of coins. He keeps it hidden under the living room carpet and finds it walking along the edge of the carpet. But his wife spies on him and confiscates him. Later she hears him talking to himself and scolding her. In contempt she returns a penny and says she can treat her appointment with a drink. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second cache of coins and dresses for the date - and leaves. He and Dent are apparently late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry tries to remedy him: he produces two prostitutes. They go into a fight when Dent (wisely) says that I'm not the kind of girls they would call "beautiful". Eventually the girls show up and the date begins. But soon Harry is hiding in the seat of the rumble, while his wife passes by his roadster, and the little girl girls show up - angry with their two rivals. <br /> <br /> The short film works well and is fun, and gives a better idea of ​​the character that Harry Langdon developed in his brief celebrity as a comedian. He is constantly taken by others. He misses his tram because a stranger keeps asking for smoke and light, and eventually the stranger gets his. The beautiful girl who is Harry's date has a little dog who chases him away. Rest between two cars that start running away and end up clinging to a pole. It certainly shows that Langdon had lost his screen character when he made his feature films. If only he could have kept the complex together beyond those first three characteristics.
