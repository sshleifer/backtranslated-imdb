Women will love this film better than men. Of course, women love all romantic comedies more than men - on average. In general I like romantic comedies a bit, but I consider this a 5.5 for the first 50% of the film and about 6.5 for the next 40% and about a 9 for the last 10%. So, reluctantly, I will evaluate a 7. I tape and keep all the movies ranked a 7 or better and none that is a 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have over 1200 movies, so why keep dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife really liked this movie more than me, although I'm not sure. I'm a fan of Drew Barrymore bigger than her. <br /> <br /> The focus of this film was on a young woman returning to high school (undercover) to write a story about her high school experience today. She was an idiot at the first school and must learn how to be beautiful the second time. His journey to the cooldom, as well as his falling in love with a teacher, is history. <br /> <br /> What drove me crazy for the first half of the film was its sloppiness. I wondered why they would choose her for this role until I realized how capable she was of looking like a dog. So much so that I don't really think I want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Of course, she eventually turned into a pretty (pretty) woman and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The finish is about 9.9 on a very gentle scale, so the engineers will appreciate it. Otherwise, it is not very memorable and easily negligible.
