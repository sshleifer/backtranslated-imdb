If you want to watch a movie with Stan Laurel in Laurel & Hardy's comedies, this is not the movie for you. Stan would not have begun to find the character and rhythms of those films for another two years. If, however, you want a good parody of Rudolph Valentino BLOOD AND SAND, which was made the previous year, this is the film for you. All the interruptions are pulled out, both in physical comedy and in titles and if the film is not held together by the character, the plot of Valentino's film is used - well, in a sense.
