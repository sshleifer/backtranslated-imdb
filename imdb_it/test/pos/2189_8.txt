Well, I'm not the biggest fan of the Sondheim world, so even though I have the cast album and I've heard it a few times I've never seen this show performed and I haven't even seen Tim Burton's version. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before seeing Burton's and giving him a chance just like a movie. This version is not a movie at all, it's a comedy filmed with some of the cast's original members, including Angela Lansbury's most important performance as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that is just like a conduit in the heart of Broadway magic and the theater itself. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself is not played by Len Cariou, who did it originally, but by George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job; his voice is not as good as Cariou's, but it seems to sound a little wider. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was with Johanna's character played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her lover Anthony, played by Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice is unable to sustain high notes, but I was not entirely sure that perhaps this should have been the point since I am not very familiar with this play. More importantly, I'm not sure the "Sweeney Todd" story really has enough weight to support some of the music, but fortunately the whole thing doesn't seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators. As a lark, and a bit of comedy in the "Grand Guignol" genre, it's pretty funny. It does not seem to me that it is a significant work like "Company" and "Into the Woods" or some of its other shows. Some of the music is quite spectacular, but in other places it seems to exist in a world outside of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I will not say much about this here because this is a movie site and this is not really a movie, but just a play on film. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the video camera, but that's how it went. People will want to see it, because it preserves the legendary performance of Lansbury that deserves its legendary status because it is an exhilarating and insightful performance. George Hearn can be proud of his version of Sweeney. This would be a good movie to show children over 5 years interested in musicals because blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. Seeing such a performance turned so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater, because I prefer shows from the 1920s to the 1950s to these last periods of the era. "Sweeney Todd" is an exceptional show of his era, however, miles and miles above the madness of AL Webber.
