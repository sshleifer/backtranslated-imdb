Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with high school hell. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry about losing his wife. Daphne is attracted to the world of prostitution because it promises to cure her from a boredom and barely legal solitude. Once Buddy takes away his secret from Daphne, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Duncan Hotel, but the details of each character's story are displayed through dialogues and flashbacks. Their appointment culminates with the final touch of the story. <br /> <br /> Both actors understand and become their particular character, offering a convincing and sincere performance. Their on-screen chemistry, which is fundamental to the entire film, is genuine. <br /> <br /> The dialogue of the film is natural, real to life. The writer, Gorman Bechard, has undoubtedly done his homework because all references are appropriate for industry and character. Daphne is intelligent, but clearly still has an eighteen year old. Buddy could be middle-aged, but he is still not the naive type retracted normally depicted in the film. Daphne and Buddy's conversation is mainly about their desperation and frustration with life, but it is still comic at the right time. Even if the general atmosphere is very relaxed, the dialogue has its liveliness, forcing the public to become empathetic towards the conditions of the character and uncomfortable for its clear vulgarity. <br /> <br /> The incredible soundtrack really captures the essence of the film. Each track commands feeling, actually contributing to the scenes and characters. Although it exists independently of the film, the compilation truly expresses the central theme of You Are Alone - solitude. <br /> <br /> You Are Alone is a less conventional piece that deals with not typically spoken notions. Definitely worth seeing ?? it's the kind of film that stimulates the thought that forces you to question your threshold of loneliness.
