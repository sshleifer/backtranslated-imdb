This film is definitely better than the first "Astérix et Obelix contre César", but it is very far from perfect. The adaptation of the comic is good, some of the images and the dialogs of the film are the same as in the book. But there are few things that make the film not as interruptive as the animated film released in 1968. For example, the fight between Numerobis and Amonbofis. This was not necessary or even credible, both for Astérix's little love story. There were also some things missing, like the songs that are in the animated film, and some other things ... I am fooled by the film because they cut the things I expected them to see and showed things that I didn't want or needed to see . I know it would have been very difficult to make the film exactly the same as the comic or animated film, but that's what I expected. In conclusion, even if the film is good, I still prefer the animated film, which I think is much better.
