Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican image from Midaq Alley just because the excellent cast, the scandalous direction and a sublime soundtrack. Many people did not like "Cronica ??", they think it is very aggressive but did not understand that it was only a representation with hyperrealism of Mexican society but so similar to all third world families. I hope that Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this film gives another example of his greatness as an actor) will soon come together again with a new film. Just remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bu√±uel) was misunderstood once released, but now we consider one of the best films of all time. Please prepare and watch this movie.
