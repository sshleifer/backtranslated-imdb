I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival and I was also surprised by the fact that it didn't attract more attention because it wasn't just powerful and well done but very original. The public was totally busy and most of seeing a film like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and participate in the question and answer session. They literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next movie - we could have gone on much longer. The film is both stimulating and fun. It would be a shame if this film were not collected for a wider distribution - I hope at least it will be available on DVD because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
