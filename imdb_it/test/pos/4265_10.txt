At times, the mainstream media appears to be led by a group of mindless journalists. In this they merely listen and report what others report. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what can be found if you put a little more effort into the task of reporting something. <br /> <br /> True journalism should be to provide people with different perspectives on things that happen so that they have a good chance of creating a personal opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary, along with mainstream media reports, will help you with this. At least for me, he provided a lot of relevant information about the purpose / motivation behind today's frequent protests around the world at various political summits.
