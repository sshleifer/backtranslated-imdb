For those of you who like comedians, you must have heard of George Carlin. He really is one of the best live comedians, so you need to know him. <br /> <br /> But he is already dead, God rests him in peace. Or to hell. He didn't believe in religion too much, so he could also choose hell to live eternity. HAHA, joke, don't take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It is bad for you! It is one of George Carlin's last works, before his death - <br /> <br /> I believe, one of his best works, a must for every fan and almost the best of all George Carlin's lines. It's not a best-of ... but it's really fun. <br /> <br /> It has fewer political and religious jokes. It's just for fun! <br /> <br /> Editing is very good. It is not a concert, therefore, it should not have a quick change of shots ... the slow fading towards the other shots was well done. Fading is the best option in terms of modification!
