I am a history teacher and overall I was satisfied with the film. My teenagers had fun during the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and a bit mushy in some places? Yes ... but it took my kids away from the computer and the play station to spend four nights watching everything. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were impressive and we met a lot of historical characters. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought that Phillip Casnoff, as Bent, was mischievous and charming. We all thought that Charles had stolen the Orry and George show. <br /> <br /> We will enjoy the movie again!
