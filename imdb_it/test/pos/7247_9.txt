Made the same year as Lumiere's first films, this is a much more dramatic short than the brothers attempted until the 'Niagara' of the following year. The surviving print is very rough, but this does nothing but increase Turneresque's visual violence, as huge waves of water fall against a stolid pillar and seem ready to swallow the camera, the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you look at some of these first short films in chronological order, and try to enter the mentality of the times, there is a further shock in that, unlike the individual frame setups of Lumieres, this film presents a modification, which for me in any case, was the cutting of the razor blade in "Un Chien Andoulu". <br /> <br /> Unlike the monographic vision of Lumieres' films, Paul opens up the possibility to multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, escaping his grip in a way that Lumieres could never have blow shows a gush similar to that of Niagara, but it is less scary because, through the modification, we have evaded the danger. In a film like "L'Arroseur Arrosse" or "Repas du bebe", nature is indifferent and powerful, irrepressible by the camera. The grammar of the basic film puts an end to its supremacy.
