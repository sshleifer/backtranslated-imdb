In the tradition of "neo" film noir films like "Chinatown", this film focuses on a criminal mystery in a dark realm with a bit of intuition of character mixed into. The typical noir characters, including the policeman to prove to himself, a damsel in distress and a bad, bad boy. Sharky's Machine gets a 9 out of 10 for its first cinematography, in addition to its direction, history, strong interpretation of the character and superb jazz soundtrack. Available on DVD, although the soundtrack is out of print (but available "used" on some auction sites). Shot on location in beautiful downtown Atlanta (the birthplace of the novelist Diehl) and in the somewhat ramshackle 1979 appearance, the city would have become a long-standing citizen or visitor for the old days before the 12-lane interstates crossed the city, the dream of that time. This was Rachel Ward's first US feature film.
