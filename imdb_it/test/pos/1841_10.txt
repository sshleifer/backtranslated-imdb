I saw this film a few years ago and I was literally swept away. So charming and very romantic. David Duchovny and Mrs. Driver have such a hot chemistry that you will have to take off a layer of clothes. The supporting cast is 100% first class. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the film's most fascinating moments are when they are on screen. Like Jim Belushi shouting to his children to go to sleep "FOREVER!" or he dancing in the kitchen. This film made me want to meet people like that in my life. Not to mention which woman doesn't want David Duchovny for a boyfriend?
