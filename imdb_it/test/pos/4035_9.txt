"D.O.A" is a small, engaging and entertaining photograph from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid is at its best caustic; and Quaid is unfortunately one of Hollywood's most underutilized talents. Even his then director Meg Ryan appears with him, but as usual, it doesn't have much of an impact. <br /> <br /> The film is directed with style, drawing on a series of influences to capture its "seamy" feeling. Would you say that it is actually directed by two people? The answer is no. Everything is superbly polished, from its innovative camera to its shameless use of black and white photography. All these elements contribute to keeping the proceedings fresh. <br /> <br /> Truly the biggest thrill here to have with the dialogue, it's snappy but intricate, don't waste a word and yet still manages to be fun. The script of this is like a pocket work of art. <br /> <br /> This has gone unnoticed by me for years before I finally caught it late at night. If this is the first one you heard, don't leave it like I did! Take it soon, it's really high-level ...! <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a solid genre film that manages to surprise at every turn, this is really up to it. <Br /> <br />
