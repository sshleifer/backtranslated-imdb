I have just returned from the European premiere of The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if you are a player (CRPG, RPG or LARP), then this movie is for you. And if you're not a player? Well, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Acting is certainly not worthy of the Oscars, but the whole element of the film adds to the charm. Humor is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (the tribute to Gary Gygax is particularly well done, if you can spot it). The cast are very easy on their appearance, befitting of being normal people enjoying a normal hobby. <br /> <br /> The quality of the sound and the vision of the film is adequate, but, once again, it adds all the atmosphere that helps define this film as the Dungeons and Dragons film, written and performed by the players for players. <br /> <br /> Not afraid to use the specific terminology of a system, but still manages to allow the insertion of the product to be part of the film, but in a very understandable and absolutely right way. It also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some players may have regarding other players and handles them fairly well. <br /> <br /> All in all the film is guided by a balanced balance of character, plot and entertainment (the Bard has an excellent quality-price ratio). <br /> <br /> In the end it makes the score of this movie rather difficult, so I gave it 2 scores. <br /> <br /> Score (for non-RP'ers): 7/10 (Some moments may go beyond your head, but the main sections of the film work so hard and get much more.)> < br /> Score (for RP'ers): 10/10 (Everything fits together, in perfect quantities and with the perfect charm and feeling)
