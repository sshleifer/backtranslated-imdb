Personally I found the film fantastic. I had it in pre-order for a month and I watched it twice the day I received it in the mail, and several times since then .. Yes, times could be a little too much, but the rest of the film clearly compensates. The whole cast of amature, yet the acting was right for every part. The plot itself is just ... twisted! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie about someone being fucked! ??? BAM, this is who. Genius. Simply brilliant. Two thumbs up. I would be honored to work with him every day, at any time, on anything.
