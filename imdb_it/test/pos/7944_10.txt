In 1242, Russia was invaded from two sides: from the east by the Mongols and from the part of Europe, by the German Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. The population, to organize the defense of Novgorod and the lands of Russia, calls Prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who had defeated the Swede in a previous battle. His winning strategy defeats the Germans after a big battle on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 due to the German threat to Russia, in a pre-Second World War period. The idea was to make pro-Russian propaganda. However, it is a powerful, overwhelming, wonderful, surprising masterpiece. The scene of fighting on the frozen lake is incredible. The current generation is very used to special effects, like in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, and perhaps can't understand how fantastic this black and white fight is. If the viewer can forget the ideology and look at it as an art, in the end he will certainly be amazed by such a masterpiece. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
