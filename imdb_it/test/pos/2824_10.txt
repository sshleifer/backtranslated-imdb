Ok, first, to all the enemies: take a life! I don't see why you worry about posting on these boards, when you obviously don't know anything about movies, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This film has important lessons for all of us to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships and DESTINY. In reality, we are all robots, programmed to respond in certain ways to certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen a sunset and made some trivial comments without even thinking about it? I say, THANKS Aqua (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters) for making me stop and think about the fantastic power of mother nature. <br /> <br /> Only when Val and Aqua begin to refuse programming, they begin to understand their true desire: to find love and escape from the factory in search of a creative life. This film should be mandatory for viewing in prisons: just think of the dreams and hopes that could inspire inmates. perhaps they too could overcome their "bad" planning and join us in a world without crime. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I'm a better person for Heartbeeps.
