This short, an educational comic with Pepe Le Pew, is about a cat that thinks about solving all its problems by pretending to be a skunk. The problem is that it attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and really skunk person (our hero, Pepe, entering the left phase) is definitely more careful, let's say, than M. Cat would like. Every great plan has its own disadvantages, but this is a stopper! I wonder if Jack Warner got a call from Hays's office about whether Pepe and the object of his worship were both boys. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the birth of the Production Code. Successive "conquests" were clearly and decidedly feminine. A great cartoon, but Pepe is a character who works better as a focal point rather than a support. Worth watching. Recommended.
