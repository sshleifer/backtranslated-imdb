I can't believe it's been 25 years since I saw this story for the first time on TV. I remembered that I was very touched and was lucky to have the VHS tape several years ago. I haven't looked at it again until recently. I've always observed it. I must have seen it 10 times in the last two weeks. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb, the story is compelling, and I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't appreciated actor Bryan Brown's talent so far. The playful facial expressions shown in the first part - when he gave Jean the stolen medicine in Malaya is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages ​​shown in the second half: in their first drink with Caines and in the touring of the farm . We have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the final scene of the dance to see his show of affection for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in Malaysia. Who wouldn't want to be his Mrs. Boong? <br /> <br /> As Joe turned from a presumptuous, almost larger than the figure of life in the jungle of Malaya to an average Joe a little awkward in his own garden, Jean took the opposite path; her experience of war seems to have given her new confidence. He wasted no time and lost what he wanted. She took steps to take what she could get - just as Joe had once told her. <br /> <br /> For me, all these transformations help to demonstrate that this is more than just a love story - this is a story of growth, courage and fragility in life. The lawyer -Noel is both a sweet and sad figure. He also gave a lot to Jean - he gave his last hope of love. In the end, he did what true love requires - he put his happiness before his own. <br /> <br /> I happened to appreciate the struggle between Joe and Jean that was not in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary addition because it helped bring out the inner struggles they both had to face to make their life together possible. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even more deeply. <br /> <br /> I am however surprised to see B. Brown has blue eyes in the promotional photo shown on this site. He certainly didn't do it in "A city like Alice". Well, 25 years is a long time!
