I saw this movie when it was released for the first time and I loved it. What film. Now I'm 40 and I have 2 teenage children and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a love film or old Elton John music. <br /> <br /> I searched most of the stores that sell new and old movies but I've never seen any. <br /> <br /> I bought some old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong, which had a nice collection of old movies, but they didn't have this. <br /> <br /> I'm also looking at the sequel, Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of the VHS or DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> I really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
