In the changing world of the CG and anything else in cartoon animations, etc. Etc., Faeries was a warm welcome from me at least. I think it's important to show these types of films once in a while, to preserve them and help us remember where the originality and fun of cartoons comes from. People talked about how boring it is because of graphics and things but hey! think of the films that will be considered boring if every movie resembles the new states of art that everyone and their mother are doing these days. Call me old fashioned but I liked it. It's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings, and all they really need from his audience is their imagination.
