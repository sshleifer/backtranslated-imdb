I bought it for a dollar !!! I bought this movie for a dollar and I saw a lot worse for a lot more !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish science fiction film by Mark Stirton and according to The Making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $ 8000. Eight big !!! That wouldn't pay for half a minute in Hollywood !! However ---- This is the best funny movie. If you like gritty things, then you'll like it. These are some rough characters with rough voices and hard words. I didn't care, but my girlfriend did it !! The actors do a great job and it's interesting to see people I've never heard or seen before. It meant that I had no idea who would die first. <br /> <br /> If you watch a movie for its latest visual effects, look at a Star Wars. The effects here are OK, but rather weak in space. But monsters are very well made if a little like predators. <br /> <br /> Stirton does a fantastic job with not much and I'd like to see his performance in a real Hollywood movie. At least it wasn't predictable and I almost fell off my chair when a guy blew his head off !!! OK, so it's a bit derived from other science fiction, but for this budget it's an incredible attempt and anyone thinking of making a sci-fi movie for 8 g is easy or very clearly knows nothing about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good grades for a good movie, extra votes for working so hard, extra extras for a really interesting Making of. No standard bull here, all production problems went to make it like Lost in Mancha only with a movie at the end. But why no comment? KEEP THE SCOTS!
