The first time I saw it was when it came out (1994), and the last time I saw it was just before writing this review .. It still makes my brain laugh ... after all these years , it's not a good dose. Truly the smartest Bollywood comedy ever made. This is an Indian film that deserves its place in IMDb's Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are probably one of their best performances in comic roles. The thing that makes this a less classic moment is its comic timing and wonderful editing ... The jokes are refreshing and not cheap .. This is a film really ahead of its time. If you haven't seen it yet GO WATCH NOW !!!!!!!!!
