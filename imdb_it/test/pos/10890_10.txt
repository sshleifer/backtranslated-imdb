We all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi etc., but none of these can compare with GE007. The game itself is fantastic. I literally burned my N64 by playing this amazing game, along with Zelda OOT. This game alone built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters. moreover, the multi-player is fantastic. The Story mode itself deserves to be played hundreds of times. It's a great game for when you're at the table and you want to shoot some people and there are endless unlockable skills. (cheats, Aztecs, Egyptians, God knows how many Multiplayers have, and the three difficulties besides the famous difficulty '007' Our modern games are fantastic but when you sit and play this game you have a certain feeling that few other games and with the online features of the new shooting games we rarely see this old style out of two in a death match style, and when we do its not so close as this game and when you get bored of the story, there are endless mysteries, glitches and eggs Easter to discover and exploit. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time.
