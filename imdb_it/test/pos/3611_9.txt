"Captain Corelli's Mandolin" is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which can undermine its ardent followers. Yet, seen by itself, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting is not so bad !! Nicolas Cage was brilliant, so different from his usual action hero characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really keeps the film together. I think this film should be judged as an individual project, not tied to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up the rights to the film's screenplay, so the film is an interpretation by the director, John Maddon. Go see this movie with an open mind - you'll love it; because below is the touching story of love and war.
