The story of Tom Garner opens with his great funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifelong friend Henry. Henry and his wife argue about whether Tom was a great man and a genius or a worthless villain. The film is beautifully written, recited and directed, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a great railroad, dominating his board and his competition, terrorizing his employees, attacking butchers. Tom's ambitious wife, Sally, was responsible for all of Tom's success. When he met her, he was illiterate and completely satisfied with his job as a trackwalker for the railroad. Sally teaches him to read and take on his job as a trackwalker while Tom goes to school. He begins to climb one step at a time through the railway hierarchy until he eventually assumes the role of president. <br /> <br /> But as Tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to Sally gradually falls apart. His spoiled son despises him, and takes with a much younger woman (the appropriate name Eve), with predictably catastrophic consequences. In his working life, Tom is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. Just like the figure of Hearst in "Citizen Kane", Tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy is terrifying as Tom Garner and the business scenes sound authentic. Even Colleen Moore is excellent as Sally; both are aging wonderfully in multi-generational history. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but does not resemble the screwball comedies for which Sturges became famous.
