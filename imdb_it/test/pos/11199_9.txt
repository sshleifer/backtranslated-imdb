Perhaps many viewers who have been frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself. What I want to emphasize here is that "distant" is not just an arthouse film, but one of the best arthouse films. From all the arthouse films I've seen, "distant" is the one that stands out like a glittering piece of gold. It is also fair to say that the cinematography and the representation of human emotions in this film surpass Tarkovsky's Nostalgia. A commentator has understood well, that sex, a common and widespread trait among foreign films, is surprisingly lacking in "distant" and in a positive sense. The most remarkable thing about "distant" is that it captures the details of life that we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that is often buried by the din and visual extravagance of our commercialized world. Fortunately "distant" does not have much to spare for the public and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings.
