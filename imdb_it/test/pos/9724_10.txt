The series as a whole: the best work by Jim Henson. John Hurt * is * the Narrator. Often the Oscar-winning screenplays are not surprising considering that Minghella is writing. The acting of the caliber of Oscar, always. <br /> <br /> Sapsorrow - Everyone loves "The soldier and death", but something about "Sapsorrow" pushes her to a higher iota in my favor. In the first dance scene, costumes, music - perfection. Hurt and the dog typically interact with the story, but this time Minghella pushes him back into that "ring" scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between the characters is particularly well developed, more than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Seen? Watch it again. Pay more attention (to those of you who don't fanatically love this piece of 22-minute cinematic perfection). Never seen? I'm so, so sorry. <br /> <br /> Luck Child - unsophisticated as Sapsorrow, but very clever in itself. This is a story of irony. Irony on irony, inside irony ... I love it. Each character is acted to perfection, except for the ferryman. He was doing a drama; everyone else was making romantic comedies. I lose it. This is my favorite of the mostly comic episodes, "Sapsorrow" and "The Soldier and Death" are examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Side note: Greek myths. What is lacking in the subtlety of Minghella (a different writer) compensates him in part with audacity as it portrays the four myths chosen with more sympathy, respect and history than usual. Also look forward to Jim Henson if you can put it in your hands. For the adept of storytellers, he presents The Man Who Introduces the Myths, the Lion of "True Bride" and ... No bored opening themes! Half Storyteller, pure and genuine half dumb.
