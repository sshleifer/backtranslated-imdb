I saw this film in the theater when I was 14 and it changed my life. I immediately cut my hair and started buying all the records from the film's bands. These were some of the seminal bands of L.A. punk rock captured in the film at the height of their powers. Groups like Black Flag (pre-Rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and Germs have few equals in the history of punk music. I can't believe this movie was never released on video or DVD. Great movie for punk rock fans.
