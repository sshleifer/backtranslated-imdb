Despite the subsequent claims, this melodrama from the first dialogues has very little in common with "Citizen Kane": it is a biographical film of a ruthless but human fake plutocrat, told in flashback but jumping over time. The writer, Preston Sturges, does not show any of his latest gifts for a brilliant dialogue, and none of Kane's innumerable cinematographic innovations is evident. Still, he is very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-fashioned make-up makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) who shows depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a little past his height, physically well matched - interpreting a multi-faceted woman behind the man. There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in the history of cinema, sending the third final in ecstatic reverberations of soap operas. The surviving press is nervous and lacks fragments of audio, and there are some holes in the plot left open (how would he know who his son was if he slept with both?), And the music is terribly hokey. For all this, I was quite fascinated.
