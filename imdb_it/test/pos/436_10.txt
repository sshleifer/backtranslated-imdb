I just saw the wonderful Jean Renoir film, French Can Can. It's a visual pleasure and great fun. The newly produced Moulin Rouge pales in comparison. I have not received all the praise that the recent film has received. Now I am more than ever convinced that my assessment was correct after seeing a master director like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He managed to get great performances from all his cast, and the great French actor, Jean Gabin, was in a rare form. The dance sequence towards the end was one of the most exciting I've ever seen. It was long, but I didn't want it to end. This film deserves to receive more awards than it has.
