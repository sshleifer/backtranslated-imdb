Based on a short story by William Faulkner, Two Soldiers is a first-rate short film, a film that has enough history, excitement and great cinematography for a feature film and certainly leaves you even more at the end. The story involves two dirty poor Mississippi brothers, one just a child, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. His younger brother, brilliantly played by newcomer Jonathan Furr, does not want to let his older brother go, and he embarks on a mission to join the army. Ron Perlman gives a gruff but moving touch as the army colonel decides to help the child. <br /> <br /> Because it's only 39 minutes, this gem will be hard to find (it will most likely be confined to the festival circuit for now), but remember the name Aaron Schneider - this photo marks him as a director to watch .
