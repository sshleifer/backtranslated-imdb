LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, thrilling HBO-TV film, full of excitement based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role). This joyful cinematic experience is centered on the guardian of childhood of Santiago-Hudson, Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a woman of strong color and a big heart who ran a pension in the north of the state of New York in the 50s. The nanny was a social services organization with a single woman whose pension was full of drunken, derelict, lame, drug addicts, maladjusted and all the others in the city who needed a dispatch instead of a pantry. The core of the story revolves around Nanny's relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so Nanny took him. S. Epatha Merkeson, who has been wasted for years on Lieutenant Van Buren's thankless role in NBC's LAW & ORDER, turns into a powerhouse performance like Nanny, the mother-figure of the neighborhood whose pension has become a symbol for the oppressed blacks in his city. Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. Merkeson is supported by an impressive cast that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons, Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as an adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely marked, this is a unique cinematic experience that works on all levels, but if for no other reason, it's worth seeing the electrifying performance starring S. Epatha Merkeson, which is given the role of a life and takes full advantage of it
