I recently saw this movie and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> the best way to watch this film is not to expect what you have seen in the past from Miyazaki. Miyazaki is well known for his work on Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. however for western viewers. both films were similar but at the same time completely different. However Ponyo is a completely different kind of story and animation all together. <br /> <br /> The story follows "Ponyo" a fish that has the face of a girl. After Ponyo escapes from his house at the bottom of the sea, he finds a new world that he never knew was out there, and even new troubles, when she was caught by a fishing boat, was saved by a five-year-old boy known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. Can Ponyo really stay with Sosuke forever? <br /> <br /> I feel that the film was inspired by "The Little Mermaid" and at the same time similar to "Tonari no Totoro" <br /> <br /> the film is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this film. But the Characters are a fish and a kid, so how much do you expect to know about them? the film is set on what appears to be 3 days, I think this is why the film is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you enjoy this movie too
