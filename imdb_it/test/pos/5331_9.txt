Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to prison for the murder of an autistic child. When pressing with the question "Why?" he has no answer. While in prison he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps Leland understand why he did it. In this film we learn all about Leland's troubled life, including his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and all his sad life. <br /> <br /> This film is Matthew Ryan Hoge's second film and is almost spectacular in any case. This is a movie that will eventually leave you thinking and ask you how it works. The film is rather obscure, but if you can handle it, you will realize how beautiful a film is. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is no villain. There is no one to blame for anything that happens. There are no stereotypes, and the public does not try to prove that Leland is guilty. Instead, we sit down, relax and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the course of the film. All the problems represented in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parental expectations, overwhelming sadness; they all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling offers one of the greatest performances of his career in this film, like the depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and doesn't care much about his son. The only person he loves is Becky, but he has his problems. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the film, "You want a reason, but maybe there isn't one. Maybe it's something that just happened." There's a reason, but we don't find out until the end. As you watch the film, the audience is surprised that such a young person can know the world so much. Leland notes things that people tend to ignore. <br /> <br /> A particularly inspiring scene that really struck me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl. Pearl has just betrayed his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl replies that he is only human. Then Leland says something that never happens to anyone: "Why do people say that only when they did something wrong?" <br /> <br /> Another fantastic acting job was offered by Chris Klein. In the film he plays Allen Harris, the boyfriend of Becky's sister, Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I was amazed at how profound his character was. You can relate a lot with Allen. You know how much he cares about the Pollard family. It is as if they were his own flesh and blood. At the end of the film, you realize how far it would have gone to help them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a masterpiece that has been overlooked by quite a few people. If, however, you take the time to look at it, you will most likely see that everything I mentioned above is true. And once you've finished watching it, you'll never look at the world the same way again. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
