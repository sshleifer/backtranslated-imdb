The biggest compliments to other commentators here on IMDb who wondered why this series didn't "hang" in its time to last much longer than many other series in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> It is not true that the series would have deteriorated if it continued further. <br /> <br /> At the end of this post I will post some thoughts on other film realizations, rather: the attempts of the legend of Robin Hood. <br /> <br /> First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, live forever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is more fun than both, if desired, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agree with the mostly new and revolutionary discoveries of the history records of Terry Jones on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and the Barbarians, the Middle Ages and the Crusades (... yes , THE Monthy Python- Terry Jones): <br /> <br /> If you have seen those genial and amusing Jones-Docs, you will do better to better understand all the historical stories of Carpenter, the writer of Sherwood's Robin series (which it happens to be the brother of John Carpenter, who did "The Thing", their third brother makes music), destined to tell us. <br /> <br /> The "Dick Turpin" writer, "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "Robin of Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my cinema lord. He is better than all those who criticize his "sword-and-sorcery" or "deficiency" element (taken from Robin of Sherwood Webring) in this series (which I can't see) or which have other unfounded criticisms of which he existed a lot then and now. <br /> <br /> That's why, when you get to know this "Robin of Sherwood" better, you'll be strict. At first you will detest the third season. Not only: I went through this, and moreover I only took the first two seasons in my deepest heart - despite the fact that Robin's actor Praed left this series, because after the series he had a huge success, he was offered a probably better paid role in a completely ridiculous Canadian series entitled "The new Adeventures of Jules Verne" - the title already reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, and not for fame, he didn't attack with his band and relatives, I mean: like actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who personally represent the after "really", in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been left to blossom much more without any degrading level of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues. <br /> <br /> Once again, obligatory to say: a change of the main role was forced by the stupid decision of Praed to leave Robin of Sherwood for a stupid series of remakes of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven in the filming of the history. However, in some respects it is a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> In any case: if one is informed about this, and that Connery was perhaps advertised by his father, but that the young Connery HAS NOT EVERYTHING, "he chases Praed away", as I have first thought in a prejudicial way, so you can absolutely enjoy the third season. Sad here is that the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have that critical and free historical background such as in "The Witch of Elsdon ", or in" The King's Fool ", two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. === <br /> <br />" Don't trust the Lion! "<br /> <br /> Unlike many other characters who wanted him dead for his power of gain, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John or others, but he used it only for his evil idea of ​​the crusade and the war against Normandie in France more than dozens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the "wholy" crusades, and their soldiers also devoured the children they killed out of starvation or poverty. Beyond that, after his capture by the Saracens (Muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed for his ransom, 100,000 marks (at the time, 11th century, comparable to about 30 billion - 30,000,000 '000 .- Dollars of current value), to bring him back to safety, and then he just visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) for the crusades (we learn that in the episode "The King's Fool"). For this new crusade, perhaps a sort of revenge for his capture, Richard Lionheart again "drains the land of money" (quoted from the mouth of Clive Mantle, when he teaches Robin to be critical even with the King). Robin criticizes this war as a non-social sentence of Richard, turns to Richard himself, telling him "The poor have given everything to make you free, how can you ask more of them?" - Richard: "... Give me your courage and your strength, not your words!" ... Later, in private, Richard orders the assassination of Robin ... <br /> <br /> So the crusaders were the real "barbarians". <br /> <br /> PS: Already when I was watching Kostner in 91, I got angry, because later, I discovered in the course of history at school that Richard was not as nice as shown by Sean Connery in his appearance at the end of " Prince of the Thieves ". Well, as Terry Jones would say: it's a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean plays humorists and charismatics, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of" Robin of Sherwood ". <br /> <br /> Again: Praed is, according to my information so far, the one who has left Sherwood for a stupid Verne series that no one with the brain will ever remember or want to remember.
