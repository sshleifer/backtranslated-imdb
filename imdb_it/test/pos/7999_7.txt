Batman Returns is considered quality when it comes to superhero movies. His predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the largest and most well thought of the comic book genre. To say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she did not completely watch the film and considered the acting of Danny Devito as the penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The story of Batman should be dark and Tim Burton realized how the comic portrays Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and should not be seen as "disgusting", although we all have a right to our opinions.
