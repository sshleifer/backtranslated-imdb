The working class bearer Perks (Mr B.Cribbins), proudly and defiantly, is eventually conquered by the upper-middle class of the family. Father (Mr I.Cuthbertson) jailed for treason - for which the punishment was death in those days, for fear he was forgotten), mother (the beautiful Miss D. Sheridan) courageous and resourceful, loyal and loving, and - mainly - older daughter (Miss J. Agutter) who staggers over the height of adolescence - wounded and confused about her father's fate. Mr Perks, like many workers of his time, will have nothing to do with anything he considers a "charity" slap and it is a key moment in the film when he finally accepts that the birthday presents that have been given to him by children do not compromise its principles. Although the adorable Miss Agutter has received all the awards is Mr Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose performances dominate "The Railway Children". Both know how Edwardian society operates from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is a tacit mutual respect and understanding between them. But this is basically a family film. At a time when a mother can kidnap her daughter and keep her in ransom and be considered "socially inept" rather than unfit to live in a decent society, and when two "human beings" can beat and beat a child to death without being accused of murder, the "family" can be seen as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist and even homophobic concept, but a century ago it was the glue that kept society together at all levels. Mr. Cribbins' and Miss Sheridan's families are archetypal in age. Strong and loving, sticking to external influences, integral units with a moral certainty derided in the 21st century. Mr. Lionel Jeffries may seem a politically boring and boring brochure in a delightful hymn to hope, faith, optimism and courage. That all those attributes were once considered the norm and that they are now too often the object of contempt and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than on Miss Nesbit. No one with more than a passing concern for the human condition may not be very touched by this pretty perfect movie.
