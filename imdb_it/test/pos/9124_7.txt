Meville's caper film is not as good as his most famous film, the delightfully elegant "Le Samourai (1968)". I don't even think this is the best example of the beloved sub-genre of robbery. The main thing against the film is its long execution time. Meville has this tendency to focus on too many trivial details. He could have told the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons I don't understand, the film seems to go on forever. However, the film is never boring. Melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very cool thief. The film's must-see color photography is a great asset and Melville uses sound (or lack of sound) very effectively. From a technical point of view, the film is practically flawless. Sometimes, one has the feeling that Meville is simply performing, but when someone is as talented as he is, one has little reason to complain. I still like the other robbery films (Jules Dassin's Topkapi (1964), "just to name one), but there's no denying that this film is a nice piece of entertainment with the pulp and a good example of that that people refer to as "cool" cinema.
