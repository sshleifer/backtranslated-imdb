Oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time! the best word to describe it is "genius"! writing, acting, narrative lines ... everything about this show is absolutely amazing! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the show and became addicted immediately and I was really surprised that it didn't get the recognition it truly deserves. It's violent and most of the characters aren't meant to please you, but the show is so brilliantly written that it allows you to look beyond violence and criminals and see them as real people. They are the lowest forms of scum, but still find a way to allow you to understand many characters and even to worry about their stories. <br /> <br /> Violence in the show is necessary to be as realistic as possible, but the show is not about violence as some might believe. It is truly a work of art and I am sure that those who will ever give it the chance will love it as much as I do.
