Brown returned to his role from the previous year (in "Slaughter") for this rough follow-up film. In the original, he had avenged the killing of his parents by wiping out a huge mass organization in Mexico. Here, it is he who is pursued (retaliated against) by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first murder attempt fails, Brown is back in action, kicking gangs from all over the group as he tries to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was, on the whole, a better and more coherent film, this offers all aspects of exploitation in much heavier doses, making it more pleasing to fans of the genre. Apart from a squalid opening on horseback and an authentic deadly machine that runs through a city street at night, this video follows at a very lively pace. Every few minutes one or more of the following items appear: drug use, sex, nudity, shooting, murder or some other action. Brown is his usual trustworthy, lovable, aided by his extraordinary physical presence, which does much to ignore any rigidity in his acting. McMahon is a revolt! With his colored glasses and his hair split in half (!), He is shown showing his orders to his gang of thugs and is heard making passionate love with his fur baby. Seeing Johnny Carson's side in a role like this is a perverse thrill. Stroud has the impression of being a violent killer, racially bigoted, while Peters only adds a touch of class to a standing police detective who enlists Brown's help. Unfortunately, no mention is made of Brown's original helpers Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is quite nice but lacks the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes an outrageous breakthrough like a pimp who can apparently take a girl from a bar and make him an instant member of his harem. Cinematography and general direction are less lucid than in the first film, but this has a boost and a sense of danger that exceed the sensations of the original. The film spends a lot of time in the sewers of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but retains interest through the creativity of his action scenes and the now surprising lack of political correctness. A strange note: a key protagonist of the first film was shown shot to death, but appears here in a different role.
