gone with the wind and the scarlett are two different films that should never have been compared, obviously the original actors in gwtw are all dead and deserved their prize and separate praise I loved gwtw and I never expected a sequel to be done or never lived up to half the praise of gwtw but for my shock scarlett was written just as well and it worked as gwtw scarlett in its own right deserves so much reward that I can now honestly say that I don't know which one I like best I think the script for Scarlett it was a perfect number 1 'as a sequel. Good boy! producer director and screenwriter Bravo! Since sequels rarely live up to their name, this is the same as its predecessor. For those who don't like it, you miss the point and a fantastic ending at the phenomenal beginning
