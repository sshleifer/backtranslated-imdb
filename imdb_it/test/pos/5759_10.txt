I've been a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson ever since I can remember his youth or his past. and I just have to say that I've never laughed so much in my whole life !!! heaven guest house is bloody! I know it won't be a cup of tea for everyone (with vomit, slapstick comedy, violence and vulgar language) but then don't look at it if it's not yours. it's not like anyone knows what sick and twisted things Rik and Ade do when they work together! I think it's unfair that this movie was received by critics because, and I don't think I'm the only one to think that, this movie is 10 out of 10! :)
