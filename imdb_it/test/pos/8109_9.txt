.. this film was made when Hitler (and Mussolini who is also in the film) was at the top and many politicians and even the Roman Church used to close their eyes to the brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in the United States there were many people who did not understand what was really happening in Germany and Europe (Charles Lindenbergh for example). It would be like today a great actor would have made a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin may have made many mistakes in his life, but this is indeed a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO was a brave demonstration. The film is fun and profound, the final speech has terrible strength and is still updated. I think this film is one of the best ever made.
