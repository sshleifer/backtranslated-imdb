I'd like to know if "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD in the future? And is the music (Tema Title) available on CD? <br /> <br /> There was only a series of 13 episodes of this drama and would have to switch to at least three or even four series in total. <Br /> <br /> The young German actor of the series was also present in a German television series called "Black Forest Clinic" broadcast here in the United Kingdom with an English dialogue overlaid with lip-synching. <br /> <br /> I look forward to hearing comments from TV Industry staff on the questions above, thanks in advance.
