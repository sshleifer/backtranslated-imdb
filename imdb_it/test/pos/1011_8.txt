I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime in the early 1980s. I say strangely because it's rather a ridiculous piece of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. Dialogue is pompously and without philosophical meaning (it makes sense, no doubt, only for Franco-Italian producers) and the completely extraneous plot. What you get is a wonderfully hypnotic and pleasantly pleasant state of mind. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), the soft-focus nudity and the splendid soundtrack all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film production that is rarely seen today. It is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures". I was lucky enough to find it on an old laserdisc and saw it more times than I think is healthy. A good moodpiece.
