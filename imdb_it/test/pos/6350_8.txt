This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle way, something that sets him apart from most films with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good at "Koma") in what appears to be an inexplicable situation at first sight. He has been married for 20 years with Ching (the great Anita Mui, in his last role before she was cruelly taken by us), and it seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to take care of her and Mr. Lam's former teacher, Choy and Mr. Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the film so beautiful is the rhythm of director Ann Hui. It takes a while to discover the secrets of the Lamsm and everything makes sense. The film is very dramatic and moving. You don't feel any repulsion for the teacher / student situation, something that elevates this film over many with the same plot. It's slow, but stay with it. Also, enjoy the wonderful, unreliable but beautiful performance of Mrs. Mui. She was and is a very special person and in this film you fall in love with her one last time. It is worth the time to testify and just be there with her.
