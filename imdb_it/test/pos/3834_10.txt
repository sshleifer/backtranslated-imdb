This must be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original TV series. <br /> <br /> What makes it great is the battle of wits between The Romulan Commander and Kirk, as well as the high-level acting of Mark Lenard, who later continued to play Spock's father in other episodes and TV movies. This is a case where those around the level of talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy and the entire cast offer an exceptional performance in this episode. <br /> <br /> Even the writing and the plot are excellent, and I love the direct approach used to show us the characters, feelings and thoughts of those characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> This very funny episode ranks 10 out of 10. FANTASTIC !! Desert-Buddha
