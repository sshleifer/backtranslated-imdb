Others have commented on the strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you would see when you participated in a live performance. The feet, the faces, the general view. Unfortunately, it falls a little short. But having said that, looking at Colin Dunne is gratifying anyway. It's an interesting contrast with Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is obvious, the changes from the original Dublin production are obvious. <br /> <br /> "Trading Taps" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion. Tarik Winston is incredible, as is his partner in the piece. <br /> <br /> I think the audio was better in this version than the original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 on DVD it is excellent. <br /> <br /> Despite the imperfect videography, it is a must for Riverdance fans.
