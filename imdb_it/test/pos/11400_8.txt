It is not so much a review as a testament that has shown, once again, that the Academy rewards money, not artistic achievement. And I must say that I am saddened by the fact that this group of members of imbd, usually artistic and intelligent, has left this place in the top 250. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and brave through script, direction and acting. Very few films can boast this triple crown.
