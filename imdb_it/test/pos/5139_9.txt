Hoot is a nice film for young people from a group of middle school kids who try to keep a chain of pancake houses from the bulldozer of a piece of land that houses some endangered burrowing owls. The acting is quite good and the fresh faces are beautiful to look at. Many famous comedians are in this film and maintain almost uninterrupted humor. It's a film for young people, maybe 5 to 11 years old. I thought it was a nice change of pace compared to adult films that pervade the screen these days. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or children. It's just a bit of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming too developed. If you can remember the day when you didn't fight for a dollar, you might remember that money isn't everything. Not many people over the age of 12 will be able to enjoy it unless they really have a weakness for the special post-school series.
