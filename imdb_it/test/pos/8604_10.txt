This is a rather faithful adaptation of the novel by Masuji Ibuse, "Black Rain". Like the book, it is very moving and stimulating. The story revolves around a couple's attempts to see their niece successfully married. They are having trouble finding suitors due to a voice suffering from radiation sickness, after walking through Hiroshima on the day of the attack. Well shot, well acted, moving, tragic, horrible and funny.
