Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except to party all the time. When Bill leaves his mother's house to live alone, he faces many problems, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to maintain the rent, but proceeds to overthrow Bill's life. This film is an endless comedy from beginning to end and is one of my favorites. The soundtrack includes guitar violinist Edward Van Halen throughout the film, as well as featuring cameos by rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. The legend of the 70s pornstar Kitten Navidad also makes an appearance! The classic 80s movie is worth more looks. Now all that needs to be done is a long awaited version of the DVD! If you enjoyed this movie, take a look at "The Last American Virgin" which is similar to "Wild Life". I consider both highly.
