This is halfway to being a top movie. The opening section, which sucks Hollywood's "social message" films, is absolutely brilliant. It is a riot from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The second section, which introduces us to the main characters of the story, is really fantastic. We have a lot of fantastic comic book setups, top-notch performances, and the dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> The only thing that really annoyed me about this however is the ending, which in my opinion contradicts everything that happened before . My interpretation was that this film was leading all the crazy prejudices and allusions of small town gossip and national tabloid sensationalism. I loved the fact that the film supported the cause that a person's sexuality is NOT determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or otherwise. And then the ending goes and reinforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the film has been successful with. Turns out that everyone was 100% right !!! (Godamit!) This was very disappointing for what was actually a great story.
