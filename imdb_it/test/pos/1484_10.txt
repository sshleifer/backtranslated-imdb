This is one of my favorite T.V shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is simply a genius! And it is right that I chose this to be my 1000 review!. I can't begin to tell you how much I love Mr. Bean, he is the man, and what amazes me, is how he comes out of these incredibly difficult situations, and he is always so creative, besides deserving even the merits of Robyn Driscoll! he is also a genius! My favorite piece that he did is Mr. Bean's Amazing Adventures and while everyone else is amazing, this remains my real favorite, plus I hope the show didn't stop so soon! Each episode is brilliantly written, and all have been masterfully directed, plus Each episode is a classic in my eyes! This show is incredibly popular, and I can definitely see why, it's probably the most fun show ever. The actors of the character played all the roles very well, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (as Irma). This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Rowan Atkinso is simply a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (perhaps the best!), And it's right that I chose this to be my 1000 revisions f you didn't see this show, forget what you're doing now and go give look, you will not regret it, believe me it is one of the best TV programs ever! and I will continue to watch the show over and over again, I never get tired! , Mr. Bean Rules! ***** on 5
