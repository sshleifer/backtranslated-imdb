This was an excellent film. I look after a child I'm raising who has FAE and watching this film was more than the word can explain. I also bought the book and it was fantastic. I would like to have a copy for my personal use so I can have my child's teachers supervised as well. I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this film, let me use it for a while or refer someone to me where I could buy it. Thank you, Myra, I would recommend this film to anyone dealing with children / adults with special abilities. This film should be shown again on TV. The team of doctors who followed my son would also like to have a copy. His special teacher Ed also asked me to look for a copy he can have or can borrow. <br /> <br /> Thanks
