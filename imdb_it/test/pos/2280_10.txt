Mr Baseball was a fun video rental with my girlfriend Susan Nauss. Susan said she couldn't wait to see the movie. Ken Takakura Oda as a difficult but honorable manager makes sense. Ken Takakura has made so many wonderful Asian films, I correct the only reviewer and I say that Takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like Hotari. Obviously everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the best dramatic actor of the two. Today someone accused me of being Yakuza, well, I say that myself, my great uncle Shadow Jack F Kennedy and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our co-creators humans are free people who fight all the parts of adversity that President Kennedy spoke in his inaugural speech. To be honest, someone has kept food prices very low in Canada on things like bread. In honor of our CoCreators, stop eating reptile amphibians and eggs. I hope one day there will be a sequel to Mr Baseball with Father Ken Takakura Oda still as Manager. Thanks to IMDb for supporting free speech like kindly President George W. Bush and I support.
