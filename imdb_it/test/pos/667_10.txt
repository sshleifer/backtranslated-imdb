Who ever put this review as "in bad taste" is not quite there ... it's so fun, brilliant and fantastic that you can watch it until your eyes are squared! not to mention the rest of the work he did on the rest of the series ... everything is as good as Morris's standards. if you think it's 'horrible', 'disgusting' or 'sick', then I can only think of something to say to you: "go to hell". Thank you. had to be said! I think the way so many people complained was a complete joke ... I would like to cry out to all the people who actually did it: "Have you nothing better to do with your time? Are you trying to prove it? "thank you for reading my review full of heart on the subject ... cheers
