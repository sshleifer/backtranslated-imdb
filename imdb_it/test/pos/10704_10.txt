Unlike the previous poster, I liked the celluloid treatment. It looked nice and made the movie much more enjoyable to watch. For me, it has by no means diminished the power of the documentary content. In fact, I felt that the lightness of the look allowed me to lose much more in the content. The previous poster was right to compare the style to a Nike commercial; it definitely has that aspect. But for my taste, it worked very well (and I'm far from a fan of Nike's commercials). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is how the documentary film should be made. I look forward to seeing the next installments of these promising filmmakers.
