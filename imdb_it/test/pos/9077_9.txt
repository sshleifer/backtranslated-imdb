* SPOILERS dishes * <br /> <br /> Five med students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) decide try an experiment; die for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum time that someone can do before running the risk of brain damage). Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy is the only exception, but they start having unwanted visitors; David sees a black girl throwing him rough insults, Joe sees all the women he had sex with (and who filmed) asking him why from TV Screen, Rachel relives his father's suicide and Nelson confronts a boy with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Why am I here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting film, set in a hallucinated city and in a Gothic Med School, is rather the experience, both for the story and for the characters, played by successful stars such as Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland on "Lost Boys", and this second collaboration is even better than the first. <br /> <br /> A must for psycho-thriller-horror twins and metaphors lovers (this story is about forgiveness and the correction of past mistakes), this is one of the minor classics of the 80s who get I also respect today, like the mention of Rebecca Gayheart in "Scream" 2 'or the Tru Calling episode that used the premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners: 9/10.
