The creative team that brought us Police Squad - and the Naked Gun derived from it - stated in the interview that the contact with the network had told him that the show would be canceled after the first episode was delivered. Basically, the show was never given any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that, for the show, the audience would really have to watch it; most of the shows are presented on TV with the knowledge that the spectator needed to get up and lose a few minutes while taking food, or going to the bathroom, etc. <br /> <br /> The humor of the show is extremely dry (it does not use the laughter track) and the universe in which the characters live is where everything can happen, regardless of logic, until it is absolutely incredible; therefore, for example in one episode a surgeon must bribe an informant on the street to get a suggestion about a heart surgery. <br /> <br /> Those familiar with Naked Gun films should be advised that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films. In the films, Nielsen has developed a particular "take" approach - that is, eyes wide open to the unexpected. This does not happen on the show, where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected for him. Also, there are no novels on the show and no MTV parody. Finally, the show takes some risks that the films avoid; in the first episode, Drebin, to "reconstruct the crime", has a team of homicide detectives who shoot themselves from a series of different angles: ballistics the hard way. This is actually a bit risky of humor, since we have to accept that it's perfectly normal for cops to kill themselves while investigating a crime, for no other reason than experimenting. This kind of thing rarely happens in movies. <br /> <br /> Taken individually, each of the episodes is actually more fun than any Naked Gun movie, since they are both more compact (more happens in a shorter time -frame), even more enjoyable (not there is no hurry for a final heartbeat as sometimes happens in the movies). There are some inconsistencies that occur in films (mainly "2" and "3") that never occur in the shortest time frame of the show. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is no doubt that the Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you watch the television series episode after episode in a single session, the dry quality of humor could wear down tolerance. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it would be useful to have a DVD of this, and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has, as some claim, medicinal value, watching this show is good for health.
