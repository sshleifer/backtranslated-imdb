While I can't say if Larry Hama has ever seen any of the old cartoons, I would think that writing cartoons, cards and some of the comics would mean something. <br /> <br /> For fans of the old cartoon, this is pretty much a continuation of the same, except with some new characters - and a crazier Cobra commander. <br /> <br /> We still have all the old favorites, but on a personal note, one thing that always annoyed me was this "Duke in charge" stuff, when instead there are tons of other * officers * in round. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences are similar to the old series; the main trick here seems to be the CGI. Overall it's pretty good, if not a little over the top.
