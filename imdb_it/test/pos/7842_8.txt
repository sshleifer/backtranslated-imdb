Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all his glory (that is, on top of his acting form and at the peak of his physical charm), but the "women" depicted are hardly typical of the South, then or now. The girls of the boarding school are incredibly naive, some show signs of becoming truly depraved women, and Geraldine Page, full blown in its corruption, barely represents the meaning when it comes to female school directors, both then and now. (This does not mean that there is no occasional bad apple in any barrel.) Mr. Eastwood said that this is one of his two favorite movies. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" has an original plot, lots of interesting characters and many surprises in store for the viewer. It's completely addictive and fun but not really realistic. (I know, having grown up in the South and attended a girls' school and a college. Also, I got to know countless girls who did the same, not to mention their relaxed teachers, or you could even say "repressed professors" " who were very far from the principal represented here.) She is definitely comical in her portrayal of a kind woman from the South who is not quite what she seems. <br /> <br /> This film was a bit outrageous when it was the first appeared and still is, I think, but you won't regret spending your time watching it.
