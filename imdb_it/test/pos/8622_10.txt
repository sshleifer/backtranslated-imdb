I liked the movie, but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a bomb. He didn't look 100% like John, but he favored him from afar. I look forward to seeing it more on the big screen. He didn't have John's charisma, but he certainly has a charm for himself. He has beautiful eyes and a big smile. It reminds me of my boyfriend. Mrs Bissett was too light for me. He would have to check his asthma. I'm not going to comment on Darryl Hannah's character. My mom always said, "If you can't say anything nice, then shut up!" so that's what I'll do. <br /> <br /> Molly
