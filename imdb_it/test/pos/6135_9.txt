Like most other reviewers, I really liked this TV mini-series. I didn't see it when it came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war movies - happened to record it in 1989. I remember seeing it in my grandparents' cabin one night and I was completely involved in the story! It has a very intriguing storyline and a good mix of drama, romance and espionage. I have seen many films set during the Second World War, but none with a twist like this! Fortunately, I was able to make a copy of the VHS film several years ago. I've seen it several times since and still enjoy it. I would like this film to be released on DVD. It would be much easier to see with the chapters.
