For a film by a director, this is a simply fantastic film, although I must admit that it is a bit difficult to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch it, given that the film takes a definitive position in favor of assisted suicide . However, what I liked about the film is that I had no idea what the film was until the film was half completed and by then I was already conquered. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent way in which the subject was presented, I was amazed by the very professional style of the film - with some of the best cinema I have ever seen in a short film. Furthermore, this camera work was combined so well with the music and images that made the film simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a controversial film. I myself struggle with what I think of this debate, but the film managed to make a statement so literally and intelligently, I really have to respect the team that made this film.
