When one thinks of Soviet cinema, Eisenstein's propaganda masterpieces or Tarkovsky's dark meditations usually come to mind. They are great safe films, but generally they are not the funniest material out there. However, the countries within the Iron Curtain apparently enjoyed their evasive musicals as much as the states. In fact, from the 1930s to the 1970s, around forty of these singing cantankeries were made public by the public. However, they are completely unknown in the West, so this documentary attempts to correct this situation. It does a fantastic job both to show these films and to put them in the right cultural context. Although I was never a fan of musicals, I found this documentary completely compelling from beginning to end. Show that, no matter how many movies you see in your life, you're just touching the surface of what's out there. <br /> <br /> As for the movie clips themselves, I'm very funny. While some of the musicals are a blatant propaganda that shows the workers the song of how much they love to work under the regime, some of the films (in particular the following ones) seem quite realized from a production standpoint. Moreover, they are all extremely fierce because of how alien they are to my Western eyes. There are some similarities between them and the American musicals I'm used to, but the presence of a strict government that imposes a message gives them a surreal advantage. They certainly do not resemble Western-made musicals. This documentary is one of the most bizarre and amusing films I have seen in recent memory, and is absolutely not to be missed for a cinema fan.
