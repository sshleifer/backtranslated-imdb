Actually I accidentally reversed the Lifetime channel, right at the beginning of the movie, and ended up watching it. <br /> <br /> Surely this is a serious problem, probably more widespread than we think, in terms of this type of attack by a young woman by an ego-manic comrade-student who feels she is at above the system, and, unfortunately, often it is. <br /> <br /> The cast here was credible and the performances credible. A lot of these Canadian / Lifetime films are definitely "over-the-top". However, this is one I could label as "under-the-top". <br /> <br /> While appreciating the fact that it was not presented in an exaggerated way, this film somehow looked like a record that was reproduced a speed lower than the correct one, the 96 minutes seemed many more, and had the 'effect of looking like a shorter film, repeated in sequence, apparently turned on and turned on and turned on - before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion. <br /> <br /> However, the engaging characters and performances made him better than the average film of this type, despite these criticisms. <br /> <br /> And while these images often "milk" the climax, this one could have given it a little more detail and length.
