This film took me by surprise. I have the habit of finding out as little as possible about the films before participating because the trailers and reviews provide spoilers after the spoiler. All I knew on entering the theater was that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers were giving a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users rated it at 7.9 and the critics earned an average of 8.2! If anything, they have UNDERRATO this little gem. <br /> <br /> The director Doug Block has decided to register his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the necessary interviews with his parents, the frank mother Mina and less than the next dad , Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and I had no idea where the director would take us (Mike & Mina's son, Doug). As a matter of fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected twists and this wonderfully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely compelling from beginning to end and it is truly unmissable even if you are not a fan of the documentary genre. This movie will make you think about your life and could even conjure up memories that you thought had long been forgotten. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare cinematic experiences that makes a profound impression and never leaves you. The best news is that HBO has had a hand in production so instead of playing with a limited audience, in the end, millions of people will have the chance to see this incredible work. GOOD BOY!!!!!!!!
