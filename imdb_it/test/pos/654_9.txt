VERY memorable comedy. It is fun to watch the numerous situations develop and eventually converge after a long journey on that largest collection of eclectic humanity (and the largest honky-tonk in the world) - the great American Freeway. Like "... crazy and crazy world" has a lot of contemporary talent, old politics, good comic action and dialogue. Unlike what the target is looking for, not the unsuspecting seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they move along America's great road. Nor does it bear the burden of having a big fallen who is saved only at the end by a big belly laugh. But the sequence of the final stunts is nothing short of spectacular with excellent editing, humor and timing, and the scene of the big city bank is exhilarating with very original acting in particular of a very talented character. The total aplomb of the inhabitants of the city in front of the chaos leaves a sensation similar to the proverbial fly on the ceiling. The slapstick is fun, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen up close because it is surprisingly full of nuances and character reactions that are easily lost. All in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are, good or bad, and the silly situations in which we find ourselves. It was just meant to be FUN and that's it!
