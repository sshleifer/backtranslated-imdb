To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. This is well written and has a fantastic cast. It is not loaded with blood and guts. And he focuses on a disgraced policeman and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and finally the person that happens to enter his hack in that episode. You are likely to find something similar in your city NO. It's still a good story YES. And it's nice to see a man interpreted as a good father despite his faults. Watch more than one (2-3) and you'll see why many of us are excited about this show. And thank you David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
