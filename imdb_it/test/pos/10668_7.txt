Written by science fiction veterans Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This spatial fantasy is rightly directed by Robert Parrish. The experienced American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) accepts a manned flight to the far side of the sun. The mission will be controlled by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his Euro Sec Space Agency scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry) will accompany Ross. The two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the exact same orbit of the Earth ... except that it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one to return to earth and has an incredible story to tell. The special effects could be better than the plot. However fun to watch. The cast also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
