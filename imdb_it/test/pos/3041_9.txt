John Voight plays the title character in this film based on the autobiography of the author Pat Conroy (Prince of Tides). A great film for teachers, it tells the story of a naive Pat Conroy, a young English teacher whose first job is in a primary school on a rural island. The only white man on the island must fight internal and external pressures as he tries to instill education and values ​​in children who have systematically denied such things for generations. A solid performance that really makes you think.
