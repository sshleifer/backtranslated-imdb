Class Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster film that does not prove for style. That's why he has style. Because the film is so undervalued and so concrete, it becomes increasingly engaging. And since Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we end up emotionally invested in this taciturn and hard-killer who loves his wife and children, has a meeting with customs agents on the shore near Nice by night that neither he nor we expect, and who he proves to be just as willing to shoot a policeman or a traitor with the little emotion that wipes out some fluff. First we meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two small children, one of 9 and one of 4. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia", we were told. "On the run for years, he had seen his resources shrink, even though his anxiety kept him moving: with the Italian police closing every day, France was still his best bet, perhaps he had been forgotten." <br /> <br /> Davos was a great gangster from Paris who took care of his friends. This was several years ago. A robbery to give him the money to return to France is very bad. Now he is hiding with his two children. Call his friends in Paris to help him. He and his children need to go from Nice to Paris, but the police are chasing him and have set up checkpoints. For the two best friends of Davos, time has passed and they have passed. They don't want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligation gives may be prudent. Then they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to collect Davos and the children in an ambulance, then to drive to Paris with heavily bandaged Davos and hidden children. We are on a journey where Davos' options are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to care for his children, where he realizes that there are no more bonds of friendship, where betrayal seems likely, and where probably the his only remaining friend is Eric Stark. <br /> <br /> This cynical film works so well because it does its job without problems. There are no trench coats with pulled collars, no games with the melodrama of the gangster code that so many French directors have loved. Class tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who was once someone, who is now slipping down for not being anyone and reacting with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the film, but when paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo a curious chemistry takes place. Ventura like Davos is dark and worried about taking care of his children. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a tough man who sees killing someone, if necessary, as part of his business. Belmondo as the young thief who is initially sent to be a spendable driver and ends up being a friend to rely on, provides the brightness that keeps the film from being just another ride down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely star-like power - a broken nose, an under-sleigh jaw - shines just off the screen. It makes Erik a game for Ventura when they share a scene. And the scenes of Belmondo with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes her friend, exude charm and good sex sex appeal. The ending is a bittersweet destiny, and without a stylistic posture in sight. We hear Davos say "Abel is gone, there's nothing left." It is worth looking at Classe tous Risques to learn what it means. <br /> <br /> There are many good French gangster movies. I'd put it right here with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura's best performances, look at Army of Shadows.
