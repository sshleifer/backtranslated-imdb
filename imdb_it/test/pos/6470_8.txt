Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist response (three years later) to the more conservative "On The Waterfront" by Elia Kazan. While "Waterfront" benefited immensely from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who inadvertently masked Kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify the names of the names (as Kazan impatiently did before the Committee for anti-American activities), "Edge of the City "boasts a young John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier, the newcomer, dared to address the problems that" Waterfront "did not recognize, namely workers' rights and race relations. <br /> <br /> "Edge of the City" dives boldly into this (then) unknown territory, and although the rather attractive black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a bit simplistic, the brave fight against bigotry and covertly veiled violence is not aged at all. One wonders how the first looks of the 1957 cinema were upset by such a bold presentation of black-and-white relations (if some of the bigots did not leave the theater soon, they must be amazed, if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last reel of the film will still surprise the public, as it refuses to sink into the expected clich√©s, including those that have contaminated "Waterfront". Only the most tired viewers will not understand what a radical and fun movie "Edge of the City" is. <br /> <br /> What's more shocking than this lost classic: as unfortunately it remains unavailable in any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy. This film should be requested during high school or college history classes across the country, but it can only be found in obscure late-night TVs, if at all.
