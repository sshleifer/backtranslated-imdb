I can't stress enough what a good movie is. Precisely <br /> <br /> the memory of this film enchants me right now. If you want <br /> <br /> to see an overwhelming epic of a film, with wonderful actors in a vivid scenario <br /> <br />, with an excellent dialogue, remembering what was the first America <br / > <br /> it may have been like [what the world could have been again <br /> <br /> so] ... well ... I highly recommend this movie. Especially during a <br /> time of war and conflict in Iraq ... when our American image is not <br /> <br /> all that it was ... this movie takes you back to a time when we were at the beginning <br /> <br />. When being an American really meant <br /> <br /> collecting from your bootstrap and moving on. When <br /> <br /> the world was such a wild and unknown place. Well, this movie <br /> <br /> has this ... and more. To enjoy.
