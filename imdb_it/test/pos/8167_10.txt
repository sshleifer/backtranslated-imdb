This was really a moving film in every sense. I myself was a Mormon missionary and I know firsthand the desire to complete my mission but at the same time hide the fact that I was gay. Like the character Aaron, I was sent home to be discovered and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a Catholic family was not as bad as it was for the protagonist. This film really brought me back to those days and helped me understand, years later, how lucky I was to have a family that accepted me and understood what I was going through. I found myself applauding at the end of a movie when Aaron and Christian meet again in the event of a break at Lila's restaurant. I was really moved to tears. I highly recommend this film to everyone who reads this review and also declares it a forced purchase.
