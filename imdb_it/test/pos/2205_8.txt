I have only praise for this movie. From the beginning to the end he captured the splendor of the Stephen Sondheim musical. I'm not a big fan of musicals, many of them are exaggerated. But that made me change my mind. I'm an actor too and I've played acting and I know how hard this role is. George Hearn gave an extraordinary performance, masterful and rounded worthy of the highest awards we can give him (he won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does turns into gold. He is so good that he will surprise you because he is not in the cinema to win the Oscars. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sara Woods is as terrifying and wonderful as the beggar woman. All in all a great video. Collect it if you can.
