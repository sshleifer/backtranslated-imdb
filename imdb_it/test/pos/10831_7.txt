It is a wartime drama - the Second World War, with French, Jews and Germans, but this is somewhat funny, honestly. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-wrote the script for his well-received film "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike the "Safe Conduct" by director Bertrand Tavernier aka "Laissez-passer" (2002), wd Rolf Schubel "Gloomy Sunday" (1999), or wd Claude Berri "Lucie Aubrac" (1997), "Bon Voyage" is a lot as sweet as title sounds - c'est la vie (anything) - and we have the beautiful and talented Isabelle Adjani to thank. It is his delightful exhibition as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of everything that made the film so pleasant. Hell, what other derailment of his plan and his expectations? We'll think again. The backbone of the story revolves around a couple of enthusiastic young people: Grégori Derangère as Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (from "8 women" by Francois Ozon) as Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the witty Yvan Attal (of "My Wife is An Actress") and the versatile Peter Coyote (French, English and German juggler here) are some of the stellar casts involved. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that come and go in this movie plot, and the way everything is manipulated is a clever talent that requires no analysis - Rappeneau is simply a genius. The story is based on itself, one episode after another, or even with overlapping events, but never confused - this is the pleasure of everything, somehow every detail is revealed right on the screen and we all caress it like a Frenchman tastefully presented dessert, literally so. There are chills, trills, tender and hesitant moments and fleeting threatening escapes, which appear before our eyes. <br /> <br /> Reading the director's note on Sony Pictures Classics' official Bon Voyage website, Rappeneau indicated that this is his most personal and successful work ever. Representing Bordeaux 1940 from the memories of his childhood years is very close to his heart and "worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years". This film is a work of love in the round, the cast and crew complete the director's passion and a formidable script by collaborative authors together with the director and son Julien - the adaptation efforts of Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre . > <br /> Music by Gabriel Yared (different from the tone of his previous soundtracks such as "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which provided a theme suitable for maintaining the rhythm and rhythm of the plot - almost like a train that goes uninterruptedly, reflecting Vivani's lively energy of Adjani (even when she's tired), making her go while she encounters anything she arrives, walking with her head held high and elegant clothing always, without looking back, not to mention the time of the regrets. <br /> <br /> Ah, we must not forget the wonderfully translated and skillful subtitles of Ian Burley, who also made the subtitles for the films in Italian: "Bread and Tulips" (2000) aka Bread and tulips, "The Last Kiss "" (2001) aka The Last Kiss and "Heaven" by Tom Tykwer (2002). <br /> <br /> If you find this relational drama too light in wartime, try "Aimée and Jaguar" by Mäx Fäberböck (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant interpretations by Juliane Köhler in the role of Aimée and Maria Schrader in the role of Jaguar.
