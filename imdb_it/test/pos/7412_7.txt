I have just seen this movie in preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very subjective because I love Techno, Trance, Club, House and music of the genre. <br /> <br /> The film deals with Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell from a roof, "drunk". Carl meets his brother's girlfriend Sunny and the two of them have completely demotivated a kind of private investigation into the death of Jason and Carl gets involved in Jason's ex-life full of sticks and drugs. The film itself, seen from an artistic point of view, is nothing but a large pile of s ** t. The plot is predictable, all the characters are extremely clich√© and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, young innocent good-looking girl, big bad king of drugs ... the list is endless) and most of the acting like the plot is not credible. Matthew Rhys' performance of the stupid boy who arrives in the great London and the sudden drug taking by people he doesn't even know doesn't seem very credible, unlike his female counterpart Sunny, played by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior seems more realistic the spectator. Nothing but a joke was the performance of Tim Curry's drug king Damian: a fake caricature, even "eeeevil" and too ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> MA: If you like club music (club scenes like selected tracks are simply brilliant), if you like simple love with a sweet girl like Sunny (yes, I confess, I have lost my heart;) ... which makes my comment even more subjective, I suppose) with some (predictable) twists you will surely like this movie. <br /> <br /> Someone else: FORGET .... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal opinion and also my final grade)
