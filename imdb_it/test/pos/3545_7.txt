I saw this movie in the early 90s when it came out for VHS for a while. At the time, I found it interesting, and was particularly impressed by Ken Russell's segment, with visions of the triage and surgery accident victim. <br /> <br /> Last night, in a 2nd run of the last Indiana Jones movie, the vision of John Hurt caused an unexpected flashback to "Aria", which I had not thought of in years, and the sudden recollection of the same piece by Russell was enough to cause a burst of tears for a bit bit. <br /> <br /> If I can make this observation, I note with interest the hate-love reaction people have expressed in the Russell segment, and I found this interesting difference in other films that deepen the deep trauma and its effects side. Some GET, others NOT interesting. <br /> <br /> I see from the comments and the assessment that the overall work affects people in various ways. This is how it has influenced and influenced me.
