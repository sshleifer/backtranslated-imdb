As a fan of the old gangster warner brothers movies I had to check it out, it's the 2nd best movie on the adventure classics DVD set that also had one of my favorite movies, Scott of the Antarctic on it. This was done in 1939 as a good year for many of Warner's brothers' films, boasting an exceptional cast, John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan, and the outgoing boys, who would later be known as the Bowery boys in the monogram photos. well, a boxer (Garfield) is framed for a murder he did not commit and is on the run and followed by a tough New York detective (Claude Rains) ends up in a grocery store run by a beautiful woman (Gloria Dickson) and children without exit (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell) later returned to boxing but try to keep a low profile. This was directed by the famous director Busby Berkley who directed timeless classics like 42nd street, goldiggers of 1933 and 35, footlight parade and many others. I would like to shout platinum DVD / video to put out a lot of cheap cheap DVDs like adventure classics (see my Scott from the Antarctic review) they give me a 10 out of 10 criminal, great movie. I have to admit that I've only seen 2 films by John Garfield, this one, body and soul. I thought he was a great actor.
