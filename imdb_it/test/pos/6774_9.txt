THE GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). <br /> <br /> How do the Danes keep coming up with these films that are constantly entertaining, accurately written, exquisitely filmed and full of great shows? THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and wickedly funny comedy, in many ways the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it has more than just laughter or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings us the chronic pothead duo Bjarne (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and the chronic sweat Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Sick of their evil leader, the two friends decide to open their butcher shop in a small Danish town, but initially the business is slow and the customers are away. When an electrician is accidentally blocked and frozen in the meat cabinet, Svend decides to turn the man's thigh into fillets that he quickly calls "chickie-wickies". This special dish suddenly has everyone in town rushing to the counter and Svend - unable to resist this sudden leap in popularity - turns into a serial killer with Bjarne acting as his reluctant accomplice. But soon, led by their former boss, many people in the city start to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary performances of Kaas and Mikkelsen, the film could not be increased above the level of the average black comedy. On paper, the character of Svend could be a caricature, but the portrait of Mads Mikkelsen is that of a serious, insecure and deeply twisted man, but Mikkelsen manages to make him scary, funny and moving at the same time. Actually, Kaas plays a dual role, also playing his comatose twin in Eigil. I never realized during the movie that he was the same actor. The other exhibits are just as wonderful with every character in town cheering up with some really wonderful cartoons. <br /> <br /> The subject material is - of course - a little morbid and the material may not be completely fresh, considering some of the predecessors who handled the same type of material, but director Jensen gives it a twist and manages to create some real characters with the strange duo of Svend and Bjarne, with this fabulous and bizarre story of two social misfits. /> <br /> Darkroom --- 9/10
