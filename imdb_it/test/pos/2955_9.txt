This is definitely one of the best documentaries I've seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw "catch the friedmans" recently and I have to admit I thought it was better. <br /> <br /> The story is not incredibly shocking, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and cold relational warfare. Skillfully block the viewer through diaries, family videos and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and attentive, and his insights are clear and measured. <br /> <br /> 51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships in over 40-50 years of social change, the social impact and the potential for redemption.
