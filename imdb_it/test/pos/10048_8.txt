Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and fun, sometimes fantasy is more pleasant than real life, and even nothing could be more real than Errol Flynn who plays Custer. This remains the best film made on Custer. The music of Max Steiner is magnificent and also for the whole film the Irish song "Gerry Owen" is played, which was the favorite of Custer. The film should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys on Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flows like no other in their films together, and director Raoul Walsh with his experience in outdoor scenes with many actors is at his best.
