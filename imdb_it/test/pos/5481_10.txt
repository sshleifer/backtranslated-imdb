I love action / adventure movies and this is one of the best. Sure, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but it's the story that really matters. The best are somehow feasible, but we can tolerate those that are a little "over the top" as in the comic book style of action. More twists, more terrible situations involving the heroes and the most shocking moments of the film; more action / adventure enthusiasts appreciate them. "In the Line of Fire" has ALL the elements necessary for a roaring action thriller. He has Clint Eastwood in the role of a secret service agent near the retreat, whose only bad moment of failure haunts him. He has one of the most wicked, despicable and manic villains in John Malkovich, the kind you can't wait to see him, "take due". He has Rene Russo as "love interest". It has twists, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is extremely well attended by the director Wolfgang Petersen and also has a soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone. This is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! Not to be missed!
