This was one of the few shows that my wife and I agreed to watch. I was sorry to hear that it was canceled, especially since I didn't realize that the ratings were so poor. As far as I knew, he was doing very well with many viewers. Most of my friends and most of the people I spoke to saw the show. Now we're stuck watching either shoddy shows or DVDs. How bad was the show? does anyone know the actual results of the show displays? I know that when he went to Thursday, it was harder for me to catch. Thanks to G * d for DVR! <br /> <br /> However, it was a real surprise to know that "The War At Home" will be gone. If the other networks see it, PLEASE, DISCOVER THE SHOW !!!! PLEASE!
