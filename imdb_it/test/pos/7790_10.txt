Well, to start with Rajkumar Santoshi is not a director of comedy films, and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece. This movie is really fun. Strong in bits, overcrowded in some scenes but still in the dialogues you really laugh about fights and characters really full of fun. History line in which a daughter of a billionaire comes to India for marriage and Two young boys behind her, the story has a turning point even with a connection of a Gangster. Amir plays a smart street boy Amar played his role with genius and Salman played the role of an innocent fool to perfection. Raveena did well, but Karshima gets really irritating in some sequences. But the real scoundrel of the show, Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor, enter the frame and automatically start laughing. Overall a movie so nice that you can see it every no. of times without getting bored.
