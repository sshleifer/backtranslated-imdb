From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen has really traveled a lot. If the first is known as a sweep of a novice, the latter will surely consider a special place as a "mature" film. Until you see 15 Park Avenue you can't imagine feeling electrified and moved at the same time. Excited to see the director's ingenuity and agility in portraying seriously challenging situations and driven by the sensitivity that echoes throughout the film. It is not a film that simply makes you feel 'tchh tchh, how difficult life must be for schizophrenics', but it makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen has done a great job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we all are, in one way or another, trying to live in our imaginary world, trying to pursue mirages called happiness, peace, contentment. Along with the representation of a delusional mind, Sen's magic has brought to light many small nuances of human relationships as they support stress and tension. The fact that sometimes we all lose our temper, we collapse, we make bad choices, we are persecuted by guilt, they behave selfishly and so on, they are captured with extreme dexterity by Sen. He showed the cruel dilemma that Shabana faced for all his life, having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and children for herself. And in the act of always standing next to her sister, always being a strong person, providing support, making judgments and so on, she unknowingly interrupted some of the oxygen her sister needed to bloom. Isn't it a very hard truth that sometimes, in an attempt to do the best for someone, we strangle their assertiveness and end up hurting their self-esteem? Certainly the acting of Konkona and Shabana deserves the laurels as always, because the ingredients had not been so good, the dish could not have been so extraordinary. Aparna Sen once again made a masterpiece of a film for those who crave some "food for thought". Good boy!
