Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic "Alive", there was already the legendary Mexican exploitative director Ren√© Cardona who used the same drama as a side dish for his ambitious film " Supervitientes de los Andes ". The unforgettable fatal flight of the Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, many of them members of a professional rugby team. But in the end 16 people were saved thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate traveling companions. Obviously it cannot be said that this low-cost, loosely assembled film is better than the famous 90s version, but I certainly appreciate and respect this film more. After all, an exploit film requires much more input from the cast and crew, while the high-budget Marshall movie seems more like a money-making routine. Sets and special effects naturally cannot compete with "Alive", but "Supervivientes ..." offers an equally impressive feeling of despair and creates an even more nightmarish snow hell. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions ever. I'm really stunned by the fact that Cardona's interpretation of this story is no longer instrumental and explicit. The scenes in which the deceased passengers are cut and consumed are however difficult to digest, but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to underline the inhuman conditions of the survivors. Quite commendable for an evil director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like "Night of the Bloody Apes" and the Saint series. Unknown young Mexican actors do a great job and the music score is captivating. The story is well known, of course, so the script does not offer unexpected shocks. Either from history or before seeing "Live", you know what kinds of dramas these people still have to endure before they are saved and you can only wait for them. Still, this is a good movie that should not be beaten as is too often the case.
