Well, first of all, it's not a bad movie. It's good, and I like the characters introduced. I also like the voices of Lady and Tramp in this. <br /> <br /> However, I'd like to see Lady And Tramp more. I know it says "Scamp's Adventure", and I love Scamp And Angel in pieces, but it's a sequel to the original, where I think they should have just come out as "Scamp's Adventure", not "Lady And The Tramp II": Scamp's Adventure. <br /> <br /> Tramp played an important role, but didn't have much time with Lady. <br /> <br /> But anyway, the songs are pretty good, and Scamp and Angel are sweet. I've seen better sequels, but hey, it's not a failure. <br /> <br /> I give him 7/10. Very good, but still had flaws.
