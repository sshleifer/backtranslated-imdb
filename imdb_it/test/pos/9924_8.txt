Dario Argento is a director I am slowly approaching, following the iconoclastic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria; he is not a filmmaker who always worries about silly things like the "plot". That could be his minor responsibility (but, for me, apparent): he will not let a small thing like common sense ruin his plan for his elaborate murder sequences, since his killers can go through all kinds of elaborate configuration of being invisible, up to revealing beyond the point of the POV detection shots of said psychopathic killer. But it is exciting to see a director capturing occasions like this, of a pure Italian aesthetic that makes its way into the soul of a Hitchcock curve (indeed, as a note of interest, if you have recently seen Scorsese's short film in which he took three pages of a Hitchcock film that was not filmed, also set in an opera, Argento beat almost twenty years, probably without any knowledge of the text). It is also brazenly 80s (CD players and heavy metal and hair, oh my!) And with an absurdity that makes it even more palatable to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a work by Macbeth is in production, with stylized pyrotechnics and trained crows. There is also an emerging star of talent replaced at the last minute, Betty, played by Marsillach. But a murder occurs during the first - interrupted not by that, but by a falling light - and now the killer is after Betty! He can't go to the police (how can he let it be known that the work is really damned?), But what does it matter to a killer who doesn't give up? One has probably seen similar premises to those of other Argento films - a girl pursued by a killer - but it's like Argento, like De Palma, builds and executes its sequences, and adds its own distinctive flavor to add touches of bizarre humor (the breaking the crows to attack the killer, and the next version of pointing in the lineup, a kind of overly stylized lion wing (the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar blow in Kill Bill 1) and also the sadomasochist inspiration with pins attached to Betty's eyes, more than once! <br /> <br /> Silver puts her actress above the shrink, and she is in effect, even when things seem to go into the "what the hell" territory (I was raising my hands almost as if to give when it comes conducted in the girl's secret passage, as if we were suddenly in Aliens now). And through this kind of obscure material, Argento maintains the dense and fresh violence, the suspense as much as that with the opera music coming from a loudspeaker of a stereo system, and a director of photography who could have drunk a few drinks (and rightly so!) during some scenes in the way they are turned and vibrate to the heartbeat. It should be considered junk, but it has exceeded any such limit by the director's senseless attitude, despite a foolish end - more foolish than anything that preceded what preceded it (thanks little lizard) - and an attempt to break the Macbeth's curse, which, unfortunately, does not seem to happen in real life on the Opera set. 8.5 / 10
