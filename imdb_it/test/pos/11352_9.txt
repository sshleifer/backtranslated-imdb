When I watched the movie, I told myself, "so a movie can be made this way". Wong Kar Wai's wonderful poetic love story captured me for everything, even after the movie. I have to admit that this is one of the best love films, perhaps the best of all, I've ever seen. The content and the form overlap perfectly. Like watching secret love, we see characters in limited frames that limit their movements as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and lighting make feelings and blues even tangible. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee on their fantastic cinematography that creates the atmosphere of love. Music also defines the sadness of love that plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in disparaging moods. And of course the performances of the actors that make love so real. In the end, all the elements of the film perfectly combined under the direction of WKW and give the audience the feeling called love.
