This film is one of my most cherished childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the peak of their popularity) heading to Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy googestingly committing her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear does his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of "extras" that delivers a movie that turns out to be "okey dokey". <br /> <br /> The wistful ukulele number of Kermit "Rainbow Connection" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was defeated by Norma Rae "It Goes Like It Goes". I'll take Kermit's song every day! Take the children and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... one day they will find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreamers and me!
