This was such a beautiful film. Such an extraordinary performance by Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and interpreted. A must see !! I screamed my eyes almost through the whole movie. This is a film that every family should sit with their children watching, teaches us a very important lesson in life and how we should approach the hard topic of AIDS, how we should teach our children to cope with it and the people around them . Not just with AIDS, but with any terminal illness. I had never heard of this film until I browsed t.v. one day and you happen to run into it. I recommend everyone to watch this, but don't forget the box of tissues. Other films should be made like this. Extremely moving.
