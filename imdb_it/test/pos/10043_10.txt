this is beautiful!!! there is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. there love is genuine! I'm 24 years old, yet this film is catchy now as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an underrated genius, his direction is so wide, so broad, yet so intimate. the last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (de havilland) almost brought me to tears (not easy for a 24 year old boy !!), it's so heartbreaking. there is also a profound Christian message implicit here, the Custer faith has in taking your glory with you, and your wife's trust and loyalty to the point of letting it go, so that it fulfills its moral duty to protect innocent civilians from certain massacres. there is no film that deals with these problems in a similar way. a must see for anyone who wants to watch this decisive moment in American and military history, from within. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew that Errol Flynn was a star, and De havilland was a legend on screen - this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the greatest!
