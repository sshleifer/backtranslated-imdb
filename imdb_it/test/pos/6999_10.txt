"Pitch Black" was a shock to me when I first saw it in 2000. In previous years, I was repeatedly disappointed by all the twisted sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and I thought this movie didn't it would have been different But to put it plainly: this film scared me ... in a good way. I wasn't aware of the fact that I was still afraid of the dark until I saw this movie; I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a child and rightly deserves to stay there. <br /> <br /> Alien creatures have given me chills down my spine; the individual (s) who designed them has a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to invent something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved the way the writers gave each protagonist a story and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> The gift of Riddick (Vin Diesel) to escape from any impossible situation and making an infernal fight was stunning. In the beginning, you consider it a cold and intelligent villain, but in a few brief moments, you can see something human behind its animal side. But as soon as you discover it, it does something malicious. It certainly keeps you guessing until the end. I didn't know whether to despise it or admire it ... it is certainly a type of love / hate character. <br /> <br /> Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character who brings out a good front but through the need for greed, shows his real intentions and what he is willing to do to survive. John's talent for knowing which buttons to press and the right words to say it makes him as sneaky as Riddick. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns expressed so well, looked at her ass before considering the consequences. But what is captivating about her is that she quickly understands the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay penance, even while endangering her life when others discard all human values ​​and head for the dark hills they run. <br /> <br /> Jack (Rhiana Griffith) simply wanted to have a hero and was the first of the whole group to look for that hero in Riddick; through a child's eye, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely priceless when Jack shaves his head in ode to Riddick; you know what they say: imitation is the best form of flattery. <br /> <br /> The imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see good in all evil. He uses philosophy to bring him through the difficulties he encounters and when time permits, he rationally pains his losses and then the soldiers. In a sense, it served as a moral for the survivors even though most of the characters acted like they weren't listening. <br /> <br /> The cast of this film was definitely perfect. Each actor shone brilliantly in their role and their talents mixed wonderfully on the screen. <br /> <br /> This film may have had a small budget but the director's direction and the actor's performances have made the film work and allowed the public to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive special effects do all the work for them. This film is a classic Sci-Fi classic. Watch it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It will be worth it.
