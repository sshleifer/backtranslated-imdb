I'm not sure if this movie is a children's drama or a fantasy film. When I saw it for the first time I could not distinguish the ending and this is the only part of the film that seems to lack depth and left me a little depressed for a while. Then I looked at it a second time and realized how beautiful the acting was and I didn't know why he received the scarce attention he had at that time. <br /> <br /> The unforgettable performances of the young Mazzello and Wood should have made this film a classic. <br /> <br /> Although it was probably intended to be a fantasy / drama film by the original writer / director (Evans), once Donner took the place, presumably he did it with a more dramatic vision in particular the end, which left much to be desired what really happened to Bobby - Was he killed?, if he escaped and really did all those fantastic trips? or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove a point to the children? <br /> <br /> But in all this it did not provide the closure of a happy ending to which we are accustomed in a children's film. Maybe it's because it's not just this. <br /> <br /> To see what could have been a more classic ending take a look at the official Elijah Wood site where you will find the first draft script for the conclusion of the film (presumably from the original writer) <br / > <br /> Also a note from the music of Hans Zimmer which is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, a mixture of childhood and dark feelings throughout the film. A great CD to keep, if you can. <br /> <br />
