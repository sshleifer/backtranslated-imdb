I find it sad that just because Edward Norton didn't want to be in the movie or have anything to do with it, people automatically think that the movie sucks without even looking at it or giving it a chance. I really hope Norton didn't. He is a good actor and everything but him has frightened people from a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it funny. It wasn't amazing or anything with crazy special effects, but it wasn't bad. It was fun to watch. But yes, it's definitely not a bad / horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
