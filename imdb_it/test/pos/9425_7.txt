This is a great late-night movie! What I mean is that I really enjoyed playing my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have a $ 6.99 DVD copy!) Many nights before going to sleep or if I have insomnia. There is only something in this film that makes it fun to watch in repeated views. It could be the fun Basil Rathbone has in "The Secret Weapon" wearing different disguises that deceive the bad guys and Holmes's assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson) but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be espionage, code cracking and the theme of the Second World War. It could also be the light touch that the director uses to manage the threatening situations in which Holmes finds himself while keeping the story in motion. Whatever it is, "Secret Weapon" is simply a pleasant and entertaining detective story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis sought world domination and do so with the advantage of the camaraderie between Watson and Holmes. Whether you agree with the patriotic discourse and the noble "save the world" themes of this movie or not (I think they're right!), I find that they only add the flavor and fun of this old adventure movie which holds up to repeated views. I consider a pleasant 83/100 points.
