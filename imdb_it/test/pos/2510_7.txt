Although it is certainly a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours and it is always worth watching a movie, this film has never achieved the goals it would have had for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes or so, he focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny, who are far less interesting characters than most others: Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are all much more attractive. Although at the beginning this works, given that in life we ​​don't always know everything about everyone else, and because the point is that maybe Helen is slightly self-involved, she wears out quickly and we want to see more other characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. The letter itself has much less meaning than it does in the first half and, although this works somehow well, it seems strange to leave so much of the potential shown in the first part behind. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is sweet and good-natured, with some really fun moments - for example, Janet explaining the seasonings to a greedy audience. The lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately depicted, but the film is not as smart as it is trying to be. All that is left is to be a light romantic comedy and to be an intelligent portrait of life. However, it is still good and if you have the chance, it is definitely worth seeing.
