** SPOILER ** Looking for a little more excitement to see the crocodiles being fed at the local sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn and Maeve Dermody, along with Grace Adam's boyfriend, Andy Rodoreda, decide to take a trip to Mount in the desolate and deserted, human habitation, Australian Mangrove Swamps. <br /> <br /> With their marsh guide Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat the four are overthrown by a giant saltwater crocodile that grabs and quickly drags terrified Jimmy all the way with him. Grace Pat and Adam end up stuck on a tree in the swamp with Pat clinging for the life dear to the overturned boat. The rest of the movie has the hungry and determined crocodile playing a cat and a mouse, or crock 'and human, playing with the trio that ends in a fight at a mud bank right where the dead and dismembered body of jimmy finally arrived at his rest. <br /> <br /> Both the director and the actors of the film take full advantage of the swamp making it sometimes much more frightening than the giant crocodile that swims in it. We will see the crocodile killer only half a dozen times in the film, but they all beat you, and Jimmy Grace Pat and Adam, right in the gut. <br /> <br /> Beyond we have been held in suspense by the giant reptile always does its damage from below which arrives so unexpectedly that, the crock attacks, has much more effect when you don't see them coming, like in the last ten minutes of the movie, when you do it. You wonder from the beginning who in the end would have survived the crocodile attacks and will eventually live to tell them. The final with the crocodile against human confrontation concerned the weakest and most unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> The crocodile who was so cautious and effective in the previous scenes seemed to have punched, or swum, himself having neither the strength nor the speed to grab, with his deadly jaws, and finish the sole survivor of the expedition. In fact the killer killer was so ineffective that even after deceiving his victim, or his victims, he just couldn't keep them. This ultimately proved fatal on his part. <br /> <br /> Much like "Jaws" the movie "Black Water" has the killer crocodile, like the great white shark in "Jaws", more interested is killing his human prey and then eating them. With all the food available in the swamp and in the rivers that lived in the crocodile it was only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam and Jimmy, to have invaded his watery domain that he believed to be the great ruler of. And for daring to do it, they had to pay with their lives!
