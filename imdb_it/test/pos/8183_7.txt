Quite a production by the director who tells the story of The Qin Emperor's ambitious plan to unite all the kingdoms of China. Some great characters, scenes, costumes and scenes. However, I was not swept away by the film in terms of the skill of the actors (which was good I liked more than the Marquis) or his appearance (although the massing of troops was extremely impressive, if he were a real man who is a lots of extras!). <br /> <br /> I have seen Li Gong in other films and she is always fantastic. I think it's a beautiful vintage piece, but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. Good movie and found the 2 1/2 + hours not a problem. <br /> <br /> Rated 7 out of 10.
