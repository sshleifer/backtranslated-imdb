The evil evil warlord Samanosuke (interpreted superbly with the hateful grip of Yutaro Gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village. The gigantic Majin stone statue eventually comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his evil servants. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient legendary folk legend: there is a very strong sense of an ancient and remote distant time (it's set in feudal Japan), good guys are noble and captivating while the bad guys are really bad and detestable, the occasional fighting with swords is staged with remarkable skill and taste, the special effects are beautiful and impressive, the serious tone and the constant rhythm never falter for a minute, and the last Majin wave of wild destruction is extremely lively, exciting and more than a little scary. Furthermore, the fantastic elements of the narrative have a substantial credibility being firmly rooted in a dark, hard and credible world. This film earns bonus points for depicting Majin as more than a brutal and frightening force of angry revenge instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. The veteran composer Akira Ifukube provides a typically rich, robust and challenging score. Fujio Morita's acute and moody cinematography also strikes the same way. The capable cast offers wonderfully healthy and sincere performances, with a particularly commendable work by Jun Fujimaki in the role of the valiant and protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo in the role of the middle gunman Gunjuro. Highly recommended.
