this movie was brilliant! I absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was fantastic for this role - and I'm sure blade 2 would be just as good. <br /> <br /> blade is by far one of my favorite action / horror movies out there! and if you haven't seen it yet, and like vampires and blood (all these things) you should really rent it, because I assure you that you'll love it!
