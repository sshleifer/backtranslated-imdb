This movie seemed so real. Actually I felt all the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene muscular dystrophy like Rory, so what you see here is exactly what I felt myself. Some will not believe that there are disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. For a drama based on characters, the story moves quickly. I never got bored, maybe partly because I saw things that mattered to me. But I think that many people, with intelligence, will be glued to the screen and will care about the characters. The acting is phenomenal! James McAvoy is as perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene muscular dystrophy. He Steven Robertson deserves an award for his portrayal of Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. <br /> <br /> Michael's love is not returned by a girl and Rory helps him come to terms with it. I've heard it many times and the question is "don't you love me because I'm not really me or because my disability excluded you?" No matter what the girl says, we will always be skeptical of the truth. It's natural and it hurts both ways. <br /> <br /> Some parts made me cry a little because it's sad and I have to deal with problems alone. People without a terminal disability cannot begin to understand how they feel. This is a must-have movie for everyone. Disabled people are everywhere and very misunderstood. This film brings some light on some facts of life, which are so taken for granted by the able-bodied. We want to be just like you - live according to our conditions, go out, get drunk, be loved. Outside, we can't do much but inside, we're dancing!
