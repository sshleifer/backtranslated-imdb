If you have the chance to get a lost gem (for many years), I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has a strange mixture of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation - even a hint of slapstick, but it's so weird that it wasn't just early, nothing like it has been seen since. <br /> <br /> I totally disagree with those who say the film is dated, especially with "Bamboozaled" (SP?) by Spike Lee a few years ago, which was a bonfire in an attempt to capture the same message. (Good screenplay, disconnected script.) <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Downy is brilliant, allowing many of his actors to improvise, the film improves as it goes on and the lines become blunt are forgiven as those found in a comedy by Mel Brooks, a pure non-PC 'I can't believe they just said that' funny. <br /> <br /> Favorite parts, commercials. The film moves from gritty black and white representations of the beautiful color advertising agency (perhaps 16mm) and achieves success. <br /> <br /> I refuse to suggest any spoilers, but if you have the chance to watch the DVD version, be sure to watch Downey's interview (but leave it until after the movie.) <br /> < br /> My vote 10/10 - the most underrated film of the late 60s, early 70s. Thank you, Prince.
