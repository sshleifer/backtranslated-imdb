John and his wife Emily, accompanied by their son Edward, venture from the comfortable surroundings of the suburbs to the village where her husband spent part of his childhood. There was a death in the family and John must begin a process to take control of an old dilapidated cottage, located near the sea and once inhabited by an old man who apparently committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Skeptical about the circumstances of death, John separates from his family and reality, puts his life in danger and wears the clothes of the old man who is now dead. <br /> <br /> The film now changes - nothing is what it seems - the people of its past appear, in full Gothic glory / hillbilly - his wife worries about her mental state - and her son disappears in the reeds. <br /> <br /> John discovers that the old man has not committed suicide, that his death is much more mysterious and strange. In a chilling finale, we learn that the film's events never actually happened and that the whole narrative was imagined by the boy, Edward, who is struggling to come to terms with his parents' divorce proceedings. <br /> <br /> Modern Love is a macabre piece of high-fashion cinema, an enigmatic and perverse piece of pretentiousness, full of vague suggestions and unexplored insults. It is without humor and apparently indifferent to the current indie tendencies that validate both its creators, but they also make it pass√©. <br /> <br /> But the weaknesses of this Australian film are completely overcome by its cinematic and muscular vision, its blood - uncompromising and uncompromising precision and its strange European horror. The enslavement of screenwriting standards and the lack of a sloppy dialogue pale in insignificance against the background of noir and in a main performance that must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressively bizarre Australian films in years.
