Like many other reviewers here, I am surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. Dan O'Bannon's previous effort was the revolutionary 'Alien' of 1979. Why and 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in the artistic direction for this type of features does not mean that this was the only way to produce them. <br /> <br /> Instead of dismissing "Lifeforce" as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation, it is important to recognize that the film draws on the "esteemed" traditions of British horror and science fiction - in particular the characteristics of Hammer and American International as Quatermass (in particular "Quatermass and the Pit", 1967), Doctor Who and "The Day of the Triffids" (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson ('UFO', 'Space: 1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would come as a surprise if other reviewers recognized the writer's appreciation of "Queen of Blood" (1966) and "It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958) - the immediate sources for" Alien "(1979). <br /> <br /> Granted that this film has some" legacy "elements, but perhaps it is worth comparing this film with its more immediate peers - 1981" An American Werewolf in London "and" The Company of Wolves "(1984) - other films from the 80s that share a" look back "while adapting those stories to the zeitgeist of the 80s. All three films have drawn on previous incarnations of the same, but have basically sex up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time, they recognized the ironic and witty aspects of their projects. <br /> <The "Wolves" by Neil Jordan played on many of the psychoanalytic memes that floated over the years 80, while "American Werewolf" has increased its theme as a "coming-of-age" film. It's called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the dramaturgy of the last days concerning the series "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Final Destination". But these films taken by adolescents seem to be part of a box-office trend, while films from the 80s like "Lifeforce" belong to a canon of British science fiction - even if this was written by an American. <br /> <br /> In many ways this film holds up much better than the disaster of the last days and the alien invasion films ("Independence Day", "Armageddon", "Deep Impact") because the "solutions" do not reside in weapons battles, armed loads and testosterone. At the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron did not examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before redoing 'Solaris' ... <br /> <br /> The objective of this film was fun , no thoughtfulness or stupidity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
