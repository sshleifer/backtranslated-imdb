i love this movie. focuses on both themes: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted a date with that famous boy Billy. and some of us haven't been kissed yet, right? be honest! <br /> <br /> another real problem is due to the pain that people derive from teasing. and whoa, high school life. remember it? fantasy is finding your true love, when you are 25 and still in high school. not really fantasy, but close enough! <br /> <br /> although some parts are incredible, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a fascinating and wonderful job, like the exhilarating David Arquette. the people who worked in the film are all wonderful. didn't I just repeat it? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is one of the films that later generations should watch. shows the reality and some problems not for people like you and me.
