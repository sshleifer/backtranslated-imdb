"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been two of my favorite films, and although lynch's past films have been slightly disappointing to me, they have always been worth looking at a few times. to be pretentious, the lynx can be like a good wine - it must be savored and mulled. but in the end you have to think about what you've seen, because lynch never gives you complete answers. <br /> <br /> many people will come out of "mulholland drive", perhaps wanting to strangle the visual visual puzzle that has just opened up before them. but there is a twisted logic to this film, you just have to look for clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in Hollywood, with fawn eyes and looking for celebrities. then he finds amnesia in his bathroom that escaped from an attempted murder on the mulholland drive. together they try to discover the secrets behind the life of amnesia. all this leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal everything. and that is when the film throws everything out of the window. the people we thought we knew were completely different people ... is it a dream? a reminiscence of the previous escapades of life? you will love this movie or you will hate it. David Lynch always attracts such extreme reactions from his viewers. but since his universe is always at the extremes, it is right that his films elicit such reactions. <br /> <br /> It is better to watch this film in a thematic way, rather than as a direct narrative. and I appreciate the fact that Lynch is a director who will still let you draw your own conclusions. has had many imitators lately, especially in "vanilla sky", in which a film that makes your head beat decides to give you all the answers in the last five rushed minutes, and you would probably forget about that movie as soon as you get out of the cinema. the mulholland record will haunt you.
