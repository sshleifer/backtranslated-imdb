I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything else about this film because I saw it and thought it was FANTASTIC. I guess it's not for everyone, because basically "The Trial" by Kafka meets "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. Anyway, I thought it was great. If you see it because you want an Office Space sequel, you will probably be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid and honest looks about where our society is headed, you're ready for a gift. I just saw the opening night of the 8pm show in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the movie will probably be gone in a week. This is really a shame because, in its way, the Idiocracy is one of the best satires that have been coming for some time. But then again, it's basically about making fun of people who make up about 99% of the audience, so I guess it's not surprising that the studio panicked and tried to download it.
