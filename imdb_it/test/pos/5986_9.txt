I wouldn't compare it to Le Placard, which IMHO has had more comedic moments, but Romuald & Juliette despite being a slow starter has certainly kept your attention throughout the film, has a nice rhythm and has reached a warming heart end :) There are There have been many wonderful comic moments, a brilliant pathos and a realistic situation that acts from all the actors. <br /> <br /> It was a typically French film, in which prejudices and phobias were confronted, which in turn meant that the viewer was confronted with his own faults! I am certainly pleased to have it in my library, and I will no doubt watch it over and over again, which for me is a trademark of a great film.
