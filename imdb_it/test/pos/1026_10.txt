Just like a reminder to anyone reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it wasn't available on DVD until the last few years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an "international" DVD player, which you have to hack - illegally, suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com - 3 discs - for $ 19-21, to be viewed on DVD in US format, without hacking. There were 41 reviews, on average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the best on Oppenheimer, or the Manhattan Project, or just about anything produced by the BBC.
