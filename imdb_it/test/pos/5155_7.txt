The large bell of a bar blinks intermittently for the last orders and the inevitable haste to queue at the desk? Do we want what we need only when it's too late? Or is the irony of Cassandra's plaintive opening scene a more resonant reflection of our perceptions of individual existence? There is an infinite fascination with where writer and director Roy Andersson wants to take us on his fourth feature film, "You, The Living". With about fifty semi-related vignettes, united by a weakness for tragicomic hyperreality, by its melancholic interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great and great cosmic struggle of Sisyphus. The absolute simplicity of these cartoons acts to dramatize the tenuousness and the immense preciousness of being outside the symbiotic relationships we have with one another. Andersson could weaken the complexity of the human condition through hard and fast cynicism more than he should, but it also reminds us of the intrinsic and reassuring glory of awakening every morning to a new tomorrow when we are all aware of our distinct arrested development.
