The Hookers was for me a great story of ordinary people, like someone you may have known. I'm just trying to make it, my big shot is just around the corner. Then the small temptations of Life crept in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much can your love take and give the boy who is not so bad after all, only Human. I liked it, I was also an extra paid in the movie. I played drums in the bar, with the band, I took several shots on foot, my green 66 corvette was in the motel party shots. Wonderful casts and troupes, first-class people, films on earth. I had lunch with James Coburn, on Mother's Day, that wonderful man, just as I have known him for years, I will never forget. My father spent the day with Slim Pickens and exchanged horse stories, even Slim was really down to earth, he loves those kids, we really miss them. Real people making movies about real people, Thank you Levy, Gardner and Laven.
