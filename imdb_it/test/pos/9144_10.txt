Being a huge horror fan, I had abandoned the subgenre of vampires due to the fact that in most vampire movies the vampire became feminine and non-threatening, benign and fundamentally weak. This was the attitude I brought to the vision of Soul's Midnight and I'm happy to say that the vampires in this film are at least hungry to kill old ladies and sacrifice children! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the fascinating vampire with wild intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interests me is that the central location is the Hotel Borgo. This is nice because (and I returned to my copy of the high school to look for this) to Dracula, the Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker has to go to get to Dracula's castle. <br /> <br /> Finally, my hat off to those who made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a damn CGI! This is the only nice thing about many low-budget movies, they can't afford the effects of junk computers that plague many Hollywood monstrosities. <br /> <br /> Bottom line ... this is better than Underworld for sure, especially if you are a purer vampire.
