My original title for this review would be "Finish disappoints, triumphs of cinema". But actually I thought about this on the way home. Most of these films are not fairy tales, in turn it is different and while its finish is initially disappointing, it sinks slowly and hits the core in a satisfying tone. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a man named James Aaron (Curb Your Enthusiasm by Jeff Garlin, who also wrote and directed) an ailing actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity that of his inability to find someone to love. <br /> <br /> Yes, it seems trivial, but experiment with elements that make it a bit unpredictable, and actually makes you want it to be longer. The ending came suddenly and he said "is it so!?" But once he starts taking his toll, it really makes you smile. <br /> <br /> It has many tones of seriousness, but fear not, because it is also very funny. Some scenes offer huge laughs, and those who saw Jeff Garlin's stand-up will recognize a couple (mainly when he gives a career speech for his class and his niece's asylum bombs). It starts with a rather serious note that you don't expect, but what follows is very funny, fun and quite moving. It's the kind of movie you keep watching and you always like. And as I said before, while the ending may seem absurd at first, once you've taken the time to think, it's a real joy.
