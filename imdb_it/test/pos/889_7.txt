Born from the same partnership as Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner who produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) - the latter renamed My Partner the Ghost for the US market - Department S remains a classic example of the action-adventure series that the United Kingdom produced in bulk during the late 1960s. Like those two shows, its internal dynamics of two boys and a girl might seem a progressive attitude towards equality (Deputy S also has a superior black), but it is above all the fa√ßade: the launch episode, "Six Days" , it is barely halfway before Rosemary Nichols is called to pull off a bra, panties and a (yes, a) stocking to extricate herself from a disreputable situation. Still, it's an interesting time capsule, although the dark sense of fashion of the character of Peter Wyngarde (who, incredibly, degenerated further into Jason King's spin-off series) would surely have remained buried.
