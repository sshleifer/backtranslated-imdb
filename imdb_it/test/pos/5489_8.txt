In the Line of Fire by Wolfgang Peterson is shrewd and from time to time a really white ride, even if once or twice we might feel as if we had already been on similar roads before. How not to do it when Clint Eastwood, immediately after (presumably) closing the book on his western heritage, will probably close the one on his gritty police pictures (don't count Blood Work there). But there's more to it than the character of Eastwood, here an agent of the secret services, tough, crazy and indomitable, has a slightly fascinating side for him, even the most romantic side that is not seen in the images where he issued his brand factory. There are some complexities that here are not based only on the usual bravado, and it is noteworthy the way in which a back story so possibly invented (it did not save Kennedy from the assassination in 63) is made quite credible among the rest of his character , which more than likely hides its wounds - most of the time. Eastwood goes to the city to make a big presence in the film, however, and given the circumstances the character seems made to measure for him. <br /> <br /> But there would be a risk that his part in the film is slightly conventional (we still have the "Harry" type scenes of him that are smarter and smarter on all the others in the room, and are scolded and forced to submit to the top, here a chief of staff), including here protecting a president who (wisely) we have never seen or known. Even the romantic secondary plot, which is a bit crude if there were some macho laughter, would make the image a bit subdued if the other aspect of quasi-Dirty Harry had not entered the picture: an indelible villain. This time there is a bit of Hollywood suspense, however the intelligent and intelligent suspense (it almost deserves the rest of the film deserves), with the character "John Booth", played by John Malkovich in an Oscar nomination, as someone who he is described more like a predator than a murderer. There are ways in which this could go wrong with the character of Eastwood, but perhaps Malkovich has the upper hand over some of his previous wicked counterparts being extremely cool and untrimmed (there is that devastating and worthy scene where he kills the bank teller and his roommate), and while his past is revealed, there is still that element of "what the hell is with this guy" that keeps Eastwood's audience and agent guessing and an extra paranoid. It is a classic performance by Malkovich, mostly gruesome and always measured in the level of madness and professionalism. <br /> <br /> Besides, apart from the conventional points, it is just an elegant image made by Peterson and the company, and they come rather close to the realism of Don Siegel's bubbly pulp. But Peterson also has a couple of film tricks up his sleeve that made me smile sometimes; every time someone makes an obvious and compelling tribute to Vertigo - jumping from the roof to the roof, the hero dangling from the ledge, the "lap" - continues to make me shiver down my spine. There are also telephone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game, probably another kick in Hithcock's ribs. But in the end, even with all the excitement and brutal danger and clear formalism in the climax, it is also an image of characters in some way in everything, and everything is sufficiently realized to give the public a good amount to meditate on, at least in the sense of suspense. Eastwod is a great protagonist, Russo plays the female possible sincere and mature love-interest, and Malkovich is the top of pop. There are also some important supporting roles and a good studio score. One of the best films of 1993.
