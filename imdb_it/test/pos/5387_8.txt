What is your problem? Do you have nothing better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about how to find something tacky? Here's an idea: go outside. Exact. Walk out of your mother's basement where you've been living for 13 years and GO OUT. "But I can't leave! Star Trek is in 30 minutes and I haven't married that avatar on World Of Warcraft yet!" Oh my God, in this case, stay inside! All right, I could have exaggerated. I mean, Star Trek is fine, but I don't watch it that much anymore. Anyway, you really have to write shit about Mind of Mencia. IT'S A GOOD SHOW. Maybe you're venting your anger because that girl downloaded you to World of Warcraft. Or are you constipated. Try putting fiber in your diet.
