What can I say? You just expect the best of the drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and gruesome story about a serial killer who cuts the languages ​​of the victims and replaces them with silver spoons. Police officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team are tasked with trying to solve the mystery of seemingly random events before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But beware, despite being "15" (in the UK), MESSIAH is a rather creepy film. Some murder scenes are similar to those of SE7EN, and one or two can be really annoying. But if you can resist, take a seat in the chair and have fun ... although you will probably find yourself on the edge or hide behind. <br /> <br /> Rated "15" by the BBFC for moderate violence and strong horror.
