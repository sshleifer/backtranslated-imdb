This is what porn was, this is a true classic. I mean, it's an x-rated musical based on a real book! Is there a real storyline and how many x-rated movies can they boast of these days? This is part of an exclusive shortlist of true pornographic film classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with "pornographic films" these days is that it concerns the "pornographic" and not the "film". Alice in Wonderland has graphic depictions of sex, of course, but in reality she is telling a story at the same time. Not one of the typical "Oh, Mr. Police Man, don't write me a ticket", this makes it another step forward and makes it a musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, this is one of the best.
