TEP is like a long and fresh drink of water after having crossed the Sahara towards classic cinema fans who have long been deprived of that certain cinematographic magic! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are portrayed perfectly. If you are looking for the film to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, he's an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that's what Anthony Minghella meant. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the poster for vulnerability and childish enthusiasm. And, of course, I'll go see any movie where Kristin Scott Thomas is present. It must simply be THE BEST actress, like Deborah Kerr. So much has been promised with this film, and so much has been delivered!
