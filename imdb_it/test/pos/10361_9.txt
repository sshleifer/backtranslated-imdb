This film certainly shows something and sheds light on what happens in most institutions today, and shows how a gurl only with the help of his newspaper can do things, his publisher trusts her and doesn't publish anything important, because it would damage your friend ... and when it was the right time she took the necessary measures. <br /> <br /> The film got an overall rating of 9, because it has everything, I mean it keeps you entertained and, in addition, they acted really well, for a TV movie, its high quality acting that deserves a lot of credit.
