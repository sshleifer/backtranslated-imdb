<br /> <br /> This film is a summary of Visconti's obsessions: the decadence of nobility, death, aesthetic research, homosexuality ... All mixed with the melancholy dominion. It is a slow rhythm only to make you able to contemplate all its beauty (which is in music and in images and in history), this is the kind of film that we are no longer allowed to enjoy, brave, deeply personal and intelligent. The genuine fruit of a genius like Visconti.
