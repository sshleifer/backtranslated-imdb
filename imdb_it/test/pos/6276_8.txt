The Jazz Singer is one of several films made in the late 1940s and 1950s on the Jewish experience in the United States. In addition to Crossfire (1947) and the Gentleman's Agreement (1947) which dealt with anti-Semitism, they usually had a musical theater background. Among them were The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), Eddy Duchin Story (1951), Eddie Cantor Story (1953), Benny Goodman Story (1956) and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The protagonists of these "Jewish" films have always been interpreted by non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks, a non-Jew, played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme palpable to a predominantly non-Jewish audience. The Jazz Singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she played a non-practicing Jew in the film. The clue to his background is when he attends the Golding family dinner before entering and says "I haven't been to a sad (Easter service) since I left home". <br /> <br /> The film is about a son singer who has just left the service after seeing the action in Korea. His dilemma is whether to become a singer, a family tradition or be a singer in musical theater. His choice of theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> However, there is much more to this film than this. This film was made after the Rosenberg trial during McCarthy's campaign and the Hollywood blacklist. So in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens and <br /> <br /> are American by excellence. The choir of the synagogue would prefer to play baseball rather than practice. Singer's friends also talk about baseball, in fact one of them is a major league referee. The synagogue dates back to 1790 and George Washington would visit. Therefore Jews are presented as an integral part of American society. No one in this film has an accent from Eastern Europe. Peggy Lee appeared in very few films. In this film you see them singing "Lover" and "Just one of those wonderful things". Danny Thomas is quite credible and acts and sings the part very well. Comic routines may have been left out. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental, but it's worth seeing. I loved it.
