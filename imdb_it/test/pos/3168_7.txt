I thought it was very "different" from the more modern interpretations of Shakespeare and I loved it. It would not be useful for those who study it at school, etc. Because it does not show the traditional interpretations of Shakespeare's characters (ie - Miranda is portrayed rather punk than your traditional Shakespeare) but for the understanding of the game and the basis of the story is a very strong and fantastic piece to watch. It also does not include the correct format, as in the layout of the acts and scenes, while I am currently playing Miranda in a production and most of its lines have been cut and some scenes have been divided and mixed, but it is very useful and I would do it surely I recommend it as to see even if only to say that you've seen it! Shakespeare fans would love it!
