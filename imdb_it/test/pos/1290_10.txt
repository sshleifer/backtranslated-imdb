Christopher Nolan's first feature film has thrilled the critics who saw it when it came out. Shot on a $ 6,000 micro budget this is a film for real class students. The film is shot in black and white and features characters who are supposed to be friends of Nolan appearing in the film. This does not mean that they are bad actors because they are pretty good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appear in other projects, but unfortunately they haven't done it since it was made 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Nolan's thriller, very similar to Memento, does not sound chronologically, it moves the scenes very similar to Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It's a great twist thriller, but since the temporal order of the film is moved around it, it becomes even more interesting. I thought that the last ten minutes, in particular, when everything became clear, were excellent. <br /> <br /> For a film with such a small budget and no recognizable names, it's so beautiful. It is superior to most studios in Hollywood and Nolan after three films (this, the Memento Superiore and Insomnia not really good but still excellent) has become consolidated as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman to arrive. <br /> <br /> This film is short and sweet and definitely a great watch. It is very professional and the turns are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that David Julyan's score was also excellent, very atmospheric and with a frivolous quality. He continued to compose Nolan's other films. <br /> <br /> Overall I would recommend it, I'm going to get all the Nolan films. This is a low budget gem. ***** <br /> <br />
