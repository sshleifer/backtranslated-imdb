Michael Radford did an excellent job bringing this difficult game to the screen. He played a play with a reputation for anti-Semitism and showed us that Shakespeare knew the humanity of the Jews quite well. Radford said after the screening, and I agree, that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be canceled out by a compulsive and compulsive need for revenge. He also points out, rightly, that a man who was anti-Semitic could not have written Shylock's speech on "If you prick me, don't you bleed?" Radford is of Jewish origin and has chosen the good and the bad of all the characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from defects; no character is bad. Radford placed the comedy in the 16th century, which offers a lush background of Venetian politics and decadence on which to project the words of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to hear Radford talk about the film, I highly recommend taking it, as it gives details of life in 16th-century Venice that illuminates many of his choices and gives considerable depth to the vision . I hope the DVD will come out with ample commentary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons beautifully plays Antonio, a man who has resigned himself to bearing the brunt of his past misdeeds. Lynn Collins, an unknown relative, offers us an absolutely perfect, stunning and detailed work like Portia. Not only is Miss Collins beautiful, but she gives Portia levels of intelligence and humor before the test scene that I rarely saw in every production of this show. the rest of the cast also does a formidable job, with a remarkable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano, and a beautiful work by Allan Corduner as Tubal, who plays the role of Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino brings out his usual strong (and strong) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he doesn't say words, but you can see all the emotions and madness flowing in and out of him as he perceives his fortunes change. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage movies, I can't recommend this movie enough.
