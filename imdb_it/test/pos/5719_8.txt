I've never seen anyone from John Leguizamo's stand-up before seeing Freak, and after seeing him again in the HBO comedy recently it was better, more cheerful and with things I couldn't understand before at age 14 . Spike Lee did a great job of directing, keeping the visual angle up to the theatricality of Leguizamo and the style of personal storytelling; it is substance and style that blend together but discreetly. We receive praise of Leguizamo on race and sex (the parts on sex are classic), but many concern the family, and what remains fresh in my mind is about his father. Even when things get dark in some of the stories, there's something cool or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls out to have a laugh, and it works most of the time. If something were to collapse (at least for me) it could be his personality tic here and there. But overall, it's the kind of fun material that's not intoxicating, but it's so true to itself that it bites. Find it if you can!
