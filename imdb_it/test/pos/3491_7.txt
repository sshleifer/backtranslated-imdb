No real storylines, character development, no Scorcese level direction, but seriously, did you really expect something like that? The only thing that matters is that this film is absolutely funny, almost on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags on a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't destroy you, you have to be the worst batty guy in the kids story. Sacha Baron Cohen is perhaps the greatest comedian VIVO, and here he makes himself laugh more than Jude Law on a nudist beach. I dare you not to laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can pull the ten-foot pole from behind for an hour and a half and enjoy some well-timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character, watch this stupid movie. You'll be glad you did. Keep it real!
