Ingrid Bergman, the faithful receptionist of the dentist Walter Matthau who hosts a small crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. He wits the witty script of the script and steals a terrifying scene in which she and Goldie Hawn talk in a recording booth (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). Matthau is a strange choice for the leading man (he's too old for Goldie Hawn and too coarse for Bergman, not to say too blurry to be a dentist), but I liked the way he strives to satisfy Goldie and stumbles into try to free yourself from a lie. Hawn (who won a supporting Oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as he is today. This bedroom farce is not very sophisticated (and vaguely resembles that of "Every Wednesday" apart), but it is a welcome relief from the noisy and young-oriented comedies that present themselves today. "Cactus Flower" is a delightful sigh! *** from ****
