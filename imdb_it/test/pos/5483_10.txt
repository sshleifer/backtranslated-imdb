"In the Line of Fire" is one of the best thrillers I've seen, which builds and builds in an exceptional climax. This film really attracts you in the beating heart and you are breathless from the action. The cast turns into strong interpretations, in particular Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is expertly directed by the suspense master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers don't improve much, don't lose it.
