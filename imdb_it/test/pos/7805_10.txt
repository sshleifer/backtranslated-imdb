There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone you meet and yet they occur as box office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and exhilarating comedy falls into this category. For once, an Indian director has kept in mind the sensitivity of the public and has not produced a mockery typical of the Kader Khan type stereo. The film is about two guys who dream of riches and try to make him woo a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama develops while in history many complexities emerge. The complexities add to the pure comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays a clever boy, while Salman Khan unexpectedly plays the role of a fool. The villian played by Paresh Rawal, and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the film borrows from many other films, despite the poor cameras, and despite being "noisy" at times, it remains one of the few "funny" films that Bombay devised after films like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar . It is sad that it did not work well at the box office, because this means that the producers return to the formulas and the creativity is abandoned.
