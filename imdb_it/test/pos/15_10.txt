Like others who have commented on the web ... I am a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. That being said, and being the skeptic I am, I expected the factors of over-the-top cheese. There was cheese, but all in all, not much ... and the film was fairly accurate. <br /> <br /> I looked at the trailer again today. After watching the movie yesterday, I realized that the trailer gives the impression that the film is nothing but rescue after the rescue action scenes. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film is really more inspired by the character / story than by the action. The inner struggles with which Costner and Kutcher have to do. Kutcher's is revealed more in depth than in films compared to Costner's. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a minor love story ... no surprise there. But for the most part, the film tells the story of two lives that come together and, after a while, help each other heal old wounds. <br /> <br /> Girlie as it seems, Costner, and although I try not to like him, Kutcher works really well together and compliments the film very well. <br /> <br /> As the critics have said, you've seen it all before ... Top Gun, Officer and a gentleman, etc. But which film has not been redone a million times. <br /> <br /> I can only remember a spoken F word ... and I can't really remember any other language. <br /> <br /> The film lasts more than 2 hours, and for some it may take a little longer towards the end. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you might cry, but I can honestly say, it was worth $ 4 I paid. <br /> <br /> I hope you like the movie.
