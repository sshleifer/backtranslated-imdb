For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend Jascha Heifetz to the screen. One evening, while Goldwyn and his wife Frances were having dinner with Heifetz and his wife, the silent screen star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn suggested to Heifetz to act in a movie. After a certain persuasion, Heifetz accepted, provided his acting was kept to a minimum. And the film, originally titled "Music School" was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is rather rude: a streetwise guy (Gene Reynolds, who is best known as the producer of "M * A * S * H"), runs away from home and ends up in a school of financially troubled music run by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). While trying to raise money for the school, the boy and some other children happen through Heifetz at Carnegie Hall. After much noise, Heifetz ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /> <br /> The story, although predictable, is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor gaffes in which several scenes have been coated together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the hall of orchestra on a commission and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later. <br /> <br /> What is not surprising is how beautiful acting is. As was customary for the studios, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later Ma and Pa Kettle), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and Who's Who of actors characters. Actress Diana Lynn and singer / actress Kaye Connor made their (uncredited) debut in this film, as well as longtime partner Nelson Eddy Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash). Veterans Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn also appear. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn has hired the Peter Meremblum Symphony, an intense youth orchestra from the Los Angeles area, to appear in the film. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians, good as professionals (who later became many of them). Many of the orchestra's children went on in noteworthy careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn both performed in theater and film, Richard Berres was a producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a notorious music supply company, Elliott Rapaport went on to be a cardiologist prominent, Lewis Elias was a band leader, Thomas Facey a director with several symphonies, Channing Robbins a major instructor at Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins an instructor with SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the children in the orchestra chased the musical careers with the main symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> While Heifetz's acting was kept to a minimum, his salary was not. He commanded $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be shot again later, he got another $ 50,000 for another four weeks. Fortunately his musical production was not reduced to a minimum. The composer Alfred Neumann (who had been a conductor of Meremblum) managed the charts. Heifetz interprets "Introductionne and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, his arrangement of "Estrellita" by Manuel Ponce (with an off-camera accompaniment by Teddy Saidenberg), the diabolical difficulty of "Hora Staccato" by Dinicu (from a recording of Vitaphone, with Emanuel Bay at the piano), an excerpt from "Melody" by Ciajkovskij, a piece arranged for violin only by the well-known "Adante Cantabile" by Tchaikovsky from his 11 opus string quartet (played during the opening credits). beginning of the film), and the final movement from the Concerto for violin E Minori by Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody. During all these performances, there are many close-ups of Heifetz's performance, including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing, something that would be of value to violinists who wish to study his technique. <br /> <br /> The Meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing the arias "Caro Nome" by Verdi and "Casta Diva" by Bellini, (both with the singing of Sherwood), an arrangement of the overture from " Barber of Seville "by Rossini, a short excerpt from" Eine Kleine Nachtmusik "by Mozart", and the aforementioned Mendelssohn concert (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn can be heard in the background of a scene, performing part of Chopin's Nocturne in B -flat Minor, and a five-year-old Mary Ruth performs Chopin's popular "Minute" Waltz. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent film The AMC proved this regularly until the beginning of 1992. In the I have not seen it on television in the last few years, but it is not difficult to get copies of it.
