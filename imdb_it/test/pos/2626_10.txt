I remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists. It grabs you at the beginning and makes you think of the whole movie. I have been thinking about this film for the last few years and have checked in video stores to see if it's available, but I've never been able to find it or anyone who has ever heard of it. I think this kind of film is timeless, and I know it would be appreciated by an entire new generation of movie watchers. I hope this comes on video soon because it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> It is very rare for a TV movie to make so much of an impression, but this has been done and it still is after so many years.
