For me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, yet it can be seen over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technically imperfect film; the pleasure has nothing to do with the spit and the shiny (my personal top ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). "The Thing" by John Carpenter is one of the very few films suitable for this criterion. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of science fiction since I was a child in the sixties, and I read the short John W Campbell the story on which the film is based ("Who Goes There") before seeing the original film, in black and white by Howard Hawks (as with many people, that vision was illicit, on TV, when I should have been in bed!). That film, as with so many you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed almost perfect: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, photography; everything seemed to work. I've watched it many times over the next few years (and I still do it, when it is shown on TV). For this reason I have avoided the Carpenter version for years: seeing the remakes of your favorite movie is, I thought, always a mistake. When I finally watched him sometime in 1988/9, back on TV because there was nothing else, I realized that I always had to change "an error" to "usually an error"! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original and really wonderful story. From the opening scene of the helicopter and the husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the kennel, to that finale (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was conquered. The soundtrack alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close resemblance to that bass-on-snare beat, and I'm * in * the final scene again ... <br /> <br /> Until seeing "The Thing", I found Carpenter as another gore monkey, based only on comments and reviews in the official press. Since I saw "The Thing", I think I saw most of his films - I didn't get out of mine to do it, but if one comes out, seeing his name as a director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful and knows how to make a film so that it reaches a point where something will remain in the memory. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen "The Thing", and you have fun with science fiction, do yourself a favor - sit in a dark room, wrap up the heat and get ready to increase your memory!
