Mrs. Aparna Sen, the creator of Mr & Mrs Iyer, directs this film about a young girl's struggle to cope with her debilitating condition. <br /> <br /> Meethi (Konkona Sen) was a child detached from childhood and showed signs of disappointment, no one knows why. However, the latent tendency slips out of control, when the work assignment takes her to neighboring Bihar where she is raped by some political assassins. The resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to his schizophrenia. Over the years he has lost control, progressively getting worse and sinking more and more into his private "world". <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition of an older sister "not established" (divorced) and how her overbearing ways already make a bad situation worse, is indicative of what subtle line there is between abnormal and * apparently normal * . Ms. Sen also makes an excellent comment on the social alienation of these individuals. Social rehabilitation is the standard therapy along with all mind-altering deadly drugs. But what about the poor and the needy, who are always left to fend for themselves and usually fall on the street? <br /> <br /> The romantic connection between dr. Kunal and Anu was not necessary. Even the canteen scene where Dr. Kunal explains to Anu how real the world is for them, it was redundant. Anu should already know. English dialogue is a bit embarrassing, sometimes even if the acting makes up for it. Konkona and Shabana show that their reputation is worthwhile. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali perform their limited roles very well. <br /> <br /> Extensive research seems to have been done on this disease, it is very obvious. But it is not clear whether MDP can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side by side. Still in the first part, dr. Kunal recommends ECT (shock therapy), invalidating the fact that it does not work for schizophrenics, only for extreme MDPs with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> the end of this extraordinary story suggests an unknown solution (perhaps no solution). The film could have ended with a more beautiful note, because in the whole world the mentally ill can lead balanced and fruitful if not very satisfying, they live under good medical assistance. <br /> <br /> However, it is an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. HATS OF NO to Mrs. Sen! No one in India could have done it better.
