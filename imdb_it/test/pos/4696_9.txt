This is one of my favorite series, all categories, all times. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to get to know the whole series on VHS some years ago. I loved it when I saw it in -91 -92, when I was about 12 years old. I love it so much, or more, today, which is remarkable considering my (hopefully) better appreciation and criticism of the film. Most of the films I liked then don't interest me more than today, as well as the nostalgia factor. This factor is also present here, but there is much more to Robin than Sherwood of nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are only a few bad things about this series. First of all, the image and sound quality is so-so, at least in the first couple of episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you would have liked a little more blood and realism in the fight scenes, even though I know it wasn't an option in this case. <br /> <br /> So for good things! And there are a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praed IS Robin Hood. I don't think I've seen him in one role since then, which only reinforces this fact for me. It offers a performance as believable as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible job replacing it. The fact that Michael Praed did not become a bigger name as an actor is incredible. Or maybe that was his destiny, to do this role perfectly, then disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham. He is not really a complex character, but totally rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is simply hilarious. Actually, watching de Rainault sitting on his throne, bored, dazzling, makes me laugh even before he said anything. Another actor who deserves more praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness inside him and his hatred of the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who finally got his well-deserved Hollywood hit (in movies like The Departed and Beowulf). There are also many other great actors here. <br /> <br /> I love the portrait of Robin's band. They have fun, they play, they laugh, you really feel the camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from a small group like this. Those bonding scenes are so important. I think the fact of being produced in the UK with British actors is really improved, compared to the movie version -92 with Kevin Costner, which seems fake, fake, fake (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, come on ..) The cast being in able to speak English with a British accent makes it more credible, and I have the feeling that the actors, as well as the director and writers, behind the series can put themselves much more in the role of Robin Hood's band than an American crew could do . The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. Music is another one of those things that they just nailed. <br /> <br /> An interesting addition is also the fantasy and magic that is put into it. It is not exaggerated, but credible and makes the whole thing better and more interesting. I also like how the mix of comedy, adventure and drama mixes well. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so alive and so genuine. It's by far the best version of Robin Hood I've ever seen. I would not end with the quote "Nothing's forgotten". But one thing that will never be forgotten, for me, is the fantastic reinterpretation of Robin Hood. Watch it.
