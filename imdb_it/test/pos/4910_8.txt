Story of a widowed father (Claude Rains) who brings his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by the great hunky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is a friend of an old but rich man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business partner of their father, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then the tough cynical Mickey (John Garfield) enters the film ... <br /> <br /> The very funny film was a great success and nominated for five Academy Awards. It's beautifully directed by Michael Curitz, has a pretty good script (if expected) and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). This was also John Garfield's first film and made him a star. It was so popular that there were three or four sequels (which I never saw). This is a compelling, entertaining, big-budget soap opera - worth seeing.
