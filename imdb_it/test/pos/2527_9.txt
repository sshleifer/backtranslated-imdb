This is probably the best film by director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown to foreigners, which is the same reality that persecutes all the countries of Latin America, poverty and a survival instinct. The most affected in this reality is that children left orphans usually, or abandoned by their poor parents, must do so in a "dog eat dog" society many times falling into the void of delinquency, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with a "no-frills" approach, this film will come to you, fantastic plot, a film not to be missed on anyone's collection. The leading role went to Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed a few years later during a robbery. I would suggest people watch the movie "Who killed Pixote?" so you can get a deeper idea of ​​the life of these characters. Some other characters in the film have had a similar fate, some have died and others are in prison. However, this film will last long in your memory
