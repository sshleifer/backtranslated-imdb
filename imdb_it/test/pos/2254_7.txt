The film "Everything is Illuminated" comes from the director and screenwriter for the first time Liev Schreiber, adapting the first novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. The book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realistic elements and the vivid use of the seemingly impossible to represent language on the screen. The film, wisely, tries less. Although the end result is not as original as the novel, it is still a film made on a strange journey in Eastern Europe, or, as one of the characters would have liked, "a very rigid search". <br /> <br /> That character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian who loves American pop culture but cannot understand the English language. However, his grandfather (the Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a tour company that deals with American Jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan is investigating his family history, and specifically is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret is revealed during their search. <br /> <br /> The film Jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a wacky semi-kleptomaniac who steals her grandmother's prosthesis to add to her collection of "family things". Wood's quiet, wide-eyed, serious way works very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as Alex, relaxed and casual. His malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to attract the character's growing self-awareness. The Mikki dog is very funny like the demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and one of the few movie dogs I've ever seen is not at all cute and precocious. <br /> <br /> "Everything is illuminated" finally puts the Holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of specific and small tragedies. Remembering a European film, it also reflects the effect of past events on today's young people like Jonathan and Alex. With his original perspective, his strong performances and some very suggestive visual elements, "Everything is Illuminated" is a great job for a first programmer, and I hope that Schreiber continues to direct films.
