I saw "Sweeney Todd" on Broadway in 1980. He starred in George Hearn and starred most of the other cast presidents in the national production of tour operators, filmed for TV in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I saw the new DVD release of Los Angeles production, although I owned the videotape for many years. Production and performance could not be better, but the age of the original tape showed that both audio and video quality were inferior to modern standards, even on a newly printed DVD. Nevertheless, I still give him 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of the work and the surprisingly wonderful renditions of George Hearns and Angella Lansbury. Even today, the most memorable memory of a live theater performance must be Hearn's version of "These are My Friends". "You will make the rubies drip", brrr.
