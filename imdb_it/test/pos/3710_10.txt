Although it is a film of less than forty minutes, it is one of the best direct and recited stories I have ever seen. He does in less than 45 minutes what most movies can't do in more than 90. <br /> <br /> It's the story of two brothers, one of 18 and the other 10. They come from a poor family of farmers from Mississippi. Both are involved in war and in conflict of duties towards love for the family. <br /> <br /> It brought tears to my mind mainly because the whole film is so well played and directed, plus it tells the story of so many wars in which one serves and the other left behind. <br /> <br /> I can absolutely recommend this film as beyond the superb!
