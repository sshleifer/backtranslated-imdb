Bergman is a director and writer of sublime comedies. This fact becomes evident in "En lektion I kärlek", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep but very exciting scenes. This film paves the way for Bergman's later plays "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all played by Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent film with which to begin your Bergman experience, acutely interpreting the emotional problems of young and old. Martin Bodin's cinematography is stunning, for example in the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of successful comedy, with a clarity of depth that surpasses even some Bergman comedies.
