Despite being dated, "Inki and the Minah Bird" is, in my opinion, a fun and fascinating cartoon. The work is not extraordinary, but quite good. This comic has no dialogue, just sounds and music, but this combination works quite well. The comic itself is good, fun, old-fashioned, creative, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes the difference because it focuses on just 3 characters: Inki (the little black girl), the bird Minah (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion who wants both Inki and Minah at breakfast - so she chases them both during most of the cartoons. <br /> <br /> Actually I find that very beautiful, exhilarating and cold lion. I really like that lion. That poor lion is so foolish and a loser that you must feel sorry for him. For me, the real enemy is the bird Minah, not the lion. At one point, the lion almost eats it - a pity he can't swallow it, because he deserved to be eaten. <br /> <br /> Back to this animated short, there is no single boring or boring moment. At least for me. The only piece that I find stupid is the ending because the bird has a great fight with the lion, it steals its teeth and puts them on itself. Apart from that, I have nothing serious to criticize about this, apart from the fact that the steak should certainly have gone for the lion and not for the bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is very forgotten and underestimated little gem that should surely get more credit.
