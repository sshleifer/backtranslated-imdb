Black Scorpion is a funny movie about a female superhero wearing leather tights and driving a car that can turn into her Scorpion Mobile armored scorpion. Fight the evil Breathtaker and this is a great recipe for a good time. I loved the fact that she had to say "Yo" to get the car computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so evil that he wants to give the whole city to asthma! It's all so exaggerated and that's beauty! The scene in which Black Scorpion "attacks" his companion steals the show. You'll know when you see it. This DVD also has a fun interview with Joan Severance. It's a doll. Black Scorpion is a fun DVD. I love!
