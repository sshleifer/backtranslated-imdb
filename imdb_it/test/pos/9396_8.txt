I'm not sure what I can add that has not already been said in some of these other fine and rather hilarious comments, but I try. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that selectively "absorbs" and disintegrates the bodies of anyone (or anything) lying on it with his body full of orange juice . We have the man, in some scenes that seem incredibly similar to Robert Smith of The Cure, who are hanging around the wall commenting on the future, and we have our various victims who can't resist the comfort of this mystical bed. <br /> <br /> This is not a normal bed. No sirree Bob! Not only does he eat people, but he cleans himself, draws the blankets, and even does himself. Who wouldn't want a bed like this? He can even use his plates as a rudimentary "lasso" to return the escaped victims (especially if they are recovering half of the film to try to escape). <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you can call it that), talk about these three girls going to this remote area to do from home (??). I don't remember exactly, but it doesn't really matter, since there are many things that defy the conventions that you simply have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters apparently talk to each other through telepathy, since their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she is not loved by the rest of the "gang" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings about this topic through a voiceover, but we don't care; character development was thrown out the window a long time ago in this movie, so why start now? There are scenes in which the bed laughs, snores, squeaks, and makes various other noises that we assume judging by the non-reaction of our cast to said noises, we cannot be heard. This and telepathy make it very difficult to ascertain the question of diegesis ... but this is OK .... this is Death Bed: The Bed That Eats and it defies all logic, so it's OK. Makes a lush dreamlike quality to this bizarre movie If you buy (and buy ... I said "buy"?) This DVD, make sure you take a look at the director's introduction. He explains that the filming of this "film" began in 1972, it did not end until 1977, it did so for a few years without luck, and then for 26 years until 2003 it was released on DVD. Presumably someone somewhere had a print of this in another country and bootleged after it was bootleged and it was enough by chance, on a bulletin board no less, that our director found evidence that people knew and panted ! curate, of his little-known film. That's where he decided to give it a shot and release it. I'm glad he did it. Once you've even heard the title of this movie, you MUST see it. I for one am going to buy it and I'm going to preach his gospel all over the world ... starting with this comment
