Perfectly directed, written, interpreted and filmed, this tranquil and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if a person exists who can watch the BABETTE FESTIVAL without being touched at a fundamental level, he is a person I do I don't care to know. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. In 1800, two elderly ladies of the maiden (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in the remote Jutland, where they sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities and personal happiness to continue the religious ministry of their long-dead father to the small flock he served . One of the young admirers sends them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St√©phane Audran), whose husband and son were killed in France and who fled from his land for fear of meeting the same fate. Although in reality they do not require her services, the sisters hire her as a waitress and cook - and over the years her intelligence and tireless efforts on their behalf allow the old congregation to stay together and the sisters to live in more comfort of what they had imagined; indeed, the whole village admires and depends on you. One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a rich woman. Knowing that her new riches will mean her return to France, the sisters hope that she will be allowed to prepare a real French meal for them and for the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and evening is really a night to remember - but not for reasons that might be expected, because Babette's party turns out to be food for the body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love for the women who took her and the villagers who were so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The film is extraordinary from every point of view, meticulous in detail and yet not irresistible in its presentation. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters both in their simple devotion to God and in their all too human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her party and where the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but no one comes close to the simple art and beauty of the BABETTE FESTIVAL, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and shows food for the body and for the soul. Highly, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon reviewer
