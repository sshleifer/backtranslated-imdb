I saw this film, having never read the book and taken the characters at face value, but having already been introduced to them, I looked at it again recently. I got a completely different point of view from the movie. <br /> <br /> Without the burden of having to focus on each character, learning his quirks and fads, he allowed me to focus on the film's cultural issues. Iowa farming families are as intimately interconnected as in the Indiana area where I grew up in the 40s and 50s and I immediately recognized the stories and motivations behind the characters. Perhaps, Jane Smiley meant for us to see beyond the world in which these people had to live, but viewers are so caught up in the "Hollywood" aura of individual actors that they lack a rich disposition of a lifestyle that exists less and less when every decade passes. Another film with these characteristics is the "Bridges of Madison County". Try watching both of these films again with an eye on the whole picture.
