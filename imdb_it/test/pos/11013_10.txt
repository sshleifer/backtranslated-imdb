In these days of ultra-fast processors and the Internet, inventing a film like "The Matrix" might simply seem to be the next step in coining the term "cyberspace", but remember how computers were in 1974? Right. Finding the notion of virtual reality is truly an incredible feat of imagination. Fassbinder's film obviously has none of the great gunslingers and pyrotechnics, and many "artistic" elements, but the atmosphere it creates is intense and raises the question of how we can know what is real in a dark and compelling way , making this a cooler and a thriller for the mind. This also results in a notation about more recent VR stories: if you come out of a cyberspace, can you be sure that you haven't just emerged into another level of virtual reality?
