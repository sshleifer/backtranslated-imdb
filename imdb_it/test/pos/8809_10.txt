If "you've been there" and "you've done" you'll absolutely love this movie. I have and "there" I mean underground clubs and home parties where it is much rarer to find drunk people than to find people out loud, ecstasy, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> With "that" I intend to dance and sweat like crazy for eight hours or more in a row without even a brake and, followed by a way for a long morning of non-sleep and I almost want to die, followed from a week of waiting for the next weekend to redo everything. <br /> <br /> So even though this film is one of my absolute favorites, I can definitely see why some people, or most people, wouldn't like it.
