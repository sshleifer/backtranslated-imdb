I had my son for the weekend and my parents called me and told me they wanted to meet them both at the cinema. When I got there, my mother said she really wanted to see "The Women" and asked if my son and I were worried because it was labeled as a chick film. Reluctantly I agreed to think that this would be another "First Wives Club" type film. I must say that I was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the film from the opening scene to the end credits. It was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles. My son and I found ourselves laughing for the whole movie and we're glad we saw it. It was a great Saturday afternoon movie and I highly recommend it to anyone, man or woman.
