I saw "Into Pitch Black" on t.v. and so I had to see this. I must say that I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Not only has David Twohy's style improved since he wrote "Critters 2", this film brought Vin Diesel to my attention. Of course, he was there in "Into Pitch Black", but here he was fierce, scary and intense. I haven't seen such charisma since Schwarzenegger in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, but it's the characters that make this film interesting. Then there was what happens with the female protagonist. Unexpected. The dark humor helps the film to move, the effects are not great, but when Riddick fights the alien ... he blew all my complaints. <br /> <br /> Diesel has not made much of this film that would interest me, but I can't wait for the sequel to begin.
