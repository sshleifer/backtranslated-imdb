- That's pretty much the entire soundtrack of this movie. I just saw this child at the Munich Film Festival and shook the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, nor do I believe he was heard, but he did take a very intimate look at the life and history of the "mixer". He has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his heterogeneous group of enthusiastic interviews will be seasoned at full blast based on what they are talking about. I have never been great at "scratching" myself, but the film does a wonderful job of keeping the elementary school for those who know little and playing tricks on those who are experts in this area. Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this film, but it was only after the film that I was able to name several heavy hitter in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extreme fascination for the turntables of these talented and extravagant DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also casts some gratifying light on these guys (and a woman) to be classified as musicians. Praying does not let his film be inactive and if there is a slow scene it is soon re-energized by music that never ends. If nothing else, this movie will increase your slang vocabulary. I have to go back to "digging", so I'll finish this review. Look at it, it will be of interest. Good man. Good stuff.
