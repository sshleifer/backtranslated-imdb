As part of an initiation joke, Julie (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a telekinesis master, died recently and was put into it. When Julie's sister sisters desecrate the place where she is housed, the real terror begins. <br /> <br /> This little film has had a good dose of atmosphere and I enjoyed it a lot, plus the last twenty minutes are simply great. Anyone looking for a lost gem of a horror movie from the 80s should look no further. Highly undervalued. Plus Elizabeth Daily is adorable. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B <br /> <br /> Media Blaster DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director Tom McLoughlin and co-writer Michael Hawes; and trailer for "The Being", "Frankestien's Bloody Terror", "Just Before Dawn", and "Devil Dog" Disc 2) Alternate director's cut (which is almost unwatchable due to a bad press) & featurette behind the scenes
