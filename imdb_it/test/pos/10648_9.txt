This film is a landmark in the history of non-mainstream cinema. The use of montage represents a qualitative leap from the right and relatively juxtaposed of Strike (Eisenstein's first film). Take the scene on the steps and observe the repeated blow of the soldiers coming down, to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually happened! A very intelligent monumental film, a must see for all film students!
