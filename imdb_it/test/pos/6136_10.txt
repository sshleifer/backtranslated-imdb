I've been looking for this miniseries for a long time. I saw this film when I lived in Russia many years ago. I'm curious if someone who has the registered copy of this film can send me the copy. I am willing to cover all expenses and pay for extra tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best TV series I've ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Israel and the history of the world after the Second World War. I'm also trying to find a book (I heard it's even better than the movie), but the new one costs about $ 50 on Amazon and I never bought a used copy. my e-mail address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thanks a lot for the help.
