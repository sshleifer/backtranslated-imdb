There was a time when not all animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to see this wonderful movie again and actually I found a good and reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful because it's out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around. I got a very good copy from a company called Flashbacks and it's pretty good. In the old days I watched it in black and white on TV and its magic to see it in color. Much better than anyone could believe. The songs are delicious and the color is fantastic. It is interesting to note that the characters are really well developed, which is strange in animated films. I loved Hoppity and the evil Mr. Beatle is a real cad. It's incredibly imaginative. The way inanimate objects like cotton coils, old cans become part of the environment and have new features. The anthropomorphic use of insects is surprising considering the highly abused creatures that most people think are repulsive. We hope we can never step on an insect again! Enemy insects are men. In reality, of course, it's the insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to get rid of ants here in Australia they keep coming back. The battle has been lost and we must live with them. There are several scenes that stand out when Hoppity and Mr Bumble are caught in a watering can, the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful. It is also rather anthropomorphic, but in a fascinating way. Human characters look a lot like Gulliver's and are incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. It is a crime this film has not been hailed as a classic. The only discordant note for me are the occasions in the film when the characters slip into verse. The speaking verse ruins the narrative and was not necessary, the verse is horrible and ruins another wise script. It's great and the kids will love it. It is a joy to watch. There is also a very clever ending.
