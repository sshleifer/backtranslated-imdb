I've seen this movie about 4 times and every time I'm impressed with the work of Second Camera Assistant. It sounds trivial but there is something very professional, knowledgeable and talented there. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as stated by other comments. The meaning so that the issues addressed are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago. The acting is a little tense, but the job of the second camera assistant is stellar! This person needs to get back into the business - maybe directing? What is this person waiting for? I'll watch and wait and cheer from the sidelines! - Bob
