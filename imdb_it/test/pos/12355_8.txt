Sheba Baby, is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation film. It was one of Pam's less visceral films of this kind. Pam plays Sheba Shane, who is a gumshoe from Chicago. Sheba's father is the owner of a small loan company in Missouri. When the local mobsters try to manage his business father, Sheba chases the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier had already made his mark on the Blaxploitation films, when Sheba Baby arrived. Fans of Coffy and Foxy Brown know that Pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the fiery performance that the spectators expected from Pam, was not so evident in this film. Not that Pam doesn't kick Sheba Baby. It's not just a kind of runaway vigilante, like in his previous Blaxploitation films. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast in this film is a clear disappointment. So Sheba Baby is Pam's movie, everything and everything. And even if Pam is a little more subdued than in her other films, she still gives a compelling performance in Sheba Baby. This film certainly deserves your time, if you are a passionate fan of Pam Grier.
