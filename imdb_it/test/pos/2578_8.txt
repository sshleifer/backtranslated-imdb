In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, the wife who just left him is missing. Find the slutty town and the nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) unloaded on the street near his small farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus takes her home, gives medicine and treatment and feeds her like a father, keeping her chained to control his warmth. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is released from the army because of his anxiety problem, he misunderstands the relationship between Lazarus and Rae and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Moan" is a strange tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The talented Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since childhood by her father and having sex with the whole city where she lives. The versatility of this actress is surprising, and this is probably the most mature work that Christina Ricci has ever seen perform. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance as Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard in a movie, with a wonderful blues. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre or CÃ©u e o Inferno" ("Between heaven and hell")
