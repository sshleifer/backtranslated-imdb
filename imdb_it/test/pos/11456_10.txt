I love young people trapped in a horror movie. Not just because I'm a big fan of Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita, but because it's so much fun and really scary sometimes. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, especially the Linnea scene with lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed. <br /> <br /> A lot of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill, a lot of humor, fantastic soundtrack, high body count, etc ... By the way, if you've ever seen this, try to buy / watch the Unrated version that has more blood and some scenes that the nominal version is missing.
