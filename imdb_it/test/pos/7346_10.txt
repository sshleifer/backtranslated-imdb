The relationship between the main characters that I thought was very realistic. How the two end up involved is credible. It doesn't have all that "oh yes, right" that most Hollywood movies have. Don't even mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the trapeze. I'm a trapeze student and I like that they showed how hard the body is, hands and yes those tissue burns are brutal! Definitely worth seeing for the report as well as the art that is made in the film. I loved it! I'm happy with the way the film ended, but I really wanted to see more. Make sure you stay seated through the credits for a special treatment hehe. Great scene!
