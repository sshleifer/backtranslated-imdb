The character Little Tramp or Little Man by Charlie Chaplin wins the first world war, at the time called The Great War, alone, even capturing the Kaiser, something that the allied armed forces were not able to do. Too bad that everything turns out to be a dream, which is somehow a policeman and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short film (almost a feature film at 46 minutes). <br /> <br /> There are inventive gags galore including Charlie who has to wear a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese shipped from home, so use the cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeping underwater in a trench flooded next to a soldier who continues to annoy; Charlie disguises himself as a tree - one of his best sketches ever - and Charlie pretending to beat his friend who became a prisoner of war, then hugging him when the enemy disappeared. <br /> <br /> One The amazing thing is how Charlie, when he is behind enemy lines dressed as German, looks like Hitler more than ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs climbed to dominate German politics. Obviously Hitler has modeled his appearance after that of Charlie in this film.
