The plot of "In the Mood for Love" is quite simple: a married man and a married woman (even if not with each other) slowly develop a romantic bond with one another. The rhythm of the film is incredibly slow and in fact, not much happens between the two. However, the background of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and the sense of intelligence of director Wong Kar-Wai to capture the beauty of the environment and the main characters make this film a pleasure to watch. The actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both excellent and Wong Kar-Wai has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feeling and nostalgia of the past (something that many films and directors try to do but usually fail miserably). There are so many little details that add charm to the film (a director's trademark) and the colors and cinematography are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a wonderful cinematic result. 9/10.
