Attention, possible spoilers ahead ?? .. I just saw "Joe" for the second time. The first time was over 30 years ago on an aeronautical basis. I was reminded by the Air Force upholstery with Tech. Sgt. Strips worn by boyfriend / retailer; we aviators had a good laugh the first time it appeared on the screen because that is a "rescue" grade. Over the years I have brought several other images from the film. First of all she was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else commented, you couldn't take your eyes off you. Until now I had not realized that this was a twenty year old Susan Sarandon in her first film. What a loss that did not make more films when it seemed so. I also remember the irony of having a counterculture hero like Peter Boyle who plays the leading role of a right machine gun. Not unlike George C. Scott who plays the generals in Dr. Stranamore and Patton. And of course the shocking ending had a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Over 30 years ago it was the most discussed film I've ever played on the base. We thought it was a great movie and I was reluctant to see it again because I was afraid it would be as disappointing as Easy Rider. But looking at him today I was amazed by how well the film gave him. It is a very strong script with few holes, although you have to ask yourself about the guy who is leaving the tub immediately when Sarandon enters with him. <br /> <br /> Looking for an explanation of why this movie is still so funny I have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting. Boyle was as physically credible as Joe (as others have pointed out, his portrait would have inspired the character of Archie Bunker some years later). Did Ted Knight model his "Caddyshack" character, Judge Smails after Dennis Patrick's advertising executive in "Joe"? They look alike and sound the same way. Patrick was completely credible as the manager of the upper middle class and too narrow. And Sarandon's innocent fawn eyes with Raggety Ann's doll still evokes a protective response from all male spectators: the perfect casting. <br /> <br /> Nude and drug scenes actually hold up (they were very provocative for their day) and are as explicit as anything found in 'Thirteen'. The only thing that comes out of this film is that violence is not realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was about the same time as 'The Wild Bunch', and the tone of violence in the movies had just begun to change. <br /> <br /> Another reason this film holds up is that the events of the last two years have brought to light the relevance of the theme and context of this film. In the film both types of "conservatives" are portraits full of fear and hatred towards the unconventional modes of counterculture; and full of envy for their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is described as a mockery of straight culture; and although paranoid towards conservatives (legitimately, given that this was only a couple of months after Kent State), they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. The political landscape is not so different more than 30 years later. I'm not sure conservatives envy young people and liberals until 1970, but they fear and hate more. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that surprisingly is relevant now as it was in the early 1970s.
