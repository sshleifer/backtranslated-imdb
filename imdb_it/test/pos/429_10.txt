It seems that Hack has been described as unrealistic ... but that's what TV is. TV aims to provide an escape from everyday life and I feel that Hack does a great job in this regard. Add to this the slow process of revealing his past plots and engaging / interesting; you can't get enough. Furthermore, with such great actors as David Morse, Andre Braugher and even little Mathew Borish, what more could you ask for. So, if you're looking for an engaging experience and a liking for the "losers" characters, I suggest you give Hack a chance, especially now that he's finally getting back on his feet.
