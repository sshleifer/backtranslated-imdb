Cuba Gooding, Jr. will win the BEST ACTOR Oscar in 2003. And Ed Harris will win for the BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. What a beautiful and touching film it is, but make sure you bring a box of tissues with you because if this movie doesn't get you, then you have ice water in your veins. <br /> <br /> It was 1976. The setting was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a high school white football coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a retarded black but nice companion, Cuba Gooding, whose biggest assets, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart that is also used as a bicycle. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris has a keen interest in the guy for a reason explained much later in the movie. It gives Cuba the nickname "Radio" and what follows is a compelling, compelling, compelling investigation of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing short of a masterpiece.
