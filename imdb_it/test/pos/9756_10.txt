"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful in everything. The jokes between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber are fun like anything else you hear in a movie today. The best line? "This would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype of "Silent Bob" by Kevin Smith. The black and white photography of Lucien N. Andoit (in particular with the bandit shadows) was surprising. All I can say about Ida Lupino is "Thank God for the DVD!" You can go straight to the scene where he is trying on sombreros and serapes and see it in front of that mirror over and over again. <br /> <br /> Not to forget, that even the boy Nino Martini sings the real purple.
