The dead spots and the postcard-like superficiality of "Out of Africa" ​​concerned almost every interest I could read about Isak Dinesen. So when my brother bought me "Babette's Feast", and knowing it was based on a Dinesen story, I didn't exactly compete with the VCR. But with the passage of the titles, it became clear that it was not a normal film. Jutland (where it is set) is not Africa; the cold mist that accumulates on the camera's blows is not inviting. The cold and hostile sea; the heavy gray clouds; the pale green and icy cliffs - translate into adversity that show on the faces on which the director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain. The most serious one is that of Bodil Kjer as Philippa; among the myriad merits of this film, the most memorable is that face. It stands as a map that places before us the beloved wonder of its pastor's apostolate; like a maze of long neglected fjords where the complications of perseverance and the commitment of his congregation hang like glittering gleams. <br /> <br /> I collect is the point of Dinesen on how the world is inexplicably dedicated to Christian dedication, when Philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor (because she fears that she is not up to the rules and the rigors of his little religious clique), and returns to find his mistress whom he considers the greatest chef on the continent. I also imagine his point of view that Christ responds to the doubts and regrets of those who renounce worldly success (Philippa's sister, Martina, rejects the efforts of a visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont, whose joy creates a edifying counterpoint to the lack of spirit that surrounds his discovery to transform it into a star of the opera, the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks the sanctuary as a servant of two spinster sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs for God alone for those who are closer to Him to witness, but it is Axel who weaves the harshness of these people's lives with the richness of Martina's voice and Babette Hersant's table and effects a sumptuousness that you would never expect from a film on sacrifice, faith and religious conviction. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film from other religious films is its cunning humor. "The Feast of Babette", ie the banchet in itself - a posthumous commemoration of the centenary of the minister - is a splendidly orchestrated clash of sensibilities that offers comic moments of an ensemble of actors that has no equal in their subtlety. It is only this clever comedy that enriches the solemn feelings of closure. Together they do something that pious films rarely do. They leave a believer tremendously hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humiliated.
