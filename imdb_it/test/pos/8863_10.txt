The Thing by John Carpenter is undoubtedly the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it's also one of my favorite movies of all time. What makes the movie so beautiful? It's hard to put a finger on it. Everything seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions when everything seems to fall on the spot. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a kind of moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it is not just about the gore (which is wonderful, btw), but is able to create a paranoia that has no rival in the movies. A truly wonderful film that is adored by all horror fans and anyone with good taste in movies.
