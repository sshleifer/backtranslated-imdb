Not surprisingly, Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who would later direct the most heartbreaking war movie ever made, 'Come and See (1985).' 'The Ascent (1977)' ?? Has Shepikto's last film been completed before a premature death ?? it is very much built in the same mold. Set during World War II, the film follows a pair of Soviet partisans trying to secure food for their starving army as they escape the occupying German forces. The first forty minutes are agonizingly tense, while the two men drag themselves through the harsh and snow-covered landscape, the world around them is completely devoid of life, warmth and color (indeed, so monotonous the scenery that literally took me this long to realize that the film was shot in black and white. <br /> <br /> After the German soldiers captured the partisans, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality, while Sotnikov ( Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even in the case of extreme violence, the less resolute Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin) tries to save himself. Did he do wrong? Ryback's betrayal is discouraging, but the film does not immediately condemn his treacherous actions, on the other hand, the viewer is forced to consider what his own response might be in such a situation Shepitko takes pity on Ryback while the Bible pitied Judas Both men have or betrayed their allies with the enemy and were forced to see them executed. However, considering that Judas committed suicide by hanging (at least according to the Gospel of Matthew), does Ryback also find that option closed to him? in a terribly tense climax, the belt around the neck becomes unfastened. <br /> <br /> "The Ascent" draws its emotional power from Shepitko's surprising quest for realism. I have no doubt that the two main actors spent whole days climbing the snow-covered ground on their hands and knees, and, indeed, their suffering is so convincing that I developed a cold while watching the film (seriously, I did it ). It is interesting to note that the film wonders about this reality on several occasions, while Ryback imagines himself making an offer for freedom, and then he is killed by his German captors. This device, although unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; Ryback is facing a test of his dignity, and, faced with a new dilemma at every turn, he constantly chooses the selfish alternative, his own life the only decisive criterion. At the end of the film, he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.
