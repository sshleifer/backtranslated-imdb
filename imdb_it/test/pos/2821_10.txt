I made this film. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience that appears on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie exactly as we imagined it while preparing the film. The sets are fantastic and well made for each character. John York and his team created sets that not only fit the characters, but that worked well for the film, allowing us to move smoothly through walls and from set to set. Each character has a fantastic bow, which makes a great story. I feel like all the actors have given excellent performances. I disagree with some of the other comments that say acting was not good. Look at it and decide for yourself.
