Well done documentary focused on two Sudanese refugees who have resettled in the United States. It's your basic story for fish out of water with a non-fiction touch. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived before they came to America and how they adapted once they arrived here (in Houston, Texas). They expected some sort of paradise, but they found that it is much more difficult than it seems well in the United States. They go from confident idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Wherever they go, they encounter bureaucrats with traces of paper that most citizens can take for granted. They worry that they are more black than African Americans and do not feel accepted because of this. One of the "Lost Boys" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds the conditions slightly better but still less than ideal. There are people who try to help them and try to hurt them in this film. Not shown, but talked about, are those who put a gun to their head and robbed them, leading one of the Lost Boys to comment negatively that "all black people in America are not good". I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I was hoping to see their reaction to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. And yet, all in all, a really well done documentary without narration. No one really is needed. The "Lost Boys" do a great job explaining about the events that surround them without any help, thank you very much.
