I saw Grand Champion all the way through at least twice. I liked the story of the movie, the characters and the actors weren't bad. It is refreshing to see a movie with a G rating. This is a good movie. History is mostly from the point of view of children. The interactions between children and adults make the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you enjoyed the Little Rascals, you'll probably like it. I saw this movie on cable. Or on an Encore or Showtime family. This is not a movie I was going to see at the theater. But, I go to the theater only for the effects of the big screen, so many comedies, romantic movies or dramas don't go to the big screen, I'm waiting for the TV / cable edition. Prepare your children, make a popcorn and have fun!
