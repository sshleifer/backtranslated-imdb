I was surprised to read the comments of the person who did not like this movie. It's really funny. There are certainly a few laughs that my boyfriend and I mention one another. Some situations could be disturbing (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly strange view of sexuality) but credible at the same time. This is communication and communication problems between men and women.
