A fantastic cinematic experience. I really enjoyed watching this really great movie in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except that it is a terrible shame that Sir Albert Finney is not yet accepted by AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in films like Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (just to name a few - he was nominated for an Oscar for them), The Dresser is probably his strong point, yet ... <br /> I know the Oscars are just a popularity contest, but if Americans like British actors and actresses ("and the Oscar goes to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson etc.) and everyone deserved the award!), Why did they always leave Sir Finney with empty hands? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny). I don't know, I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the two protagonists of The Dresser, you will not forget what the art of acting is. Watch this movie and have fun! I recommend it to everyone who loves art. I give 9/10 for this excellent film (1 missing point for non-cinematographic material, after all it's "just" a theater) <br /> <br /> Note: my criteria are much stronger than this on IMDb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should / could last forever).
