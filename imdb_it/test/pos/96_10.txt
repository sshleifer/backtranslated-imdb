Having been raised in Canada, I saw this short many times especially in CBC. I've seen it many times, in many periods of my life, and every time the reactions are the same. It's a joyful bittersweet, a wonderfully animated film that pulls your heart out. I'm sure I have it on a VHS tape somewhere by digging around. <br /> <br /> Every growing child can relate to the situation, and wants to adapt to your favorite idols. The scene and look at the children look out when his mother is filling out the Eatons catalog and his jump around the room is priceless. I haven't seen anyone capture that carefree atmosphere of youth in the movies, as this little short has. <br /> <br /> Of course I'm a fan of Montreal habs, and that makes my appreciation for this more special. But in the end it's the nostalgic aspect of tin hockey, and the memories of your family telling you that you should be great at what you get even if it's not exactly what you wanted. And oh yes, the animation is nice too;) <br /> <br /> Rated 10 out of 10
