okay ... first to Anne rice BOOK fans .... <br /> <br /> sure that Lestat's eyes aren't blue ... of course he's not blond in this movie ... but even if Marius doesn't is the maker ... even if they have COMPLETELY changed the story ..... <br /> <br /> how can you say that it is not a good movie .. <br /> <br /> this movie ... it's the BEST vampire movie I've ever seen ... and lestat is depicted perfectly in it ... maybe not his features ... but I don't think we can find a better lestat ... the way he talks. .. and the way he looks at mere mortals ... his arrogance ... and the pure love for fame is impeccably represented. <br /> <br /> If for once ... consider it just a movie ... and don't try relate each scene to the book ... you'll love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> now ... to non-readers ... <br /> <br /> be prepared to fall in love with this movie .... it has everything ... and goth music ... it's like an added gift ... the dialogues ... they are beautiful ... and they capture ... and even if it's a vampire movie ... you find yourself smiling ... at the wit of the characters ... and you'll find yourself sympathizing with vampires .. <br /> <br /> in general ... one of my favorite movies ... !! 10/10
