A dozen bored surfers, mostly children in Venice, California, not only reinvent skateboarding but rework a suburban fashion that was once forgotten in the 1950s in a revolution for action sports. <br /> <br /> Narrarated by Sean Penn, Dogtown describes life in the most degraded "Locals Only" beach communities in 1974, which consisted mainly of surfing in early morning tides and loitering. The Zephyr Team (or Z-boys as they are called) spends a summer fighting boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local that owns a surf shop. After participating in re-emerging skateboarding competitions in SoCal, they all transfigure them in their own scene; one that sets off a generation of skateboarders made up of greats like Tony Hawk, Shaun White and the creators of X-Games. <br /> <br /> Dogtown puts the chronological perspective into the skateboard and the up-from-the-bootstraps story you never knew you had. <br /> <br /> from Andy Frye to MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
