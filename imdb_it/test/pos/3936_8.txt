The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Although she was privately known for being an excellent dance club and dancer, Miss Turner rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. <br /> <br /> So the spectators take notice! Here, MGM was clearly still trying to determine which way the young actress was going to develop, and then they were handing her over to everything from Andy Hardy to Dr. Kildaire. <br /> <br /> In "Two Girls on Broadway", "however, she is offered an excellent opportunity to show off her native rhythm and the ability to move time in the production number" My Wonderful One, Let's Dance ". This number is conceived and filmed as a sort of hybrid between a Busby Berkely style extravaganza and the kind of routine that Hermes Pan was drawing for Astaire and Rogers at the RKO. <br /> <br /> Thus, the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner are represented as bartenders (with a full chorus) in front of a curtain of black lame where Mr. Murphy writes the number down to Miss Turner, then the camera (on one arm) pulls back in a remarkable crane stroke to reveal a huge stage, and a rotating set with steps, columns, fences and sliding walls. <br /> <br /> From this moment on, Murphy and Turner perform a quick series of moods and attitudes, including elevators, tops, soft shoes and ends with an electr arousing series of joint pirouettes that ends with Murphy either by lifting and turning Turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra. <Br /> <br /> Everyone told a mind-boggling feat that shows that Miss Turner was fully capable of holding her own as a dancer, although I would dare to say that most of her admirers would refuse to abandon her as a queen of melodrama.
