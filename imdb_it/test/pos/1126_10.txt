... I can't believe I was captured by this show instantly, after seeing the first scene I was in. <br /> <br /> Anyway, first of all the guys are sexy, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the girls are cute, sexy, smart and are not afraid of being called a bitch. I like it. Which at the same time does not make them mean and greedy, simply realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, the relationships are so great, especially Casey and Cappy. Lately every show runs very far from its original path and people end up with someone who wasn't even in season one. Cappy and Casey's relationship is true love, a guy that lasts. They've loved each other over the years and it's not over when a guest star appears. <br /> <br /> In today's world it is perhaps incredible that two people love each other for a long time, but it happens. And people define themselves at school, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be in college with. Just like Casey and Cappy. <br /> <br /> I HOPE THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER SEASONS OF THIS SHOW AND I HOPE WE CAN SEE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CASEY AND CAPPY NOW THAT THEY WILL BE PROBABLE TOGETHER at Thanksgiving ... I love this show
