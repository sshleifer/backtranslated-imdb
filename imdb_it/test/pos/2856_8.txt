Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through soap operas "A Reason to Love" as a way to escape her slob husband and boring life. After a shocking incident involving two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to Los Angeles, believing that she is destined to marry the main character of the show (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is a rare thing, a lesser-known film with a cast of famous actors and a soft plot of Rom-Com that surprises with its formidable script and its acting. Indeed, such a plot raises a question about the R rating, but it is justified. The shocking incident that sends Betty over the edge is a bit too graphic compared to the light and fun comedy that has to come and feels like something out of a different film, but at the same time it is necessary to show Betty's transformation into eyed, amily nut job becomes. <br /> <br /> As we go along with Betty on her journey, director Neil LaBute works an extraordinary magic that makes the film unique and far above the comedy of error. An example of this would be Betty's first encounter with her crush. She pours her heart towards him and he plays together, thinking about auditioning for a part on the show. Although we are aware of the ridiculous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, Betty's emotional perspective. We almost believe what he is saying, yet we understand that his mind is fractured. While other filmmakers try to accentuate the ridiculousness of the situation to snatch every ounce of possible comedies off the scene, LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats it with the utmost understanding and understanding. <br /> <br /> the joke between the assassins played by Freeman and Rock is priceless, the excellent script that draws up an intelligent line after a clever line to make them parade. In particular, Freeman is excellent, as always, while his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his ideal of Betty, not even knowing who he is or what happened to her. Aaron Eckhart demonstrates once again the versatility in the ungrateful role of Betty's bad husband and he is almost unrecognizable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose portrait of the soap star is not too overcooked. There is a tendency to fix the clich√© of the celebrity bastard as densely as possible, and Kinnear resists, instead of infusing him with pompous but contained authority, despite being simply a star of soap. <br /> <br /> The soap opera is made so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and co hit the nail in the head with this and a good thing too. If the soap opera had been too satirical, much of the film would not have worked. Making a "Days of Our Lives" as seen in Friends would have been the wrong move for this movie. The dedication to detail pays off, as the style and feel of the soap opera begin to bleed more and more into Betty's reality, while maintaining the comically unintended appearance of the genre. The scenes on the set seem real, unlike some movies where the atmosphere seems so produced, you wondered why people who do it for a living can't do it well. <br /> <br /> The clear resolution of the final act, although predictable, is overall satisfactory. It is a pity that after LaBute directed this wonderful film, the mainstream called him to direct the abysmal remake of The Wicker Man, a fine example of a man so totally above the material he was given. Unfortunately, you cannot absolve him of any responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Nurse Betty, it's something to discover. If you have it, it's worth a visit again. There is a fascination for Nurse Betty who is contagious, although she may not let you think long afterwards. A hidden gem anyway.
