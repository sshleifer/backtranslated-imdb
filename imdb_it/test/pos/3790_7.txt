The big names in the film tried to play their part in the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandistic framework is part of his contribution, even though the war was almost over at the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humbly performs acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the ass. It's a very funny film, even though I don't consider it almost one of its best. It is with 'A Dog's Life' as his best release for First National before making his first masterpiece 'The Kid'. It's his first three reels, which contain sustained and more elaborate gags than he is able to orchestrate in his two-wheeled glasses at Mutual. <br /> <br /> It can be difficult to balance a pro-war message with slapstick antics and burlesque scenes on the front, but you might not think so looking at 'Shoulder Arms'. In many respects it is also preferable to have a "more serious" and dramatic work with a similar message, such as "Hearts of the World" by Griffith. Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of the cinematographic comedy of that time; it makes it look effortless. He knew very well by now that a film with less gags - with more elaboration, refinement and accurate timing - could be better than any Keystone farce with a dozen hits per minute. The sequence in which Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a pertinent example. Even with the angry wars, Chaplin can lift the spirits of millions.
