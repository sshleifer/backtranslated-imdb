A man arrives in a strange, beautiful, sterile city, where nobody feels emotions and obsessions instead of interior design. The essential identity of his days recalls the "Groundhog Day"; the strange passages in and out of this world remember more "Being John Malkovich". But really, this is a Scandinavian film, a piece of self-satire that is also Scandinavian in style: the tone is austere, and even the most fantastic scenes are interpreted directly, challenging you to laugh at the absurdity. In my opinion, the combination is not entirely successful: there are not enough authentic laughs to compensate for the difficulty of taking the piece as pure drama. It is certainly original; perhaps my problem is that the satire world is not what I recognize. Maybe I should move to Scandanavia!
