Morris and Reva Applebaum had been Broadway's toast at its peak. At ninety, Morris is a widower. He summons his children - the psychotherapist and BMW car dealer - and his daughter, the screenwriter / television producer - to attend a party in his honor, after which he will self-identify himself. They are literal mind creatures, they take what they say at face value. He leads them, his grandchildren and some others including an African-American-Jewish psychiatrist who remembers Godfrey Cambridge, in a cheerful chase through Manhattan as they try to stop him or dissuade him. <br /> <br /> The comedy totally works. The performances are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This film does more than deserve an audience: it deserves popular success.
