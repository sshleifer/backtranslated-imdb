Mark Blankfield (from the old late-night television program "Fridays") plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a gentle-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-drugged party animal. This was obviously not his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also a lot of fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's not even over again and runs through Hollywood like a crazy sex machine with frizzy hair and gold chains. There are some subplots like the girlfriend of Jekyll, who is the daughter of the headmaster of Our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll's employer. And there is Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with apparently few "real" parts and a taste for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes, and who is making many people rich with a complete set of transplant organs, including the testicles. Yes, humor is vulgar and silly, and overall the whole thing is pretty bland, but if you're not on a quick splash in the gutter, you'll probably like it a lot. Now also available on DVD, for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10.
