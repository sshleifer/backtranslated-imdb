Difficult to believe that this was directed by Fritz Lang since he directed mostly dramas and mysteries of crime. This film has a cast that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old band and ends up saving Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs to the west. Jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it's done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is in charge of the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot with a gun but can ride. Scott meets his old band who wants to stop them but Scott can't tell anyone. It's a good western and Lang should be directing more westerns.
