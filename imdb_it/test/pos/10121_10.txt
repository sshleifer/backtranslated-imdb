This is a very moving film about life itself. The challenges that a disabled person must face in a land that expects perfection to be brought to the fore so that everyone can see and hopefully understand. It should teach the bigots of society that we are all human, and while some of us are endowed with mind, heart and healthy body, there are decent human beings that exist in the world who are not so fortunate, or perhaps we, the unfortunate ones. We do not always see beauty in the world because we are surrounded by our "blind" ambitions and we see it only in a light "what can this world do for me !!!". Perhaps we would all like to be like Radio, a loving happy individual ... who loves everyone.
