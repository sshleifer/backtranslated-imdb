This interesting lost film (written by Terence Malick) plays Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two wacky southern brothers looking to open a fish restaurant. Margot Kidder was never prettier and Forrest should have been named. Originally titled The Dion Brothers, this light film with a violent ending is pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I've been looking for it for 30 years. Keach was still great then and I'm surprised he doesn't have a cult following anymore (maybe he does). These guys are a mess with more brain ambitions, but totally lovable guys! A 7 out of 10. If you can dig somewhere, you'll have fun.
