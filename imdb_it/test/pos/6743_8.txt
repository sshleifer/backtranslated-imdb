In April 1947, the city of New York faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, a carpet importer from Mexico, had arrived in the city bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus. He stumbled on a bus, complaining of fever and headache, and soon died in a hospital in Midtown, but not before he had infected a dozen passers-by. The damage had already been done; for the first time in decades, smallpox wandered the streets of New York. The city's health authorities have acted quickly to isolate the sick and contain the virus, promoting a free vaccination campaign that has seen over six million New Yorkers immunized against smallpox. Thanks to their rapid response, the virus was contained with minimal losses. The epidemic, however, must have left an indelible mark, for several years later it was followed by two similar noir thriller films in which doctors must track down a single contagious carrier in a city of millions: the "Panic in the Ereks "by Elia Kazan (1950)" and the lower budget by Earl McEvoy "The Killer That Stalked New York (1950). "McEvoy's film takes place in a glorious docu-dramatic style. Reed Hadley's narrative sounds like it was torn from a newsreel directly, reciting the facts as if he were reading the official police transcript. This technique sometimes seems a bit cheap, but fortunately the narration is largely limited to the film's bookends, as well as providing some explanatory elements during the breaks in the plot.The "killer" who persecutes New York, in this story, is not an importer of carpets from Mexico, but the beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), just arrived from Cuba. Within a few days, Sheila has two parts that persecute her independently: a treasury agent (Barry Kelley) who seeks to arrest her for smuggling offenses and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who identified her as the source of the smallpox epidemic, as in "Panic in the Streets", a hunt for the the routine man is given a greater sense of urgency, particularly when those who are initially pursued have no idea of ​​the identity or appearance of their suspect. <br /> <br /> Killer That Stalked New York, "for the most part, manages to evade its low production budget. Regardless of a few lines of dialogue (" we have to stop it! "Dr. Wood exclaims to at one point, as if making a difficult decision), the directors and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic and compelling way, in fact, in this regard, the low budget most likely helps the film's intentions, necessitating a documentary style that increases the immediacy of the epidemic scenario Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the lead role, showing stubborn resilience in the face of unimaginable torments, at the end of the film, she appears so brutally rendered incapable by her illness that it is almost painful to look at her in the face. Apart from the virus, Charles Korvin is the main villain of the piece, like the greedy and adulterous husband of Sheila who, quietly, gets everything that comes from him. And if all the nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, maybe taking smallpox wouldn't be a bad breakup after all.
