"Lackawanna Blues" is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 1950s and early 1960s. A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks who existed outside the dominant culture Santiago-Hudson depicted black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values ​​of love, loyalty and honor. Even if the characters moved away from those values, sometimes they did not deny the importance of values, but recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters, without judgment, who went through the life of "nanny". The central characters were strong and credible, the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a past era. Pre-integration urban life was a period of sensory intoxication, sight, sound and smell, which could almost be experienced by watching the drama "Lackawanna Blues" take place. I will watch it again and again.
