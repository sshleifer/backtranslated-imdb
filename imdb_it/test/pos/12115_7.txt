When I saw this movie at age 6, it was in the CHILDREN section of Erols Video because it was an animation. We looked at it and it was a completely different ball game! A very violent story and graphic dead are VERY fun and compelling, but not for children. Avoid for family viewing, my mother almost had a heart attack and tore the video apart!
