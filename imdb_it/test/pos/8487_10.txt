Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles. After a few moments, stop watching a movie and see a biography interpreted by the great man himself. Ray Charles was truly a music genius and the film well represented her. No one has ever, ever, ever written, played or recorded music like this musical giant. When he passed the meat, the world lost one of its greatest American heroes. As for the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a scholarship in classical music at the university and could sound like Ray was an advantage for the director. What could be better? It is not necessary to have a "double" game plan and then try to split the screen from someone else's hands to Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that he also realized how difficult Ray was. He was not always a good man. You haven't even rooted for him. He was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes he was just hard. But I guess this is what made him brilliant so I can't criticize him for that. I'll take Jamie as the best actor!
