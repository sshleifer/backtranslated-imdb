Although it doesn't look very promising for a long time, Renoir's French Cancer ends up being a film without affection. The story is a cliché: a girl from the laundry, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), is discovered by a night club owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals it from his baker boyfriend and leaves his current girlfriend, who both return for their former lovers. Nini must choose whether to return to his humble life with the baker, go on with the show with his employer, oh, or become a princess, like a prince falls in love with her even at some point. I'm glad the film didn't go for the obvious choice, as a minor film would surely have done. The film ends with the opening of the new Danglard night club, the Moulin Rouge, and a couple of splendid numbers of songs and dances. The first of these, "Complainte de la Butte", which also provides the basis for most of the film's soundtrack, is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written and Renoir himself wrote it. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film, Moulin Rouge !, you will recognize the melody, which is approaching the beginning of that film, sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although not very important in that film, everyone I know who belongs to the soundtrack I love. In addition to having one of the most beautiful songs ever written, the Frenchman Cancan also boasts one of the prettiest women who has ever played the screen. It's hard not to fall madly in love with that girl. 8/10.
