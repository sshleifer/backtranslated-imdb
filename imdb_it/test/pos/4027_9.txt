We saw La Spectatrice last night at the Chicago International Film Festival and we were immensely moved by it. This is a compelling story of loneliness and lost connection in which the desire for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three protagonists (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamics between them is very surprising. <br /> <br /> After all the films that depreciate older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful and sensual as well as seductive and powerful. We are conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters the "mix", the elderly woman will become jealous of the younger woman, the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman, etc. Etc. In this film, however, the emotional truth is considerably more complex. Highly recommended.
