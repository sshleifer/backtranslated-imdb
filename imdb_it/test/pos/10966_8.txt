It concludes with the statement that "the movie you just saw was an improvisation" - once you made yourself feel like an idiot to think that improvisation was a good movie, and surprised by Cassavetes' genius ... once again . Certainly, Cassavetes told a guy that he wasn't really an improvisation by himself, on his deathbed, so ... it's the story of a light-skinned black woman, Lelia, who passes for white, and her family: another one who passes - white brother by the name of Ben, and a black-black brother named Hughie. When he falls in love with a white asshole named Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he discovers he is black, and from there he talks about the individual aspirations and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hughie is a jazz singer about to become a failure, Lelia is still hopelessly depressed about Tony, and Ben is distressing and violent in general, in desperate need of something that upsets him from his old patterns of existence. Overall, I suppose it's really a question of stasis with respect to changes in human life. I suspect Cassavetes has organized the plot enough, and it was only the dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very irregular - sometimes someone will say something very memorable, other times it is memorably embarrassing. What is surprising is the extension of the embodiment of the amateur actors of their characters. Cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching when he decided to make Shadows, whispered in the ears of the ten best students, and this was the result ... the boys who play Ben and Hughie are very good. At first I did not like Lelia, but as the film progresses we see more and more that it is one of those actors that improves as tension and drama develop, not necessarily the best with chatter. Shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the independent film movement (made in 1959) and is definitely recommended.
