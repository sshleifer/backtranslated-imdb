Ok, this was not the greatest horror film I've ever seen in my life. Despite being on a lower budget, it's still a pretty decent movie. Monsters are unique and credible. Hell, they're even a little scary in the scenes where they show them to wreak havoc on this poor family. Even if, when you finally see the monsters completely, you really think "WTF!? Those bizarre things are after them ?!" The only part that really disturbed me is when * they sniff * killed the kitten! Not the kitten, noooooo, why? Seriously though, if you are looking for violent violence and cold blood, this is not the film for you. Go hire The Hills Have Eyes or something. If you have small children, I would not recommend looking at them with them; probably give them nightmares about the trolls in their room.
