It is very true that this film defies conventions by not describing the plot for the viewer. While some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves, I embrace "Uzumaki" for his irreverence. There is a PLOT, it's just that it might not be immediately accessible to a lazy user. This is a film that invites numerous interpretations, like all great works of art - however, this film is also very funny, making it a rare cinematic experience. It is both provocative and fun.
