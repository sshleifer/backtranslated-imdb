Uzumaki is a visually stunning film, but it seemed to me that part of the plot could have been sacrificed. There is hardly any development of the character that has left me personally detached from the film, which is ironic because apart from all word games, this film really attracts you with its many spiral effects and the breathtaking transitions of the scene. In the beginning the general cinematography threw me out, but as soon as you get used to the general appearance, you begin to see the beauty in this twisted film. This is a great movie if you are looking for a looker without too much substance or deeper meaning. It's a great horror movie that isn't actually scary or full of suspense but somehow ... disturbing.
