I'm not saying anything new when I say that "Ray" was great. While I continue to praise this film, I have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely is a film made entirely by the actors. "Ray" was created simply by Jamie Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx, "Ray" would be just another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought Foxx was funny, coming from his days with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show", and I also knew he had talent, because he used his show ("The Jamie Foxx Show") for show his musical talents. But I never imagined he could play a role like this. I don't know much about acting and what they're going through to get into the character or other stuff like that, but what I saw from Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself in that role and showed us Ray Charles rather than an actor who plays Ray Charles. The story of "Ray" was great, but it was created by Jamie Foxx.
