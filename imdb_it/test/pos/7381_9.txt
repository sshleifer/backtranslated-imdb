... this film noire set suffers from obscure sounds (at least, as demonstrated by the inadequate equipment of both film festivals in Seattle and Maine) and a darker plot, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes and sweat flan. Nevertheless, he has moments of a stellar scene that he chews, and the film offers a sinister ambiguity from Norman Reedus, the gracious Polly Walker, and a surprise ending (aimed at frequent movie-goers), while offering a beautiful look at the physiography of Maine and Rickman. Due to video output (after a cable broadcast) in March. Not to be missed by any Rickman fan. Ignore the amanita hooey.
