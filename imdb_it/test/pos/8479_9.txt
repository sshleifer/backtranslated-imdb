A lecture on the life of the tormented wizard named Ray Charles. His pulsations on the piano made the music of fire and his nostalgic voice created interesting and fantastic melodies. Any barrier that Ray was facing never kept him down, and found his way into all conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers helps to recreate the era and armed with great costumes, hair and settings will follow the story of Ray believing in his real and direct shots! Frosty music blocks and gives goose bumps to the audience with intelligent audio editing. But the most important part of the film is Jamie Foxx. His acting is really superb, the most brilliant acting ever seen. He lives his role. He is the ray of light.
