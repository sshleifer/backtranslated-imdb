Talk Radio sees a man incidentally stumble into life, indeed into the American dream, from any standard and everyday work he has in a store; a presenter of a local radio show before going straight to the same job only later syndicated nationwide. It is a role that adopts from its own aggressiveness and natural mannerism, a crazy and foaming approach to freedom of speech that attacks almost everyone, even those who often call to agree with him or compliment him. His role as a man who insults all good, bad, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral things is something that people seem to take in a form; that of "is it fun and worthy of being tuned", but in addition on a plan of rejection and antagonism ?? two things born of the same things apparently encouraged in professional working life in the western world. This is against a man who reaches the top of his game through the American dream and who is concerned with freedom of speech, while people turn to a man, but do anything except what he says. <br /> Talk Radio starts with a montage of tall, towering buildings in a commercial area of ​​Dallas, Texas. The skyscrapers are shot from one corner to them and above the observer, in addition to everything else in the vicinity as this voice of a man breaks through the images, chirping statements and information about objects as these monolithic buildings dominate the screen. They are the very physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free west; personal speech and opinions on anything. Stone will finish his film in the same way he started it, even if the film is anything but a circular journey of any kind, as the characters undergo monumental changes both in what they witness and in their everyday life. Rather, the shots of buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed. The ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist; people join them, but it hurts them more than good; before the re-establishment that this proud lifestyle still exists and will continue to exist by turning out the kind of people exposed in the film until someone or something drastically changes things. <br /> <br /> The DJ is Barry Champlain, a man with a radio show on a local Texan station that takes care of everything. Champlain's somewhat carefree attitude toward some rather explosive content is established when he flies from a phone call with a bigoted man who recently visited a Holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose fiancée allegedly overdosed and is to blame for on the prank of a pizzeria. For us, the content appears quite shocking; to these people, everything seems to be a business as usual, which sows in our minds, the neophytes of all this, some serious seeds of doubt and horror. <br /> <br /> What Barry is talking about, nobody ever seems to really establish: everything and nothing. In fact, time is taken in the form of jingles or dialogues that the shows immediately before and after the Champlain show are on specific topics; gardening, for example, and they are hosted by people who talk calmly and methods that, I am sure, do not move from one point to another or from one extreme to another all the time raising the stakes. One wonders what is Barry's jingle, the guy who plays around lunchtime during someone else's show: "Coming later, Barry Champlain's show! With the village idiot and psychotic drug abusers ! " In fact, the introductory piece of his show carries a de facto tone, a cry to the public, as a strong rock track accompanies it. <br /> <br /> Barry's success comes in the national syndication proposal. He was born of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and for them. The promotion of the material and the increase in the stakes should call into question the extent to which they believe they can do it, and if this progress on a track for entertainment reasons is really worthwhile. It is when the show reaches this level of transmission that Barry seems to detach himself for the first time in his life of transmission, when an alleged serial rapist calls and leaves mostly all slightly dazed. It is at this point that the camera stops on Barry, and because of the depth of focus, it includes those same looming and towering buildings that the film started with which they stand outside the window, directly behind Barry. They remain tall and proud. Specifically, of the ideologies on which they were built and this promotion of free speech in expanding Barry's nationwide show as a man climbs the ladder of his profession, he suddenly comes up against the kind of content being offered. Everything comes to a point that is too far away, and that with freedom, it should at least come with a sense of clarity rather than just enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone talked Talk Radio right in the middle of both a fascinating and explosive period of film production he had in the late 1980s. During this time, he produced a series of films very well received in a short space of time; starting with one of my favorite Platoon war movies before continuing with the brilliant Wall Street and ending with the 1991 JFK. It could also be said that this race continued into the mid-1990s with Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio is like its main character in the sense that it is loud, booming, loud and confrontational. It is not anti-capitalism, as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what is going too far for reasons of popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is definitely a film that remains in the memory.
