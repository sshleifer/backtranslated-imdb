Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but has had my attention in BREAK UP. It is true that the story lacks critical details in several places, but I continued to scrutinize Fonda for clues about what was significant in the story and she did not disappoint me. The look in his eyes in the last scene, while she must courage, literally, to put one foot in front of the other towards her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of acting of the face of all time. I completely believed it, perhaps because I have known and admired several "hard men" who have survived similar situations of violence. And they did it without becoming man-haters, but this is my hopeful projection of the character of Fonda at BREAK UP.
