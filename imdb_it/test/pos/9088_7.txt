Countless TV shows and memorable appearances of 4 mega-stars today (in addition to the screen debut of Hope Davis) still maintain Flatliners in prudence. The plot is about a non-academic research by five medical students who pursue their own crazy idea to discover the secret of death, and learn what is there after death, then come back to life again. Yet the plot was not conceived as fascinating as the idea of ​​the plot. <br /> <br /> There are popular stereotypes to develop a regular script for teenagers in Flatliner. There is Nelson who creates the idea of ​​decoding the death, beautiful but introverted Rachel, David cutting the Gordian knot fortunately for not being fired from school, the man of the ladies Joe and finally the smart boy Randy ("I am not came into medical school to kill my classmates, no matter how unbalanced they might be "). They join their hands completely in an experiment in which Nelson's heart will be stopped and rearmed. Then they decide to continue this experiment with maximum confidentiality at night on campus. Not long after Nelson's experience, everyone starts a race to have the fiercest and longest death experience, risking their lives one by one. Still, they soon realize that their daily life is influenced by those experiences they have had. The afterlife visits report their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories. Depolarizing their deep subconscious attention, they begin to have somatic disappointments and visual hallucinations. <br /> <br /> When the point comes when the explanation of the subconscious, director Joel Schumacher jumps that every human being has a subconscious personality of which I am not aware. This inner personality prevents us from changing our identity. If you lose or depolarize this subconscious personality, you will certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories. I wanted to add this as a movie mistake, which has already been mentioned by film critics in the early 1990s. Obviously here in this film Schumacher made the actors less affected. So why are they hesitating to continue the experiment after learning their lesson, as if death were unquestionably designed by God? David had been introduced as an atheist, now he is discovered to believe in God when he recalled a flashback of his childhood. Having witnessed this 180-degree change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was so conservative and lively; this is ultimately why it is never classified as a science fiction work. Alas! He had good potential. He even tried to tell unconscious maturity to have a death experience, beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and it's just a part of a man's life. <br /> <br /> More than what is in the film, it was also memorable to remember what's in the film. Jan de Bont as director of photography, who worked almost every time with Schumacher, creates a dreamlike atmosphere as if it were a gothic horror film. The blue color schemes on all the walls that are reflected in the faces of the actors offer a first-class light, which is perfectly suited to the film. Close-ups of the gargoyle statues in campus buildings, Catholic frescoes in the walls, stop-motion cameras and dynamic camera speeds were all Bont's responsibility. <br /> <br /> Flatliner has become a cult film in time with its sociological portraitist of the young X-generation, in particular through his futuristic montage style with storyboard connection sequences like being part of a video clip in an aesthetic way. Those were the times when fast, multi-sequence music clips were on the rise. This style was very rare to encounter in those years after the pioneer of Tony Scott "The Hunger (1983)".
