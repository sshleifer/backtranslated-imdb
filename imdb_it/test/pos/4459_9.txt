Being a passionate fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated attack. I had seen The Beyond which I think is totally overrated, I found The New York Ripper simply scary and I didn't particularly like The House By the Cemetery. These three films have left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian directors. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check more of his films. City of the Living Dead was a film that I found very interesting but Do not Torture a Duckling is almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Set in a small town in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community in which young boys are killed. The authorities have not understood who is behind these crimes, especially after their main suspect has been canceled . An enthusiastic young reporter together with a rather slutty girl (who seduces young boys) investigate and eventually reach the bottom. <br /> <br /> Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case with Italian thrillers of the 70s) make Do not Torture Duckling a good crackling thriller. The plot is well built, not easily understood and the final conclusion is very satisfying. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very ruthless and ignorant community and creates very strong visions, particularly in a scene in which a woman is beaten to death by some local citizens. Fulci's social commentary on religion and innocence is quite sharp and every aspect is well managed. When he thinks of his zombie movies and his violent yellow New York Ripper, it's amazing how he manages to balance his criticism with explicit violence and make it an even stronger point. So far I have not seen any Fulci film professionally made like this. <br /> <br /> Although not a traditional yellow film, Duckling has many such trademarks. Fulci shows complete control over the format, only once exaggerating with an unconvincing moment of gore, but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries of epics in full rule. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really give a punch. <br /> <br /> So far Do not Torture in Duckling is by far the best Fulci film in my opinion. A sharp social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery.
