The last film by the underrated director Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist", "The Killer is on the Phone") is a thrilling thriller but incomprehensibly neglected, containing practically all the brands that make this Italian horror subtitle so magnificent and compelling to fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, fake priests ??), a lot of gruesome moments, twists to the right and to the left, exceptional music and ?? last but not least ?? a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Above all, the opening sequence, which is a sort of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What is it about ordinary girl dolls that make them so disturbing? When the anonymous man, dressed as a priest, attacked a little girl and his doll's broken head bounced off a flight of stairs, he really sent chills through my spine! Years later, the prologue girl is an adult woman tied to a wheelchair. He inherited a lot of money, but he uses his fortune to stimulate other disabled people to play sports and maintain a positive mindset. She ?? Joanna ?? falls in love with his personal coach and get married immediately. Of course, it is only after his money and starts to terrorize Joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that paralyzed her. Repeated images of a sinister-looking priest, guided by disturbing melodies and a nursery rhyme, provide "Formula for a Murder" with a ton of genuine scares and Alberto De Martino's direction is very resolute. The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") in a glorious greedy villain role. Due to some holes in the plot and a lack of originality, this film may not be able to compete with the best Italian horror efforts, but it certainly deserves more attention. Many unknown and unknown Italian crime fighters have received wonderful DVD versions and hopefully, "Formula for a Murder" will receive the same treatment very soon. Meanwhile, good luck tracking this baby!
