This film is where the Batman franchise should have stopped. Although I would admit that the ideas behind "Batman Forever" were excellent and could have been easily realized by a competent director, it turned out that it wasn't. <br /> <br /> Apparently the leaders of Warner Brothers were disappointed with how dark this second Bat Burman movie was. Apart from the idiocy of expecting more from Burton, and the conservative cowardly of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into a tribute to the TV series of the sixties, I can't understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered completely disappointing. /> <br /> It's true, it's not exactly the same as the first movie - even if it repairs all the minor deficiencies of the style found in "Batman", a weaker script that divides the antagonism between not only two, but three characters invites unflattering comparisons with the masterful coupling of Keaton and Jack Nicholson in the role of the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a wonderfully dark film, true to the way Batman has always been thought to be, and very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, interwoven with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, in honor of the silent German actor of the 1920s), his companion -in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of "Richard III" by Laurence Olivier) and Selina Kyle, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), who Wayne interprets both as himself and as Batman. The four protagonists offer excellent performances, in particular Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the dark side of double identities. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting concepts in this film. About the only weakness that I can really emphasize is a certain clarity of the script in some points, which I think is mainly due to the way this film is a four-pronged fight. There is simply not enough time to properly explore what is happening. <br /> <br /> However, this is a damn good movie. I highly recommend looking at this in conjunction with the first, and then crying about how good the series would have been if it had continued with Burton and Keaton.
