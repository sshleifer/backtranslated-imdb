Love In Limbo is my favoirite film of all time. (set in W.A) He is casual and has an excellent cast including a group of three wonderful actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), on the day he looked really HOT with short hair and no hair on his face. Aden Young (Barry McJannet) and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a high school student obsessed with sex and is expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. He starts a new job at his uncles garment factory and approaches another new guy, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so they can go out and pick up chicks. They become friends of the geek Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and the three boys drive up to Kalgoorlie against a brothel and lose their virginity ...... <br /> <br /> Look at it, it's a classic !! For so long I tried to get a DVD or a soundtrack, whoever let me know if you have it.
