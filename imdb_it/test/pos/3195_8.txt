I remembered seeing this program as a boy in Australia in the 1960s and having again enjoyed myself on DVD as the father of 50 years as kids. Although the villains are mostly superficial characters and there is a component of violence, I am very happy to see my children of 6-8 years because the central characters are profound, kind and honorable, Japanese culture shines through, violence it's not bloody, nobody believes it and the program is nice to watch. It does not promote nightmares, but instead shows much of the culture that must have mainly influenced the design of the Jedi knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired. Video perfectionists won't appreciate this. Strongly remember something that is held on a 16 mm film and projected on the wall in some basements ... which could be. The soundtrack also lacks the quality you'd expect from home theater. However, my children only noticed that it was not in color, and I suspect they only noticed it because we recently talked about how old things are often like this. The beauty of Mount Fuji is also evident in B&W. Something in the setting of the 17th century is part of the quality of the atmosphere, as if looking into the past through some time window. <br /> <br /> In general this program is better than most things on the air, and a far better advertisement for Japanese TV than Pokemon, but you could consider it of marginal value if you hadn't had the experience of seeing it in the 60s. My score of 8/10 takes into account his age.
