One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that he has the courage to take talent that most people push to the side or push to the side and make them protagonists. Case in point, a washed ... Burt Reynolds offers a great performance in this film. And if proving that Adam Sander can be a great actor (Punch Drunk Love) wasn't enough ... here is Mark Whalburg ... like you've never seen him before. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people go up "Boogie Nights" because they are anti-porn or hate the adult industry and can't overlook this aspect of this movie. But below is a great story of characters who lose everything and fight to win themselves back. There is a good film ... and it is a pity that so many people see it.
