This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a D & D group. As I watched, I couldn't help but notice how vividly the characters reminded me and my game friends to the point where they literally played like us. Including fights, fights, internal beats that drive the DM crazy. ALL. <br /> <br /> It has everything. Jokes that made me cry, action scenes that, even if filmed on a small budget, I found extraordinarily impressive. The story is rather simple and not surprising, but it doesn't matter, since the best part of the film is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the NPCs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you're playing D & D or other similar role-playing games, I can't stress it enough, WATCH THIS FILM, it has magnificently captured the spirit of D & D.
