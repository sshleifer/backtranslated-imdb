Wow! I got it from the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in "Trainspotting". This is a phenomenal film; has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and spirit. When I wasn't laughing, I was on the edge of my seat. This is certainly a film that I would recommend to people who appreciate intelligent dialogue and a new perspective of the eighteenth century. This movie has everything to make me happy!
