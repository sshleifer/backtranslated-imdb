These films do not enjoy the merit they deserve. This is my second favorite movie of all time, (Stand By Me is 1st.) The reason I watched this movie is because Wil Wheaton was in and he is my favorite person in the world and I think that he did an incredible job in this film and so did Sean Astin. I just saw it last night and it just surprised me. Everything in the film is truly exceptional. The script, the acting, the script. I was on the verge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mother wasn't in the room I would have stumbled every time Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I didn't see it coming !! Not at all !! I was really surprised when I learned that it wasn't very popular in the 90s. I was born a few years after it came out like that, of course, I didn't go to see it in theaters, but I'm sure I would have done it if I were alive. If any of my friends had watched this, it would have been like, "okay?" but this is only because they are not interesting enough to appreciate a job like this. If you haven't seen this movie, or you want to see something that's the bomb, this is the movie you need to watch.
