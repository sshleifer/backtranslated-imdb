In the late 1940s there was a series of short films entitled "Flicker Flashbacks" in which extracts from silent dramas with characters like Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet were interpreted as laughter. Biting paper clips from old antiquated films have been redistributed, projected too quickly, and have overlaid jangly music and limping jokes. The attitude expressed through this brutal treatment largely summarized the Hollywood vision of the beginning of the middle of the century: silent cinema was considered "hokey", thriving, a little embarrassing, and only good for a laugh. In the 1950s this attitude began to change gradually for a variety of reasons. James Agee's famous 1949 essay on dumb clowns for Life Magazine was a factor, but television played an important role in reactivating viewers with silent films. To be sure, television networks sometimes ran the material roughly like the "Flicker Flashbacks", but higher series like "Silents, Please" treated the films with respect. Another milestone was the Robert Youngson compilation THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY, which turned out to be a surprise when it was released in cinemas in late 1957. <br /> <br /> I don't know if Charles Chaplin was aware of Youngson's film or his box office success, but it was during this time that he decided to launch a theatrical re-release of three of his best short comedies, A DOG'S LIFE, SHOULDER ARMS (both made in 1918) and THE PILGRIM (made in 1922 and released the following year). These three films worked well as a trio because they are in contrast with the plot, the theme and the setting. Furthermore, all three have familiar faces from the Chaplin joint stock company, some of which play more roles in each short film. At the time of re-release the films had not been screened in public for over thirty years, so perhaps Chaplin was worried about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of viewers, especially since his best work was rarely shown on television in early days of the new medium. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Chaplin apparently concluded that the films were moving too fast at the old silent projection speed, so the decision was made to "print" them, which meant that every other frame was been printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid the 'Flicker Flashbacks' look, but this was not the best way to do it. On an aesthetic level, the results were terrible and practically destroyed the flow of action of the film, but nevertheless it was so that THE CHAPLIN REVUE was released in theaters in 1959, and this is the version that was transferred to the video and made commercially available by Playhouse Video in the 80s. I purchased a VHS copy of the film at the time and was terribly disappointed by the jerky and stop-and-start rhythm of the films. It is a particular pleasure to discover that David Shepard's restoration of the Chaplin compilation (originally produced for the laser-disc format) is a huge improvement over the Playhouse Video version. For the most part, the projection speed has been corrected. The "stretch" has disappeared in any case, even if the action seems to drag on a little at times. For example: in A DOG'S LIFE during the clumsy dance of Edna and Charlie in the Green Lantern Cafe, Edna's bare arms appear visibly blurred; at another point, during the trench scene in the SHOULDER ARMS when Charlie is relieved of his duty as a sentinel, the action appears strangely slowed for a few moments, but this could be the result of a maneuver by film restorers to cover up of decomposition. Above all, the image quality is fantastic considering the age of the films themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: REVUE starts with rare behind-the-scenes footage shot in the Chaplin studio. This includes the shooting of a joke practice session, obviously staged, in which Chaplin handles the diminutive actor Loyal Underwood, as well as the scenes of Charlie in his dressing table that makes up and cuts the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin's narrative, delivered in a quick clip. Chaplin also composed a new musical score for the compilation and, in my opinion, his themes for the REVUE ranking with his best compositions, in particular the pieces used during the caf√© sequence in A DOG'S LIFE. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, a pseudo-Singin 'Cowboy number called "Bound for Texas" sung in the 50s style by Matt Monro (playing rather like Gene Autry), which is absent-mindedly anachronistic and misplaced. Otherwise, during the rest of the REVUE, the music adapts perfectly to the action and the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It seems that the Image version of THE CHAPLIN REVUE is, in a sense, its long debut referral, presenting these classic comedies the way they should have been seen all the time. In this form, the REVUE aligns itself with Chaplin's most durable and entertaining works.
