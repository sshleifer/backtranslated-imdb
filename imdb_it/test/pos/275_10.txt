I like that many others have seen it as a child and I loved it and it shocked me into adulthood, I tried to find this film and I even tried to do it again on TV one day, since it was originally it was broadcast on US networks. Does anyone know where to buy this film, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy of it? Does anyone know if there is a possibility to play it again on TV? Perhaps all of us fans should write a station in the hope that they will be broadcast again. I don't think they did a good job promoting this film in the past because nobody really knows, people only know Stepford's wives and Stepford movies. No one is familiar with the fact that there was a version for children. Maybe they should also do it again because they seem to do it a lot lately with many of my favorite old thrillers / horror movies. Well, if anyone has any input, please allow me to write me with information. Thanks Taira tcampo23@aol.com
