"The China Syndrome" by James Bridges is a first-rate thriller; a model for those who want to create a truly terrifying thriller but don't know how. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end with the standard shooter and the hunt that ends with the villain getting what he / she deserves. But Bridges understands that such a standard ending is not the case in some scenarios. "The China Syndrome" is electrifying in a way that no one would expect. It has the kind of ending that is so unexpected, but at the same time so logical. <br /> <br /> The film stars three (then) Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor 1973 for "Save the Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actress 1971 and 1978 respectively for "Klute" and " Coming Home ") and Michael Douglas (Best film of 1975 for the production of" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ". This is not the typical" spot the star "movie that became so popular in the 70s. The acting is so solid and strong that we forget those who play the roles and believe that the characters are real people. This is a testament to the collective abilities of all three actors. They can be the stars, but they are actors First of all. <br /> <br / > There is no music in the film. Besides some background songs of jukeboxes or TV programs, there is nothing. It is simply presenting the material in a direct way: with such a strong dramatic story, we don't need a score to distract us It seems to me a predecessor of the started Dogma 95 movies by Lars Von Trier in 1997. It focuses on characters and history rather than style. <br /> <br /> The story is about a Southern California nuclear power plant. ** SPOILER ** An accident seems to have happened and at the bottom of the film is about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas trying to expose the truth . In a sense, this is not a spoiler, since the trailer, TV commercials, videotapes and reviews reveal it. But from this seemingly simple premise comes a surprisingly complex morality game and the suspense comes from human nature and people's actions rather than from a villain framing another boy (although this is an element in the film). This is what makes "The China Syndrome" so good. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
