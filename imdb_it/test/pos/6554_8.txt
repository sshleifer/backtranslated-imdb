Uzumaki (which is Japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd films I've ever seen. A city becomes obsessed and then consumed by the vortex pattern in very grotesque ways. Fingertips are cut, people commit suicide in washing machines ... just wild and crazy Japanese horror. Probably psychologically harmful as "The Ring". Generally it's not as scary as "The Eye", but the image in this is more sickening than most things in "The Eye". And not as bloody as "The Untold Story" ... but this does not mean that there is not a good amount of blood and dismemberment. Seriously, if you like horror movies and especially Asian horror, you have to add this movie to your list. Some parts are a bit weird with sound effects (the plot is adapted from a manga and show comic), but it's really suitable. Unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source ("The House of the Dead"), this does it perfectly. The most original film you'll see ... not just this year, but probably never. Recommended!
