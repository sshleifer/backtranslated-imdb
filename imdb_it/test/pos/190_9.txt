Sergei Urusevsky's fabulous cinematography helps make this work extraordinary. The opening scenes are like browsing through the album of a master photographer and, as the story begins to unfold, we are swept away by both the events represented and the beautiful look. Everything is well filmed, but there are several sequences that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without "ruining" but it is enough to say that a scene is very intense during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother disagree while the sirens whine and windows shatter. Another overlaps a swirling staircase and a rotating stroke of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence. High-level Soviet film production.
