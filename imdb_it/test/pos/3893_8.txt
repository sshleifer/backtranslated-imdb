Not a stunner, but a good movie to watch once or twice. Bill Macy shows that he can do much more than act; his writing was really good. Big supporting cast, in particular Jamie Cromwell as the private extortionist eye. <br /> <br /> The biggest strength of the film is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his role as Jerry Lundergaard from Fargo. He has numerous scenes in which he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulative and deceptive character. It's fun to watch him do the weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were going well for him. *** out of four.
