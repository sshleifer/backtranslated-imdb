The Late Shift is a great book, I read the book several years ago, and I was paralyzed by the dissolute debauchery that went on when Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to take his place. When the movie came out, I captured a VHS copy of the movie, and after re-reading the book recently, it's hard to say that I like it better, because it's pretty much the same amount of information transmitted. The two main actors, John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I've never heard of before, and I've never heard of, convincingly interpret Leno and Letterman, despite Letterman's dismissal of his portrayal as poor . The parts play well enough, although many people are looking for an imitation of the two. I wasn't so interested in this. History is what matters. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, is this film. She plays this evil bitch of a character so threatening that you realize how this woman can control herself, much less a national TV show. Yikes! There should be a sequel !!
