For his latest film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, in this adaptation of James Joyce's "Dubliners" story, and gave us one of his best hits to remember him. <br /> <br /> Joyce is almost impossible to film like anyone, but "The Dead" has at least one traditional narrative to work with. Many (indeed, almost all) the important information of the story are found in the spaces between the lines, in the thoughts and expressions of the characters - there are great moments, but they are cerebral - they are not stuff of which films are made. But somehow, Huston is right, and handles an almost flawless adaptation. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is magnificent, and the film is disturbing and powerful. <br /> <br /> Vote: A
