I went to a preliminary screening of this film thinking that I was about to embark on 120 minutes of brazen lines, senseless plot and that kind of nauseating acting that made "The Postman" one of the most malignant performances of cinema errors of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that attracted the soul of the public. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could play such a serious role. Disconcerted that a film played by both is actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since Robin Hood saw this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have optimized the serious acting with which he played in "Butterfly Effect". These two actors entered this film with a serious and focused attitude that shone in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, it's not a movie worthy of the Oscars. It is not a film of epic or profound social commentary. Rather, it is a story on a simple subject, illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than previously thought possible. This is what I think is a good film production and I am deeply impressed by this work. Good boy!
