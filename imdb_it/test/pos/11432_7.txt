Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who worked for years in a steel plant, as a maintainer, who the Italian owners are selling to the Chinese, arrives at the end of the meeting where the purchase is organized because he wants to tell the new buyer of a defect he discovered and thought he had the solution. It is not exactly identified with the old Italian management or with the new Chinese owners. He also fights with the translator on the exact term he wants to use in expressing his concern. <br /> <br /> The next thing we see is that Vincenzo arrives in China trying to contact the new owners. To his surprise, there is someone new in office, as Mr. Chong, the man who tried to warn in Italy, was fired. His next research is to get to the woman who was the translator, Liu Hua. He finds her working in a library, but she tells him, in no uncertain terms, that she blames him for being fired from his position. Liu, who sees Vincenzo's desperation, agrees to accompany him to find his steelworks. <br /> <br /> So Vincenzo and Liu begin a journey through some of the desolate countryside that involves traveling by train, steamboat, bus and truck, to remote parts of the giant country. Finding the correct factory proves elusive, at best, but Vincenzo discovers a life that is completely foreign to him, in addition to finding a kind soul who does not hesitate to help the Italian, despite his initial disgust for him. <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's film is a sort of travel diary. Take the viewer into unknown territory. Some comments compare Vincenzo to Marco Polo, the great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not entirely tangible. The film attracts our attention in the early stages of the journey, but starts to get a little less pleasant when Vincenzo runs aground after parting with Liu. Amelio is an interesting director, as clearly shown by this film for which he worked on the adaptation of Ermano Rea's novel, which we have not read. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch the film. This versatile actor brings a lot to the film, which, in a sense, is a tour de force for him, since he is seen in almost every frame of the image. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto turns out to be a winning combination. Ling Tai, who is making her debut as Liu Hua, has some good times and shows good chemistry with her co-star. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi has photographed the Chinese landscape in all its desolation. We see a China that is not a postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all the greyness, typical of the areas where the film is set. The soundtrack by Franco Piersanti serves the film well.
