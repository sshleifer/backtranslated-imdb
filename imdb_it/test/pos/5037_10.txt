John Travolta was excellent as "Michael" in the film of the same name. I don't think it would have been possible to make a better portrait. The film was fun, but moving. Michael is a "human angel" (if so). Andie MacDowell is exceptional in her role as a reporter, since she moves from disbelief to belief. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are as good reporters as colleagues, each of whom has pledged to prove the angel's prank on earth. Each of the supporting casts is wonderful, especially the older woman (I don't know her nickname), who plays Michael's mother! One of the nicest movies I've seen in years ... I could see this movie dozens of times!
