I still count "Police Team!" like the funniest TV show of the 80s. Somewhere, on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that such a beautiful show would not last and that I had to keep it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They said viewers didn't know that "Police squad!" it was a comedy because it had no trace of laughter! Right! When Drebin has a joke like "Take some chances by getting up in the morning, driving to work, or sticking your face to a fan.", How can it be comedy!?!? I've seen every episode at least ten times and I still see something new that I missed before. Even the deep backgrounds always have gags going on. Don't miss it if you have the chance to see an episode, but if you are reading this, you probably already have copies scattered in a place like me.
