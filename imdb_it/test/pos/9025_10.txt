Okay, so it begins unimaginably with a narration of the main character (Justine played by Laura Fraser - an extraordinary actress in her true nature) but continues to become something miraculous. He has little nonsense that you shouldn't find funny but you do every time. There is a particularly memorable moment when your jaw drops to the ground the first time you look at it when Jake's male body, containing Justine's female mind, is trying to get used to his new anatomy. I don't want to ruin it for you, but the second time I saw it was with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. It makes you shiver, but laughs at the same time. I'm also a big fan of used music. There is a beautiful little band that appears randomly in the street or on a path from time to time, but also some beautiful, but unknown (often the best), pop songs. It has the feeling of being written for an English cast by an American writer, which only annoys me a couple of times. Overall, this film is hilarious. I'm a big fan of Laura Fraser now, after receiving her movie for my birthday, and I expect that, even if some of the cast are little known, you'll like it a little too.
