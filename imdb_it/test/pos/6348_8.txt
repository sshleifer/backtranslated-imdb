Let me first say that I am a big fan of the original Lonesome Dove series and the book from which it is based. I postponed this sequel for the best part of 10 years due to the negative reviews I had heard. If Tommy Lee Jones wasn't playing Capt. Call, I didn't see the point. If Larry McMurtry wasn't involved, why should I worry? How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> This is in many ways a worthy sequel to Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo. History, acting, production, cinematography are all top notch. Obviously the script is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove, but it has its moments. And, to my surprise, there are pieces of Lonesome Done in this series; the relationship between July and Clara, completely rejected in the prequel, is reported here almost identical to the book, a very welcome surprise. The story is not all roses, it also has surprises. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Capt. Call. While not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, his is both faithful and unique to Voight's merit. The cast is fantastic across the board, and I don't think Rick Schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the show here, he is superb in a role that makes you worry about his character as you hate him. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you haven't had bad criticism, especially the fact that the DVD is so cheap (I got the 2-disc set for $ 10.99, you'll probably find it cheaper) . Not at all the disappointment of Dead Man's Walk (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry was involved in that!
