I'll be honest, I only rented this movie because it was part of the "Child's Play" series. I was expecting a boring 4th part of the series, but I was surprised. This film was surprisingly good, and I found it very funny. There was a lot of dark humor, and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a good way to make things more interesting. The two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type to the film. All in all it was very good for a fourth film in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (see the type of Marilyn Manson being killed at the beginning, not to mention the fact that John Ratch has a face full of nails). He applauds the writers for highlighting things, and the ending, even if I found it a bit strange, leaves room for MORE followed ... maybe "son of chucky" !!!
