NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. These are three wage earners who make their way over their heads when their innocent, drunken pennies whisk away three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who have much more deviant deviations than even the film allows us to know, they beat the living lights of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return the favor in kind - only they casually kill one of the other boys! The remaining two enemies then begin the systematic destruction of all that these poor slaves hold dear, including their rapidly diminishing sanity. The cover of the Phaedra Video DVD presents a critical quote defining the film "A crime as a paranoid criminal!" or some of these, and the more term that applies here. Thoughtful, tense, very violent and low-key (but still quite lucid), filmed mostly at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the public guessed together with the besieged protagonists (who, to some extent, deserve everything what to get!). I give him a 10.
