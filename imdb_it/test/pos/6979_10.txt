For science fiction fans, this film is just what you've been waiting for. Watching this movie makes you lose the characters, especially Riddick, the bad movie. This is where you cheer for the bad guy and want to see him live and win. As you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive, you want to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet. An excellent film, Vin Diesel did a great job as condemned as Riddick and the acting and the suspense were incredible. A +
