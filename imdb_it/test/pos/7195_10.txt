It's the first time I can remember where an adaptation did exactly like the book ... In reality, only the jokes have been added to the story rather than the mixed or removed content! <br /> <br /> Like the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had difficulty transmitting, um, communicating, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus was interpreted as a quasi-Sith Lord and was annoyed when the Roman Empire suffered a blow, the general order for the Empire of ..? Ah, look at the movie people! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this photo was one of the most expensive in the history of French cinema and for my part it was worth it, Depardieux was excellent as the bashing and the Roman boar chewing Obelix. Clavier who plays the indomitable little Gallia was perfect and far from his days as a sculptural sculptor by Jean Reno in "Just Visiting". <br /> <br /> The fighting scene between Artifis and Edifis was exhilarating and it was good to see the Matrix theme was not borrowed to defeat an otherwise perfect battle! <br /> <br /> Barbarossa and his crew have almost stolen the image, from sinking their ship to become the engine of Otis (Assistant of Edifis) invention at the end. <br /> <br /> I understand that there is Asterix and the Olympics with many of the same team, from Toutatis, I'm going to see it too!
