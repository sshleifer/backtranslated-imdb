I just checked Northanger Abbey from the local library and didn't expect much. Imagine my surprise at this gothic party! Northanger Abbey is one of the most disturbing places you've ever seen, with empty passageways and rooms adorned with hidden secrets. The glory of the film is that it never reveals everything: your imagination runs free, running with the imagination of the main character, a Kathrine M. She is a girl of wild imagination, a reader of Gothic fantasy that she carries in her (and our) real world. <br /> <br /> If I had to use a word to describe this excellent film, it would be surreal. Dreams are woven into the film, improving mood. Sometimes it is difficult to say what is real and what is not; this is intentional, I think. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere reigns supreme. Music is not what you would expect from a Jane Austen film: it is disturbing, flute and drum based, loud and disturbing with a background of fear. If a soft and pleasant melody sounded in the Abbey of Northanger, it would be positively inviting. Now it is an omen, a grim and terrible crazy palace. (But! The characters! You'll have to see them for yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a more enjoyable evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey.
