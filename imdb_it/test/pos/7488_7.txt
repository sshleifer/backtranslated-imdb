A film violently cynical, sarcastic and intense, mocking and imitating the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster films, Thursday is a fun, discouraging and hilarious thrill. An incredibly eclectic mix of exaggerated characters and strangely amusing situations, this day-in-the-life of an armed man who tries to go straight is a worthy addition to the series of films that try to imitate the genius of Tarantino, the obscure masterpiece of Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops by Casey's house (Thomas Jane) to make up for the old days. Casey was a former drug dealer killer who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall), and is now thinking of adopting a child. Does Nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leave a briefcase full of drugs at Casey's house while he borrows his car to do some errands? a.k.a unfinished business. Disgusted and irritated by the introduction of drugs into his home, Casey unloads them all in the kitchen sink. At that moment, one by one, Nick's two accomplices, Rastafarian drug robbers and cops all come knocking for the unsuspecting Casey, who is about to have an incredible Thursday. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a hilarious sequence at a service station where Nick is looking for the best bargain for a cup of coffee. After thinking about which cup to get, a fiasco breaks with the cashier when she asks for a free snack and uses a $ 50 bill to pay. Resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a policeman intervenes and is captured in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters who seem aware of their existence in this nonsense gangster movie. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into segments based on various events and times over the course of a day. This effect is very similar to Pulp Fiction, which is a similar chapter, although Thursday does not mess with the chronological order except for the occasional flashback. Even as Tarantino, music beautifully introduces every scene and every character. Strangely humorous creatures, like the Jamaican bellboy who messes with the phone and shares his hashish, and the narcissistic Dallas of Paulina Porizkova, who tries to rape Casey, adds humor to every event regardless of how horrible and unnerving some of the coincidences are are When the calm short circuit by Mickey Rourke, Kasarov is presented, the careful staging and the intricate configuration are completely assembled, and Casey's sticky situation becomes even more daring and commendable. <br /> <br /> Definitely an aspiring Pulp Fiction, with much of violence, witty dialogue and extremely gruesome antagonists, Thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may go far enough to suggest a scam. A flashback sequence that shows Casey pulling up the baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches John Travolta's in Pulp Fiction is easily a step too far ahead. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
