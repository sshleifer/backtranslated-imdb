(Plot) Bartleby "B" Gaines high school diploma (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He was able to talk and get out of every problem he encountered, but was unable to captivate his way of passing the college admissions college at eight colleges. His mother and father are very disappointed that Bartleby was not accepted in college. His parents think that if Bartleby did not go to college, he will have no future. Many of Bartleby's friends find themselves in the same situation of being rejected by all the universities to which they have applied. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby has an idea to start his own school with a website. They transform an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the website states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students who have been rejected even from all colleges. With a million dollars in cash, Bartleby has to turn his fake college into a working one. He takes Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the college Dean. The fun begins when you draw your resume, set your own rules and celebrate all night. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The premise of starting a college without teaching staff is a bit off the wall. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby didn't really need a staff. The film reminded me of the classic film "Animal House", the university environment, fraternity, lots of gags and beautiful young women. These new college freshmen had a different idea of ​​what the college experience was. The film not only has a lot of humor, it also has a good message for life. People should reach their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what others want them to do. The ending was a bit unrealistic, but it's just a movie. The film was created to entertain the young audience. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)
