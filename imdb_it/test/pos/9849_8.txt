Peak Practice was a British drama series about a general surgery in Cardale ?? an imaginary small town in the Derbyshire Peak District ?? and the doctors who worked there. It worked on ITV from 1993 to 2002 and was one of their most successful series at the time. Kevin Whately originally starred as Dr Jack Kerruish, Amanda Burton as Dr Beth Glover and Simon Shepherd in the role of Dr Will Preston, although the list of doctors will change many times over the course of the series. <br /> <br /> the series was cut in 2002 and ended with a literal cliffhanger when two of the main characters in the series crashed from a cliff. Viewers wrote to ITV by the thousands and a petition for a last episode was created by the Peak Practice Online website. However, all the petitions were unsuccessful and ITV stated that they would no longer be making any incident. <br /> <br /> Peak Practice has been replaced by Sweet Medicine, another medical series set in Derbyshire. It lasted a few episodes before it was canceled from the schedules. <br /> <br /> Cardale was based in the Derbyshire village of Crich, and the series was filmed there and in other towns and villages of Derbyshire, particularly Matlock and Ashover. After the end of this program, ITV attempted to launch a follow-up series called Sweet Medicine, which extended the stories of several characters from the original show.
