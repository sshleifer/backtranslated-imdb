I had never paid much attention to this film until I learned that Paddy Chayefsky - author of the brilliant "Network" - was the screenwriter. His work there had instructed me on his genius, so when "Hospital" appeared on TMC, I was anxious to see it. I was not disappointed. Looking at both this film and the "Network" it would seem that its great theme is the absurdity, the inanity and the absolute wickedness of great human enterprises (for example, hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and of the spirit human, and all delivered with a sense of completely black humor knife. "Hospital" is as black as a "Network" comedy, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, makes his work fully justice. This is a custodian; definitely not to be missed.
