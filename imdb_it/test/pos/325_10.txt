This film is absolute gold. If you haven't seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam exceeds himself again. This film also introduced me to Nandita Das, even though they all shine in this film. My only regret is that I never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of southern India, as well as from the terror of war to the final conquest for the sake of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with some hidden surprises waiting for the viewer, this film resists being seen again and again, and the story within the story, The Umbrella, is done so well, as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book. Beautiful. Watch it.
