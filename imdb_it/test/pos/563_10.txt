Great movie. Excellent documentary. <br /> <br /> Very nice to see those hated detainees humiliated and discovered as the bigots, narcissistic and heartless that their parents with one eye, community and environment have raised them as. <br /> <br /> I give Pat McGuinness the tip of the lid. Can we get this decent human being on some commission or investigation of 911? We need his integrity, strength, intelligence, clarity and spirit that fight the rigged game that is world politics and big business. <br /> <br /> All animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, cheaters, queens, fairies, dopants, drug addicts, the sick, venal. One day a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drop of that real rain. The people who control this land are animals. They must be drowned. <br /> <br /> I'm just in shock. Walking for the night is a scary affair. The inhuman howl and chatter is of detective, in Homicide on a Sunday morning. In Pat McGuinness's dazzling spotlights, they seem horribly cultured, terribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowning. <br /> <br /> It is exceptionally satisfying, in a world where gamblers play a rigged game, to see justice done and see every narcissistic criminal drown like the pathetic human mice they are. <br /> <br /> How do you feel threatening, abominable and nervous fingers of law? How does it feel to have your trial indicted, your confession rigged, your investigative work made up for what it really was? How does it feel? <br /> <br /> I hope you turn like a knife you miserable, no eyes.
