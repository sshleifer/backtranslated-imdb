I saw him at the Hong Kong International Film Festival over three years ago. I entered without expectations since Christopher Nolan was not a name at the time, but it seemed interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw in that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr. Nolan gave a good account of his creation in the end, enough to put someone out as a filmmaker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to lower expectations. And the fact that it was more an arthouse film.
