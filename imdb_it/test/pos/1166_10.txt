One of the best "boy" movies I've ever seen must be the wind and the lion. Gad, the scenes ... <br /> <br /> The Raisouli bandits swarm over the wall ... A calm English gentleman quietly gets up from the tea with Candice Bergen and drops three with a Webley revolver in the coat. A whisper from the ghost of the Empire ... not to forget! Not to forget! <br /> <br /> U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long, distant past - Barroklyn. They were carrying Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow. And the Winchester 97 blows large holes in indigenous natives and even more stubborn and unfaithful Europeans ... Raisouli - Sean Connery, or, Wow! - wondering 'What kind of gun does Roosevelt use? "<br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt - Brian Keith, or, Wow! - wondering" What kind of gun does Raisouli use? "and write yet another angry letter to Winchester about football on his Winchester 95. <br /> <br /> Raisouli, armed with a sword ... A Prussian cavalry officer, HOLSTERING his gun and drawing his HIS sword ... Honor. It is something that has long since died, from a world now far away, but Raisouli would never have flown on a plane full of children in a building .... <br /> <br /> Milious in the magnificent Milious film, and now on DVD.
