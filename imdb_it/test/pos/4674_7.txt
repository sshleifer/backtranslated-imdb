I went to see this movie with a friend of mine who doesn't like robbery movies. But she had fun. I lost pieces and fragments of the film to the end. It's a story about Edward Norton and a group that steals some gold, and Norton decides to want it all for himself. So the people he betrayed want to come back to him. It is a well thought-out, intelligent, fun and action-packed film that I need to see again ... all the way. One of my best summer films so far. <br /> <br /> A big help for the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Seth Green, and adds to the flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster and his roommate stole it from him. He is a computer genius who is a wonder to behold. <br /> <br /> It was said that Norton did not want to make this film ... but if I were him, I wanted to sign up. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Every filmmaker should be able to tell in his mind what is going on before that happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint with the film is the choice of hair on the face of Eddie Nortons. The thick but thin mustache and a small pike on his chin ... looks like a 80s porn star for god's sake.
