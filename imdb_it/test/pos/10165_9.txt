The film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, has been brilliantly realized. It starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day) - who is a former theatrical singer, and their young son - my hypothesis is about 10 years old, traveling through Morocco please. On the bus, the collision with an agent of the French government, and I'm a little too nice with him. He is killed at the market after discovering the information he was looking for. He wants to bring this information to someone, so he goes to the only person he knows, even if slightly, James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say that if he says anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London, because that's where his son is, and where the murder the agent told him about would be. The film is very full of suspense. There are many twists and turns (typical Hitchcock movie). Moreover, it has the right amount of comic relief. On top of that, he won an Oscar for playing Doris Day in "Que sara, sara." This film is very good. It is difficult to find a problem in this regard. I would certainly recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and suspense fans. I give this film an "A-" just because it's a little predictable.
