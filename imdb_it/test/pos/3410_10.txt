One of the best! Being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first episode of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives an extraordinary performance, as do James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In looking at this fabulous story unfolding in a time never forgotten, the themes of love, passion, pain, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in eighth grade. Being a boy, you'd think I wouldn't be interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story has stolen everyone's heart from my class, and that's just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was fantastic. Now I'm 17 and I still like the story, the characters, the subjects and I remember the times of the civil war. As a film director of the future, I will always enjoy the North and the South: the first book.
