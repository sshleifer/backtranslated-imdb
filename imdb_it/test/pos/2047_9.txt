Rent this, I own the DVD, I bought it for $ 9.99. A theft is so undervalued. Of course, there are better films. Movies with less or no holes in the plot or action. BUt I don't have this problem with this movie. For me, if a film remains true to itself, honest and exploitative of its flaws (and virtues, of course!) In the name of entertainment, then it has fulfilled its purpose. I took care of myself because his producers cared. The whole film is absurd from beginning to end, but its creators took the whole business seriously, and I didn't feel manipulated to take the film seriously. And this is true, because I want to take all the films seriously, but many, oh many, disappoint me. For all its nonsense, this movie is almost perfect and completely fun! What a funny script! It also became strangely relevant in light of the events of September 11th. In no way do I try to minimize the loss. But this film incorporates the tradition of the collapse of the WTC before it happened in ways we would never have seen if the film had been made after those events. <br /> <br /> "... or has gone forever, or here to stay." "Do not you agree?"
