To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they shot it. <br /> <br /> This was when their series was about to end and the group was close to melting. Their inventive and comic series (a sort of American Idol of their time) took four unknown actors and formed a supergroup made around them. <br /> <br /> This is their way of interpreting their "image produced" and the status of the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talent. <br /> <br /> It is also a hell of musical triumph, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Look at it with an open mind.
