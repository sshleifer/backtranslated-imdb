This is the movie that eventually pushed me over the line of recording with IMDb so that I could vote (and comment on it). I have only recently come to appreciate the well-made "war" films, and this is one of the most reflective I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "Stunning" is the word that comes to mind when I think of this visual experience. My husband and I watched this movie for the first time last night. It is sweetly moving, but at the same time exciting (not a contradiction). This story in the hands of Hollywood could have become just another Top Gun shooter, full of action and full of action. <br /> <br /> The two main actors playing Frantisek and Karel had a wonderful time; and Krystof Hadek is a very "nice" guy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact. As for Hadek's ability and acting aspect, my husband said (ironically): "Well, it's not Tom Cruise." I replied, "Thank God!" If you appreciate beautiful and sober acting, see this.
