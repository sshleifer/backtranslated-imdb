One night, bartender Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) from his jealous boyfriend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). Jewel case at home. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open the safe at Mc Cool's. Suddenly a blow - Utah is dead. So ... ... I'd better stop here to tell the plot. This is like explaining the story of "wild things". What I found so interesting was the fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel, his first and last job - he died in July last year ...) was told from 3 points of view - the 3 men falling for Jewel. Each of them sees it from different eyes - like John Goodman as the detective, who tenderly falls in love with her to be reminded of his dead wife ... No wonder the boys fall in love with her! Liv Tyler: it's a real gem. It made the big screen shine! He played his role as if he were in a noir-thriller thriller of the 1940s. Sweet - but at the same time she was the cold vampire who walks on the dead body and uses men for her needs. And, of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget it? Mr. Burmeister, the killer of the bingo game - was pretty cool! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was a bit too crap for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. This part started when Paul Reiser (as Randys Carl's cousin) wore his leather dress for Jewel. The song "YMCA" didn't fit so much here ... ... but, overall, "A night at Mc Cool's" is a nice parody of film noir! <br /> <br />
