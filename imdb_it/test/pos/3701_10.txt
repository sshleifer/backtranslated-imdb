It's 3:30. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie about six minutes ago and it's great. <br /> <br /> A teenage girl has a night of passion with her mother's lover and ruins everyone's lives. The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really blame anyone. <br /> <br /> They all played to perfection, and the story was inspiring. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie if you can put it in your hands. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10.
