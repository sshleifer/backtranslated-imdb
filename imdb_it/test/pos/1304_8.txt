I just found the whole set of 3 DVDs at Wal-Mart in the business basket for $ 5.50, so I thought I'd take another look. Total of 13 hours to watch everything (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations have repeated them for many years. <br /> <br /> Better than I actually expected, the weather was kind to the obvious sincerity of its creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all allied and female fighters. More abstract and artistic than a simple documentary, but very truthful in describing the causes and final results of the Second World War. That war depended heavily on shipping, and the final victory depended on who managed to achieve the ultimate mastery of the world's oceans. The Allies were the ones who were able to do it. <br /> <br /> Also interesting to see how they try to find a balance between the big events and the individual soldiers and sailors who made them happen. The score is impressive, although a little excessive compared to today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed as much as Richard Rodgers to the final score. I imagine that Rodgers provided all the main themes, and it was Bennett's job to adapt them to the images. Good job! <br /> <br /> It should be seen by any housekeeper or potential housekeeper. A warning to tyrants that wars are ultimately won by ideals, determination and supplies to support them. Logistics: their quality and delivery will determine the eventual winners. The Allies exceeded and exceeded the material quality of the Axis, attacked their own source in the process, ensuring their eventual defeat. <br /> <br /> Sorry to see that the producer, Henry Salomon, lived a very short life. The IMDb facts were rather mean, I have to find out more about him. He made some more important documentaries before his premature death. He could have more to say later <br /> <br /> Curiosities: I had all 3 LP records made with background music, generally pretty good. Unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one, relegating them immediately to the state of novelty, rather than listening to serious music. Too bad, because it contained some interesting but more secondary themes in the series. Nonsense like shooting 16-inch guns, fired torpedoes, bulldozers, planes ... just for kids mainly. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
