Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: indulge. It really doesn't make sense to try to "capture" this movie. I like movies where nothing happens (explicitly). Herzog's Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes has the same nothing, even if that film is less convincing, since the highlights are rather early in the story, so Herzog had to focus on nature against Kinski. Death in Venice is completely different, as it has different highlights, curves, etc. In fact, from the point where Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the film almost 'rushes' to his grand finale (his last grains of sand begin to flow through the hourglass after the moment of happiness where he imagines to warn the Polish family and stroking Tadzio's hair). <br /> <br /> You can, if you want, look for some real clues / symbols in this (his attempt to get away from his luggage from the moment he arrives, Tadzio's point at the end, the fact that throughout the The film's content and form are completely sincere, but it makes no sense to do it: it will not make the film better or worse, since its strength lies in the backwash of the entire plot, which is never made explicit. Tons of history, Europe in decadence, the end of the "romantic era" as we have come to know, which has proven to be only the beginning of it (individual emotions and expressions are more important now than they ever have been.) But wait , now I'm starting to develop the only small (small) flaw in the film: the parts "we talk about art". Now there is one thing not to do. I myself believe that it could have been expressed in other ways. , I think it becomes very clear in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I don't like them explicit films. I can read books, so I don't want a plot that only talks about my logic. I prefer films that are not explained in words, but only in the film (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's Picknick at Hanging Rock and Roeg's Man Who fellows To Earth also belong to this category), by then, and then only, has a reason to exist as a film and not simply as a book. So what about the Thomas Mann novel? I've never read it, but don't think about it anymore! The film offers a different point of view: it says things you can never say in a book. Use the art of film to make you feel, through images and music, the same thing that made you feel Mann, using the text. Equally brilliant, but different worlds.
