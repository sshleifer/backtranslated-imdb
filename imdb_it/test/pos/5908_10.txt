Jimmy Stewart portrays the story of Charles Lindbergh as he recounts almost the entire film as he crosses the Atlantic. He is well cared for with flashbacks about Lindeberghs life. The soundtrack by Franz Waxman is truly exceptional and gives the image a heroic touch. One of the most refined roles of Stewarts and this film can be delivered from time to time. Look for the appearances of Murray Hamilton (The Mayor in the JAWS movie) as Bud Gurney. He sees the DVD 8-15-06 with the release of some other classic Stewarts movies. I consider Jimmy Stewart the best American actor and I will never get tired of seeing him in any film I see, I look at this photo and you will agree.
