An exuberant and egocentric cadet of the army arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise man attitude towards the Body. <br /> <br /> In a role obviously tailored for him, William Haines shines in this very amusing & friendship story of honor. A level A thief, Haines during the first half of the film lives up to his usual Silly Billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have him locked up in a guardhouse. The last half, however, becomes very serious, leading to Haines' moral redemption and giving him a good opportunity to exhibit his acting talents. If WEST POINT does not quite reach the caliber of the previous TELL IT TO THE MARINES (1926) by Haines, this is undoubtedly due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma and the quality of Lon Chaney with which Haines can interact. However, this tribute to the Army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated for its merits. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford appears as the love interest of Haines, playing the innkeeper's virginal daughter. Joan is perennial and pretty and above all shines in her early scenes, when she meets Haines on a ferry on the Hudson River and is subject to her usual immature stunts. Haines & Crawford has made five silent films together and have been great friends for life. She was the biggest celebrity of this time and gave her many ideas to go on to Hollywood. A superstar of herself in the early 1930s, she reciprocated after her exclusion from the MGM in 1932 by encouraging her career change in interior decoration. Little William Bakewell is effectively chosen as Plebe who idolizes Haines; their relationship is actually more of a sentimental treatment than Haines & Crawford's. <br /> <br /> The film was made with the full cooperation of the War Department. The extensive shots on location at the Academy greatly contribute to the production setting, which has received splendid production values ​​from MGM. <br /> <br /> WEST POINT was recently restored and received a new soundtrack by David Davidson.
