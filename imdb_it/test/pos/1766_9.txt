I was surprised, "Once More, My Darling", had not generated enough votes (at the time of writing) for a "user rating". It is a "compelling" comedy that I have enjoyed many times over the years. Robert Montgomery's mission puts him in very unlikely situations, and he is only the man for the job. He keeps his trademark "confused" throughout the film and even hysterically. Ann Blyth plays her precocious / eccentric pursuer, who takes on a relationship that doesn't exist. His character is eccentric enough to deserve the nickname not nicknamed "Killer", but remains cute and tender. <br /> <br /> Among the abundance of "B" films of the late 40s and 50s, "Once More, My Darling" is a standout. This is worth looking for ....
