From acting to Cardone's direction, this new twist on the family ghost theme, badly done, will keep you in your place. Slow down sometimes because it builds this tension "what will happen". Medium-well on the blood but what's good. Spoiler: The death of the aurora and the subsequent party is a highlight for blood-hunting dogs. <br /> <br /> Writers have created an old story, but have added twists and re-imagined your typical obsession. Cardone gives it to life. . . er. . the death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and the always fabulous Ben Cross are real, no sign of acting here. All those who are part of the cast are busy and in reality it is not what every director looks for. Actors believe, so we believe. <br /> <br /> In addition to the traditional ghost story, the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere, from the mine, Hank's house and the Tunny house, there is a jarring fear from the first frame to the last. <br /> <br /> Fan of horror, do yourself a favor and enjoy what is one of the real horror movies out there. <br /> <br /> I end up with a great kudo to Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (screenplay) for no inventive writers, Hollywood would be nothing but a bad TV party.
