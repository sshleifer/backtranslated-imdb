Ok, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it's a great show, and it's the variation of Liv Tyler by Alicia Silverstone "Clueless" or Cameron Diaz "" There's something about Mary ". <br /> <br /> Liv plays a femme fatale, who just wants to have a home of your own and every kind of material comfort. And you do everything you can to get just that ... even the crimes. A lot of crimes And you drop every guy who doesn't cooperate to get these things. to have other lovers next to her current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is even more fun to see if you know that Liv is actually a cancer of the zodiac sign - and cancer is reported to be very domestic So the character that Liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone in the cinema when I saw this. It was quite comfortable because I could laugh as loud as I always wanted - but it was also strange, as if no one was really interested in this movie? <br /> <b r /> I loved it. The acting was from very good to excellent, especially the main actors, where brilliant. There where there are enough jokes, many of the black genre and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a trash film, and it is full of black humor. If you like this kind of movie, try this!
