It would seem that we should recognize Scandinavian cinema as something more than the mere Dogma movement of 1995, invented by the Danish in all these years. Den Brysomme Mannen, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surreal and deeply thought-out film, but deeply intriguing and rich in content both on and below the surface. Just as a film, it's a scathing comedy about society and the postmodern attitudes we live in; a world that judging from The Bothersome Man has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But together with this feeling of black comedy, it would seem that the film goes a little deeper and raises problems, at least for me, of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct of wanting to discover the truth among so much material in our world that perhaps it seems strange to us. <br /> <br /> This was actually a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me. The film falls heavily in the category of European art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguity enveloped by the atmosphere, while maintaining an open ending and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that can mean one thing or another . So many times we have seen movies that use the setting of The Bothersome Man and so many times it has turned into an almost predictable routine that revolves around a detective story or a chase story or something, but this movie allows its setting and situation to act as a simple background for its protagonist, named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag), to explore who he is; where it is and what are the possible mysteries behind this position. <br /> <br /> The setting I am talking about implies that the hero arrives in a place with no previous memory or what happened before. I will jump to the right and say that it is in my opinion he died and was sent in a sort of purgatory, like all the inhabitants of the city. Everyone in the city with which Andreas mixes are of the same age; same mentality and same attitude that suggest to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent in a purgatory devoid of any emotion, feeling, color or, above all, pain. <br /> <br /> When we see Andreas for the first time, he gets off a bus that later discovers he is mysterious in his abilities and approaches a gas station in the middle of nowhere. He is scruffy and has a huge beard, but soon he will be the opposite, wearing a suit and tie; clean and shaved face and a house of his own with a new job in which the film represents one of the best changes between rural and urban that I have ever seen. But the new job and the new city are uncomfortable; you can take breaks whenever you want; the garments are unusually gentle and there seems to be no emotions or reactions to anything. These ideas are best interpreted in a cinema when Andreas, still a neophyte of the city, is crying and is clearly influenced by a film on display, but everyone else looks at the stone style. There is also the initial example when a man jumped out of a window and lies impaled on some spikes but everyone walks without problems. <br /> <br /> To support my idea of ​​everyone who is already dead and the city that acts as a kind of purgatory, death and harm in general are impossible. There is a particularly unpleasant scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb, but everyone's reaction to the event is stone and grows back within an hour. In the same way, a suicide attempt that involves trains later on leads to nothing and instead we get the point of view on what it means to be dragged along tube tracks with invulnerability on your side. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need to self-harm is impossible; a place where sexual relations can occur and separations in the same way, but both in circumstances without emotion and without passion; a place where people can attempt suicide but it is impossible to actually die. The city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in "real life" and, therefore, the film says that you cannot kill yourself twice, in fact you cannot feel pain or emotion in the afterlife of purgatory. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the film is the one that insinuates you. Judging by the final five minutes of the film and the side-story that opens with the music from another man's house, it would seem that there is a thin line between the spaces that the film calls "heaven" and "hell". Can we see these spaces only very, very briefly ?? so briefly that they consist of a single shot. The "paradise" is a colorful kitchen with music and games for children: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness, while hell is a snowy nothingness that haunts you thanks to its hopeless construction and its disturbing reference point. The introduction of these two spaces at the end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality Andreas and co. in the face: purgatory and all that ensued, the afterlife was not ready for Andreas and his free and adventurous mind ?? and look where the thinkers end up.
