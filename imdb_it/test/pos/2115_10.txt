This is the kind of film I grew up on. It is great fun for the family, that children love and their parents have fun too. I wish other films like this were made. It's a beautiful story about a little boy who raises a bull with his mother and sister, and shows it to the National Grand Championship, where he wins! Then he is frightened by the fact that someone is about to grill his bull, so he kidnaps him and returns home with it. I was very excited when I saw this movie for the first time in the theater and was surprised to see George Stretto, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little movie. The music was great with all kinds of huge country names like Willie Nelson and Dixie Chicks. Anyone who does not love this film, has no children or has never been a child.
