Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel to all Halloween movies. Jamie, the niece of the serial killer Michael Myers, brings a child who is then taken by the man in black since the end of Halloween 5. A kind nurse helps Jamie escape but Myers quickly tracks her down and kills her. Jamie's baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of Jamie Lee's baby-sitting children in the original film, and Myers arrives in Haddonfield and begins killing the Strode clan who lives in his old home. The film ends with scenes that reveal clues about Michael's evil, the identity of Man In Black and a parenthesis with the whole of Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers' plot. I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is classified as R for violent violence, extreme violence, short sexuality, language and short nudity.
