If Monte Hellman's masterpiece of the early 70's of the legendary road movie "Two-Lane Blacktop" had been made more like a humorous, angular, ruthless, tense and honest masterpiece of humor embellished by that distinctly fussy, not bad Australian mentality , very rough and torn, and seasoned with a generous sprinkling of extremist, gloomy, hopeless, hopeless punk nihilism, it would undoubtedly be very similar to this unpleasant and atmospheric knockout. <br /> <br /> Mike, a friendly worker Mike (a charming Terry Serio) runs into a crazy and elusive champion of the car race Fox (a hateful Richard Moir) when he steals Fox's girlfriend to model Julie (the adorable Deborah Conway) away from him. Mike and Fox begin to compete in increasingly lethal races where the stakes get higher and higher with each subsequent encounter, culminating finally in an all-or-nothing race with only one true winner allowed. Mike, assisted by his worried but loyal Italian friend Tony (a beautifully fluid breakthrough of Vangelis Mourikis) and educated by a blind, fattening fifties style rebel (wonderfully tested with the utmost coolness by Max Cullen), willingly puts his life the line for the good of his reputation, the affection of his old lady, the money and, above all, the possibility of overthrowing the arrogant fox from his gloating and glorious launch. Directed with the utmost gravity and intensity of John Clark, laconically written on perfection to perfection by Barry Tomblim, with a chilling soundtrack, creeping synthesizer by Peter Crosbie and the contemptuous cinematography of David Gribble, this authentic early 80's presents the concept of racing cars not only as an alternative and funky lifestyle, but also as an ubiquitous obsession and way of life (it is the only thing most of the characters in the film are really passionate about) with a extraordinarily astute and impassive eye. Completed by a terrifying unexpected ending and a ruthless central message on the bitter price that is paid for being the top dog, this compelling representation of a landlocked existence is considered an extraordinary cinematic achievement.
