This movie is fantastic. Elegant, fun, good acting. I had seen it in various ways like "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Muskets" and "Reservoir Fops", both excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but does not detract from the enjoyment. Carlyle is a brilliant pimp and Miller is an excellent drunk gentleman. The sets and costumes are fantastic and the music and filming are unusually unusual for a "costume drama". Sense and Sensitivity surely it is not !!!!! My recommendation? Go see it, relax with a huge bowl of popcorn and have a blast.
