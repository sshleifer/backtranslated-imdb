Life is crazy You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We are all a little Minnie and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems better to make sense ... but then what could you lose? <br /> <br /> It must be you. You don't have to park the cars and scream in a semi-random way at people, but you can't hide behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like it's all right. And sometimes, you really have to pay attention to the wind, why why are you alive? <br /> <br /> I have no intention of "evaluating" this love compared to the other Cassavetes films, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each of their own individual actions of expression and exploration of our lives. In this sense they are all great and the comparisons are odious. Certainly, this film has that crazy, sometimes exasperating, but ultimately wonderful and free quality that all of its films have - you never know what will happen next, and you never know what the characters will think, do, or hear. next one. Not even the characters themselves - and do we really want to live our lives in another way? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a great job and subtly steal money from your IRA, but live the life of an adventurer within your feelings, your spirit and your own life experience. Yes, we can have both, that's what Cassavetes shows us. Thank God someone did.
