This film was a pleasant surprise. I had foreseen it for a long time and I was afraid to enter that it could not possibly meet my expectations. <br /> <br /> It has overcome them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Exhilarating from beginning to end (to stay until after the credits!), it is absolutely remarkable how a film about stupid and boring characters can be so intelligent, witty and engaging. <br /> <br /> With its obvious opaque paintings, the future Earth of the film is reminiscent of the Planet of the Apes series and other sci-fi films of that era. <br /> <br /> Actually, this film is essentially Planet of the Apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of monkeys. <br /> <br /> It moves at a fairly brisk pace, and Luke Wilson brings the movie pretty well, with a character that remembers what he played in "Bottle Rocket" ". (There is also a nod not so thin to "Bottle Rocket" in one of the first scenes. <br /> <br /> Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who was frozen. <Br /> <br /> Despite all his points of strength, "Idiocracy" has the distinct feeling of a film that was taken away by the director / editor before it could be tuned up. <br /> <br /> I can't for the life of me understand why such a funny movie it would have been downloaded in some theaters without advanced projections, without trailers, without marketing. <br /> <br /> It is as if the studio had decided that they would no longer spend on it and just left. <br /> <br /> Or maybe they thought the film had the makings of a cult classic, and the only way to make it a true cult classic was to do it fall ire? <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a shame, because Mike Judge and this film in particular deserve better. I predict that this film will have real legs on DVD, and a word from your mouth will push you to the success it deserves. <br /> <br /> Maybe Fox Executives saw themselves in the characters, they were confused and thought it was a documentary?
