While the talk shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in a while, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president or other substantial guests sit in front of him, it's not bad. At other times, it tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal that absolutely does not provide intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars. During the OJ Simpson trial, it seemed that every other guest of his show was connected to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes, it comes out a bit like trash television - Jerry Springer in an interview with telephone interviews instead of a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, King's show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly whose show is nothing but a properly political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That being said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but unfortunately he is not a big one. The king does not always come out as if he completely understood when intellectual material is presented, especially if it is from a scholar or historian with a new book on the subtle aspects of politics. It always seems that the minute King can't handle the problem when he turns to phone calls, perhaps hoping that someone in the country has a better question than he has. He could interview someone like David Gergen, but he may not have read any of his books. A bit like the film producer who never bother to read the script. <br /> <br /> When it is a celebrity of the show, no problem. It can come out as if it were well informed since the material is not substantial in any case. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. It is known that he usually saw the last film of the star. Watching a movie takes less time and more contemplation than reading a book. However, if they are characters like John Dean or Bob Woodward, King comes off a bit as if he had not finished his homework. So on for phones. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for in-depth interviews, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. He reads and / or searches in advance everything he has written or his guests and has a practical knowledge of those areas. I really don't see King doing it. Of course, he probably has a 1000 times bigger audience than Terry Gross, who could say more about the American public than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill but not as good as Terry.
