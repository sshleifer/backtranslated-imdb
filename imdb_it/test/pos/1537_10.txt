This film gave me recurring nightmares, with the voice of Alan Rickman representing an all-powerful, insidious and fascist ruler. The scariest movie I've ever seen: the most powerful psychological terror of any horror film ever made. Alan Rickman's voice will always represent the power and terror of a totalitarian state, which recalls Orwell's 1984. This film describes to those who do not care about the reality of most governments in the current world. This film is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should look at it - it's a description of a reality that no one should ever try, but many do.
