I haven't seen so many people packed out of a Star Wars Episode III theater. Both shows are sold out, and for good reason. The Man With the Screaming Brain was the best movie to watch with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a jerk too.) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in suture! The film was made of cheese in the best possible way. It could be the funniest movie Bruce has made. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop and its facial expressions, it's a real laugh! Who knew that Ted could do rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There's nothing more fun than a robot ... being a robot. <br /> <br /> Regarding Bruce's performance: "I take the 5th." Thanks Bruce. Thanks for being nice, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all the fun.
