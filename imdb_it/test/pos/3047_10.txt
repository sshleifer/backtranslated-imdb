This film launched my theory on film based on books: instead of following the clich√© "You read the book, now watch the movie", if you're looking for a good book to read, try one where a movie you like was based , because it will be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in its first National Theater release in downtown Eugene and I liked it so much that I stayed to see it again. It's a perfect fusion between the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what has become my favorite book, "The Water Is Wide", by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can't think of anything better film about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. Two small warnings: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers severely from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) The title should be reported to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most moving and enigmatic songs ever written
