Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this evil comedy / drama / melody. The hospital depicted here is full of problems ... from protest neighbors to angry patients to a potential free killer. George C. Scott is the best doctor who, on the brink of his nervous breakdown, gets involved with Diana Rigg and his extravagant father Barnard Hughes. Alternatively depressing and amazing, THE HOSPITAL presents some of the most acidic dialogues imaginable (note how Scott describes his love session with Rigg). He also has a lot of great cartoons: Nurse Nancy Scott, who scolds Scott after one of these subordinates accidentally kills a doctor; the manager of daffy Frances Sternhagen who desperately tries to gather information on insurance from a waiting room full of patients; Scott received disappointing advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him about his painful home life. All acting is top notch. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with the screenplay by Chayefsky who won a well-deserved Oscar (in such a tough competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The initial narrative is priceless.
