What a pity this movie has never been released. (Now it's playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high esteem for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie much better than the ones I paid to see in theaters recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as "unusual", but in reality they are more of the same old recycled grocery. This film is really different, with the bonus of a moving message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Although it is required by the plot to sing some of the most mushy and sentimental songs ever written, it does it so well that it doesn't matter. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well blended and superb, but a newcomer in the role of Cathy Bates's daughter-in-law steals every scene she is in. Give this film a chance.
