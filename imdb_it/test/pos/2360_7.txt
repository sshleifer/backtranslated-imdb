Black Day Blue Night was actually a good modern noir. Three young nomads fleeing their lives unite in something of a journey through a desert in the middle of nowhere (as most modern noir does). A woman discovers that her husband cheats on her and, after finding him in a hotel room, he decides to leave and start over. Strangely, she travels with her husband's lover, who is forgivable since the sleazebag never told her that he was married. And together, as they drive in the pouring rain, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. While they are stunned and free and all suspicious of each other, the policemen in the city have marked them as suspects in the death of a policeman. <br /> <br /> Black Day Blue Night starts with an immediate fight, and throws a good story with all its twists to fool your suspicions about one character after another, leading to a very unusual ending. That is, the film begins with an immediate confrontation, and once you think the story has been resolved, you are immediately pushed into another turn in the plot, revealing only a little more than you expected before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> But, as some viewers have written, the ending is slightly confusing and a little disappointing. The killer is not what you would expect immediately and, once revealed, becomes a bit confused due to a rather subtle flashback that reveals all the reason needed to solve the mystery. But in reality there is an ending beyond that, which I think is the most interesting of the film. Because the modern noir always involves a circle of suspected criminals, almost always all guilty of something, it is also a genre that always involves money. And so the question in these films always becomes - how far away are the characters willing to go for money? <br /> <br /> If you like this interpretation of the modern film noir, I suggest you look at Red Rock West (it's also I took JT Walsh and some who go to the devastated desert)!
