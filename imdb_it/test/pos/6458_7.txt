Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) appears in the New York shipyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. He gets one on the condition that he pays for a kick in the overcrowded crew chief Jack Warden. While there, he attains a friendship with the negro Sydney Poitier who unfortunately leads to a moral dilemma that is hopeless for a man who, we know, generally escapes his problems. <br /> <br /> The film looks like Oscar winner On the Waterfront, feels like On the Waterfront and, above all, it sounds very similar to that of the 1954 Kazan production. However, its racial theme is innovative for its time. The black Poitier and the white Cassavetes are treated as equal in all respects. It could also be called the first of the black-white "buddy" images that would later dominate so many action movies. <br /> <br /> Help the two protagonists play so well with each other. Nevertheless, the central flaw of the film does not indicate why the chief of crew Poitier pushes a friendship with the severe Cassavetes in the first place. He really does everything to be a friend of the newcomer. But the reason why he crossed racial barriers to do it is never really suggested. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with the other head of the Warden crew, but then he really comes close to the boy. There is a hint of this in some of Cassavetes' suspicious reactions, but beyond that, the relationship seems unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there's a single shot in the whole movie, I can't recognize it. Everything is done in the squalid New York location, without the usual movie extras. In this sense, it is an anti-Hollywood production, carefully deglobed up to the night club scene, which in turn seems like a real crowd outside the opening hours. I suppose sociologists can dub this rather crude slice of life "a taste of the poor working". <br /> <br /> However, for all his virtues, which are many, the film remains too close to Kazan's Brando-Film for convenience. Here, an unfamiliar good actress, Kathleen Maguire, plays the role of ex-redeeming girlfriend, Warden, the role of the corrupt boss of the work, while Cassavetes, like Brando, has to undergo a bloody beating before regaining his moral position and doing the Right thing. Still and all, despite the derivative nature, the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original strength to deserve a look-see.
