Hehehe. This was one of the best funny street movies ever! I laughed so I fell off the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody's banks and, of course, One Night at McCool. <br /> <br /> These are crazy Norwegian fans, who will participate in the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany. And all kinds of crazy fun that comes with it. It was fun. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun for centuries. The rumors say that number two will come, but I don't know. This will be hard to beat. <br /> <br /> recommended to everyone! It is a must-see film. I had to see it at the cinema, but I had a job at the time it was shown. And I tried to rent it for a month, but I rented it all the time. Understood today on DVD. It's worth it.
