it's been years since I saw these shows. I have been looking for years for anyone else who has seen these or knows anything about them. I thought I made them up. what I remember most is the soldier and death. I would ask the movie fanatics if they saw them, mentioning a Jim Henson and people still didn't know. these are great fables. I was very young when I was these, not even 10 and left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would recommend anyone to watch them, just remember they are from the 80s, so they don't look like today's movies. just give them a shot. Jim Henson was far ahead of his time and died early.
