I just saw this movie and recommend it. It has a very good storyline, it keeps your full attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and even Emily Watson was very good. A very beautiful film, on the great unconditional love. The character of Tom Wilkinson is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor makes a performance that makes you feel the anguish and suffering of the character . The character of Emily Watson is very strong, and she just needs to take a quick look and you understand everything. I will not say more because it is better that you should enter the story as it unfolds.
