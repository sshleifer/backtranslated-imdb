It infuriates me forever that, now and forever, I will have to identify this film (which I consider a masterpiece, and I don't use this word lightly) with the qualifier "It's not the film by Michael Douglas!" Not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing: the radioactive fallout that rained on the survivors of the first nuclear bombings. In Imamura's film, this is not an economic metaphor; the whole film is about the physical and emotional relapse of Hiroshima and the war itself. While the deterioration of a couple and their granddaughter becomes more darkly clear, the ironic imagination becomes more powerful, from the old clock that is reset every night to the stone gods that gradually accumulate outside the heroin's door. (These, in turn, are carved by a distraught veteran who is forced, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything with an engine that approaches the city). The day of the bombing is shown in flashback fragments that are coldly terrifying. Yet "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") Can be seen, even repeatedly, due to Imamura's compassion for her characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
