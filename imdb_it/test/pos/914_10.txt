Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this latest installment of the Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it manages to tie all three films together. I'm simply admired by the amount of talent it took to make one of these stories, not to mention all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the final result is much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs to any list of great film results. Simply brilliant!
