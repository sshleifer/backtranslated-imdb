The Cure is an extraordinary drama of real life that deals with a very delicate subject. It is the story of the deep and dear friendship between two boys, Eric and Dexter. The latter acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion. So he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) became marginalized, avoided by the public and labeled as a dangerous society, basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, known by "The Client" and "Apt Pupil") and his mother move into the house next to them, he is dealing with public insults and the fear of taking AIDS alone. However, Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. At first he starts talking to Dexter, but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the witty guy (played by Jurassic Park, Joseph Mazzello) and his games. Very quickly develops a true friendship with Dexter, who is delicately built and fragile due to his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the film ?? the theme that makes it pervasively authentic and tragic at the same time ?? is how Eric and Dexter try to find the ultimate cure. At the beginning they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves ?? which is very naive, but at the same time genuine, since it shows how children deal with diseases so hateful and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear about an alleged cure that has been developed in the South, they do not hesitate and leave for an adventure that will bring them even closer and symbolizes the latest search for hope. <br /> <br /> So they get on a raft and head south on the Mississippi River. What starts as a real adventure becomes a dangerous undertaking, which is emotionally intriguing and instructive at the same time. The scene where Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, Eric hands him his sneaker, a symbol that wherever the boy has to go, Eric is and always will be with him; it must never be alone. This sequence, which is one of the most compelling of the film, presents a very convincing interaction between the two actors, who manage to avoid clumsy and awkward dialogues and offer a very genuine performance that eventually shatters its tenderness and honesty. <br /> <br /> I will not go further in delineating the plot, since I do not intend to give too much information. The ending, however, is emotionally hard and makes the audience so much a part of the tragedy that everyone watching the film will feel personally affected. This aspect makes this film so strong, exceptional and convincing. The emotional burden on each character is so real and so engaging that even the most severe members of the public may need some handkerchiefs. A 10 is doing justice to this film and it's not too high a rating. There is hardly any other film I have seen so far in my life that manages such an emotional problem with so much intelligence and sensitivity. It is the story of how two boys enrich each other's lives and how they teach each other the lessons of life. So Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really matters in life; and both realize how true a true friendship is when it comes to the most difficult moments in life. <br /> <br /> Is this film tragic ?? but his message is pure inspiration.
