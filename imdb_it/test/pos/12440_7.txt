The happiest days of your life stage some of the greatest talents of the British comedy of his time in a traditionally farcical and high-class fashion. Generally it is a whistle-blowing whirlwind behavior with the girls-only school which provides an ideal setting for eccentrics. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - above all! - Joyce Grenfell is fantastic, she gives us a lot of laughs as they express their horror of what they are facing. As the film progresses, things become more foolish and more silent with the parents' tour around the school which is an appropriate reference point for crackers. <br /> <br /> At this point I will give a special mention, again, to Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage. It's so extraordinarily innocent, foolish, apologetic, and ineffective that it seems to steal the whole movie. Provides the biggest laugh in the movie when flirting with a male teacher ("Call me sausage!"). <br /> <br /> While some films are slow or dated, and not always very engaging, they are still retaining most of its sparkle and barely stands for romance. Good for a silly and harmless giggle. <br /> <br /> 7/10
