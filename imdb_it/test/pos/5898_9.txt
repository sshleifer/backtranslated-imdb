This American masterpiece has come close to perfection as the popular art wants to be, from its splendidly equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent interpretation aroused by William Wyler from the nonprofessional amputee Harold Russell ?? <br /> <br /> Has the film embodied both the dream and the reality of the post-war world? Has this intimate involvement with the psychological facts of American life given him an almost universal audience? But, unlike the images of the contemporary and previous "message", was it not a sermon? He showed the Americans as they are, presented their problems as they saw them, and provided only such partial, temporary, personal solutions, as they themselves would have accepted? The values ​​of the image are the values ​​of the people in it ?? <br /> <br /> William Wyler, an exceptional director, the triple winner of the best Oscar film, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and western ... With his distinctive visual style and his taste for solemn material, acquired a reputation as a meticulous and serious artist ... Wyler's most focused use of deep focus reveals the true commitment to emotional content ... <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three men returning from the war to a small Central American community, and they find it difficult to pick up where they left off ... The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March) as magnificent as the devoted family man who he manages to break the ice with his family; an incisive captain of the Air Force (Dana Andrews) who returns to an unfaithful wife; and a troubled sailor (Harold Russell) who lost both hands in service, replaced by hooks in real life ... <br /> <br /> Winner of 7 Oscars including the best film, "The Best Years of our life "is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal film with touching scenes of homecoming without words: <br /> <br /> - The first words of the sergeant's loving wife when he arrives unexpectedly at home:" I look terrible! It's not fair for you to burst into us like this. "<br /> <br /> - The involuntary mother hiccup's hiccup when she sees her son's mechanical hands for the first time ... Slams:" It's not nothing! "<br /> <br /> With his dry-martini voice, Myrna Loy charmingly combines her maternal and maternal qualities; Teresa Wright is as adorable as the beautiful daughter of the sergeant who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is tough as the unfair flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life; and Cathy O'Donnell is as wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's girlfriend ... <br /> <br /> Situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious, but this is a superb example of high quality film production in the forties, with smiles and shrewdly spaced tears and a film that says what is needed on a vital topic ...
