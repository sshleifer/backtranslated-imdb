This is not a story. It is a group of psychic needles that reach your subconscious. If you wait for a story, you will get bored. But if you abandon yourself to it you will be in his dream world within 10 minutes. The vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape give way to your fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of Christ's crucifixion, the pulsating light and the deep dark shadows, all reach your subconscious to fill this mental space. I found myself shaking and unable to escape in front of my television. It was like daydreaming. A strange nightmare, a bad journey, a religious experience ... it touched me deeply and marked me to live. It freed my mind and gave me one of the rare experiences of loss of personality and fusion with the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. A violent freedom anyway ... Not a good film, but a very strong and unforgettable film. Literally my text has no spoilers. For me the great surprise of this film was the incredible intensity of it, and describing this can be understood as a spoiler. The less you know about this movie while watching it, the better.
