After the death of all the senior officers, the commander Craig-Scott of the laundry and moral body finds himself promoted to the command of an intergalactic spacecraft owned by Starcups Corporation. Its main mission is to search for habitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his second-in-command, Chief Blather, find themselves ill-prepared for leadership, except as far as they are completely able to keep the crew's panties clean - which is not the importance of clean underpants diminishes, especially when incompetent commanders ensure that those same panties are, well, dirty on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> The episodes are presented as a series of brief 2-3 minute reports of the Commander on Earth. Humor is a mix of ironic impassive and extravagant physical comedy. Think Yes, the Minister meets Red Dwarf, but with a shoe budget. All the usual science-fiction devices of the plot are here - aliens, nuclear weapons, computer malfunctions - but each is enhanced by the new smell of high quality laundry detergent. <br /> <br /> Commander's Log is decidedly low budget, but the effects and props that are a little rough fit the absurd premise of the show. Do you remember those hilarious hockey helmets they wore on the old Battlestar Galactica? With the name "Jofa" still visible? Okay, there's a lot in the Commander log, but it's nice. <br /> <br /> Commander's registry is not of a high standard, but it is not what it is trying to be. It's just a bit of carefree fun. It does a good job of being that.
