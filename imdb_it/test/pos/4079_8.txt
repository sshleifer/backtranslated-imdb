This burning incident based on a real accident involves several ambitious African citizens who decide to leave their families temporarily by putting themselves on an outgoing ship. They think that if they can make the journey they can improve their lives by making enough money in New York to send their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship they select is a ruined Russian freighter that has already been heavily fined in a previous port to accommodate illegal passengers. The captain and the first officer are determined not to let this happen again, as their jobs are online. The group of blacks begins its harrowing journey in the hold and eventually they are discovered, forced to hide and killed by the ruthless companion (an extraordinary performance by Sean Pertwee.) Some (among whom the convincingly terrified leader Omar Epps stands out) temporarily escape and they are mercilessly persecuted through the ship with their lives lost if they are captured. Overall, a compelling film that will see audiences biting their nails and gritting their teeth wondering how such terrible events could happen in modern civilization.
