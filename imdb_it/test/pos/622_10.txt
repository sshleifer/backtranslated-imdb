This is a VERY good movie. I give him a 10. <br /> <br /> It is very different in that it is a sort of stalking scene all along the way. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very credible way. <br /> <br /> He sees a murder (for a film not funny) and decides to escape but is chased (this takes quite a while). I don't want to reveal the rest of the film because it would ruin the experience, but rest assured: it's very credible, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises and a fantastic ending. <br /> <br /> I miss this movie.
