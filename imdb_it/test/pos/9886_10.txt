I saw the premiere of this film during the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival and was very impressed by the director's ability, Jeff Hare, who exposed this topic on the subject. The cast of characters has perfectly woven and has allowed us to examine the question of an elder who wishes to die "in his own terms" in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was as brilliant as Morris and the support group of family and friends was perfectly chosen in their roles. The interaction of family, friends and strangers with Morris has created a realistic view of how families face the issue of their parents' aging and desires to die with dignity. <br /> <br /> Although this film is apparently a film about Jewish Actor and his family, it really is a film about all families. The jokes of the family and Morris during this parade through the "Force of Nature" are fresh and realistic. Childhood rivalries, successes and failures of adults and hope for children are an integral part of this script. While many will wonder how it is possible to make the subject of suicide "humorous", I thought the treatment was logical and timely. If you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the jokes of a family struggling with this problem, then you MUST SEE THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded "Best Film" at the Phoenix Film Festival.
