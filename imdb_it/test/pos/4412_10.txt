A pile of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow. This is the piece of naked meat that is "Little Joe", a New Yorker hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and small child. The film follows a day of his life, after he was awakened from sleep by his wife asking him to go out and do the traditional male thing - to be a breadwinner. But the use he wants to put bread is to pay for the abortion of his new girlfriend. Surely we are not in the traditional family unit here ... <br /> <br /> After playing with his son, Joe walks the streets to go on a cruise with John. Customers arrive often and quickly: the homosexual homosexual who wants to meet him again because he "works well together", the old English classical scholar who pays $ 100 to see Joe pose as an ancient Greek athlete; the topless female dancer blowing on Joe then boasts of being raped; the elderly gym bunny who does not think that what he and Joe do together is strange. After a hard day at work, Joe comes home exhausted, only to be put down by his wife and girlfriend. He falls asleep while harping and undermining him. <br /> <br /> Meat is fascinating in that it requires a traditional traditional classical structure - it has an inciting incident (money for abortion) and installation, a collision and a resolution (even if very downbeat), also a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal, and then focuses on the details of the daily routine of these people who are perfectly ordinary with themselves but extraordinary for most "mainstream" people. It all seems very authentic and natural - it is difficult to see acting, the actors are so fully their roles - but the whole is a cunning artifice - a beautifully drawn portrait or a finely carved statue. The director Morrissey carefully plans every event, every encounter around his theme of human flesh becomes packaged goods but with such a cunning hand that you almost don't realize he does it. The wife "packages" Joe's sexual organ, the old Englishmen lament a long history of classic beauty that has created art and poetry of human fleshy beauty, friends disguised as a stripper package as women reading a Hollywood magazine where " real "women are packaged as products; the gym bunny buys Joe's friendship and affection, he thinks artificial porn is real and can't say, as we can't, that Joe is exhibiting his friendship and intimacy for money. The film itself is presented as the non plus ultra of cinematic realism, but what we could very well have to do here is art or a first example of concept art. <br /> <br /> The genius - a word not lightly used - of Morrissey had to find a way to take the artificial pretensions of Warhol to film production, which were interesting, but boring to die for, and turn them into salable products that remain among the most intriguing cinematographic works ever made - advertising boxes labeled "Flesh" and "Trash" and "Heat" with a product label - "Andy Warhol" - which sells an idea of ​​the product as much as the product itself . Yet just as you make Morrissey's cynicism falter, you are fascinated by his ability to maintain the highest level of standards and depth of meaning. The constant that looks like a camera flash constantly draws attention to the filmic nature of what is being observed, but one is still attracted by the illusion - Flesh is certainly one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic to always enchant the public .
