You can't really call Roy Andersson prolific, (6 films in 37 years). Nor can you accuse him of being conventional; it's not 'straight-forward', at least when it comes to fiction. "You, the Living", his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which you observe a large number of characters without doing much and if this seems daunting, I assure you it is not. This is a funny, accessible and surprisingly friendly film, a slice of life far removed from what we normally see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, "slice of life" is hardly the appropriate moniker to apply to this film since the lives of most people are unlikely to be something like this. The incidents on the screen range from those that are almost terrifying to those that are decidedly extravagant and while the characters can run away, sometimes they are no longer seen, others reappear as if they were anxious for approval, Andersson gives them a kind of benevolent affection. This, and a bit of rollicking music, ensures that the time we spend with them is a time well spent.
