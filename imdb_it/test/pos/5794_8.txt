Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life that is increasingly falling into decay. In his search for meaning, he falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred for his deeply imperfect parents quickly turns into out of control. <br /> <br /> Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in almost every way. The father's drinking, his mother's skill and lack of understanding, the casual lies and the wrong direction of his brother, and the very Vera who forgives them all their faults are all shocking and slightly disturbing to observe. However, the film's crude honesty somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters. Set in cramped spaces and vast urban decay, Little Vera presented a very different view of Soviet life than it had ever been seen before. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society painted in the tones of pain, despair and rust. It is the implosion of a family against the implosion of an entire social order. <br /> <br /> Although painful and desperately unsatisfactory, the film itself certainly deserves to be seen, if only to understand the feelings and cultures that are reshaping Russia today.
