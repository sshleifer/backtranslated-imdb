If you're a fan of Duke's first films, this oldie Lone Star is good. What more can you ask from Duke, Yak and Gabby. Lots of nice running and shooting !!! I found it surprising that the singer voice of Duke was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It was reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so he may have also been twin brother Bill. However, if you like good and clean Western movies, don't miss this. We must not question ourselves about hidden meanings or try to understand the underlying themes. Sit back, relax and enjoy a simpler day and schedule western movie. It's called entertainment people !!!
