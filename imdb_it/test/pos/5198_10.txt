Stalingrad is a fantastic film, well acted and directed, and rather down-to-earth in its approach to the various bizarre aspects of war and its politics. This, along with "Das Boot", is one of the best war movies (along with the Finnish "Vinterkriget" ("The Winter War", in English, I think)). Describes the evidence of some of the German soldiers who fought and died during and around Stalingrad during World War II. Not heroically grandiose heroic, without excessive emotional heaviness, only the fear of dying every day in war. The atmosphere of the film is similar to that of "Das Boot", and this should give you some suggestions on what to expect, I guess. So, if you like realistic, non-Hollywood war movies: rent them, buy them, just make sure you see them! Finally, the note from a movie fan: for some of the information from previous reviewers, I just want to add that "Stalingrado" is not directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made "Das Boot")!
