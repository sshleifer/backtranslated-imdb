Like many people, I am tired of the numbers of the clich√© films that Hollywood makes. There doesn't seem to be any creativity in Hollywood. Companies just want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an integrated audience. <br /> <br /> This film is a welcome change. It could be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but don't miss this movie. This is a very original film that is not like most of the things that Hollywood produces. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you already know the basic plot, so I won't worry about going further. The only films that come to mind to compare this are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel" which are little-known gems that take a different path than most Hollywood junk. <br /> <br /> This is well worth seeing if you are tired of looking more or less the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
