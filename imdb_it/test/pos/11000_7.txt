General Trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the Enterprise. A lot of extremely improbable and meaningless things seem to happen, and Trelayne seems obsessed with human war and murder practices. It seems that he needs to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and he has created a human environment (although not updated for several hundred years) in which to reproduce his fantasies. The environment is subtly inauthentic and the crew immediately begins to identify inconsistencies. It soon becomes clear that Trelayne is not only an immature but very fallible god. Regardless of how you feel about this, look for the ending similar to Twilight Zone. It was worth it. <br /> <br /> As many have pointed out, the character of Trelayne inspired the most developed and entertaining character of Q - and one can see in John DeLancie's construction of that personality more than just shades of Campbell's Trelayne. It's fun to compare the way the four captains we've seen dealing with Q deal with him so radically differently.
