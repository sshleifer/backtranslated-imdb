This thriller has so many twists that it put me on the edge of my seat. I saw it on video, some of the bluff landscapes could be a little more spectacular on the big screen. Cast has Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from "The Truth About Cats & Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
