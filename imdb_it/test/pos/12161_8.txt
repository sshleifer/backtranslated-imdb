Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by then almost all of Europe had fallen under the advance of the Nazi war machine. Entering the war, Great Britain began practically from scratch, with scarce supplies and with an aeronautics that was exceeded in number of ten against one from Germany. But the will of the British was firm, encouraged by their new prime minister Winston Churchill who declared: "We will never go under." <br /> <br /> On 8 August 1940, the battle for Britain was open. However, for the first time since Hitler's declared position of conquering the world, he hits a wall. Although in vastly lower numbers, the British Royal Air Force went on the offensive, and within twenty-eight days, in September and October of 1940, the German Luftwaffe losses rose to two thousand three hundred and seventy-five planes and crews lost. Hitler's anger was boiling, but he had to call a momentary pause. Responding later in the year, Hitler launched a massive bombardment of London on Christmas day 1940. When I say that there has never been a catastrophic film to rival the real London live on fire during this assault it would be an understatement. Perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter of the "Why We Fight" series would see British citizens emerge from their underground shelters after the bombing to resume what's left of their life above ground. Even as you watch, there is no way to understand the living horror that these people must have gone through, since the city of London has been left in virtual ruin. <br /> <br /> Yet the Nazis were also stunned and blocked. Everything that Hitler wanted to believe in freedom and democracy was now turned to his head. Instead of being weak and complacent like the French, the British would not have given up without a fight. And they fight that they did, taking the air battle in Germany and responding in kind with the attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.
