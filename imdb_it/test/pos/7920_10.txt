This was commented only because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) may not know at first how powerful a soundtrack is and how majestic these texts really are. If you read the texts of Alexander Nevsky op.78 there is nothing here is less than a witness through the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores of all musical literature. This film with its accompanying score has a special place in the world and can be just as true on the internet as it is everywhere. the composers' website, which is signed by his estate, provides additional care based on the score that this score deserves. It is as deep for me as it is wide with such boldness that you wish to be the only one, what they called Great Novgorod This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the Neva river, on the Neva river, on the wide waters. We have killed the enemy of the fighters: there are fighting men, the Swedes' army. Ah! How we fought, how we got rid of them! Ah, they destroyed their ship. In the war our blood was liberated freely for our great land, our native Russian land. Hey!, Where the broadaxe swayed was like an open road, through their rows a lane where spears ran! We've mowed the invader The Swedes like the feather grass grow on desert soil. They will never cede the native Russian land. Those who march on Russia will be put to death! Stand up against the enemy, Russian land, stand up, resist the weapons, great Novgorod! the arms go on) Stand up in arms, Russian people, in battle, alone, in the struggle for death, you rise, you free and brave people, defend our beautiful homeland! Great esteem for living warriors, immortal fame to slain warriors! at home, for the Russian land, get up people, Russian people! No enemy will live in our great native Russia. Go back to arms, rise again, native mother Russia! No enemy will have to march through the Russian land, no foreign troops will have to attack Russia, not seeing the roads to Russia. An enemy will devastate the Russian camps (here, dear reader, we are asked to live forever with the following verse) entitled " The camp of the dead ": I will cross the snowy field, I will fly over the field of death. I will look for valiant warriors, my betrothed, my brave young men. Here lies a man cut down by a wild saber, there he lies impaled by an arrow. From their wounds the blood fell like rain on our native soil, on our Russian fields. Who has fallen for Russia in noble death will be blessed by my kiss on his dead eyes, and for him, brave boy, who remained alive I will be a real wife and a friend in love. I will not be married to a handsome man, earthly charm and beauty vanish quickly and die. I will join the brave man, listen to this, brave warriors! (now to its conclusion with the entry of Nevskys in Pskov) In a great campaign Russia went to war. Russia defeated enemy troops. No enemy will live in our homeland. The soldiers that will come will be made Celebrate and sing, native mother Russia! Men must not live in our native land. The fishermen will never see Russian cities and fields, those who march on Russia will be condemned to death! In our great Russia, no enemy will live in our native Russia! Celebrate and sing, mother native Russia! All of Russia arrived in triumph at the celebration. Celebrate and rejoice, Russian motherland! - It should be noted that Prokofiev was under quite a bit of pressure from Stalin, if you want, you do well. This soundtrack was really approved by Stalin. For me there is an unmistakable beauty in the way we love this world and Nevsky speaks of a Hero whose God Like attributes provide for all participation in that love. A truly beautiful and furtive tale of Alexander Nevsky's story.
