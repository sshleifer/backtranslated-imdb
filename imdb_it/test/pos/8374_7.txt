An unusual film for an audience outside the United States. Lena Horne looks fabulous, as does Ralph Cooper. There is no added background of touch steps like in other musicals so you don't hear the beat of the touches which is a great realism. Music is turned off to hear what dance moves are there. Acting is a little rigged and the actors speak slowly, so that they think the film is older than it is. The costumes are bold for the time in the dance routine at the end. Often it seems to be part of an audience in a theater show. What decor you see is very modern which adds to the film the feeling of another worldliness. A must for all movie fans.
