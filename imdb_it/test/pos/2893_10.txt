"Rush in Rio" is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting DVDs I have purchased. Even though I'm a huge Rush fan of almost 20 years, I found this performance impeccable. The music is heavy and high-pitched (which sounds good on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile ... it's like they are able to capture every concert I've been to. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must; if anything, just to see the documentary "Boys in Brazil" (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). For any non-Rush fan, this DVD is a fun concert. Fans of Rush know the talent of these three Canadians. We've been firmly stopping them for years. I have shown this DVD (or parts of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or those who think Rush is less than good because they do not attract the pessimistic masses of rock (ie sex, drugs, and a frenzy drunk). The bottom line is that this DVD is worth every penny and more than worth the time to see it.
