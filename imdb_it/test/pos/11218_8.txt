An Eko-centric episode on "?" explores the consequences of the tragic events that shook the castaways in the previous one. While the main characters John, Locke, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley dealt with the incident in the hatch, Locke and Eko set off to find out where Henry was headed. Apparently Eko is engaged in a mission in an attempt to understand the symbol? that Locke had drawn on his sketch. We see flashes of Eko's life in Sydney as a priest who comes into contact with his brother through a stranger. We are also witnessing the tragedy that hit the hatch at room temperature, while Michael continues to remain a mystery. <br /> <br /> An episode of excellent LOST with many interesting laps.
