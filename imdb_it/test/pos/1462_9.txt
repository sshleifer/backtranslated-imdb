A thorny comic talk show by the creators of "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" The new series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, focuses on the manager, publisher and advertising agent of Garth, played by Richard Ayoade. <br /> <br /> The owner of the disco, the restaurateur, the publisher, the international playboy - Dean Learner is a trademark of a man. <br /> <br /> After his co-financed Garth Marenghi television program Channel 4, Darkplace now invites you to his luxurious penthouse for a whole new, fun and immensely elegant TV talk show. <br /> <br /> Man to Man with Dean Learner will feature all of Dean's remaining celebrity friends, as well as lots of live music and fine fish cuisine in a show that smells classy - but not of fish! <br /> <br /> I attended two of the live recordings and scored points. There are distinct comparisons with Alan Partridge's "Knowing Know you you you" in the layout, but Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness's unique writing style takes him to another level. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Darkplace then you can't miss me. Take it when it's aired in late summer
