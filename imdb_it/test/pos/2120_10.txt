My children, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoyed the film so much that they squirmed in their seats. It was good, old fashioned, rated G, family fun. This film was made for children ... someone really understands them. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and the other stars make their cameo appearances. <br /> <br /> As someone who lives in the city the fake "Big Texas" has been modeled, I can say that they made an honest and accurate portrait. The children looked like children, not like the superstars. I hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this. Go see it, then spread the word!
