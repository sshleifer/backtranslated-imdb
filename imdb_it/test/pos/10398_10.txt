Here is another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it came out for the first time (even in the capital of the metropolitan cinema LA!) For a couple of weeks and then it disappeared (the artisan public seems to have opted for its own special territory, where the old favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities. <br /> <br /> At first I was disappointed, I thought the rhythm was unbearably boring, and that man had lost a chance (for years Antonioni had found difficulty finding financing) in old age to add another masterpiece to his canon, but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how I reacted to Blow-Up and the Passenger at the beginning, I refused to judge until I saw the movie again.I came back the next day and I shouldn't have been surprised that the movie kept dragging me in, making me aware of the things I had thought about and lost count during my whole life , driving towards home, in a contemporary setting, points exposed for the first time about forty years ago in "L'Aventurra", forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristically and fascinatingly alienated by the tone (and rather comic in reality) that I've never had enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting on the colorful and imaginative swings on the windswept beach, with the time so wonderfully silvered, and the Eno / U2 track in the background that flowed at its own pace, had been my favorite; it still was, but now the whole movie was just as great! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex that only the eye of Antonioni seems able to grasp and communicate. The strange thing is that, although at first sight it looks like a softcore porn of some kind and has a lot of sex and the incredibly stupendous Sophie Marceau and many other international stars to distract you, this film is unmistakably that of Antonioni. but you will not perceive how deep it is until you have seen it a few times and become accustomed to its rhythm. For example, it's a pretty funny film with a deep sense of humor, something I didn't notice at the beginning, but was welcomed by another critic, and I was delighted to see more visions (4 before they shot it returned for more). If this film had been promoted well and people were driving to a certain extent on how to deal with it, I have no doubt that it would have succeeded on the artistic circuit like most of Antonioni's films of the 60s. But the 60s are gone and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half of its beauty will also be lost in a DVD version in letterbox format (if and when it is released). I invite all fans of the general or esoteric film to see "Beyond the Clouds" and add a touch of magic to the tragic.
