I've seen this movie probably more than 20 times. The jokes are now 10-15 years old but every time I look at it it makes me fall out of the chair. Two of the best actors Salman Khan and Aamir Khan play the main roles here. Although Aamir Khan is a much better actor and got the best role (smart guy) in the movie Salman Khan matches and sometimes behaves even better as the stupid guy. All the characters are memorable. This film is full of hilarious jokes and funny situations (probably a little too silly). Don't try to look for logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for a while. I promise it will be an experience to remember.
