Mexican Monster I agree is the weakest of Scooby Doo's modern films, mainly due to the weak plot and how predictable it all was. The Loch Ness monster, however, is a remarkable improvement, with wonderful animation, honestly Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good and the plot is well thought out. Also, there are some fantastic dialogues and the vocal acting was fabulous, with Casey Kasem a constant pleasure as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a leading role. In fact, my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two members of the vocal cast, with the exception of Easten whose accent seemed genuine, and somehow the Loch Ness monster was not as well designed as it could have been . Overall, a solid and fun Scooby Doo movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox
