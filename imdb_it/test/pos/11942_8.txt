I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10. It had an excellent storyline, and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, as well as the rest of the cast, did their parts well. <br /> <br /> Both Peter and Michele were in the teeth too long for the centuries that their characters had to be, and their children in the film, of course, would have been better suited to be their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I lost the first ten minutes of this movie, so I don't know how that body showed up after 25 years and I went back to Denny Traynor (the character of Peter Coyote), but I had no difficulty in resume the plot. <br /> <br /> Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is stunned when her longtime husband, Denny, is arrested for a murder in Oregon some 25 years earlier, a state in which Denny claims he never was. <br /> <br /> However, as the evidence accumulates against Denny, his story changes. Then his story changes again and again, until Barbara knows what to believe. <br /> <br /> Barbara decides, however, to go all the way to the mystery that revolves around the fatal time of Denny and a girl named Sherry has accepted a ride from a stranger named Wayne Kennedy, who has ended with a murder. <br /> <br /> I found the movie funny, well structured, and it made me think about what really happened between those three people. <br /> <br /> From what I saw during the credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.
