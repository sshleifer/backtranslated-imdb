Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the largest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed on humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Academy Award-winning stars like Dolemite, the worst cat in the universe. Clearly he doesn't take any jive from any turkey (I'm unfortunately a turkey myself) and he shows it with his powers of rapping, pimping and karate chopping. This is the blaxploitation at its best, a brilliant example of its kind with its low budget, errors of continuity and hatred of mouse soup that eats exaggerated expectoration. The real Godfather of Rap (not this new absurdity of Ali) Moore is something of a juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow managing to be the most charismatic actor of the 70s, and that's something he says. This is HIGHLY recommended to people, if not for the one-liners alone.
