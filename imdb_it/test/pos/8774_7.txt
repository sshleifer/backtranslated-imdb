Overall, this is a funny and strange film. Don't try to make sense. There are more holes in history than a computer could keep up with, but Robert Cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this "Fugitive" story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the popular TV show and then the 1993 film, this fugitive is not looking for a man with one arm, but a two-armed Nazi saboteur named "Frank Fry". Cummings ("Barry Kane") is blamed when a defense plant explodes in Los Angeles and goes on the run looking for the man who did it (Fry) to clear his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") enters the story, and starts to get bogged down a bit with a bit of a mushy dialogue. The director Alfred Hitchcock often did it with his female characters, to the point that I wonder if he had the faintest idea how the woman spoke. Lane's character here was a little lame. <br /> <br /> Actually, the villains played by Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") were the best, in my opinion ... .. simply fascinating. Kruger's acting and dialogue were particularly good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, but you've seen Hitchcock's famous "North By Northwest", you'll laugh at the finale and you'll really enjoy it. Instead of a climatic scene on Mount Rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the State of Freedom. As usual, Hitchcock's camera angles are fantastic and fun to watch.
