Fires on the plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a WWII movie that ultimately does not show the allies fighting the powers of the aces, but the Japanese fight and fight for their lives in the Philippines. The main name of the characters is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and is a soldier who leaves his regiment because of his illness. All he has about him is a grenade, his gun and some potatoes. In this way, he is trying to reach the hospital to get a doctor and a cure for his illness. But since the hospital rejected him and is destroyed, a long walk begins. Throughout the film, Tamura remains a little coward, but very civilized, when the other soldiers become more animal-like by using their basic instincts to survive. Tamura is still human and will not degrade. A scene that has influenced me a lot to think positively and differently about this war movie is when Tamura enters a completely deserted Phillipino village. There, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of Japanese soldiers piled up in front of a church. This makes Tamura thinking and even more scared than it already is. This shows that the soldier is not a courageous killing machine, but a servant of superior and human beings, above all. After leaving the corpses, two Phillipinos (a couple or a brother and a sister: a very intimate relationship) return to the village to retrieve their salt deposit. The main character of the film wants to be friendly at first, even if he approaches them with his gun, but he shoots the woman once he starts screaming. Her brother / boyfriend / husband runs away out of fear and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino. He doesn't hit him. After Tamura collects the sack of salt, something very precious, he drops his gun into a river. This gesture is very important for understanding Tamura's profiling and Kon Ichikawa / Shohei Ooka's war. Comparing this film with other World War II films, it is not at all typical. Obviously all films have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. It expresses all that is human: it is manipulated, it is weak, it is frightened, it has hope. This is typical for Japanese films of World War II and for Japanese society. Since World War II is not a topic discussed in Japanese society, the Japanese will probably put Japanese in World War II in the role of the victim. This victimization is also very visual in this film. One example is Tamura, another the piled up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one, when Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting there for them and shoot all the Japanese soldiers who have equipment worse and are fed worse and have no health facilities or similar. In my personal conclusion I must say that it is worth seeing this film to finally see a film on the other side of the usual. Furthermore, it has no nationalistic propaganda that can easily be built. Once you have seen the film completely, you will be able to see the horrors of the Second World War in its full extent.
