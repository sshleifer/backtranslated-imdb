I tend to get angry when I hear about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he is classified as a talented filmmaker, only to amaze and disgust the entire audience with images of pure blood. True, his films contain more explicit filth and disease than your average American traditional production, but his films are always far-reaching and the textures are macabre morbidly. Do not Torture in Duckling is another story! This film is a real jewel of Italian shock cinema! Let me easily call this film a masterpiece, it's an old-fashioned mystery that includes all the brilliant aspects of real horror. The film shows the search for an inhuman serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of 3 young boys are found, horribly mutilated. There are a lot of pseudo-crazy people in the city, but every path leads to nothing. Among the suspects there are a greedy bum and a frightening woman, obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. As a true mind, Fulci knows he finds the right scary tone for his film. It portrays the town as a claustrophobic and ineluctable setting of macabre events, supported by a dizzying soundtrack. Fulci also develops as a brilliant narrator here. The script is always one step ahead of you and the complex plot will take you away more than once. In other words, it is a unique mystery (the mystery of the murder of a murder). The gore is not presented as grotesque and explicit as in the later Lucio milestones (including the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and the New York Ripper), although there are still some sequences of nauseated and hard to see shocks shown. <br /> <br /> Not torturing a duckling is the most compelling and effective result that Lucio Fulci has ever carried out and easily ranks among the greatest Italian horror films ever made. Right next to the masterpieces by Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from beginning to end, some aspects of the plot are frighteningly realistic and the tension is adrenaline rushing through every moment! A must see for horror fans and a top priority for lovers of Italian shocks!
