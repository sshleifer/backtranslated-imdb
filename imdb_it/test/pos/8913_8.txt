There's a lot more to this film than it looks. If you are looking for revolutionary originality or easy comedy, you will be disappointed. But for 90 minutes of fun, it's great. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is accurate and precise. The sex scenes, which a comment deciphers as free, are anything but - each gesture contributes to the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly lovable humans. But the film makes an honest effort to show their interactions in an honest light, without being sensationalistic (at least not by urban standards of the early 21st century). And there are many fun moments.
