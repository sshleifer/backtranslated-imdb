what a refreshing change from the PG movies with teenage girls jumping in and out of bed, young high school students who count how many girls can "connect" with, children who drink, do drugs, etc. etc. etc. Carl Hiaasen has written so many books that they are fun but hardly classical literature. but he has finally written something that middle school children want to read. And this film sends a message to the children that perhaps they can make a difference, that perhaps their voices can be heard. Shot in South Florida, the scenery is beautiful, natural and REAL. Who cares if it's predictable, and a little trivial. So it was FREE WILLY and look how well he did. This is a good family film .......... a rare breed.
