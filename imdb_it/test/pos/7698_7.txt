The plot of "Sally of the Sawdust" is the usual melodramatic stuff - an orphan, from rags to rich - but the film rises above most silences thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> This is not , of course, DW Griffith's masterpiece, but showcases its cinematic savvy in full maturity. He uses all his innovations, which are techniques we take for granted now: close-ups, transverse cut, a mobile camera and the ability to change acting from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety. <br /> <br /> W. C. Fields shows off his skills, not his signature, but his extraordinary dexterity as a physical comedian. He makes some act of inventive juggling, cut too short to be fully appreciated, and some very skilled pickpockets, but it seems that every object that comes within reach is manipulated by comic effect: hat, stick, car roof, dog, money . It is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Carol Dempster. Much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also very comical. She was 22 at the time, a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and embarrassment that may not be entirely convincing, but really involves the eye when it is on the screen-- especially when dancing. It is not a beauty - even if it is positively bright in that scene in which it is pulled up like a sister Talmadge - but its simplicity only increases Sally's character, especially in the many moments in which she shows an evident affection for Fields his guardian / "father." Few, if any, Hollywood artists could compete with Fields when it came to comedy, but Griffith gives his protagonist every chance to meet her co-star, and Dempster absolutely supports her.
