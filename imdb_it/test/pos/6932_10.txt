Todd Sheets has created one of the greatest Zombie BUDGET BUDGET films. The story is great, the blood is great, the psychopaths are evil! Yet the film is imperfect by its petty dialogue and sometimes slow images. <br /> <br /> Despite this ZB2 offers what any Zombie movie should, gore, good storyline, fast-paced adventure in the macarbe. If only the MR sheets had been given a budget of 100,000 this movie would come out of EVERY Zombie movie, even the Almighty Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> But over time it improves and earns more goes into your pocket. Thus allowing this man this modern Genius to perfect his vision. <br /> <br /> Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of his big trampolines when he is on top of Gore Mountain
