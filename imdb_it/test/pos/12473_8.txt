SPOILERS The famous Edgar Rice character Burroughs has been adapted thousands of times for the screen until a person's thirst is extinguished, particularly during the thirties and forties in Hollywood. Its producers made Tarzan one of the most successful movie characters. Several years later, Hugh Hudson decided to create a more ambitious version of the ape-man and is a more natural, wilder and more down-to-earth Tarzan who gives away here. Hudson skilfully avoids the clich√©s that you usually give Tarzan, like his famous scream or his friendly pet, Cheetah. Not only that, we are far from Hollwood's designed and invented character, but we are also far from the set of the film used to create his stories. The film was made partly in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film introduces two obvious parts: the first that takes place in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his foster friends, monkeys and considers himself their lord. But ignore its true origins. The second in England, where Tarzan discovers English society. Ian Holm embodies the bond between the two sides and Hudson avoids anything that could make the film fall into ridicule thanks to a clever script. In fact, Holm teaches Lambert the basic rules of good manners so that he behaves properly in English society and the result works. Also, in the second part, nobody ever laughs at Tarzan and he is even very appreciated. As for the end, it is a bitter and happy ending. Happy because Tarzan returns to the jungle and meets his close adoptive relatives again. But also bitter, because this return home means that the Greystoke line will not be secured and is condemned to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here, his first (and last?) Great role. Unfortunately, it will never match the result of his performance in this film and will play in poor and insipid action movies. However, as I said before, a clever script, a rare quality performance, some impressive natural scenarios (both the jungle and the English countryside and we get a wonderful movie. It's also an excellent rereading of a popular novel. It only rated barely (6/10)?
