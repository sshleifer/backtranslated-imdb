Footprints is a very interesting film that is quite difficult to categorize. "The psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female lead, Alice Cespi, discovers she has not remembered anything from the last three days. The only clue he has is a torn photo of a hotel. She is also haunted by a recurring and vivid dream about a science fiction film she believes she saw many years ago. In the search for the truth behind his amnesia he doesn't trust anyone, but little by little it becomes obvious that he visited the city where the hotel is located first. This is an exciting film whose main virtue is that it is practically impossible to predict how the events will take place and, in particular, how it will end. The unusual solitude of the main character and the unreliability of all the others make the good old paranoid feeling present throughout the film, while the beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this film visually attractive. The important part of the one and only Nicoletta Elmi, the star of the hateful child of the all-time favorite Italian horror, is an extra bonus.
