It doesn't matter in which country your In you have to buy this show, Sure It is Australian and if you've ever seen any of our comedy attempts are pretty much sucked but with chasers they are not boring forty-year-olds who make bad word games are a team of people who they talk about current affairs (practically in Australia) they make fun of our shit announcements, they make fun of our politicians and so on. <br /> <br /> The boys also did a show in 2002 called Cnnnn which was not as much as the War, which had only started this year, so everything they talk about is current news that is really good considering no matter how tedious or tragic it is to try to make some humorous light shine on things.
