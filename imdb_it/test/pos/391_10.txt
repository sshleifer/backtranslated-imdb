Beautiful .... this one word sums up all this film. Everything from cinematography, directing, acting ... brilliant. At any point in the film, you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or "artistic madness" as some people would say. I assure you that after a vision, "Bobbycrush" will be stuck in your head. I know from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes very well with the tone and rhythm of the film. Be grateful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make movies that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) images.
