I can't believe this isn't a huge cult success. Perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a stupid pop band produced by the Beatles factory, refused to see it. That cynicism has probably covered him forever. Not making this mistake _Head_ is a fantastic film that most open minded people will appreciate. He is very funny and very intelligent (and very funny).
