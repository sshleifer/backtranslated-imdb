Who could think of suicide in a way that is palpable for everyone? I saw the SXSW movie on its premiere and it turned out to be the best movie there by far. Yes, it is deformed and bizarre, but it makes sense in the world that the filmmaker (Michael Parness) creates. If you have not laughed (most have done all), then you don't understand it and this is a real shame. In particular, Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals a lot of scenes and the chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The film resembles one of Harold and Maude, but not really, it takes one bizarre spin after another, and they all make sense in this crazy world in which we all live. I stayed (like most) for the Q&A later and what was great was to hear that the same things I thought in my head about why things "happened" are the reasons they did . I don't think you can say very badly about the movie unless you understand it. I think I understood it and it seemed that everyone else did too. The film is nicknamed a suicidal comedy, but it has a lot of heart, a lot of laughter and offers many hopes, yet it does not avoid the horrors of suicide. A nice little movie that should attract attention when released, which hopefully can happen sooner rather than later.
