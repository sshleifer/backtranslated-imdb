As I stated earlier this year, in my review of Swordfish (which was scripted by this producer / director / film producer, Skip Woods), this is a good movie. It ranks very high on my crime list between Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically I think this film is for me what Reservoir Dog has been for many people - a cult classic - although I prefer to compare it to Pulp Fiction. I mean, I never really liked Tarantino's first effort, but I certainly liked it as much as I like Pulp Fiction, because it simply has everything a classic needs. A great story and good actors. OK, the budget may not be as big as for example Godzilla, The Avengers of Mission to Mars, but surely as hell beats life from those movies (and many others). <br /> <br /> The story of this film is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane), who settled with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly an old friend of his arrives interrupting his life, revealing his secrets and turning his day into a living (and even bloody) hell. <br /> <br /> The film is very original and quite bloody / sexually colored. So, based on that first and last quality, I can assure you that if you like this movie, you will also like Swordfish, which obviously has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this one, but it's just as good (though not as bloody and not quite as sexually colored). I saw this movie for the second time last night and loved it (again). I mean that all the characters and the actors are good, even if I have to give very big credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and they had the best characters) in the film. I should also thank Skip Woods for being so imaginative and original. Brutal, sexual, offensive ??? Perhaps, but certainly as nice heck and a thrill to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
