I've always liked this movie and I'm glad it's finally available on DVD, so more viewers will be able to see what I've been telling them all these years. Story is about a virgin from high school named Gary (Lawrence Monoson) who works in a pizzeria as a deliveryman and goes with her friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary notes Karen (Diane Franklin) who is the new girl at school and gives her a ride one morning and is now totally in love. That evening at a party he sees Rick with Karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but does not tell anyone about his true feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if he can borrow his empty grandmothers at home, but Gary makes an excuse in so that Rick can't take Karen alone. But one night Rick brags about Gary who nailed her to the soccer field and Gary gets mad. A few days later in the school library, Gary sees that Rick and Karen argue and asks Karen what's wrong. She tells him she's pregnant and that Rick dumped her. Gary helps her by taking her to her grandparents' house and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen how he really feels about her and seems receptive to her feelings, but later at his birthday party he joins Karen and Rick again. Gary leaves without the girl! This film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is. No matter how good you are, you don't necessarily have to have a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Boaz Davidson who would become a rather competent action director and did two things well with this film. First, he made sure that there was a lot of free nudity so that this was marketable for young males who usually go to these films. Secondly, he finished the film with young Gary without Karen and I think that the males in the audience can relate to being screwed regardless of how much they try to win a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is silly and unbridled but it's fun and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the movie like sexy Carmela. Moritz was always a popular "B" level actress and you could remember her in "Someone Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", this one has a very good soundtrack and the songs played reflect what is happening in the story. But at the center of this film are two excellent performances by Monoson and Franklin. There is the nudity required by Franklin but she continues to transmit the pain of a girl who is discharged at a crucial moment. She has always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film. But this is still the story of Monoson and you can't help but try this guy. When the film ends, it's his performance that stays with you. It's a solid acting job that makes this more than just a comedy for kids. Even with the silly scenarios of teenagers trying to have sex, this movie still manages to get what it wants. The underrated comedy hits the bullseye.
