I thought Besson's film could do without the words that few films were able to do with them; Capture real human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, setbacks, hopes and desires are so honestly proven that you wonder if he is not acting at all. The film has a limited budget and is obviously made without the pomp and glamor offered by most Hollywood productions, but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi label and become a real drama. However, defining this film exclusively as a drama would lead away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. It is true that this type of film has been made before, but I think this captures the joys and sorrows of that kind of world perhaps better than any other.
