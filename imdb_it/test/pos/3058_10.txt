I saw this film when it was released in smaller theaters in the UK some 50 years ago; and the memory remains of a great soundtrack, and the tragedy of the plot. I saw it again on video recently. The soundtrack was poor and the image grainy; but it is one of the two films I saw again the next day, the other is the Gladiator. The theme of music is intensely tragic and from the beginning we know that it announces failure or death. Definitely one of the best shows by George Sanders; like a man working in the black market to get reimbursed for what he lost in the war, but nemesis is waiting; Patricia Roc plays a refugee from Eastern Europe eaten with despair. He is attracted to her, selflessly wants to help her and then falls in love with her, but is too proud and hurt to accept help. Their love destroys him, and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall), who brought the nemesis. The plot is of complex intertwined destinies, in which the secondary characters are not what they appear to be. This is like a movie, which has disappointed critics and fought at the box office; but for the teenager who saw it, and the retired gentleman who saw it again, it's one of the greatest films (taking into account his age) whose story is more like an opera.
