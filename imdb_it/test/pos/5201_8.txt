This film tries to escape the typical 'I'm fighting because I'm forced to defend the homeland. The NAZIs are all bad, I am against them "(typical of German war movies). How? We don't talk too much about it and I refer only to the war and the prisoner of war. However I would like to see a German film that would be something between end of Come And See and the "bad NAZI" by Das Boot. I say this because, excluding this factor, German films are the best ones depicting the Second World War and the German part. You can easily see some of the German hierarchical relationships, very much different from those of the US military. <br /> <br /> This is a film that tries to get a real view of what Stalingrad was, and I wasn't there, and I doubt most people were there now "But if I had chosen a film that would describe this battle, it certainly wouldn't have been the Enemy At The Gates. Why do I say this? Because even the best soldiers are not heroes, and given the conditions they can consider their lives instead of their homeland." This applies to all ranks, and eventually see von Paulus setting the example.
