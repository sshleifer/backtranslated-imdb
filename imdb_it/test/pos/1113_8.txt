The most vivid picture of the strangeness of a small town I've seen for a long time - and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This work seems to have been done "under the radar" and, in reality, it is a completely fascinating work, which has a largely invisible worldliness in recent Austs. film making. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is rather slow and strange - it seems to wander around here and there is not really sure whether it is a thriller or a 'head film'. But the stunning aspect of Alex Frayne's film is his iron fist, his ruthless direction. It never falters, it is highly controlled, precise and absolutely self-confident. Cinematography is among the most artistic, beautiful and lyrical I've ever seen. Sound is all psychological, music builds tension. <br /> <br /> With the third act, the story has spread and the episodes collide and converge - don't try to reconstruct the puzzle of the last 20 minutes, it's a bit of an impostor - but at that time the film has a bit of a trance, a kind of hypnosis, and you've been sold a riddle - which has no real answer.
