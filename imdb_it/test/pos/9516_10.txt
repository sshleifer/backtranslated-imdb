Although not a Greek, I had a permanent interest in the Eastern Empire. His fall in 1453 was the greatest loss to Christianity in its entire history. Yet, while the Paschal Empire is not a much-discussed topic in American intellectual circles, the United States has not simply imitated the Byzantine gold public architecture, the United States is very absorbed in the Byzantine historical cycle and has now faced many of the crises that have involved certain people in a Middle Eastern extraction on which it is said that there is a slight tendency to excessive exuberance on religious questions that humiliated the great Byzantium. I wonder if the loss of the ability to speak clearly is the first road sign on the road to disaster. John Romer is to be attributed not only for his excellent production, but also for his joyous enthusiasm for the subject that is more refreshing. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for Americans who like political correctness.
