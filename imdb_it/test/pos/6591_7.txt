Ernesto is a man who lives to deceive other solid citizens of their hard-earned money. Together with Manco, an old man with so much experience, he extracts capers that allow him to live well, but this does not make him a rich man in any way. Federico enters, an older man who has more experience in the art of deception. Together with the young Ernesto they demonstrate a winning combination. That lasts only until Pilar, Federico's former love interest, appears in the picture. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film directed by Miguel Bardem, is light in tone and pleasant to sit on. Other caper films made better have been made with much smarter plots than this, but the film is easy to take and sometimes has many fun situations. <br /> <br /> This viewer will see Federico Luppi in everything, even reading the phone book! He is an actor. We had the privilege of seeing him in the Buenos Aires scene doing an excellent job before his international film career. Like Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible to imagine someone better in his role. Ernesto Alterio's son Ernesto is a young actor who promises to have a great career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun while getting involved with these scammers. Even Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is as good as Manco.
