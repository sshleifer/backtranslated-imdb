The Reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be. A moving story, told simply through well-written dialogues, beautifully painted images, a score that seamlessly intertwines through narration, and characters portrayed with care and grace. <br /> <br /> I saw this film at a festival where other films and interesting ideas were shown. But none of the other short films had all the elements of the great film production that came together in a film like The Reader did. The Reader attracted the attention of all the festival goers in the room and for 10 minutes took us into the emotional life of the characters. Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful film and I hope to see more from this director be shorter or maybe a feature film.
