An interesting film with Jordana Brewster as a young woman traveling in Europe in an attempt to find out what happened to her older sister (Cameron Diaz), mysteriously dead years before. Brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic compliments, like finding her lovingly and starting a relationship with the much older boyfriend of his dead sister (Christopher Eccleston). However, mostly good. GRADE: B
