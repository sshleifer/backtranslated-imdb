The RKO Radio Pictures became a true classic in 1947 and even managed to get the nomination for the Best Picture Academy Award. The acting, the script, the continuity, etc., are almost perfect; and the story is worth the spectator's 82 minutes. Although the soft image of the true story of life making the murder victim a Jew rather than a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual - such disguises never work, maybe they were not meant to do it. <br /> <br /> I could choose some details, but just for fun. There was no night-time cinema in Washington, DC, in 1947 --- and if there were, I would like Robert Mitchum and his friend not to talk about the show. There were no bars where a GI could take a pretty blonde. NONE! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he would have to buy the Daily News; not the Times-Hearald, Evening Star and certainly not the Washington Post who knows nothing. But these little things do not take anything away from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from the absolute lack of a musical score, except during the closing credits. I've only seen it in some movies. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, from 1995 comes with an introduction to the TMC in which some liberal talk about what the public was "ready for" in 1947 ... blah, blah, blah! As if that madman had business to judge his superiors. I would say that the ex-GIs of 1947 - the Greatest Generation - were much smarter - and had better values ​​- than some commentators, film historians or other essays in 1995. Put on a sock!
