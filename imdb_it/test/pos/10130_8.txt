'Radio' is a beautiful film based on a true story of the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy, nicknamed 'Radio', and the football coach of T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as a Radio! I would never imagine seeing him in a serious performance, especially since most of the films I watch with him are comedies. And Harris is as exceptional as Harold Jones, but this actor is fantastic, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> The young man mentally called James Robert Kennedy, always walks around the T.L. Hanna High School, without disturbing anyone and almost not noticed. One day, when the soccer ball approaches him, he decides to stay with the ball, due to the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players on the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys I've ever met. One day, Cash decides to punish James, making fun of him with other football players and even tying him up. <br /> <br /> When coach Jones discovers that horrible action, he gets angry and punishes the whole team, deciding for this day to help James, who gets the nickname 'Radio' for his passion for radios in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows how Radio becomes an assistant adept, helping the team to train despite the difficulties of the players, and also to get respect from basically all the people living in the small town. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film for all those who want to see a true and beautiful story. He has a life lesson, especially showing us how a person can make a difference, even if it is not what we call "normal". The radio has a big heart and is incapable of hating anyone, and that's something we should all apply to our daily lives.
