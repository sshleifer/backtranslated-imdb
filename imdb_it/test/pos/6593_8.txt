I also looked at this at Petersfield Hampshire elementary school around 1975. The strange thing is that I still think about it from time to time (I'm 40) The big question that runs through the whole series (I don't know how many episodes 6 ??) was the identity of the person riding the bike! "In the past I asked friends of this series and they have no idea what I'm talking about and I think it's a kind of strange dream I had. I've never understood the educational benefit of this so far, but I thought it was great "But slightly scary. I seem to remember that there was a pause of some sort in the middle of each episode. I have no idea why. I'd like to see it again. Got a short clip on the BBC cult website."
