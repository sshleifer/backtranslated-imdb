The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogues and dances. This typical musical of the rising stars has a neglected plot, even for 1944, but because of the actors it's still fun to watch. Hayworth is not even a dancer, but has a very "inexperienced" charm that fits her character. Kelly plays her usual role as a caring author while Silvers offers a lot of self-irony and laughter. The film can also be very serious at times. It is not a must see, but recommended if you like actors.
