Moving Bollywood epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who finds out she was adopted and is determined to find her natural mother. The main success of the film is the performance of P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the film is very good. There are also some really good songs, especially the number that introduces the protagonist. Unfortunately, the second half of the film, which takes place in war-torn Sri Lanka, looks like a completely different and disappointing film. It is great for explosions and special effects, with soldiers and rebels from Sri Lanka dodging grenades, running from fireballs and being yanked on by acrobatic wires. The whole film can offer as intuition cheap trivia like "One day peace must come" and "Maybe children will find a way". The final sequence, where the daughter and mother get together, is good, but so exaggerated with the music and a timely downpour that looks like a crook. I know, I know, it's all in the Bollywood style. But this is a story in which great moments simply distract from the simple, powerful central story. Sometimes even Bollywood could use some restriction.
