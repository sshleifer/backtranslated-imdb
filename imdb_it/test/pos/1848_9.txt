I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year intern from my office (OK - it was quiet after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique storyline, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog continues to wait at the door. Isn't he part of every one of us just like that dog after someone we love dies? <br /> <br /> I love old people in the restaurant too - they remind me of some of the older people in southern New England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. And I love marriage in the end. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is great in this movie - and Bonnie Hunt would have to win a prize for everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie: create more movies!
