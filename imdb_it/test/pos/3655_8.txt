On one level, Hari Om is a film that uses a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a family story: the curious westerner explores the mysterious Orient. But at its core, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Isa) determined to live life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with Bollywood aspirations, from very different cultures, their growing attraction for every other, and the beautiful mad chaos that is India today. The gap between them can never be bridged, but the director manages to bring the two closest to the limit of a possible deal without damaging the plausibility of the story. India and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative, and except for the main characters, the roles are interpreted in a magnificent and persuasive way by locals recruited during the production of the film, while they are traveling between Indian cities and villages that form the setting of the film. One of the biggest negatives for this viewer: a Keystone Kops chases close to the conclusion of the film while Hari flees against the mafia intending to collect the gambling debt. But the final scenes in which Isa and Hari greet are moving and unforgettable.
