Dirty Dancing is one of my favorite movies. I only saw it twice on ABC because I didn't have the chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea that Jennifer Gray was 27 when he shot the film because he was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some Hollywood women, he has a very flat chest, which is why I was so easily deceived about his age. So, both physically and emotionally, Gray brings out a teenager very well. I also loved dancing - who wouldn't? Both times I've seen Dirty Dancing, I keep looking for dance lessons. I also like the soundtrack and I recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I would like to see it in my acting class, and I will ask my teacher at some point if there is any part of the film he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the things that made us look last year. And the finish was absolutely FANTASTIC. This is one of the best moments of the film. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I'm looking forward to going back to school because of Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence from a film with that kind of title?
