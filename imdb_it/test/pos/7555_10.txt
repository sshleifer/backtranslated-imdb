A wonderful film about people. I first saw Four Friends when it was initially screened in theaters and I've seen it many times since. If I don't watch it while it's on TV, I'll go with my friends and rent it. Invariably, the people I watched this movie find it funny. He takes care of friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50s and 60s. It is very funny and moving, it deals with the first love (and the first sex), racism, war, politics, the entire 1960s. It can also be quite dramatic. If you like movies about people, this is definitely worth it.
