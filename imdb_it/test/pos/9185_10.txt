Last night I had the great pleasure of seeing the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith has done a phenomenal job in a role he is not always associated with. He has shown once and for all that he does not need to hold a gun to be a great actor in a film. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit I always liked "The King of Queens", but this role really brought it to light, and I hope to see it on the big screen much more in the near future. The film was fun and adorable and I would recommend it to any guy as the best dating movie imaginable. The mix of comedy, romance and drama made me feel complete. It's nothing like most "flea movies" in the sense of tears and sadness, but it holds its own and I think it can be equally appreciated by both males and females. I urge all couples to see this particular movie, but even if you're not involved with someone, you could pick up some fantastic ideas from Hitch. <br /> <br /> TWO BIG BIG THUMBS ON !!!
