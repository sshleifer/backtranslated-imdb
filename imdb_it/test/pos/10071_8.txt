I'm not kidding. Yes, "Who's That Girl" has the distinction of being one of a series of Madonna movies that they bombed, but actually I liked this movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan". In "Susan", the character of Madonna is relegated to being the second violin of Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work. Do not disrespect Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna interprets this extravagant and outrageous character, made only in an 80s style. Although today it may seem "tasteful", this is actually one of Madonna's best films and one of her most undervalued. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former prisoner who is sent to jail for a crime she did not commit. She was released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of taking her to prison to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two come together, then madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as a wealthy businessman who has a large mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest (???) on the roof. <br /> <br /> This movie parodies everything. Rich people, squalid characters living in Harlem and totally destroying the Rolls-Royce of Louden, the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne in the city, and Dunne's boyfriend, Wendy Worthington, who presumably slept with every New York City taxi driver (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend, Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Funny! In addition, Dunne is also responsible for a rare breed of leopard that resembles "Bringing Up Baby". In addition, Madonna had a large platinum blonde 80s back then and the film has a great soundtrack. Throw all this into the mix and you have the WTG laziness. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of impassive acting. There are times in the movie where he says a totally straight and surprisingly joke, turns out to be fun! This is how some of the best comedy films should be interpreted - directly. Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a pity she didn't choose to do it. She later became much more controversial and took on more obscure and sex-laden roles in the films "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game". <br /> <br /> Some people say that Madonna can't act, and that's okay, people are entitled to their opinion, but I think the real problem is that people can't see the difference between Madonna playing a character in a film, instead I still see only Madonna and this is the main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her films. It's still a fun 80s comedy. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you won't like it, so I'd recommend it mainly to Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and like it! <br /> <br /> Interesting note: one of Madonna's friends in her early 80s at New York club, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of the Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band groups.
