Sri Lanka ... it's not a country I've ever thought much about, I have to admit. I didn't even know it was close to India, not to mention the fact that there has been a bloody civil war since 1983. It seems that the Tamil minority rebels have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years, causing many deaths and suffering spread on the island. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman's latest film, A PECK ON THE CHEEK, tells the story of a young girl named Amudha, who is separated from her Sri Lankan parents by the war and raised by a young Indian couple . Amudha is a brilliant and spiteful girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. Even if her adoptive parents love her as much as possible, and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children, Amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman is probably the best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides a story about terrorism and politics within a love story (or is it the opposite?). An interview on dandelion lives in a similar territory, but it is perhaps more ambitious in the terrain it covers. The central theme that links the film is the love between all the various members of a family, particularly between a child and his adoptive parents. It is a sincere and open look at feelings, which can be extremely moving and touching at times and rather painful for others. It is an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somehow idealized but still behave in a very human way. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around 9 years, Amudha, interpreted with charm and vivacity by the young actress P.S. Keerthana in his first and only acting role. She is a princess and a monster, always in trouble, but so disarmingly charming no one can remain angry with her for long. The young actress is perfectly chosen for the role, and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her. <br /> <br /> A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name that I was rather unprepared for the intensity of the experience. That is, such a small act has never had such an enormous emotional impact. The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore themes that are not often discussed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The management of Mani Ratman is superb, very secure and mature - the most sophisticated work I have seen from this director yet. The film is visually very elegant, with some excellent shots and images. A.R. Rahman provides the soundtrack of the film, which does not match his classical music DIL SE or BOMBAY (based on first impressions at least), but still shows his great musical talent. <br /> <br /> I am not aware of any DVDs coming out for the film - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. Production is a truly world-class endeavor, and I'm sure it will be popular with Western audiences and will begin to receive more exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
