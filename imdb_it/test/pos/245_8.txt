Rita Hayworth is right where she should be - as a "Cover Girl" in this 1944 Technicolor movie with Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful showgirl, Rusty, who works in a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go out for oysters with Genius (Silvers), the club comedian. Everyone hates oysters, but they are looking for a pearl. When they find one, all three will have luck, they believe. <br /> <br /> Auditions Rusty and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - starts with the other competitors because the owner of the magazine (Kruger) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl who once loved, who reveals himself be Rusty's grandmother. Once she becomes the cover girl, the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true. Danny wants her to have his success, but at the same time he realizes he has lost her. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern, with Rita nicknamed by Martha Mears. Rita is at her best to play both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. For a woman so sexy, desirable and wonderful, she was apparently very insecure and always under the control of dominant men. None of these ever showed on the screen, nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star. It is one of the true goddesses and has brought to life all that it has done. Gene Kelly has a serious role here, but he has many chances to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very amiable and fun as the cartoonist and best friend at home. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice film, with no obscure points. The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty should choose between a successful career and the man he loves. When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays herself in the film, talks about getting married, she is warned by her boss not to do it, which is too necessary for modeling. We are not told if Rusty continues with his career or returns to work with Danny - but all the signs seemed to indicate the Brooklyn club. Why couldn't he have them both? Nevertheless, you can't beat "Cover Girl" for the best entertainment, beautiful colors, lovely music, great energy, beautiful performances and its most fabulous resource, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
