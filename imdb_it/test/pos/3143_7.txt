Perry Mason: The fatal fashion case sees Perry and Della Street in New York receiving an award from the American Bar Association. An unbeaten test record should get a recognition that I would think. However, a friend of Della's, the fashion editor Diana Muldaur is arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper and in fact Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale attend a clash between the two in an elegant restaurant. <br /> <br /> two rivals have something that makes Hedda and Louella look like school girls. Of course Harper has a number of other people who loved her the same way. <br /> <br /> The same author also met a stylist who could reveal the individual. This launches Perry with his trusty investigative lawyer, William Moses in an alliance with some mobsters. It seems that the designer was a cousin of a mafia boss who also wants to find justice in their usual way. <br /> <br /> One thing I couldn't get is when Moses and mobster Robert Clohessy tracked the perpetrator, I can't believe the police were not vigorously pursuing the case. Of course, Clohessy has access to sources that the cops simply don't have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this particular Mason voice is Scott Baio as the rather self-assured young man Assistant district attorney who introduces himself to Raymond Burr said how he studied all his cases and he didn't see the time to beat it. Foolish Boy. <br /> <br /> In fact my favorite scene is Burr and Baio in a sidebar with the judge. Baio wanted to reopen his case and add a witness and was ready and prepared with precedents. Burr takes him by surprise and says he has no objections to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the baton at cross-examination. Absolutely priceless. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best thing about this particular Perry Mason film and should only be seen for him if nothing else.
