If you believe that a certain war movie can really make you feel the war, you must see "Letyat zhuravli" (called "The Cranes are Flying" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the brink of World War II. They are walking along the waterfront, watching the cranes fly by, when the war begins. Boris is promptly sent to war. Veronika hides with a family and ends up marrying her son, whom she doesn't love. Boris, meanwhile, continues to trot across the countryside, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war, until the energy runs out. When Veronika - who works in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it, until Boris's body arrives home on one of the trains. At the same time, the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and that the allied powers have won the war; The Soviet Union has lost 27 million citizens, but it is the beginning of a new era. <br /> <br /> This film did a great job demonstrating the human impact of war not only on the battlefield, but also on how it affected the civilian population. This is definitely a movie that everyone should see.
