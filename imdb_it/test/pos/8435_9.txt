China Syndrome is a fast-paced and not slow or boring thriller, as some people tend to say. The transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension accumulated in the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole two hours. Jack Lemmon is great, as always, as the somewhat nervous plant operator and Jane Fonda again manages to bring some emotions into the story. You can view this film as a political statement of the time, or just as an intelligently made thriller. In both cases it is certainly worth looking at.
