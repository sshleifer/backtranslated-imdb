Together with In the Army!, This ranks as one of Pauly Shore's best films, if such a thing exists. While the entire West Coast-meets-Midwest-culture-clash is nothing new, this film proves to make the story a little more fun with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh Shore. While the change in values ​​probably would have gone the other way, the whole concept was pretty funny. Not only was Shore's interaction with the family exhilarating, but also Carla Gugino and Tiffani-Amber Theissen (who will always have amber in my book) in two enchanting and early roles. One of those movies I have no problem watching when it's on TV.
