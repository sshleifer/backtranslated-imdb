As with some of the best movies and series, I came across this rather by accident. It was late, a storm was in full force outside and I was sitting comfortably on the sofa when I flipped through a channel that was about to show one of the episodes. I simply wanted to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to end up on another channel before returning to some sitcoms. About an hour and a half later I remembered my decision and I was so happy that I didn't. Needless to say, I made sure I saw all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah has been brilliant in almost everything I've seen him and he doesn't disappoint here either. All other cast members also do stellar work. My favorite (apart from John Hannah, of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only downside of this series is the limited amount of episodes. Only 8 with JH itself and 1 additional with someone else. I'd like to see McCallum on the screens, even though he should be with JH!
