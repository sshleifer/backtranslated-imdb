Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I believe) DVD label specializing in smtty and excessively violent cult movies ?? mostly Italians - from glorious times when everything was possible, that is from the end of the 1960s to the mid-1980s. The selection of the label looks like a crossover between the creations of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they probably borrowed the latter's name) and have already released some really rare Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer "", "Killer Nun", "Phantom of Death" and "Torso". "The frightened woman" was completely unknown to me, but since the fellow reviewers here, whose opinions I greatly appreciate, have described it as one of the greatest and hypnotizing psychedelic euro-sexploitation films of his time, I didn't hesitate to take it, this is a very strange film and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average movie lover audience. 1%, however, you are ready for a truly unique treatment.The style, atmosphere and content are similar to "Succubus" by Jess Franco and "Venus in Furs" by Massimo Dallamano, but they are both widely considered classics, while " The scared woman "is practically upset osciuta. It's all a matter of profiling and good marketing, I guess. The story revolves around a rich, literally rich doctor (he lives in a giant isolated villa, has more vintage cars and has an impressive collection of artistic relics including a life-size replica of a mannequin doll) with a bizarre and somewhat unusual attitude towards women. He considers them a threat to the survival of the male race and so spends his days kidnapping, humiliating and sexually abusing randomly that he picks up from the street. Dr. Sayer kidnaps ambitious journalist Maria with the intention of completely destroying her feminine spirit, but he slowly falls in love with her. Only he starts to believe in true love, she reacts with a vengeance. This is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate moody and sinister atmospheres, bizarre landscape games and psychedelic touches that seem absolutely implausible and surreal, you can consider this one of the best tips. Is it slow, elegantly dreary and totally unlucky? Shameless Entertainment, okay!
