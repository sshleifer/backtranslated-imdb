A lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically fun than actually funny (although it has some moments of laughter), but much more is because it seems to have been cut from the studio to better attract the idiots it's kidding. Many situations cannot develop, there is obvious overdubbing of exhibition material and, worst of all, a narrator explains EVERYTHING (most of whom do not need explanations), probably because some previewed viewers did not understand what was happening. In other words, a humiliation film was ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that a longer and better version of this comedy will end up appearing on DVD, and it will become the favorite cult deserves to be, but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic form of reduced spirit is one of the most memorable films of the year - a cry of disgust against our culture and all the ways it has become trashed, amazed and named to appeal to the Yahoos. I saw it right after Land of the Dead, George Romero's last milking on the single idea that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point that Judge is doing; yet the point of view of Romero's counterculture (now zombi = a subclass that needs to rebel against the rich) seems hopelessly outdated, Judge's grip is fresh, dead and much more disturbing. Listen to the yahoos in your audience of films that encourage him for the state of President Camacho's Union, just like their screen colleagues, and you will know that we are all doomed.
