I decided to extend the review for my favorite movie ever. Unlike other war films focusing on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer on a psychological journey to the head. Pure surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can't take your eyes off it. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, Apocalypse Now slowly descends into its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) in madness, most likely in the same way that Kurtz immersed himself in madness. The production of this film is known for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines with the inspiration papers). There is a documentary called Apocalypse Now: An Apocalypse filmmaker that shows the hell that everyone has done during this process. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in each film. While the helicopter blade is heard in slow motion and the napalm is dropped into the trees, the "The End" song of the Doors is heard. The next shot is from Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the helicopter's noise coincides with the fan. We are aware that he is doing special missions for the military, mostly murders. When he is given his next mission, he is baffled. "Charging a man with a murder here is like giving a ticket for speeding in the Indy 500." The man who has to kill was a respected colonel who went mad and isolated himself with the tribes. Kurtz is ordering heinous acts performed by these people and he must stop me. Willard doesn't go alone though. He is transported on a boat with several soldiers and meet several battles. Along the way they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah" on the war. Willard reflects on the fact that if Kilgore is crazy, how could Kurtz be. There are many scenes depicting Willard plunging into madness: the tiger's attack, the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese, the unbroken rain, the scattered heaped corpses and the death of the crew members. When he reaches Kurtz's compound, he is greeted by the villagers and a hippy photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of killing Kurtz right away, Willard starts talking to him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He is tired of war and wants to go down like a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with various machetes by the people. When they realize that their leader was killed, instead of killing Willard, they call him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them. <br /> <br /> The photography here is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are without grain, which is rare in old movies. I can see him quietly and admire the beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> The acting ensemble is exceptional, with everyone playing their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he can combine his role as a depressed madman who is beaten by the war. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and the soundtrack are disturbing and provide the atmosphere for the film. I wonder what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits rolled? There have been many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name in a police show behaves like an idiot: "Your character provides comic relief for the show , like um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. "Anyone who has seen the movie knows why this is fun.
