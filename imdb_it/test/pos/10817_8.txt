I found this DVD in the library and based on the cover notes, it seemed like it could be interesting: a black comedy set in 1940 in France, just like the Germans are marching inside. "" Boy, should this make them roll in the corridors ?? ") But he does! This is an intelligent, original film, full of suspense and fun. I don't remember seeing anything of the kind before, foreign or American that the writer / director can find humor when we know that part of the result (the Germans will occupy France for four years) is remarkable. That doing it with such a charm is part of the pleasure. What starts as black comedy and fluff also ends with a couple of important moments ?? including a run to distill a hideout of " heavy water "(which was part of the preliminary research for the atomic bomb) and a rapid introduction of History 101 at the beginning of the Vichy collaborationist government that would govern southern France for much of the German Occupation. * But leave nothing out of this that scares you: the movie itself is fun, charming and romantic and runs on a constant clip. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is the combination of deed ri we have seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we have never heard of before. Along the way, there are two stellar turns: Virginie Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère. Both are impressive, but Mr. Derangère is particularly true. According to IMDb, it was in ten films before this ?? but he also won the Cesar as "Most Promising Actor" for this role, so apparently he was not so famous even in France. Is he a combination of romantic protagonist and comedian ?? and it makes it look so simple. Could you remember Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace" ?? it's hard to do comedy in a movie, because the risks are huge and the actor can look crazy. But Grant did it in a fascinating way, and this guy does it too. I should think we will know more about it in the future. <br /> <br /> To be sure, this film will not appeal to everyone ?? there is a bit of violence, even if nothing you don't see on TV every day. But if you want something original, you can try after seeing what you've discovered a cinematic gem. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this comment.
