I absolutely loved this movie as a child. I can't find it anywhere! I was quoting it to some friends just the other day, and none of them remember it! Can anyone help me? My older sister remembers it vaguely. There was also another film that I remember was half live action and half animation, but I can't remember the name. The characters were animated and the background was real ... I seem to remember that it was a kangaroo, and I think the setting of the film was in Australia. I'm freaking out trying to get copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very nice childhood. Edit: I searched IMDb for this other movie and found out it's called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was type "kangaroo" in the search bar under the characters, and the name of the movie on the list was like a bell that goes off! MAN, I love IMDb! Thank you!
