I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and the crew have developed over the years. Actually I like this one and "Waiting for Guffman" better than "Spinal Tap", which was the first of the group (and made by Rob Reiner but starred in guest and many of his regular mockumentary). This humor is not for everyone. It's pretty thin and not too physical, so some people might not be referring to it. However, as a dog lover (and fan of dog shows), I loved this movie. There are so many fun lines in it! My daughter and I often mention them. I find it incredible that these people can use such fun material for every movie! What a fun group they must be. I highly recommend it to those who prefer their own humor on the brain side.
