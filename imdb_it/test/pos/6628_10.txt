Bergman's story of how the hell of war can guide a reasonable pair of musicians towards barbarism. With many memorable scenes throughout the film, I found it particularly noteworthy that near the end Ullmann and Von Sydow entered a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. A fascinating masterpiece!
