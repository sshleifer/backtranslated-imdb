Wow, here's another great golf film. I have enjoyed at least three in the last few years, which have been well done, beautifully filmed and stimulating. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance". <br /> <br /> This is a true lost story, if ever there was one. Having an amateur defeat of all professionals and winning the Open United Tournament is an unprecedented feat. I believe this is the only time in 100 years that has ever been accomplished. How much of this film is fiction embellished by dramatic effect, I don't know. I know I'm going to read the book, and I know that in real life, Francis Ouimet had a three-time advantage in the playoffs with only two holes to play, unlike what we saw in the movie. <br /> Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is a fact. It's an incredible story and the filmmakers did a super job of presenting it here. It's not something just for golf enthusiasts; this is a funny movie. Kudso to actor-director Bill Paxton for an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> Yes, a lot of this is just golf but there are subplots like Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young girl who is obviously interested in him. It is also the moving story of someone giving a child a chance. The film also talks about the demons of Vardon who come from the wrong side of the tracks and try to make it in the sport of an elitist, who was at the time for both Europeans and Americans. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf is victorious as Ouimet as Steven Dillane as Vardon. For the uninitiated, Vardon was like Tiger Woods of his time, perhaps even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is depicted as a good boy; a real human being. the other main competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus), is a bit brutal. <br /> <br /> The fourth main character in this golf story could be the most beautiful person in the film: a fifth grade boy who ends up being Ouimet's caddy in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the film. <br /> <br /> If all this - a playoff with the huge loser against two powerful professionals and reaching the last hole - wasn't true, you would think: "Oh, man, this is so tough, who could believe it ? " This is what makes this real life story fun, finally captured in the movie. As with another 2005 sports film - "Cinderella Man" - here is another excellent film that was unfairly ignored when it came to prizes. I imagine that good films don't win prizes ..... only the hearts of their viewers.
