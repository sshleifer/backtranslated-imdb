Of course I'll think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I didn't see during filming. I was the guard for about an hour in the movie in the courtyard of death to ask for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this scene. Originally they had decided to go to the construction site and straighten out the prisoner, turn it over and let it out. The director said: "It will take a long time, what would you do Gower?" I said, "We have to get in and hook the arms and drag it backwards, so your camera can stay on his face as we take it off the set." I also lived in the same prison as a small child, since my father was the security guard assistant. I am also a current employee at the Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as a supervisor at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Although much of the film was a joke, the part where I was was quite reality. Even in the bar scene, the dancer who jumped into the air and left the stage was a real stripper I used to work in a club called "The Classic Cat".
