If you've never experienced what Zasu Pitts is, here's a zinger Zasu! In 1933 Mae Questel charged Pitt's voice to the character of Olive Oyl for the animated comic book version of Fleischer Studios Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does his best imitation of "Olivia Oyl" as he turns around complaining and playing his hands or clinging to the cop's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead it is "something always happens to someone". The first time I saw this movie I loved Zasu and found his character really funny. Since then I've seen her in other movies where she does the same whiny, intense and fragile routine. So, after watching this movie again, I started to feel a little annoyed by the constant moaning and almost hysteria on a piece of dust. But there are some funny comedians here, and it's also a mysterious movie. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that really works. The mysterious plot goes well together through the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason who plays Arthur Crimmer the cop. The haunted house is fun with many secret passages and even a skeleton in the attic! Worth watching. Read more reviews on public domain films at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
