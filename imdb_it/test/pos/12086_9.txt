Forget all those romantic and mushy films that involve notebooks and couples with closed lips that somehow manage to go along with the big over, after a life spent on the screen of unrealistic romanticism too simplified. Forget all those unfortunate "life giving dogs to save your familiar gestures" (although I have to admit I have a weakness for myself). Forget Ricky Schroeder who already shows his propensity to commit crimes at an early age (now that one was shameless!). <br /> <br /> This TV movie, which unfortunately never seems to be broadcast anymore, is the all-time champion of tear-jerks, hands down. And a well written and well written story. Ann-Margret had a great opportunity to take this role. Nothing fancy or sexy about her here, and this is a monumental achievement in itself. Based on a true story, she plays Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who chooses to fight until her last breath to find good homes for her ten children, instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a great job as a husband, the good-hearted but unreliable breadwinner, whose paralysis and paralyzing demons make him unable to take care of children. <br /> <br /> The film takes us through Lucile's tortuous process of interviewing future parents and then watching his children leave the house. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and of the father - grieving for the tragedy that is happening now and the one that will surely follow, and frustrated by his inability to do more. The scene where the youngest child (Steven) is taken to his new home is the most incredible I've ever seen. Now, I grew up as a "hopeless romantic" and have spent many years since then growing a harder and more cynical shell. I usually find more to tease than to empathize with the sentimental cinematic tripe that has been submitted to us these days. But this gem from the early 1980s still kills me. <br /> <br /> I would really like someone with a good sense of marketing to release a DVD version of this drama. Special features include the Emmy Awards TV show the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the award for best dramatic actress went to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". In what must be one of the most beautiful moments in what is now a real prize show, Stanwyck cried during his acceptance speech and launched "Ann-Margret, I love you!", Which brought Ann- M in tears. <br /> <br /> One last note. The IMDb number for "Who Will Love My Children" is 6.4 at the time of this writing. However, over 75% of the ratings are in the 8-10 range (mainly 10). Any type of handicap system used by this site to modify the general classifications of the films listed by IMDb, the mark on this is completely missing. This is the "fastest" of all time, and a good TV movie to boot.
