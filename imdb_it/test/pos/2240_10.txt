I would like to highlight these excellent points in favor of this film: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie's sex scene <br /> <br /> # 2 Foley's artist has outdone herself. <br /> <br /> The plot # 3 was quite thick <br /> <br /> # 4 The DVD includes trailers and chapters <br /> <br /> # 5 no animal was damaged in the making of the film <br /> <br /> # 6 gifts to the blade hunter through the movie <br /> <br /> # 7 burning garbage cans <br /> <br /> # 8 funny boy without legs <br / > <br /> # 9 Voice over by Jack Palance has added a real dynamic element to the film. <br /> <br /> # 10 recommends Sage, for example "When you have dinner with the devil bring a long spoon." <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18! <br /> <br /> To summarize: an evening of entertainment was provided.
