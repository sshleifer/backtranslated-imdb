Shtrafbat - The Criminal Battalion is a moving, and mostly honest, look at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their blood crimes during World War II. You can almost call the Russian equivalent of the acclaimed miniseries "Band of Brothers". <br /> <br /> Formed in July 1942 on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, criminal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible losses (sometimes up to 90%). Prisoners of the GULAG (political prisoners / concentration camps), deserters, soldiers captured by the Germans but managed to escape, soldiers accused of violating the protocol, had the opportunity to join the Shtrafbat and prove that there were no "traitors to the homeland" "with their lives. Those who suffered injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and reintegrated under the eyes of the law. <br /> <br /> This miniseries presents one of these Shtrafbats, under the command of Tverdokhlebov "An honorable officer who was captured by the Germans was shot and left for dead. He is characterized by a colorful and diverse group of people, placed in a situation from which there is no way out. The authoritarian and respectable boss of the crime Antip "Kulak" (The fist) and his small band of unreformed criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who hit his anti-Semitic officer, Father (Orthodox priest) Mikhail Isch to the battalion when his parish is destroyed the house-to-house fighting, the political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to GULAG but who are anyway willing to fight one last time for their people and their country, must all find their courage and their reasons for continuing to live, and continue to fight. <br /> <br /> Although set during a war, not all episodes involve fighting, in fact the fighting scenes are often chaotic, sporadic and brief - which was probably the intention of the director. In between, the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast, their backgrounds, their thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by one of the Shtrafbat soldiers and then her execution, executed for alleged AWOL, periods of boredom on the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a German bunker stocked with food (and champagne ), the moral the dilemma of the officers unable to save their men from their superiors, the betrayal of a spouse and other situations, are in the foreground. The camera is impassive: it does not move away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. Dialogue also does not censure the oath. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb and profound, and the script is also well written. Everything, from anger, to fatigue, to resignation, looking for a bit of joy to cling to, is made almost impeccable. One complaint could be that some of the Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone unfamiliar with the language and culture. Since in a sense it is a historical drama, some of the terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, some historical references) could be lost in some viewers. This understanding is not necessary to fully enjoy Shtrafbat, but these references are a touch of authenticity. Another complains that it could be imposed, it is an occasional anachronism and the bending of history to adapt to the plot, but frankly this is such a compelling miniseries that you will probably forgive these minor mishaps.
