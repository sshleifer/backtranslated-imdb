One of my favorite movies of all time. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase the memory or suffer from momentary amnesia, I would like to be able to enjoy this film as much as I did for the first time. The second and third time is still pleasant, but I found myself appreciating humor more like shocks and emotions were not unexpected. If you want to see a movie that you won't be able to predict the ending, I highly recommend this movie. It's chilling, shocking, full of suspense and there's a lot of humor to help you get through that too. If you watch this movie and don't love it, I really question your sanity!
