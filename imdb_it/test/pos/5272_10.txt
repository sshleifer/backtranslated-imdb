The Helge Schneider phenomenon challenges easy description or rapid categorization. And yet, for the international public who did not know him, one could say that it is something like a crude mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, adding a passion for Jazz music and the clothes of the 70s. While his theatrical performances are already eccentric, his films are simply hilarious and outrageous. <br /> <br /> "00 Schneider" is, in my opinion, the best film of Helge. She is the protagonist in the two main roles: the police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and the bad-killer "Nihil Baxter", and also in a smaller and more precious role as a doctor "Dr. Hasenbein". <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, we see how Baxter, a lover of modern art, accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, from whom he bought a badly used Jaguar, when a beloved sculpture slips from Baxter's hands , hitting Metulskie deadly. After reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 returns from the pension to investigate the case with the support of his faithful companion, Lieutenant Koerschgen, played by an elderly actor of the same name. They quickly pick up Baxter's track and question him in his strangely decorated villa (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But initially fail to collect any evidence. The plot winds through many curves, with several scenes that do not always contribute to the progress of the plot, but are hilariously amusing, such as a daydream of 00 (including the most unusual vision on the horse in short of a man running) in the film story), a party of the police department during which Koerschgen lined up with the head and must be hospitalized, and a visit to the aforementioned Dr. Hasenbein. Finally, Baxter is finally caught trying to escape on a plane to Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> Andreas Kunze, who in this case plays the wife of 00, is always worth a special mention, as he usually performs in drag performing female roles in Helge's Movies. <br /> <br /> So all you people out there looking for new laughs, I highly recommend this movie. The socket? You must understand German (as I doubt there is an English version around) ...
