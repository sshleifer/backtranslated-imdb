This trio of 30-minute short films on issues related to homosexuality are all performed fairly respectably. Each training story is interpreted with pleasant charm and naturalness. This film deserves to be widely distributed and easily obtainable. However, it is not. I had to order my copy of the video; none of the local video stores or even the libraries have it in stock.
