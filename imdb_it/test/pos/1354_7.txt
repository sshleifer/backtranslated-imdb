If Sicily is a territory of the Baroque, with its doubling of perspective, it is part of the challenge of the film to realism. And it is an exuberant pleasure here, surpassing Fellini with not one but three directors, besides obviously the current Bellocchio, who has made some really great films and should not be susceptible to his honor. There is a variety of tricks and improvisations on Manzoni's "I promessi sposi" with a real marriage somewhere. Even Sicily is considered a tailoring area (you already know this version of the island, so there is no spoiler), a comic version of which makes the noteworthy image for Sergio Castellito's work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palace.
