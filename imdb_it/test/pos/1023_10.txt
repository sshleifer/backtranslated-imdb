Although I don't like cricket at all and saw this movie 13 years ago, I still think it's one of the best training films ... I remember the day I came home from my school and sat down. I had lunch, I having seen the opening titles of that film and then ... I was so immersed in what I felt to be there, it really impressed me personally. I still remember how I felt when I saw him for the first time, I felt that the poor boy was my friend, living the same adolescent experience we had in those days. what I really liked about that movie is the main theme of a "shy" guy who fantasizes about "kissing" his dream girl, without offense but if it were an American movie, you would certainly see - at some point, especially the climax - the "shy" guy "making love" to his girlfriend, and I really can't catch these contradictory concepts so far ... I have a simple request, if anyone knows how to get this movie on a DVD by mail , please let me know why I need a succession of memories ... thank you
