There have been some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon on IMDb. I think this is for three reasons. First, purists are disappointed that the mini series is not exactly like the book. Secondly, it is not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Finally, people like to complain on IMDb and the biggest movies in the world will have negative comments. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say that no movie will be as good as the book. It's just that. The solitary dove was not as good as the novel on which it was based. In addition, the Lonesome Dove movie left some things exchanged. This is just the way it will be with a film adaptation of anything. So it's a futile argument when you look at Comanche Moon. I agree that it is not as good as the original dove. But hey, nothing is. I know people who lead their lives thanks to the lessons learned from the Dove. If I was going to compare every book I read, the movie I saw and the TV I saw from Lonesome Dove; I would be perpetually unhappy. <br /> <br /> This is a television miniseries product based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave (the novel) and the sequel to Dead man's Walk, and that's what you get. It's the best TV I've seen in years. It's a fun set for Lonesome Dove. We learn about the history of the Rangers that we have learned to know and love in Dove. Zahn does an extraordinary job in recreating Gus McCrae. Even Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) Do great jobs creating characters that help fill the past of the rangers and the Newt. <br /> <br /> If / when he returns, I promise you will have more fun than some cruel reality show.
