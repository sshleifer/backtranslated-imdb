I've been waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is that he lives up to my visions! This is a must see for any Tenacious D fan or real Black Jack. It's so nice to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It is not a true story, but who cares. The D is the biggest band on earth! I had the soundtrack of the movie last week and listened to it non-stop. Seeing the film was pure happiness for me and my husband. We both met Jack and Kyle after 2 different Tenacious D concerts and we saw them even when they were on tour with Weezer. We left that concert after the D had finished playing. No one can complete their show! Long live the D !!! : D
