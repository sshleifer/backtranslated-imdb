I was really surprised to see that, unlike most documentaries, this was written, directed and produced by a film critic, Richard Schickel. Most of the time I know where film critics played an important role in the films, the films turn out to be bombs (Rex Reed starring in "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert in "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" are the first examples). However, in this case, the critic's powers are used for good and not for evil - and the results are better (although this is not saying much, because the films I just mentioned are among the worst ever made). > <br /> As for the documentary, it is narrated by Clint Eastwood (a pretty good choice) and manages to discuss his long career - from his silent days until his death in the early 1960s. The only negative aspects, and they are slight, are that the film is terribly short (like most documentaries on films) and Gary Cooper is a very little human being - in reality you don't learn much about his life. However, as a good overview of his films, it works very well.
