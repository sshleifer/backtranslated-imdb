"Japan takes the best from all over the world and does it right", while that may be true, it applies to everyone except for one thing, that being ..... Major league baseball .... but not worry "Mr Baseball" is there to try and change all that. But only who will change who, is the part of the film that makes it really rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines in his comic roles. The plot can be true to life, but the subplot is uninterrupted. The Japanese people are a kind and respectful people, with ways and traditions very different from those of western society. All these elements and obstacles combine to create a really fun and entertaining film. It is absolutely worth it!
