This film is simply one of the best films I have the privilege to own. It took me years to make this film and it was worth it. The film is meant to be anti-drug propaganda, but turns into the opposite while it is not yet in the middle of the film. The passionate look on the faces of the players who receive their generosity of drugs is pleasing to all those who observe. Until the final stage of their drug-induced life, heroin comes to have her say. YIKES! This is the anti-drug message that has been so fabulously researched. The soundtrack of this movie kicks! By far it is one of the best Pink Floyds albums ever! If you ever get the chance, take a look, listen and time to witness a spectacularly made movie.
