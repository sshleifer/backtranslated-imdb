I heard that this film had many good qualities. The cinematography was certainly different, exposing the scenic aspect of the set and the plot. The original characters as actors were certainly a result and I felt more strongly interpreted in a quite convincing way, obviously they are playing alone, but certainly unique. Cultural aspects can leave many disappointed because a familiarity with Chinese and Eastern culture will answer many questions regarding parent-child relationships and the stigma that accompanies any drug use. I found the story of Jia Hongsheng interesting. On a negative note, the story is in Beijing and some of the scents of fashion and music of the early 90s, although this was done in 2001, so sometimes it's a bit rough (the Beatles crap, etc.) ). Whatever, not a top ten or twenty, but if it's on television, take a look.
