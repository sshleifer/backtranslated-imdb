"Crossfire" is apparently a mystery of murder, but what sets it apart from other similar films of the period is the murderer's motive, which is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance that fuels bigotry and contains references to a "hillbilly" and an Irish immigrant who has also suffered from abuse due to their ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is based on the novel Richard Brooks called "The Brick Foxhole" which talks about a hate crime in which the victim was gay. It is ironic that this story of a form of intolerance must be tolerated by the intolerance of the censors who have established that, for the film version, the kind of bigotry involved should be changed to anti-Semitism. Another irony is the behavior of a soldier who seems proudly proud to have served in a war against the Nazis and yet embraces their hatred of Jews. The director and producer of this film also suffered from another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being summoned to appear before the "Committee of the anti-American activities of the house". All these points seem to underline the deeply rooted and intractable nature of the whole problem of bigotry as illustrated in this film. <br /> <br /> When police captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers that the night he was killed, Samuels socialized with a group of soldiers and one of these, Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper) is soon identified as the main suspect. Additional information is also collected by Montgomery (Robert Ryan), who is another of the soldiers present that night and by Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) who is a friend of Mitchell. Keeley, with the help of other soldiers, searches for Mitchell and when he finds him, listens to his account of what he did on the night of the murder, including his meeting with a ballroom hostess called Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grahame) . <br /> <br /> Keeley helps Michell avoid being arrested and tries to identify the killer. Ginny Tremaine is interrogated, but her information is not enough to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigation leads him to recognize the reason for the crime and, subsequently, creates an elaborate trap that leads the true culprit to denounce the own fault. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is a film with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage of the story. The "message" is transmitted in a way that was, without doubt, appropriate for the period in which it was made, but by today's standards it seems rather heavy. J Roy Hunt's cinematography is simply marvelous with low key lighting and the creative use of numerous strategically positioned table lamps that combine to evoke an appearance perfectly compatible with the drama that takes place on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite this being a low-budget production, "Crossfire" was a huge box office success and benefited from an engaging and very relevant story with a wonderful cast, two of which were nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan) and Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame). Additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Film) and John Paxton (Best Screenplay, Adapted Screenplay) are just further proof of the positive recognition this film has rightly received.
