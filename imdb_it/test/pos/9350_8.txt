Film noir at its best. Set in the immediate post-war period (1946), "Crossfire" represents the good, the bad and the bad of that time. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew and therefore, automatically perceived through Monty's narrow lenses, was a slacker who came out of fighting the war. Monty doesn't like people like that. The truth is that Sam was also a soldier, but the truth is something that disappears when you feel right about the ideologies of hatred in which you have been immersed and the world is full of dirt this and this, which desperately needs your brand of "cleaning". <br /> <br /> Monty is a sadist in dressing winning soldiers. The losers of World War II had more than their part even hateful and prejudiced leaders and soldiers. Some of them were hanged for war crimes, how to start a "war of aggression". <br /> <br /> This film got its creators into trouble when that other sadistic American purifier, Joe McCarthy, made his auditions in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire", just to see how good an actor Robert Ryan was. The real Robert Ryan was not Monty. He was a great, if underestimated, underutilized actor. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and enjoy the dark side of America after World War II. Watch it for a taste of the good side of the late 1940s in America. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play leading roles. Mitchim could have played the role of Ryan, in fact, he did when he played the psychopath in "Cape Fear".
