Would you like to know why the French and Italians love / hate each other? Would you like to get a taste of the history that drives our lives? So, go see Virzi's film (in the original language, of course) and you can watch a wonderful Monica Bellucci who finally speaks her native language from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, right on the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speak Livornese (adorable Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil certainly in his shoes with Napoleon. A lot of fun, a real fresco of the landscape of the island of Elba, and a photo on the political reasons to kill or leave a tyrant alive (good for all times).
