I have the distinct feeling that what you think of this movie depends heavily on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie before, it will probably confuse you. If you have already seen a Miyazaki movie, it will probably confuse the devil again ... but it won't really interest you! This is because I discovered that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to understand what was happening and why - and this affected my enjoyment of the film. Now that I've seen almost all of Miyazaki's films, I see the oddness and I take everything - enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least for the Western public) are like drugs: many strange and beautiful images that do not always initially make sense but which are certainly beautiful to look at !! Of all the films of Miyazaki, this could have the most unusual and incomprehensible plot, even more than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEBOROR TOTORO. But like these and many other Studio Gibli films, if you sit down and see that you are rewarded with a fabulous fairy tale. But since it's so difficult to describe (and others have already done it), I won't even go there. <br /> <br /> As for the artwork, it is typical of one of these Japanese films, although there has been an obvious change. There was a widespread use of what looked like colored pencils for backgrounds. This was NOT a bad thing - the lovely pastel appearance was very pleasant and unique. In a sense it seemed that a small piece of Bill Plympton's style was infused into a typical Miyazaki movie. With a high frame-rate, an exceptional animation (which gave it a lot of personality) and a great "wow factor", this is an exceptional film for all ages. Although it is clearly designed more for the younger audience (especially TOTORO fans), it is a bit scary here and there (during storm segments) but there are many interesting things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically so), I loved cute things and I applaud the otherness of the film. <br /> <br /> A great movie - among the best of Miyazaki. I don't give a 10 because I'm reluctant to do it all the time - I've also done a bit more with the other films in the studio (especially TOTORO). But this does NOT mean that you should not rush out and see it - do it and do yourself a favor.
