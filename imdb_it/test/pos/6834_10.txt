This is a really cool movie in the pulp fiction genre with a twist of film noir thrown. Really one of Emma Thompson's best performances to date ... this movie has it all, it's well written, well directed, wonderfully filmed, and has some great shows. I don't know why it didn't go well. It's spectacular!
