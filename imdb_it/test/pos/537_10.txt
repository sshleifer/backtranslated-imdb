Most families will recognize the similarities between their family and the one created by the brilliant acting of Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates an image on screen that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and one worthy of a Golden Globe nomination. The control of his emotions is so intact that at any point in the film you can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene. Susan is also extraordinary in this film, but she has chosen a role so different from all the others and carries it forward with true professionalism. <br /> <br /> Any Natalie fan would have seen the film based on his past successes, but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film. It is a truly humbling experience.
