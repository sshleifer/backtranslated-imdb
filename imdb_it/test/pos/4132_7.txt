Considering he is basically a low budget cast, this is a surprisingly good film about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey plays Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for almost all of his music. Supported by his Crickets, Holly had a string of successes and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to fame, his marriage to his better half and his final death. I like this movie and I think you will too. Charles Martin Smith also does a great job in this film.
