Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrait of a comic genius. If you are familiar with the mannerisms and diaries of Kenneth Williams, this drama perfectly captures the essence of them. When I read about Kenneth vacuuming my swim shorts, I laughed and then appeared on the screen, but this time I didn't laugh because it was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man. It must have been such a solitary life to be in Kenneth's skin, he craves attention, but he avoids it when it REALLY counts! The last 20 minutes are heartbreaking as we see Kenneth sinking into the depths of despair and considering suicide as the only alternative. I've seen it a dozen times and continue to cry uncontrollably at the point where it bids good night to LOUIE. I can't recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, but he takes home the fact that Kenneth has not allowed anyone to invade his world and this is where man's sadness lies. For a genius who has brought so many happiness, it is a pity that his private life was full of despair and sadness. Pauly.
