I recently visited the Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mother, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistakenly perceived as a place for children only, but when you see quality shows like the Mickey Mouse movie, you discover that the magic of Disney is for everyone! It was a great show that we left the theater and we turned and we are back on the line. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I would encourage anyone who goes to Disney World to take a look at this show, which is not just a show but a world wind, a fun-filled ride with Donald leaving calm again to get into trouble!
