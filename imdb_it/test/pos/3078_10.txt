I love this movie! I know some people might say that it wasn't a great movie, but I don't agree at all. Comedy is the classic style of Mel Brooks and the actors have been chosen superbly. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle and what they first made. Cary Elwes shines like Robin Hood, the only English Robin Hood you lie to. He has great comic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much older now, but at the time this was his first film and he did an exceptional job as Achoo. The characters were all well planned and all added their little peculiarities to the film. I highly recommend renting this movie and enjoying it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
