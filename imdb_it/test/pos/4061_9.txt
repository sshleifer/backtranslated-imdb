Dad (78) and I (46) both enjoyed watching the movie today. For a boy mainly known for important roles, De Niro is a heckuva comedian. Of course, it helps to have his images of the past film against which to play. Consider that one of those roles, 15 MINUTES, was a policeman dealing with media interference, and you have an interesting set of comparison / contrast performance. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley Characters. Shatner interprets a burlesque of himself, a self of the parallel world that was best known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its imaginary counterparts on TV and film. Shatner conferences on the appropriate means of sliding through a hood; De Niro points out that the holsters scratch the hood. Ironically, as the film progresses, De Niro's character begins to incorporate the illusions of the reality of the TV-cop in the real case he is working on. <br /> <br /> The film draws inspiration from a range of sources, so you could make the comment is derived. Well then? Satire needs to derive its humor to exist. And besides, the film has bizarre moments of originality. For example, I am reasonably sure that the method of the villain's death has never been done before. <br /> <br /> A quibble about the reality of the weapons involved ... shouldn't those guns have had a kind of recoil? To penetrate the steel, those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate. And the highest level of inertia of a projectile is at the moment of shooting. So ... firing a barrage of these tank-killer bullets should have pushed the shooters back onto their butts. Oh, what the hell ... it's a satire. Perhaps the lack of recoil of the guns is itself a satire on the B-F guns so casually used in thrillers. <br /> <br />
