Having obtained a copy of the Bostocks Cup, I must confess that it is not as funny as I initially thought !! IT'S BETTER!!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart. Fixing of matches ???? Never! 45% uphill slope? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? The Coach Driver who thinks that Pontefract is in South Wales (it's all Ponty this and Ponty that) Bertie Masson's (Tim Healey's) hat of the lucky cup !! (not that you enjoy) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused???? Watch it again. The innovative use of the actual movie with Bostock players was brilliant and the producer should be proud to give us a MASTERPIECE. Come on ITV be a spectator and do yourself a favor - show it again !!! Please>
