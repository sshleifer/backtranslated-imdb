The young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are exceptional in this excellent film about two boys who promised to "take care of their mother" and how they face when their new stepfather starts beating the younger boy. The support cast around the boys is top notch. The script really enters the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe that Wood can grow up to look like Tom Hanks, but it's not news in Hollywood. This is honestly my only criticism of the film.
