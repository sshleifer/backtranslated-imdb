The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it's not fun. It dresses exactly like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing happens is fun. But if you can see it as a movie where almost nothing funny happens, then you'll really have fun. It is also a film that is hostile, as the title suggests. Extremely opulent. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few prevailing cult directors who completely and completely embraced the 80s in his work from that decade, rather than understandably pretending it was still in the 70s. <br /> <br /> The opening credits unite The animation of the 80s, the Italian-American and the staging soaped one another at the same time. From there, despite the 1980s, it seems right. The lighting of Demme's frequent director of photography, Tak Fujimoto and the jukebox's soundtrack full of very different pops and alternative jams, are opulent and in fact are controlled and shaded as part of the atmosphere. Demme is good at colorful flash characterisations in her visual and sometimes apparently impetuous composition of a fun mix of styles, a plot that could have gone somehow, where a smooth FBI agent, played by a modest Matthew Modine, trying to infiltrate a mafia family, sees a possibility when a rifle peg, played with Michelle Pfeiffer's hither-hither allure, tries to abandon the criminal lifestyle after her triggered husband, in what you hoped for in a performance by Alec Baldwin, he is enchanted. <br /> <br /> The way it works works for a while, because Demme seems to have a steady hand on the steering wheel. He knows the meaning of showing us the scenes of life at home very subjective and related to Pfeiffer, as well as his concerns and desires as a morally conflicted mother, although his relationship with his son Joey is taken for granted. What son of the mobster is listening to the mother of a little party when the head of dad played with the naturalness of Dean Stockwell and by far the strongest point of the cast, is he giving him such fantastic gifts? Overall, though, the nuances of Demme are easily interpreted as a novel that makes fun of a hilarious thriller story. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, we discover that we are going in the wrong direction, because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer must fall in love. This is not inherently bad, and every here and there seems really bearable, but as a romantic subplot, it is not handled in an interesting way, or well, almost for nothing because it goes through various various clich√©s, which satisfy the initial expectation of a cheese of the years '80 hit of date, and for that audience, I think it has the right impact. But for someone who has genuinely been interested in history and the aesthetic approach, it is a disappointment in a state of boredom. <br /> <br /> So it is a decent film with false steps in some places, but like a movie for appointments or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s, maybe it has seen many films of events in the 80s , the value of entertainment is not so susceptible to fluctuate, except for the said deficit in true laughter. There is perhaps some mockery, and it is very generous, but I would not leave the comedy lane with the high hopes with which I would initially have entered. In any case, there are additional joys in the bit roles of great actors who have started to fade, like Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
