I'm in a vast minority here. I also didn't care much about the original caddyshack, apart from the scene of the chase / murray duo and some jokes about Rodney. okay, cut it down: rodney vs. jackie - both Jews and have similar humor. Rodney is a bigger and more distinct name. Jackie has an accidental and more observant approach to his jokes and is more "yours" in this sequel. Jackie's attitude towards everything is memorable and, in a sense, inspiring! its fast lines and its security left me wanting to express myself that way. Rodney was good, but there wasn't enough, and he was more "on his face" and contemptuous. Jackie, in a rare film appearance, is a perfect subtitle for Rodney (come on, a gun-shaped hair dryer?!?!) Really, look at the little things! <br /> <br /> stack vs. knight - both play very well with snobbish yuppies. Ted Knight, despite his wonderful television / film career, shows his age a little. but, in this way, it eliminates the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see it fall. Ted looks a bit weak and is rather annoying, playing his anger and frustration too slapstick, while the stack is more acute and vengeful; you really hate it and have fun seeing it fail constantly. the stack wins with me. <br /> <br /> Murray Vs. aykroyd- well, they both had vintage scenes like SNL with the ubiquitous and fun chase (ty webb). I liked the murray / chase better. Murray plays his big, annoying and talkative character with obvious improvised ability and is adorable but annoying at the same time. and the same can be said for aykroyd. both become annoying after a while, but it's a draw. <br /> <br /> I really liked part 2 compared to the first one. are 2 completely different mood films. the first part is more drug / bath / sexual humor with a cast full of big names. the second part uses golf as a backdrop for a stick-it-to-the-rich kind of comedy that makes you feel better than being a working class. 80s script? Yup. a bit far-fetched? yes, but wasn't it the first? an insult to the sport of golf? yes, it's a movie. thin story? yes, it's a comedy with real humor, not "dancing with wolves" !! moreover, part 2 has a much better soundtrack !! PLEASE DO NOT WAIT TO BE A SEQUEL BEFORE! IT IS 98% AND ITS MOVIE AND IT SHOULD NOT ALSO HAVE THE NAME 'CADDYSHACK' IN IT. That being said, I am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and is a great fluff entertainment exponent of the 80s with quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! to all reducers - reduce! it is a great comedy in its own right. randy quaid was wonderful, jonathan silverman was wonderful, heck, they were all !! all this in chat and now it seems to me to watch it! I think I'll do it
