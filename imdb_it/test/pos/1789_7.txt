What kind of saying about this movie. good for beginners, I thought this movie was ok, not the maximum not worse. I said this because I thought the script was exceptional and original, really different and refreshing. Now I wouldn't say it's the biggest movie I've seen for acting. The actors who played every role, it seems that they played them without emotions, as if they had taken their lives. When the wife laughed or cried, this didn't seem real to me for some reason, this is just an example, but honestly all the characters don't behave at all. I wish I could say more positive things about this film so that you guys can see it at least once, but how can I do it because I know I won't see this movie again. I rented this film from my school's library, without having heard anything about the film itself or the director. I took the opportunity because the story I described on the back looked really interesting and it really was.
