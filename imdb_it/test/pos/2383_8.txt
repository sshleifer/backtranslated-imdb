Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico were undoubtedly the weakest of Scooby Doo's modern animated characters. Loch Ness Monster is a remarkable improvement. <br /> <br /> This time the band goes to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit the castle of Blake, Daphne's ancestral home. And you wouldn't know, the castle is located in the picturesque fishing village of Drumnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness. <br /> <br /> During their stay they meet some interesting people. First there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who drowned all her money to find the Loch Ness monster. <br /> <br /> Sir Ian Locksley, the head of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, is a faithful non-believer of Nessie. <br /> <br /> The Haggarts, its cozy inn on the shores of the lake. The children are a couple of local jokers, always in malice. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild and paranoid hippie dude who is convinced that the monster is out there and will stop at nothing to find it. <Br /> <br /> And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the dock master who saw Nessie too many times to count. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a little annoying as this is teaching young people a younger shit load and giving the wrong impression. However, if you can defend yourself, you'll be fine. Being Scottish, I can't help but tremble for the terribly imitated Scottish accents. Fact: We do NOT play that way. <br /> <br /> Soon Nessie, looking rather more demonic than usual, shows up and causes havoc. The band seems to have another mystery in their hands. Follow the usual chase scenes, the clues and the extravagant disguises of Shaggy. There are many laughs. The animation is splendid, with suggestive scenes and places. And the plot is much better than Monster of Mexico. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is the music. I miss the scores of Louis Febre and even here the songs are pretty rotten. Where are the Hex girls when you need them? <br /> <br /> The DVD of region 2 is in crystal clear widescreen 1.78: 1 (region 1 is not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some extras ok are included. Definitely worth getting.
