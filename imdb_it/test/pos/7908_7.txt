A hard life becomes harder when the three children of a single mother are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after her untimely death. <br /> <br /> To be together, the older boy plans a daring and high-risk escape to find a lost and distant uncle, their only close relative. <br /> <br /> Their journey takes the three fearful fugitives in a chase through the desert in a classic beetle, penniless, hungry, desperate, terrified of criminals and too young to drive, hunted by the ever threatening civil authorities . <br /> <br /> What the film lacks in acting and in the realism of the plot, compensates for the honest human need to be part of a complete and complete family - even if that family is cobbled together with broken parts of life. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ending is forced and too dramatic for the critical public, but every heart beats the same cry for being together and belonging. <br /> <br /> With all its weaknesses, I continue to give this film a strong recommendation.
