First, let me review the film. This movie drives me crazy, and I don't even believe in aliens! However, the film has its flaws. <br /> <br /> There are three acts for this film. The act one is perfect. Set the movie and really develop the scroll factor. I must say that the score is fantastic! Everything is set up and set up perfectly. <br /> <br /> The Second Act begins when Jillian, playing Sherry Burton, goes to the shrink. They hypnotize her and she remembers the kidnapping. Act Two ruins the film when the aliens appear. "Screaming Mad George" made effects for the aliens. I must say that they did a good job, except for their depiction of the "gray" aliens. No offense, but the Grays looked like inflatable rewards for doors. <br /> <br /> In a side note, I liked how they treated hypnosis in Acts One and Two. If you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the husband's version of the events, the blue light hits them and his wife says "Someone is here" or something like that. Does this make sense. The husband is worried about his wife. "Someone" could hurt her. This is his problem. However in his version of the events, he says "Help me!" She does not say "Someone is here". This also makes sense. The aliens follow her. Her husband's desire to help her and save her is her problem. Now back to the movie. <br /> <br /> The Third Act transforms the film into a gore festival. Start with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical gore festival, but it has a surprise ending. I won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development. <br /> <br /> The DVD and comments are taken too seriously, but if you think that Wilford Brimley says "Horsesh **" is funny, you might want to take a look at the interview section. Now I congratulate Jillian McWhirter. <br /> <br /> I could only hope that Jillian will read it. I had never seen it before, but wow, what a show! Let me tell you this rest. First of all, this should be a serious film. The details that I will describe now may seem campy and fun, like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but in reality it is not. I got it? Ok. <br /> <br /> Jillian is sexy, naturally good-looking. She is naked for most of the film, a good thing. Unfortunately, it is usually attacked, terrified and raped, a very bad thing. However, she has to play most of this naked film. You get points to get over it. He must act happy, sad, excited, scared and physically wounded in a matter of moments. The turnaround is staggering! She must cheer for joy when she finds out she is pregnant. She must scream in terror when the aliens pull out their guts. She must behave very angry when the husband suggests that the child is not his. He must behave as if he were denying, saying that there is nothing wrong with his child, when her husband says otherwise. A denial, I should note, that is really imposed on her by the aliens who control her. I'm talking about the caliber show of the Oscars here! <br /> <br /> Then there's the rape scene. It's scary, but since it's just a rubber alien, it's not bad. In this scene, the alien is not a "gray" alien, so I will describe it. The alien has tentacles, and it's a bit like a table. Jillian is on the table-like side, held back by the tentacles. From his head is the alien's head. The alien's head is long and lowers so that his head is now above Jillian's legs. Then, the alien, hey-nanu-nanu, comes out of his forehead. It's on the forehead! Seems pretty campy, right? Well, Jillian does it straight, and she pulls it out! He must act like an alien with his hey-nanu-nanu coming from his forehead he is raping her, and she pulls him out! It is a very intense scene, but it is not what makes it. See, this scene is done in a flashback. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance that recalls these events. He is simply lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis reminiscent of alien abduction, but his acting here is more intense than the rape scene! How many actors can perform a performance in a scene that describes a more intense rape of the rape scene? Not many! However, Jillian does it. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever. Jillian, if you've ever read this, I want you to know that I (hidden name) aka MegamanX-1, I think you're the best actress ever. You're the best actress ever! I could only hope that you read this and always take it with you. <br /> <br /> As with all others, "Progeny" (1999) is a film by Okay to Good. I would recommend it.
