Libby was talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about his past (like when it ended in the same hospital where Hurley was), then you should know that Libby despised his season 2, the character will be explored more third season and we will get answers to the questions surrounding it. <br /> <br /> BTW, great episode. He had a fantastic cliffhanger and some interesting questions ... like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the statue of the four feet? <br /> <br /> I can't wait until the third season, I just lost the rules !!! I hope all unanswered questions will be answered. I loved the way they explained why the plane actually crashed. Desmond did it when he couldn't dial the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
