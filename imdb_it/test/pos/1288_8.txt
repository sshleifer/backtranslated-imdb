The debut that has wrested from the dark one of the most brilliant stars of contemporary noir is a sure, albeit limited, stab at play and obsession. Turned to zero money, Nolan could not have chosen a better topic than the shabby and very thin subject of London to practice his profession, given the lack of funds. This short film (67 min) is at its best in playing with the expectations of the public and the protagonist on who is scamming who, even if the initial set-up makes some alarm bells ring in the credibility department. Muddy cinematography (often used natural lighting due to the budget) can be mostly marked by noir stylization, although sometimes the limitations manifest themselves. <br /> <br /> Nolan's style can easily be seen to develop in this young development; many of the same themes of the confused identity and the rush of hopes recur in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. Not a masterpiece, but good and certainly worth a look at the modern Noir and Nolan fans.
