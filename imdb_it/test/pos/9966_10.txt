Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination for this? Is it that we take it for granted at this point in his career? Pacino here is extraordinary .. It gives a complex and heartbreaking performance like Shylock, the lender of Jewish money .. the film as a whole was quite large, with beautiful shots of Venice to watch and a perfect score to listen to .. also the other actors do a great job, but the real reason to see this is Pacino .. I saw all the nominations for the Oscars nominated in 2004, and I must say that Pacino was snubbed .. blame him on the anti-Semitism associated with the performance of campaigns by the studio, the late release date without major pushes, or most likely, all of the above .. In my mind, the best performances of the year belong to Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda and Al Pacino in The Merchant of Venice ..
