I loved this show but then I don't remember ever having loved what he did, starting with "Americanization of Emily". A sheriff of the city who continues to try to steal the blind city and go to Mexico must love it. Like everything else it does, it has a cheeky-flavored language that makes it a Garner product. James plays the same character in many of his shows and films, but somehow never becomes stale. <br /> <br /> P.S. re: kill the main character <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly the "good" brother was killed and replaced with the "bad" twin in an attempt to increase the ratings, for example; make it more like all other westerners on TV at the moment. I think this show was too early and I still miss it. Something is missing on TV without a Jimmy G show.
