Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for starring in television comedies - most notably ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where the young blonde with sweet biscuits was. He made films before CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable of which is a Walt Disney film, THE ONE AND ONLY GENUINE, ORIGINAL FAMILY BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up his character from LAUGH-IN and (thanks to a good script by IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on a piece by Abe Burrows) was able to develop the television character in a way to get a true sculpted performance. As a result Ms. Hawn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career took off from future successes like PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although the other LAUGH-IN stars did a good job on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as a judge in BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie was able to have a career as a bonifide movie star. <br /> <br /> About LAUGH- In Goldie's personality she would show a naivety that would be embarrassing. Occasionally he realized it and laughed loudly to cover himself, but sometimes he didn't see his mistake (example: Goldie is introduced to the variety presenter Gary Moore of the fifties and is said, "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore. "She shakes hands and says (much to her confusion)," I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore! "). But like Toni Simmons it's quite different. She is desperately in love with dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian told her that his wife (with whom he had two children and a daughter) will never divorce him. So, at the beginning of the film, Toni tries to commit suicide with the gas from his stove. But she is saved by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a dramatist in difficulty, who breaks into his apartment and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni is resigned to live, but sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) will not stop Julian's work schedule to hand him the phone when Igor calls. Instead Julian finds the letter and runs to Toni's apartment, only to find it alive. When Igor supports his story that he tried to kill himself, Julian realizes the depth of his love and decides to marry a woman like that. Unfortunately Toni has swallowed Julian's lies and believes in his wife and children. See, Julian has no wife and children. Since Toni firmly believes he can't marry a man who would lie to her, Julian is stuck on a weakening tree branch. <br /> <br /> Julian manages to solve it by making him believe that he is the lady. Winston. Stephanie opposes it at first, but alone, on her first free Saturday, she confronts Toni in Toni's record store. They talk and Toni notices all the strengths of Stephanie's character and personality (and since Stephanie has her two grandchildren with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's children). Toni tells Julian that they have to see who the man Stephanie should marry is. So the lie begins to spiral for Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon a lover is given to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and freelance patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so shabby (Stephanie hates him) that Toni feels he's not worthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And so on, with a complication (most caused by the well-intentioned, uninformed Toni) that follows another up to the conclusion. The screenplay is full of first-rate situations and jokes (eg Julian to reward Stephanie for lying about their marriage, buys two records from Toni's store. She gave Toni a ferret, but decides to send it to Stephanie with Julian Stephanie's card is happy enough to get the mink, but she doesn't say a word about the nature of the gift she received - when she warmly thanks Matthau, says she'd like Horowitz - which means Vladomir Horowitz. furrier!). <br /> <br /> Bergman must have enjoyed the shoot, as many scenes show that earthy radiance that was a mark for her in the 1940s movies. But there was also the resemblance to his successful 1958 film, INDISCREET. There Cary Grant lied to make sure that the couple would focus on the romance of their relationship without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman, he decides to lie to convince Grant that she's getting him caught. Here, instead of being the passive lover who believes that Matthau is telling the truth, Bergman cautiously tries to get Matthau out of his mess with little white lies, only to discover that one leads to another to complicate everyone's life. Bergman is seen as a good woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All the protagonists behave well, in particular Bergman, first the accuracy of the business but gradually they claim it sexuality. Matthau is delicious as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that cannot simply be put aside. The supporting cast, particularly Weston as the mooching and the sexually slimy Harvey, and Vito Scotti as the Ambassador of the U.N. which actually has tits for Bergman. It was a clever comedy and a great way to advance Goldie Hawn's film career.
