I completely disagree with the other comments! I also saw this film in a first screening and found it very funny. Robin Williams is in top form. True, the tone is familiar, but it's Williams of Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny, on the point. After too many turns in the dark, Williams is finally back to what he does best. Support actors give great shows, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself, as usual, but as an "agent" of the next president it has been a pleasure on screen every time. Lewis Black basically plays only himself, but is wonderfully used here. There is also a fun twist by Jeff Goldblum. The film is more than the trailer suggests. The film is fun, but it's not a pure comedy as suggested. It has a thread of thrillers, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
