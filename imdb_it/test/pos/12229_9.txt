A tender film that represents the way in which our daily life is a catalyst that makes us change our thoughts, behaviors and emotions in people we are not. This story is a love story in which real emotions arise. I deserve Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates for outstanding performance. A film that is certainly worth seeing, an itinerant journey that turns into an emotional turning point. I suggest to see it.
