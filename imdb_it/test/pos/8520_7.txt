Yes, it's Sean Connery who plays Bond again, he seems more alive and in his part than ever since the first time they made this film, in 1965, when it was called "Thunderball". But the language is so firmly in place that one wonders if Connery is not employing some tricks observed by his friend and more humorous successor, Roger Moore. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual trip. The only serious film by Bond, unrealized under the aegis of the classic Eon Bond series, "Never Say Never Again" is an irreverent return to the well. Soft in action, it is nevertheless strong in character and in intelligent dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, it's clear right away, is an unfavorable man. No matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle. "Too many free radicals, this is your problem ... Caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, too many martinis." "Then I'll cut the white bread, sir," replies Bond elegantly. <br /> <br /> A sequence of early combat in a spa represents the climax of the film's action, with Bond and a striker making his way through a kitchen, a bedroom and a workshop before Bond finally blame his opponent, ironically with a little help from those free radicals. Humor is freely applied in the film, rather smarter than most of Moore's releases, although Connery seems to have enjoyed letting go of Moore's less self-serving example. <br /> <br /> Was it because he was doing a good part of the gross? Or was he working for the less stingy producers? Whatever it is, the script serves its relaxed style well, and the result is richer and more enjoyable than Connery's previous two releases of Ener Bond, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever". <br /> <br /> The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond, whether it was Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Legwarmers, video games and bad sports cars are all in evidence, and Bianca Jagger Klaus Maria Brandauer's sunglasses are seen wearing in her first scene do not do him any favors. Forget the first impressions. The role of Brandauer as head of the villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in every James Bond film, with Brandauer playing pleasantly the threat and mania of his character. At one point, he allows Bond to roam freely in his situation room, with a martini to boot, and his dancing eyes and crazy and engaging smile make an irresistible company. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film, besides Connery, are the Bond girls, taken with more attention to the personality of the normal in the Bond movies, a testimony by director of photography Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner . Barbara Carrera was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as Fatima Blush villainess, just as crazy as Largo and even more beautiful to watch. She doesn't last the whole movie; you almost need her to leave to focus on others. <br /> <br /> The breasts and buttocks of Kim Basinger should have had their agents for the time of the screen in which they entered this film, but I'm not complaining. Basinger is a rare beauty that in this first role as Largo's lover mixes an incredible aura with a childish vulnerability that brings out the Bond in me, and many others suspect. (His lips and cheekbones are also pretty sweet.) <br /> <br /> It's not a well-made film. It's a knockoff of a better Bond movie with a sloppy storyline, a terrible score and a flat final. But he has Connery, proving that his was the final take on the definitive secret agent of the cinema, even if he steals one or two pages of my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is pretty funny, so I'm not complaining.
