This film for me and my wife is more fun than all the violent thrillers / mystery / murders that abound en masse. It's about the real people who make the best of their lives. They are simply Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. Realistic acting and great scenery make up for the slightly implausible plot. The soundtrack is by BC Smith, who also made the Coyote Waits soundtrack and is fantastic. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who is a bit prone to accidents and Wes Studi is the skeptical, highly professional detective. There are many other supporting roles or cameos by Graham Greene, Cardinal Tantoo, etc. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we loved it.
