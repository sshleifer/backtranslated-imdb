I was 20, I just graduated from college when this movie appeared. Seeing was an event of great impact, not only for the high quality of the film (as evidenced by the numerous awards), but also for its place in the historical context of 1959. Due to social progress since then, it is almost impossible for understand that my college had only begun to admit (discredited) black students in 1953. A mainstream, high-budget extravaganza with an almost completely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959. <br /> <br /> The film was given a luxury roadshow (reserved seat) presentation only in the best theaters, complete with a souvenir program detailing the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color, multitrack stereo sound, etc. Almost every black entertainer we whites had the knowledge of was in the film. Gershwin's music, superbly performed, and the pure universal humanity of the story has been tremendously moving. <br /> <br /> I was recently able to get a faded copy of a two-hour cut of the film, and repeated views confirmed my opinion. Time has made what appeared to be a hot sex scene in 1959, but the musical quality has not diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portraits. What a crime that today's young black artists can't see these artists at the height of their careers!
