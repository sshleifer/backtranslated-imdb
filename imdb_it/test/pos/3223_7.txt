Every time I watch this show, I just want to turn it off and curse the producers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogues, or rather the monologues, while all infinitely complain about nothing, are becoming so boring. For example, the episode I saw yesterday began with a seemingly boundless wandering about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs maybe) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into a total war. And these were only a few seconds. <br /> <br /> So it seems every time, many lines, with absolutely zero contents. The scripts they use must be huge. <br /> <br /> But then sometimes something happens. The stuttering stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent and emotional moments. For example, this week was Lorelai's breakup with the real estate agent. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It almost does everything it's worth.
