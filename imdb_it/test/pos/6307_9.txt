Elegant, stimulating, fresh and engaging ?? only four aspects of a film that will long remain in the thoughts of this viewer. <br /> <br /> The slow pace could be at the beginning, but the director seduces with a beautiful photographic work, sophisticated compositions and elegant editing. The unfolding of history, not so much the narrative line but the revelation of the characters' inner selves, is masterful. <br /> <br /> Olivia Magnani, who plays Sophia, the hotel receptionist, who finally breaks the ice the reserve of the former councilor Titta of Girolami (Tony Servillo) is of a very cold beauty and reveals depth hidden and personal honesty in his brief but profound relationship with Girolami. <br /> <br /> The average Mafia man who fell into disgrace, forced to live an empty life, tormented by insomnia, in a Swiss hotel, is captured in the equally empty lives of the refined elderly couple who once owned the hotel, but now they are forced to live there as residents after the husband played away the resources years ago. The husband constantly dreams of recovering his lost wealth and making a great declaration to the world. His wife realizes that this is just an impossible dream. This contrasts positively with the resignation of Girolami who sees no way out and does not look for it. <br /> <br /> The fleeting love story between Girolami and Sophia has consequences that no one could have foreseen. It allows him to escape from his prison without a bar but to pay a huge price that he willingly accepts and in doing so offers redemption for the older couple.
