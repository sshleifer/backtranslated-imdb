Peter Strauss, by nature of appearing in miniseries and films made for TV, often gets an unjustly high percentage of negative reviews - usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film, with the channel blown in halfway through. Well, I've just read all the other 20 reviews for this movie and I'm glad to see not a single bad word spoken on The Jericho Mile - This should be enough to blow you up to buy this movie !! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it once will show you why he deserved it so much ... <br /> <br /> Trying to be objective, I have attempted to criticize this film. Instead, I found myself discussing all my possible finesse. This is the real realistic film. This is not the typical Hollywood sensationalism, where everything is exaggerated - It's so realistic and true to life that people thought they were based on a real event !!
