The DVD jacket that this movie came in describes as "uplifting and fun". Those are not the words I would have chosen, not for a long time. I would choose a word like "dark", sometimes even "depressing". Which doesn't mean it's a bad movie. In reality it is a rather beautiful film, with good performances by the protagonists, with enough uncertainty about what will happen in the end that you continue to watch. The uncertainty stems from the film's structure - it seems to revolve around Ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer, while being interviewed by the district attorney. So we know from the beginning that something suspicious happened at the end - the questions are "what?" and who? "<br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was as good as Ellen - the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and work in New York to go home to take care of her sick mother "Ellen evolves through the film - more than any other character - as she learns to deal with both her parents' strengths and weaknesses. Her relationship with her father (William Hurt) is quite interesting. My initial impression was that they were close enough, but the warts in the report begin to show after a while Hurt was effective as a detached husband, not indifferently detached, but in the sense of not being able to cope with what is happening to his wife and to try to escape from it in various ways.In the end, Meryl Streep as the cancer-stricken Kate was very convincing in her role, trying to live what remains of her life in the most satisfying way possible, then facing the rabb who feels for his growing debilitation. In a sense, looking at a family agreement with this type of crisis reminded me of a bit of "common people", even though this film was much less emotionally intense. So, not "edifying and humorous" (with all due respect to those who wrote the synopsis on the DVD cover) but very good in his own way. 7/10
