Millions of gold travel by train to the United States treasure. Traveling along is Lois Lane to report on it. Along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves. Detach the car with the armed guards and attack the rest. This leads to a vicious struggle between the remaining guards and the thieves. The thieves manage to overpower them but then Lois Lane jumps in. Eliminate the thieves from the train (at one point using a gun) but the train begins to lose control. Lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. The good thing is that Superman is coming! <br /> <br /> Rapid, exciting and non-stop action. Probably one of the best cartoons of all. Simply fantastic
