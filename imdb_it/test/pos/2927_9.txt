I tell you even though it's funny how these bad words are in this case, I'm sure the number of swear words and swear words would probably count to around 200 because from what I've heard the most swear words on a South Park episode is 165 counts of word s ** t but apart from that it is so funny because in it there are bad words and also pedophiles that are shot in the head. Watch this for your own survival and also look for hints of father carters and even the annoying voice of Chris Hanssseeeen and also kyle must save the cartman from pedophiles (the catch of a predator show is also on dateline) and trace a peado towards the low and when the peado arrived "he shot himself"
