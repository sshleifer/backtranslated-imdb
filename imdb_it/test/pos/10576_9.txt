I'm usually disappointed with what the media calls "lesbian" movies these days: bisexual killers; homicidal psychotic lesbians; women who experiment with other women, but eventually end up with men; ridiculously beautiful women who fit together just to light men, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, FINGERSMITH is on a very tall pedestal above this garbage. It is a believable love story played MARVELOUSLY by each cast member, down to the minimum of secondary actors. In addition to having a very engaging central conflict, the love story between heroines is well developed and credible thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. <br /> <br /> I also saw COLLECT VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is far superior to the first, both in character development / conflict and acting quality. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is both satisfying and fun to watch, offering lesbians everywhere a big sequel to BOUND.
