Where do I start? Let me say that - after seeing the whole movie and the peculiarities of the DVD - my wife and I again watched the entire movie with the comment of the director in execution. I don't remember ever enduring more than 7 minutes of this movie comment. It is worth listening to. <br /> <br /> I'm not a southern guy, but I spent some time in Memphis a long time ago and got an idea of ​​the area. This film smells almost like the south, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actors of all time, is as magnificent as emotionally bent Lazarus, and Christina Ricci gives the interpretation of a life like Rae, a woman who was seriously injured during her short life. I've always liked Ms. Ricci's work, but in this performance she gives 137% of herself every second that appears on the screen. Prizes and figurines are not enough to reward her for what she puts before the public in this film. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so I'm just commenting on the work. I had heard the name Justin Timberlake before seeing "BSM", but I had no idea what he looked like or why he was famous. Shaking your head at 60, I'm out of your demographic target, to say the least. After seeing this movie I will recognize it. He can act! It gives a substantial and credible performance as a loving soul mate of the provincial bitch. <br /> <br /> The director is from Memphis and shows reverence for his home region. He is also a good storyteller. <br /> <br /> ..... and I have to mention the music. I love the Blues and the soundtrack of Black Snake Moan is a real party for a blues fan. <br /> <br /> I am writing less consistently than usual because my enthusiasm for this film is going beyond my sentence structure. See this movie, and I mean now.
