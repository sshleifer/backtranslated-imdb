I would like to know if anyone knows how I can get a copy of the film, "That's the way of the World". It's been about 30 years since I saw this movie, and I'd like to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcends the nation globally with their music and inspirational themes. It was a pity that this group did not take off like their counterparts in the early 1970s, but as previously stated, racial tensions existed in the United States prohibiting equalized exposure for African American musical groups. It's nice to see Earth Wind & Fire continue their success. I would like to add this film to my collection. Someone, please, help me if possible. Thanks for the attention. Milton Shaw
