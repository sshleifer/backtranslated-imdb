Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent, beautifully comic fantasy. Built on the basis of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds crosses the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to immediately immerse yourself in the action. In the process, Tarantino solves one of the main flaws of The Dirty Dozen giving time to the bad guys to remind us how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screens end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters. <br /> <br /> Sculpting the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and resistant. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that any Tarantino movie will have a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to make the French talk to the French and the Germans speak German, besides adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino has he also ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp, fun and intelligent as in his dialogue in English. <br /> <br /> Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi colonel "Jewish hunter" Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is questioning the French farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a Jewish family. While applying subtle pressure on LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily swallowing, Landa compliments LaPadite with his daughters and cows, "a votre famille et vos vaches, je dis bravo". The fact is that in French "vache" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar game, Landa could say quite convincingly that he did not understand French well enough to have understood it that way, but Landa understands it this way and considers it a threat. And LaPadite understands its meaning all too well. <br /> <br /> This is a really subtle piece of acting and pun that many viewers would never take, or at least could understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich in that kind of detail. All the French and English dialogues are chosen with the same attention to detail and while I cannot swear to German, I suspect it shows a similar level of skill. <br /> <br /> Inglourious Basterds opens with the phrase "Once upon a time ... in Nazi occupied France". Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and film, another comic fantasy in a war-occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is strangely funny in some places, although the film also becomes obscure. <br /> <br /> In its most serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first victims of the war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost all the elongated sequences of the film, Tarantino finds a new way of building cruel tension to almost unbearable levels. <br /> <br /> Tarantino also reminds us that the film is dangerous, even flammable and that its power deserves respect. <br /> <br /> If you can watch this film as I did in a theater full of well-informed fans who understand every line, you will see this masterful film as it should be seen. If you're not so lucky, all you'll see is a great big movie that offers an obscurely funny punch.
