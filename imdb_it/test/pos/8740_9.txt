This film has not remained exactly in the minds of film lovers, and it is a shame to cry. His witty adaptation to the script should have compensated for the Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's adaptation and Ingrid Bergman's impeccable performance. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman, with over a decade younger than her 54 years - fifty-four! When it is on the screen, it shines positively. <br /> <br /> This is a film that may seem dated at the beginning, but actually made me want to be around during the sixties. Hawn's fashions are as uncomfortable as Bergman's. (This is a secondary flaw - is his character not a little too fit for a girl who still lives with her sister? But then again, would we have Ingrid in another way?) Slipped Disc? <br /> <br /> The best compliments I can pay for this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that I never saw, and that left me wanting more. Speaking of wanting more, I wonder what the sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz ever became? (He looks like Griffin Dunne in this movie.) This was his film debut, and I don't see any other important role in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, he has done so much since then it's easy not to be impressed, but I can't even imagine any other actor in the role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is based on a game, the delivery of the line may seem a bit of an internship, but it did not prevent my enjoyment at all. In fact, I'm amazed at how much fun it is after more than thirty-five years. Since this film represents a bygone era, it has unfairly slipped from the consciousness of cinephiles. It is more related to the films of the era that preceded it than those that followed. But don't let it stop you from enjoying the delights it has to offer. Degree: A
