Definitely the best film directed by Claude Lelouch after "L'aventure c'est l'aventure". The inspiration of Jacques Brel's life is truly present. Richard Anconina and Jean-Paul Belmondo have interpreted a truly incredible duo and are truly fantastic in the psychological discovery of the two characters they are playing.
