In New York, a group of freshmen enrolled at High School for the Performing Arts after successfully completing their audition. For four years their dreams, deceptions, successes, love and personal dramas are revealed through insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), confident Coco (Irene Cara), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and their friends until graduation day. <br /> <br /> Twenty-eight years ago, "Fame" was a great success, with the story of teenagers looking for a place in the show, and I loved this movie and the CD soundtrack. I have just seen "Fame" on DVD, and currently I would say that it is a good movie with great potential only, but with too many defective subplots. The plot follows too many characters and leaves many situations unanswered. I don't know if Alan Parker had problems with editing to reduce the running time of this film, but what happened, for example, with the dancer who goes to a clinic to have an abortion? What happened to Leroy and his teacher, failed because of his grammatical problem? What happened to Coco after stripping her blouse in that swindler's apartment? The musician who plays the synthesizer and his proud father remained in the subplot. However, "Fame" is still a delightful entertainment and a cult film for me. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fame" ("Fame")
