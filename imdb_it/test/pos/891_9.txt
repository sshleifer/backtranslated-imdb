Created by Dennis Spooner, the "Department S" was a brilliant thriller on an offshoot of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve puzzling mysteries that the police could not handle. If a plane had landed at Heathrow with no one on board, if a man had been found wandering in London in a space suit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly turned into a skeleton, if a train entered a station on the subway turned out to contain dead commuters, you called "Department S" to fix things. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde played "Jason King", a dramatically dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped solve many of the bizarre cases. King captured the public's imagination and was later rewarded with a spin-off. He was ably assisted by the American "Stuart Sullivan" (Joel Fabiani) and the delightful "Annabelle Hurst" (Rosemary Nicols). Unusually for a 1960s show, the department was led by a black man - "Sir Curtis Seretse" (Dennis Alaba Peters). If the show looked very similar to "The Avengers", it wasn't surprising. He shared many of the same writers and directors! The colorful titles were designed by Chambers & Partners and are worth tuning yourself. As happened with so many I.T.C. series, the music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for "Department S" must be considered one of the best television themes of all time. <br /> <br /> Predictably, the show looks a bit sexist and dated now, but don't let this disaffect you from it. Imagine a hybrid of the films "Jonathan Creek" and "Austin Powers" and you have "Department S"! <br /> <br /> Trivia Notes: the episode "A Small War Of Nerves" a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in an important role!
