OK, I got the DVD set last week and I'm finally moving to post my reviews, but I really enjoyed this sequel in many ways. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead. OK. This movie in a quick clip has some really good gore effects and a really well done atmosphere and style. Actually I would say that this could be one of the most elegant DV gestures I bought. Most of the time, I get very angry with DV movies for being boring and looking like soap operas. Even a film like Bone Sickness that I like has some incredible features of DULL. Not this movie. It never stops long enough for you to catch your breath. Although I wouldn't say that I liked it better than the first film, I will say that Sheets has certainly improved technically in the two years between one film and another. This has the best gore, the inevitable zombie scenes that feed, the rude characters and some returning actors (even if their roles are different) mainly Jerry Angell as a good psychopath with a hellhole trumpet. The shots are more ambitious and the script this time, because you can say that Sheets is trying to shoot much higher than him in the first movie. Some work and some don't, but I have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to make a bigger version of the first movie. This time there was no mention of a chemical shedding power plant, only Satanism and the occult bringing the undead back to life. So I say congratulations to Mr. Sheets for trying to do something different with this. I give this movie two damn thumbs!
