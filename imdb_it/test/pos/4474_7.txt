The story begins with a soldier transported to a city in the desert, then he goes back in time to tell how he got to this place. He started as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt, but was separated from his unit. After almost starving and / or dying of thirst, he came across a leopard that somehow became his heartfelt friend. He got him food and in a short time the soldier became almost totally wild, so his connection with the animal was acute. But all things end and the man decided that it was necessary for him to leave the creature. A very strange film, well written and portrayed. Beautiful landscapes from Jordan and Utah that don't always blend perfectly, but who cares.
