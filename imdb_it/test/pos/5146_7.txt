My family (two 40-somethings, an 8-year-old and my 71-year-old mother) saw it premiered on April 29th. We really liked the movie. The story was good, and knowing that it was based on real events made it much more pleasant. Luke Wilson was a real fun (word game) to watch as Tim Blake Nelson was. And seeing Neil Flynn playing something other than "Scrubs' bad janitor" was nice. The children in the film did well and I'm sure they will all appeal to some demographics at the heartbreaker level. The images were simply enchanting and Jimmy Buffet's music added to the "Florida feel". OK, maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can't compare it to the book, honestly I hadn't heard of it until the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a NICE movie and had a good message. Clear and simple.
