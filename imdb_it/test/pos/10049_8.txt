This is a wonderful film like a movie - it gets an 8 out of 10. As a piece of accurate story footage ... you want to be more loving, but it's a 5 out of 10. And I think I'm actually very charitable. <br /> <br /> What it was like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest "boy" general in the Union army of the American civil war, and ended up dying with all his command in the most great military victory of the Indian tribes of North America? Bounded, militant, irritating, bloodied, ambitious, intelligent, too intelligent, Indian, Indian friend (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, Grant / Lee and Sherman / Jackson. It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career, the excessive ambition of inspiration, that his reputation has decreased. Yet, to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best figure remembered in the military annals of our history to lose his last fight (I can't really think of a similar one - perhaps General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan March of Death - but Wainwright survived March and World War II). <br /> <br /> Custer has appeared in multiple films of much better generals, due to Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Too bad the details of the real career were never treated as lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn treated them in this film. But even in 1941 the legend was still powerful. Olivia De Haviland played Libby Custer, who was recently highlighted in another film review on this thread, which survived George until 1933, so his effective treatment of the story was still in effect eight years later. Custer was seen as our rebellious but courageous errant knight, and with the shadow of the approaching Second World War, we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it. <br /> <br /> So we have the impression that it was a hot stimulus, but it was patriotic. Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the 1861 class, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about a fighter that year. You see, most of the so-called West Point military talent (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy. The Union needed all the men of the northern "point" they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer's civil war career should be studied more closely - he was attached to the General's staff - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and in other wars of east front But he was a knight - and he would stand up under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman, his friend Phil Sheridan, in the later parts of the war. In particular, he served with a touch of distinction in the Battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley. He also struck Custer personally (his close friend at West Point, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all last night). <br /> <br /> After the war things went to pieces. He wanted to make his patent - permanent Major Generalship (he wasn't, since it was a battlefield promotion). They had only one colonel from the Ten. To give him the army shrunken along the border. He tried to do politics, making the mistake of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political journey in 1866, and finding most of the Nordics hated Johnson as an idiot idiot. He presumably admired the Indians (he was certainly eloquent in writing about them and the West), but in 1868 he caused a genuine military slaughter of Indian women and children that ended in court martial. Later, during the 1870s, he supported Indian claims against a circle of politicians (who went as far as Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian merchants for profit. He ruined Belknap and left a black eye on Grant's administration. He put him in the kennel with Grant and Sherman (who was the former commander of Belknap), and Sheridan barely saved his career. He was then sent to the Big Horn final campaign. And immortality has arrived. <br /> <br /> That career deserves a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we keep a man from 1850 - 1876 by 2007 standards? Would we like it done in a hundred years? It certainly could happen, but I'm not sure we would like it. <br /> <br /> Custer (1941 style) adapted to Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a "dance" performance in any of his main films. His final film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character. In supporting actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn they did very well as friends, enemies, or even treacherous traitors (Kennedy). As a fun piece of myth that keeps it high - but as a study of a complex military hero it's not what it should be.
