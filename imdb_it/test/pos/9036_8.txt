I described this film as surprising ... this is true in many respects. The subject (the black man wrongly accused), the characters (the people you expect to be stereotypes often show unusual attitudes during the film), the production ... <br /> <br /> All these factors make an unusual unusual film, especially for his time (1949). The only possible spoilers are sometimes disconcerting dialogues and the occasional high moral position. <br /> <br /> But if you happen to see it while you weren't going to watch a movie, you could find yourself like me - stay up in the middle of the night just to see what happens. <br /> <br />
