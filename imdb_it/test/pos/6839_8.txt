This was the first directing work by Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and this was doozy. A kidnapping and a woman were shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case and the police chief (Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which appears to be the wife of a senator (Hal Holbrook). These two make an exceptional pair while working together. <br /> <br /> The kidnappers / murderers have the lovers Simon Baker (The land of the dead) and the ultra hot Carla Gugino (Sin City), along with a couple of partners. They kidnapped a computer hotshot tycoon and run his accountant throughout the city before getting the dough. Things pass quickly from there, when new twists are introduced. Everything is brilliant and definitely a "piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something" thrill. <br /> <br /> Now, to be completely honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie than the security guard was looking at the opening. I would have liked to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that was not part of the caper; just icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman should definitely do more movies together. A surprise: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: So, fill me up. Detective Friedman: That observation could be interpreted as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's stop: you have never worked with a superior woman before. I got to where I'm pushing the paper and playing well - I've never fired a gun before, I'm alone in this job to prove to my father that I'm not a coward. I give a dignified head, so I was promoted before all the worthy candidates, all men, all equally gifted with fellatio, but there was a gender quota to be filled. I'm also stupid and idealistic; you are tough and cynical, and usually fair. I am secretly in love with you but I have difficulty showing it. Did I miss something? <br /> Damn it, it's a great dialogue! Gutierrez not only directs a great film, but he can also write! <br /> <br /> And did I say that Carla Gugino was sexy? <br /> <br /> Put this on your list.
