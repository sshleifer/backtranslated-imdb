This is one of Chaplin's first national films of the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature features of United Artists. More opulent than Mutual films, Chaplin's quest continues to perfect his comic expression. Most people forget that the movie is actually a dream that Charlie has been waiting to be sent to the front. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of slapstick through the Limburger cheese that is used to carbonate the enemy, and Chaplin's incursion into enemy territory dressed as a tree. <br /> <br /> In this phase of this career, the great man had become so immersed in the filmic expression that his films gave the impression of making themselves. Undoubtedly it was not the case, but still, it gives a convincingly realistic view of life in the first place, as I can remember, even if from an ironically ironic perspective. <br /> <br /> For my part, familiarity with Chaplin's entire work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles - don't delay!
