Simon Wests' pg-13 thriller about a babysitter receiving joker calls while sitting in a villa is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good movie. Although there are some elements of suspense, good taste for the eyes and decent characters, the film is just another, I know what you did last summer, because it was not taken seriously. The performances were fine, but nothing special with this film, I say skip, unless you are looking for a mediocre movie, you can find better movies than this for life, sometimes, ok maybe not for life but at least in the States United or something, haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
