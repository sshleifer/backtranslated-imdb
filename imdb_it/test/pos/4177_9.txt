Head should have been a moment of pride not only for his stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or his director / co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also his other co-author (and short cameo) Jack Nicholson . As it is, most of them seem to avoid it, and for outsiders the film is considered, at best, to be a curiosity. <br /> <br /> While the TV series was famous for the Beatles antics "Help!", this film is also judged by the same agreement, yet far from the sad and painful films of the overrated Beatles, and even from the dated series Monkees TV, Head has a layer of depth A subterranean current of the darker nature of man is at work here, and while it may seem a bizarre thing to say about a manufacturing pop band, the use of some themes and images (hit women, laughing at cripples and real footage of a Vietcong POW shot at point blank) gives the film an advantage to which many "serious" films would not dare to aspire. <br /> <br /> There are also funny moments, ranging from parodies of James Bond to the Big Victor and my favorite, Mickey Dolenz under the guidance of Arab soldiers on horseback. (One of them turns to Mickey and hisses 'pssst!', Only for the 'pssst!' To appear in the subtitles !) The group is aware of its image produced in the film ('I' m the dummy, Mickey ?? I 'always the mannequin', says Tork, summarizing perfectly his one-dimensional role in the series), in the sense that their characters ?? do they sound 'themselves' acting and not acting here? they open up more, and consequently are less generic and irritating than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness absorbs even their fabulous origins, with more subtle Maharishi traps and acknowledgments with a waitress who asks: "Well, if it is not God's gift to the eight-year-olds" you are still paying homage to Ringo Starr "Listen to Tork too, whistling 'Strawberry Fields Forever' while you're in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Then there are the songs, of course. Six of them here, a little more psychedelic than usual, who might have alienated their fan base, and even a Frank Zappa cameo would not have turned their appeal to an adult audience at this point, probably the best is the charming 'As We Go Along', although the first, a song by Porpoise named after Carol King, speaks in an interesting way about the desire to live while time passes inexorably and death is getting closer and closer, on a lighter note, her "porpoise ride" refrain seems to be a direct mickey-take of "I am the Walrus". <br /> <br /> Constantly inventive with direct references to silent cinema and drug culture, perhaps the best feature of Head is its narrative structure. Isn't he the only one ?? but the most important ?? which is why it improves with more visualizations, the story goes left, right, forward, backward, circular and through different levels of reality. In essence, a series of sketches hanging together, its cohesion is tightened by the space-time challenging plot that blocks its internal logic together by means of flashbacks, dream sequence, prison of the mind and remote control channel change. <br /> <br /> With a perfect start and end, this cleverly written clever film was not what the pre-teen audience of The Monkees expected and later suffered a negative critical reception. Now those expectations are gone, this desperately needs a serious revaluation.
