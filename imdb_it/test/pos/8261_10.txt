Please let me know about any version of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth in video that people might be aware of. I love Mary Webb's books with all my heart and would be very grateful to have any information on VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, which are my favorites of Mary Webb, many times, and she has also collected other novels from her. I was lucky to have found his "Springs of Joy" poetry and essay, but I was never able to see the version of Precious Bane that was on Masterpiece Theater, or the full version of Gone to Earth, although there was a American film The classic airing of The Wild Heart, a muffled version of the original Gone to Earth film. <br /> <br /> If someone can help me get copies of one or both of these films (full versions), I would be so grateful!
