Waco: Rules of Engagement does a great job not to draw conclusions for its viewers. It simply presents interviews, footage from the stall, videos of congressional hearings, telephone conversations, expert testimony, etc. It allows you to draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> I do not mean to imply that the data presented here was done 100% objectively but is very convincing. You will not like Koresh anymore after seeing him, but I tend to think that you will end up believing, as now, there is a lot that we were not told what happened before and during the stall.
