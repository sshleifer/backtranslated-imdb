The plot is quite original and all the actors did their job well. There is also a lot of comic relief. Some things don't make much sense (for example, the first "hunting" scene, because heroin shouldn't just hide out somewhere and wait for the bad guys to leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without an accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models that extend like 50 years, and therefore the place seems strangely timeless. Overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like it too.
