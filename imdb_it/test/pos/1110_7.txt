This film has used its settings really well with some incredible, dark and disturbing shots that the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you looking. Modern Love has worked well in this year's Gold Coast Film Fantastic program offering the public a taste of an Australian cinema that is usually overlooked. The most important thing is that it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not accept the clich√©s characters and stories we have seen killed over the years. This film compliments any festival and will open a debate after its screenings. The performances and the characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic. An interesting exploration of family relationships and environments.
