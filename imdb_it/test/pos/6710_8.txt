Is it a perfect movie? No. It is a strange adaptation of a science fiction book and includes space vampires, naked beauties and the efficiency of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie I was quite young and all I can remember is the feeling of wonder at the film and Mathilda May. Actually, if it weren't for this beautiful woman to be naked throughout the film, I probably wouldn't have considered her so high, but given her magnificence, I'm now thinking of voting for her! <br /> <br /> Fortunately for me I remembered the movie and watched it again now. Imagine the special effects Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist scattered around a rather decent science fiction story, but with performances completely above the best. I loved the film (besides Mathilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, compared to the shit movies they make today and actually wanting more when it's done. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: if you are a science fiction fan you are not allowed to lose this movie. Oh, and did I mention that Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
