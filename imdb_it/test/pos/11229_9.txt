It is a pity that this film is classified as the PG 13 - it is really suitable for everyone - even if the kids might not follow it too well. <br /> <br /> Belongs to that wonderful genre of serious-comic ghost / angel stories that should include everything from "It's A Wonderful Life" by Capra to Wenders' Wings of Desire. <br /> <br /> Photography is amazing, acting of the highest quality and - wonder of wonders - the tone is uplifting. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two intertwined stories seem initially mysteriously intriguing; but they resolve a little too well for my taste. As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients in Irwin's story are on the bedside table. Symbolism is just a little too much for me. <br /> <br /> But what a lark! My favorite scene must be when the transfer team tries to have breakfast in a restaurant. This is practically theatrical in its magic - a tour de force of a witty acting - subtle, playful and positively rhythmic - coupled with a surprising cinematography and a sharp look for the grotesque. <br /> <br /> "Northfork" is fun, touching, beautiful to watch, magical (with the above reservations) and does not have a single chase. <br /> <br /> An easy nine star.
