I enjoyed some of the old Doctor Who many years ago, so when the new one came out, I just had to take a look. I was so happy - with the characters, the narrative lines, the updated aspect, I became hooked! From season 1 (27 for old fans) to season 2 (28), it continues to improve. It also binds to old shows, although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this latest version. <br /> <br /> Although there was a change of cast, I highly recommend Doctor Who - with Chris Eccleston E with David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that they gave the characters so much depth. The Doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because it's the last TimeLord. The range of emotions that Chris and David show are truly remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger and sense of adventure with them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to every episode, although she is much braver than I would be. With his talent, Billie will go far in the field.
