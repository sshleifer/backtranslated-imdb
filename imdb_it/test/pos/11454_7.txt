The 80s are largely considered the decade when horror decided to have fun. Sometimes, behind everything there were some definite brains ("Evil Dead II", "Night of the Creeps" and "The return of the living dead", for example) and then there were those films that were mindless but had a decidedly low charm. and they were perfect for a night with beer and friends. Films like "Pieces" and "Blood Diner" on the shelves of the 80s and 90s offer little intelligence or craftsmanship, but plenty of stupid entertainment. Kevin Tenney's 1988 movie "Night of the Demons" is part of this tradition - stupid, misinterpreted and not an original bone in his body, but damn if you don't enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simplistic that it only has to come from the 80s: a group of stupid boys played by a group of actors between the mid and late 1920s decide to go to a party at Hull House launched by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (The legend of Scream Queen, Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and co. decide to organize a seance. This turns out to be the "Arrested Development" character of Will Arnett that Gob would call "A big mistake", because a demonic force soon possesses Angela, and begins to reach out to others. <br /> <br /> Take "The Evil Dead", "A nightmare on Elm Street" and your typical stupid dead movie, throw them in a blender and "Night of the Demons" is what you get. The film is anything but original and, in reality, it is not a good film. Everything is madly derived, the acting is terrible, the beats often fall flat, the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the holes in the plot are numerous. It's still a lot of fun. Then why? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, the effects of make up and gore are top notch, with some really memorable moments (especially a bad and a little weird with a tube of lipstick) that really stand out . Rarely, even if he never takes it too seriously, but with the exception of some terrible puns, he plays straight and never wastes the audience's time with winking self-awareness. Furthermore, there is a certain amount of energy and enthusiasm for the whole enterprise that is almost impossible to resist. Yes, it's nothing special, but he knows it, and he couldn't be more proud of it. He's a crazy party horror film, and he never claims to be anything else. <br /> <br /> It may not be a classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of good horror junk food. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you don't want a cool beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
