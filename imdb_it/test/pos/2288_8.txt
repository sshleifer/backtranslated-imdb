This has always been my favorite movie. I owned a VHS copy, and a couple of months ago I found a DVD version that is also part of my video collection. I'm also a big baseball fan and, during my off-season reading, I took a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book "You Gotta Have WA", which details the details of Japanese baseball and the challenges foreign players have encountered play in Japan. As I started reading yesterday, it made me think of this film, because it seems that the script was almost literally based on this book. The parallels are disturbing. The character of Jack Elliot looks a lot like Bob Horner, an old MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate Leon Lee is also depicted in the character Max "Hammer" Dubois, a veteran of the Japanese league who has made peace with the frustrations of the Japanese game, and helps keep his teammate healthy. The character of Elliot goes through the same sequence of encounters of Horner, from the great fanfare to the signature, to the initial success that feeds an already ravenous sports media, and the consequent collapse that causes frustration, alienation from teammates, fans and media, and the consequent disillusionment that requires the desire to return home to the United States. The only difference is that the film adds Hollywood touches like love interest and happy ending. <br /> <br /> Speaking of amorous interests, I'm sure many viewers came to this site (as I did) to look for the actress who played "Hiroko" (the beautiful Aya Takanashi), and which others work you are done. Just list this movie. It turns out, based on an article I read, that the short love scene he has with Tom Selleck (a foreigner) in this film (mild according to our standards - in practice they kiss while he's in the bathtub and wearing a towel) caused such an outrage by the Japanese public (males in particular) that she was never offered another role of any kind, in film or on television - substantially obscured by the Japanese film industry. It's a real shame, because she is (she was) a pretty talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like this film as much for the elements of baseball and cultural differences as I did - go find a copy of "You Gotta Have WA" by Robert Whiting. A good read and an excellent accompanying book for this film.
