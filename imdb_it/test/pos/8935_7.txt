Only the British could make a film like this and make it so pleasantly charming! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more from life, but doesn't know what, when she realizes she's in love with her childhood friend, Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns the local funeral home. Meanwhile, an American mortologist (Christopher Walken) who "wants to put fun in funerals" moves into this small Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and wants to give Boris a run for his money with flashy funerals and thematic. (Star Trek funeral, someone?) Brenda and Boris decide to stage Brenda's death and funeral, with hilarious results. A very funny film - if you are a fan of British comedies like "Waking Ned Devine", you will like it very much.
