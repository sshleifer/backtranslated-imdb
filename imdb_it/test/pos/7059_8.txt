Camp North Star and its extraordinary camp consultant, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) would certainly like to conclude a series of 10-year defeats to rival Camp Mohawk, an ivy-like place where only wealthy children can participate. Meanwhile, let's look at how Tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor Roxanne (Kate Lynch) while other teenagers join in and fall with their heads down. The film takes the lead at the Olympic Camp while rivals compete in competitive athletic competition with Tripper almost realizing that their fate has failed yet another year. The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and a quiet and lonely puppy-eyed Rudy (Chris Makepeace of "Vamp" fame), whose father is often always out. Rudy doesn't seem to adapt to other children of his age and seems to spend most of his time jogging in the morning with Tripper or taking his nuts at Blackjack. The film mostly contains hi-jinx from teenagers who make cuts and jokes. <br /> <br /> You have some sexy consultants, a total Spaz nerd (Jack Blum) with taped glasses and bad acne, "Hardware" beaked nose (Matt Craven) who likes to blow things up , Fink, a fat little boy (Keith Knight) who often thrusts his face, among others in the film. There is a basketball game in which poor Spaz can barely bounce the ball against his rival Camp Mohawk, let alone shoot a precise shot with poor Fink who throws devious throws, between his knees flying over the board. There is a campfire camp (with a scary tale of Tripper on a hooked killer) and boys drooling over pretty ladies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that sometimes he is desperate and tries to squeeze every laugh he can and occasionally indulge in drops of sentimentalism (like the scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray), but just like this recent vision, I I found myself giggling. I'm licked and can't help but love this. It's a summer camp movie through which you simply want to entertain yourself. I can't explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that comes when I see the hand of a sleepy Murray reaching up from the covers for the alarm that is piercing out loud by uttering a summer camp movie is about to begin. His intercom beats are particularly fun. But, the film is, let's be honest, a series of comic cartoons with Murray dead-panning ad infinitum ... there's nothing wrong with that. The film, however, could not survive without him, could it? Hard to even think of this film without Murray in the lead. It is a happier moment and I think the nostalgia for that summer camp experience has a certain influence on why we adults are still in contact with "Meatballs" warmly. And, poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), the head of the field who wants so much things to go smooth, and beat Camp Mohawk for a change, is the constant source of Tripper and the fun of the band while they often play gags on him ... especially when he's sleeping on his bed! Great enthusiastic cast that seems to have as much as us.
