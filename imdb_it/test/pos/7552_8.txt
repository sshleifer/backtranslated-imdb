Four Friends is one of those movies where you go without expectations, just to find yourself running out of loops. You do archive, but then you hear the song "Georgia On My Mind" by Ray Charles, and the vague images and feelings begin to flash on the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember this crazy movie that made you laugh and cry, almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> Why is this film so memorable? First, at least for the people who have experienced all this, because it captures the tenor of the times so well - its dashed hopes, its successes, its sincerity and above all the emotional ride on a roller coaster that leads to a moving nostalgia. And besides, acting is simply fantastic. Danilow, all anguish and passion, Georgia, difficult to grasp like a will or the thread ... but enchanted, anyway, and Louis, the handicapped roommate with the charm to spare those who attack life with taste and take every moment with an ironic smile, because he knows all too well that it could only be the last one. <br /> <br /> How long has it been since you saw a movie that made you really interested in people in the story? Even if they were far from perfect? The film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable, but the film never moralizes, it simply allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety ... even minor characters have a well-defined personality and a story, which is why this movie seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem exaggerated ... because that's how life is, when you think about it. And because this film involves you with a complexity that is defined by the character. Truly an extraordinary and satisfying experience.
