The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was to look at it again (because I missed many things with all the laughs I did). I am European and I studied abroad and I lived with Spanish, French, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, most of the time, people outside, and reading some of the other reviews I see that has taken people out. But this film has stereotypes, so I can't criticize it. Except perhaps the way the French boy has become a drunken party animal. The English boy was the perfect stereotype of "geezer". Drunk, annoying, offensive, but in the end it shines. In addition to stereotypes, the film also corrected the emotional aspect of studying abroad. At first he is shy, he doesn't know anyone, he is missing a home, he doesn't know how to move. Over time it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave, it is extremely difficult. A feeling that people can only understand if they have lived it. I highly recommend this movie.
