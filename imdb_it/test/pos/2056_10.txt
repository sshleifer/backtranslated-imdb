I've seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released in the theater. Anyone who calls this junk or horrible movie does not understand action films or recognizes a good one. Perhaps for some, accidents and outcomes may seem far-fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) has created one of the most well-thought action adventures you've ever encountered. Above or not, this film runs like clockwork and the action keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen in any film. The cast of this movie crackles. Genna Davis gave an exceptional performance and it is a real pity that there has never been a sequel to "LKG". Samuel L. Jackson is exhilarating as his aide Mitch somewhat on his private eye luck trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few dollars. If it baffles me how someone can't like this movie. It contains so many chills and it's so much fun. The jokes of this film still make me laugh 10 years later. In my mind the first Matrix movie and the Long Kiss Goodnight were two of the best and most original action films of the 90s. Incidentally, Shane Black made his fortune when he sold this script. At the time it was the best-selling script and worth every penny. It's so sad that the public has never given a chance to this movie, because they would have seen the best Renny Harlins and Genna Davis film like you've never seen it before. Long life "The Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
