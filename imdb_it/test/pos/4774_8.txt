No doubt about it. This is the short film that put Uncle Walt on the success map. When Walt's older brother Roy suggested that Mickey's next short should include sound, Walt jumped at the chance. The result: Steamboat Willie was a runaway hit for 1928. It was, after all, the first short animated subject with a synchronized sound track (mainly music and sound effects, since the dialogue was minimal). Not looking like a wet blanket, but the short is far from perfect. The pre-1935 animations were creaky and rather crisp (but once the equipment made improvements and improved the artistic techniques, the rest was smooth navigation) and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the well-known sound system RCA, or the Western Noiseless audio system, but was rejected by both companies, prompting Disney to use the Photophone system that PA Powers was experiencing at the time). The plot (is there a real plot here?) Regards Mickey (as the aforementioned Willie) is the pilot of a steamer, which is terrified of Black Pete (Captain Pete for you), and decides to jam board, using the various animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, take note). If you don't think too much about technical deficiencies, Steamboat Willie can be eight minutes of fun (and a piece of history).
