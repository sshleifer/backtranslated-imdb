Checking Out will be released Friday, September 15, 2006. through the AMC theater chain that starts in New York City. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Ave, West 84th Street. This film was one from the heart, for the heart. Mark Lane, Jon Karas, Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrloe, Matt Jensen Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura St. James, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold, all the cast and crew knew from the beginning that this movie it was something special. The need to comfort the elderly is understood, the closeness of the family is more evident now than ever. I would recommend this film to all ages and races. This story sounds the truth to anyone with or without a family.
