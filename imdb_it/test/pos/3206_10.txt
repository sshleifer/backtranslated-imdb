Gilmore Girls is an exhilarating show with sarcasm, wit and endless charm. At the age of 16, Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. He left his parents' home and found a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are the best friends. The girls have a vast knowledge of films and television programs and constantly cite them. In season one, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton (a highly rated school), so reluctantly he has to turn to his parents. They are happy to give them the money, but in return, Rory has to come to dinner with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show. I love it!
