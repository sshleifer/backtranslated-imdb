DO NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's first films (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better ...) - and even if it's not the typical "bloodbath" for which Fulci is known - this is still very unique and fun movie. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders occur. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigation - both as suspects and those who "help" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the city police force, a journalist of little importance, a former handsome and rich drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped citizen and a deaf-mute child. All these people are intertwined in the plot to create different twists, until the real killer is revealed ... <br /> <br /> NON-TORTURE DUCKLING is neither a "classic" yellow nor a typical Fulci blood film. Although it contains elements of both - it is more an old mystery of murder, with more obscure arguments and some scenes of graphic violence (although nothing as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well-written film with a lot of twists that made me guess until the end. Recommended for fans of mystery / murder-yellow, or anyone who wants to check out some of Fulci's non-splatter movies - but don't despair, NON-TORTURE has even more to offer than they do to violence and squalor. Some may be discouraged by the theme of child murders, and a main female character has a strange habit of hitting very young kids, which is also quite disconcerting - but if that kind of material doesn't bother you, then surely take a look at this 8.5 / 10
