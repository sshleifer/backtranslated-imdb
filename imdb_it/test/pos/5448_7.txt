Now, I'm a little biased, since I'm a big fan of late-night television. I've been a loyal Jay Leno fan for about 6 or 7 years, and I think he's one of the most fun and most talented comedians out there. And David Letterman is also a comedian, although I only watch his show (unless Jay is a repeat) during the commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both good actors and looked a lot like Jay and Dave, but did they disappear into the characters? No. Roebuck can barely nail Jay's voice and expression, mumbling loudly, sounding like castrato Marlon Brando. Higgins nails David's facial expressions (for example, his trademark), but does not cancel Dave's voice. Those who are not big fans of late-night TV could be much less biased. There are a couple of comedians who can commit to Jay. Why couldn't they have selected one for the part? And the same goes for Dave. I'd prefer that Norm McDonald play the part. Norm doesn't look much like Dave, but he did a great imitation of him on SNL. "Hey ... do you have a tire?" It was so much fun! <br /> <br /> However, I learned a lot about the night wars I didn't know much about at the beginning. I had never seen "The Tonight Show" before Jay Leno was a guest, so I didn't know about the fight to finally replace Johnny Carson and the countless negotiations that eventually convinced Dave to move to CBS. I knew very little about what was going on behind the scenes and I found the film very enlightening. And Kathy Bates performs a knockout performance as the former executive producer of "The Tonight Show." Practically steals the movie. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
