Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary on Gary Cooper - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" takes a look at the huge all-American star through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood, the theme is certainly "Gary Coooper, American", given that we are given short sequences of his numerous appearances in westerns and scenes from "Meet John Doe", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and "Sgt . York. "The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family, as well as the photos of his childhood, which show him as a beautiful blond boy with the sunny smile he would have had for his whole life. Cooper on "The Jack Benny Show" returns to the "Bird Dog" issue - and Benny loses it - the documentary also briefly takes us into his tumultuous relationship with Patricia Neal, who almost ruined their lives. <br /> <There is a certain cohesion that is lacking in this bio / retrospective - it jumps a lot and has no footage of Cooper interviewed, which would have added a lot. Also, Clint Eastwood's narrative has been described as unobtrusive. boring and monotonous, since the same Cooper was the strong and silent type on the screen, we could have used a little animation. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper was one of the most beautiful men who ever lived - there were some looks in his early films, not enough for this fan. That smile, those lips, that bone structure - it was beautiful for life, but in films like "Marocco" and "Desiderio", it's devastating. Instead of watching a scene from one of his worst performances, like Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead", giving a speech he admitted to the author he didn't understand - a young, sweet Cooper in a tuxedo would have been a nice touch. Unfortunately, this documentary was certainly produced by a man.
