First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users who commented on this film (from Belgium) had to add that Lumumba was "communist". If this user really watched the film, the message was that he was not a communist but had been jailed (no less than in Belgium, the United States, the United Nations, etc.). As a "communist" leader for other individuals, "corporations" and countries political and economic gains. Even if one decides to accept that the film participates in the "revisionist history" it would be naive to assume that Lumumba was a communist, especially from the country that "granted" the independence of the Congo, and since Lumumba was elected DEMOCRATICALLY in his place as the First Minister. <br /> <br /> Onto the film ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful films I've seen in a while. Depicting the struggles of the freedom fighter in Africa, and ELECTED the Prime Minister's struggles as his first leader, Mr. Peck, does a commendable enough job of putting all the pieces together in one job. And this must have been a nice task. Due to the fact that most people outside the Congo and Belgium probably do not know the history of Lumumba and the Congo, outside a slight coverage of African imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high schools / secondary (or perhaps university / history classes), had his work cut out for him. <br /> <br /> And to think that Oliver Stone's "JFK" lasted more than 3 hours, "Lumumba" lasts less than 2 hours. And the most engaging 115 minutes was, as we discover that his desire not to compromise with Western powers (which is responsible for the atrocities of his people, especially Belgium), while trying to face power struggles at the Within its borders, apparently even with some of its friends, it is incredible that man has lived for as long as he lived. <br /> <br /> This is a MUST for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. You will not be disappointed.
