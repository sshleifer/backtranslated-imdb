"The Journey" is a great movie. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and published in 1959, this film was quite popular in its early years. Despite the political problems that have influenced the success of the film (because the story takes place during the Hungarian revolution, the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good film, but not very well known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most people who have seen it so far want it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary harmony between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal strong feelings, great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script, which is very well written. It has even been published as a novel by the screen player George Tabori. The film maintains its tension from beginning to end. At first, we did not know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary, because the major communist discovers that Diana's friend, Paul Kedes, is Hungarian and that he is not allowed to leave the country. The major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is, in fact, the real reason why he doesn't want to let her go. But after he hugged her and gave her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on the screen, and she also kisses him, lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever shot - the major and Diana say "Goodbye!", Arrives at the border with all travelers, including Paul, while Surov is hit several times by some Hungarians, so he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very beautiful and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, just like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. I'm one of the greatest couples in Golden Hollywood. A real spectator should watch this movie. "The Journey" has everything a good movie should have: a fascinating and captivating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is, in my opinion, at his best). Finally, I want to give a message to the studios of Warner Bros. or those that restore and publish classic films: please, publish "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
