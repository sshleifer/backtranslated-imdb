There are many similarities between Never Say Never Again and Thunderball not only on Sean Connery but also the plot and the plot. except the actors all the others are like hijacking atomic bombs, asking for ransom, trafficking nuclear weapons in a ship, etc. the only difference is where they occur in the plot of a thunder that is in the Bahamas in Never Say Never Again ended up in North Africa. And in the thunder sphere, NATO / RAF charges atomic bombs by plane and in Never Say Never Again it has changed from a "red arm of the ax" and the air has fallen in the United States and stolen in the Caribbean. Almost 99% is the same. If anyone wants to challenge this is welcome.
