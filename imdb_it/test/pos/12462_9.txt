Where this film is faithful to Burroughs' vision, it is excellent; where he starts from Burroughs, he is superb. It is a family story, a search for a father from a real and emotional orphan. Lambert is talking about one of the most anguished lines in the whole cinema "He was my father!" it is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic. Not a perfect movie: the infamous supernatural of Glenn Close's McDowell's voice is inconceivable and explainable only in terms of a very British mistake - but a masterpiece, albeit imperfect, and a noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson.
