If you know anything about the Manhattan Project, you will find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least an interesting representation of the events surrounding that story. The film is in every way a very realistic portrait of these events, and in many ways it's almost too real (like some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to come out as a real person on the screen. The supporting cast, like John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson, is quite good. This film is not, however, one of the best examples of turning a true story into a film. The great films are able to tell a true story and to use a sufficient artistic license to keep the public busy for the entire film. This, however, tends to drag on a bit everywhere, and some scenes (like the love story of John Cusack and Natasha Richardson) could have been completely eliminated without making the film lose much. However, there are enough interesting facts and humorous little pieces to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the whole movie. Not always entertains, but as far as great performances are concerned, this is very accurate, fascinating and will leave the public with something to think about. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
