If you asked me to choose the best films ever made, this film would be on a short list with 1951 Streetcar Named Desire. I guess I'll find someone else who qualifies, but Kramer vs Kramer is an exceptional exercise in naturalism. So it's a very rewarding experience at this level: just look at the wonderful and in-depth performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular. One of the best performances for children of all time. <br /> <br /> But I find it very satisfying to look at, because it's such an engaging story that it always makes me forget my problems. It has such an excellent narrative drive. Once you stick Kramer against Kramer, and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing else about what he has to find - keep looking to know that all is well with them. And even once you know how things go, every moment of the race sounds so brilliantly true that it's a joy to see it happen again and again. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake - Kramer vs Kramer is not light entertainment: it is a very realistic representation of the effects of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scripts (born of conversations between Benton and Hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) never written, performed and interpreted beautifully and impeccably. Not to mention that it's a great engaging story. Put simply, a perfect movie.
