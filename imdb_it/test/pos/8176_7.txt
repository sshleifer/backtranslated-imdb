The history of pre-unified China must be popular. Jet Li's Hero popularized the killing of the king. <br /> <br /> This is another story a few years ago. The incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Memoirs of a geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) is the protagonist as lover of the king, who was sent to recruit a murderer so that the king could defeat him. Recruit Fengyi Zhang, but he falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, it is still not able to complete the mission, as the King knew before him. I suspected he knew that too, but it went anyway. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and, of course, another chance to see Li Gong.
