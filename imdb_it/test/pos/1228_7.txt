I'm not here to tell you that "Armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. No. The reference directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). Those two helmets didn't make fun of subtleties like putting women in their films. Skirts are not necessary. They made boy films unrepentantly. Guns, lots of guns. The men met a violent death with a contraction of the jaw. Their films were like a sap in the head. Do you want a friend? Get a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is such a movie for boys. Duel of armored trucks? Bloody gunshot wounds? Money that explodes? If that doesn't speed up the lizard part of your brain, then stay away. <br /> <br /> At 88 minutes, "Armored" is all muscle without a gram of fat. We meet six security guards driving armored trucks, three per truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, work out a fake hijacking involving two trucks. Their mission one day is to deliver $ 42 million from the federal reserve (I think). The idea is to drive both trucks into a warehouse, set aside money, then organize a hijack. Of course, the cops will suspect them, but if they stay together they will overcome it. <br /> <br /> The problem is that one of the six, played by Columbus Short, is a holdout. At the beginning. But he must face eviction. And he is the guardian of the messed up little brother. He needs cash. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon cajoles, pleads, convinces the holdout. No blood on anyone's hands. A clean escape. All right, not bad. You will be rich forever. Blue skies smile at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell, of course. It's one thing damned after another and the betting keeps going up. And almost everything happens claustrophobically in an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. Indeed, the film strives to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay. I like urban industrial degradation. Congratulations to Matt Dillon, who plays the worst bad dog. Switch from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally insane during the film. I love that boy. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the credit is due to the ominous, throbbing, explosive and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by John Murphy. I guess he listened to some Tangerine Dream records. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is surprising that this is a PG-13 movie. I got one ?? one! ?? f-bomb in this entire movie about violent robbers. At some level, I like it. Take the children. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made a nice noir set in the Budapest metropolitan system called "Kontroll". Screenwriter is a boy out of nowhere called James V. Simpson. <br /> <br /> Many people in this film are just starting out. I'm willing to bet that the estimate given to this film will increase over time and these directors will advance in their careers.
