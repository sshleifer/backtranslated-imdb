I think that Pierre LÃ©aud, or his character, to be precise, is really extravagant but with grace: I also remember the chess player, and the girl who seems to appear by chance in his house, something really curious ... the woman that makes the lawyer is for me one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen ... but I must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously .... The character who plays the role of main actor is really nice , especially when he is annoyed by the new actor, the one with the purple shirt ... also, the scene where the bearded actor - who belongs to another company - directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing, as often happens with this movies - for example, when they drink tea, they just make you want to have a cup ...
