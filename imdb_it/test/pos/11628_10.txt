I saw this show when I was younger. It's really a good show to watch. It is very educational for children from 1 to 8 years old. Barney is definitely super-duper. B.J. it's pretty funny. Babie Bop is very nice. Even the children are fantastic. This show is about learning numbers like a sesame street but different types of shows and characters like Barney the purple dinosaur, B.J. the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head, and Baby Bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. The first one that started was the old Barney and Friends show. But then the second one was different to be new episodes. Also the last one in 2000 was the new Barney park scene. They also have a Barney show at Universal Studios in Florida where you see Barney, B.J. and Baby Bop and then when the show is over you can go play, shop and meet Barney. It's a very nice show to watch this show when you learn about the many things you'll like about the movie, and the live show at Universal Studios in Florida.
