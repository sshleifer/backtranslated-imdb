Although video technology can be dated, this classic musical work, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's most important and refined work on Broadway. If you've never seen SWEENEY TODD, you need to purchase this DVD. I saw this production in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington - and I fell in love with a pre-Murder She Wrote "Angela Lansbury. Next, I tried to find all her work, including: MOVIES:" The Harvey Girls " , "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "Manchurian Candidate"; CD: "Mame", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and many others. The rest of the cast is also impeccable. All in all, this wonderful DVD offers us the final version of Sondheim's work!
