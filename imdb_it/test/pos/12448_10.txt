Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine members of the band wearing personalized ballroom socks and custom homemade masks (eg clown mask of # 6, various gas masks # 0, tarmata # 8 + anti-tamper mask with dreadlocks). The same music seems to follow the lines of demarcation between healthy and normal, but it is performed in such a brilliant and psychotic way. <br /> <br /> "Welcome To Our Neighborhood" sounds rather like a generic title, but the movie itself is something else. Interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest album, two live shows and a banned-by-MTV music video (a brilliant tribute to Kubrick's classic film "The Shining"), the clocks of the films weren't even halfway now, but it's definitely worth it. It's perfect for presenting any metal / hardcore fan in Slipknot.
