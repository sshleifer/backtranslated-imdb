It's been a while since I saw Cold Mountain, but I knew I liked it a lot. Although it is set during the last days of the American civil war, it is not really a war movie. It's more a love story / drama and it works. Mainly due to performance. I don't like Nicole Kidman, but I loved it. I thought he was very convincing in his role. I also liked Rene Zelwegger, who is usually not a fan. Jude Law is as good as ever. The supporting cast. There are some great support performances, too many are the quotes. There are also some breathtaking scenarios in the film. In addition there are also many beautiful musical pieces. the story is sad and tinged with tragedy, but it's a well-made story, told for me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
