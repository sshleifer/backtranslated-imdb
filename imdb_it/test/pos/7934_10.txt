Nevsky is one of the great epic war movies. Of course, others, like Birth of a Nation and Napoleon, had come before, but this is just as influential. The acting is standard, but anyone who knows the first thing about Eisenstein would know that this was part of his film theory. This film, unlike many of his silent works, speaks of the heroic individual as well as of the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had emerged in the limelight in 1938. However, his film shows us the power that can be generated by people who come together to fight something they perceive as evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is prince because he is the strongest, but not because he is in any way different from the rest. The romantic corners of the film provide more of a personal story than what Eisenstein had previously allowed. Not all elements work and the film is probably a little too long, but it still resonates.
