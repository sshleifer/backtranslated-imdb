The adaptation of director Jay Craven of Howard Frank Mosher's "Where the rivers flow to the north" is one of the most beautiful passages from screen literature. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work - he also directed "A Stranger in the Kingdom". <br /> <br /> The cast is superb, especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn offers what could be the best role of his career - Noel Lord, the former fiercely independent lumberjack who is at the center of this story. Even the figure of Cardinal Tantoo on the housekeeper / wife living with Lord is dead. I am both amazed and disappointed that none of them was Oscar nominees when this film was released. Performances of this caliber should be recognized. The only character that is a bit difficult to digest for me is the manager of the power company played by Michael J. Fox. It looks too much like a child in this role. I imagine there is a curse related to youthful appearance, no matter how many people want them. <br /> <br /> Craven has done a good job here bringing the 20th-century Vermont character to the screen - places, corners, sets, all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of history. Cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional. The soundtrack of the Horseflies is also of first quality - it adapts perfectly to the mood and the scenery. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most compelling portraits of the fiercely independent American pioneer spirit of all time - a feature that is in decline in this day and age. When it appears in modern times, the person is often looked upon with suspicion and contempt. In Noel Lord, we have a character that we can admire for his values, and also for his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> This is not a heavy "vintage piece", but a vibrant look at an era that has gone and a type of character that has almost disappeared. These are not gold-plated heroes, but real people, with both strengths and weaknesses at stake within them. struggling in a difficult environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live. Like today, there are those who hold the power they would otherwise have.
