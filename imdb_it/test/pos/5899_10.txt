I watch this movie every time it plays on TV. A simply brilliant film. Three men return home from the war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. All three lived opposite lives during the war (Executive Banker became an army corporal, a dick became an Air Force captain and the high school hero loses both arms in battle) and now everyone must rebuild own life and connect with a new reality. The houses they return to, with grown children and independent, working women, along with a depressed economy, only add to the struggle. The scenes are just outside the camera and the dialogue is not said to resonate louder, anyway. The embarrassing intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is compelling as the handsome and decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is full of honest characters and everyone is played by a talented actor. <br /> <br /> This film, however, took a whole other level after seeing "Saving Private Ryan". The reality and the greatness of what these men lived for love and homeland ...... and obviously it didn't end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is an essential element for any collection. <Br /> <br />
