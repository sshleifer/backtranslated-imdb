Yup!! Finally they got it to perfection. What a great idea, a refreshing epic exploitation for Generation-X, whether they know it or not. After disasters like the sergeant. Kabukiman NYPD, and getting fucked by Blockbuster, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman, has just decided to do it, stop serving the distributors and let Troma be all the Troma that can be. Lloyd would make it the film Troma more exaggerated, exaggerated and definitely hilarious still. This time, Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, turns it upside down, Spreads it and adds that long-lost, always-missing entertainment value. Entertainment value, such as Lemmy Kilmister (the narrator), Debbie Rochon (the cook), Joe Fleishaker (the fat man) and, of course, brutal mutilation and toilet humor. Tromeo And Juliet is the definitive edition of a rather dull story and the jewel of the crown of the Troma universe. Years ago, in Tromaville, NJ's commercial partners, Monty Que and Cap Capulet, began a film company called Silky Films, which would produce apparently tasteful soft core films. Monty considers Cap his friend, but Cap is out fucking the poor sucker on his side of the company. On paper and in books, it seems that Monty gave away his life's work for free. Fast forward to the mid-1990s in Manhattan, we have two families that are extremely unhappy with each other, to the point that they are only looking for a reason to take a life, or preferably, a life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, nephew, Benny, them, with their friend Murray Martini, who is just a little too excited about all the carnage, they make war on the incestuous Capulets, except Monty, he's too drunk to take care of he. As in the original, there is a confused situation, which leads Tromeo to fall in love with Cap's daughter, whom he never knew, or whom he never even met. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert, who, unlike Tromeo's father, has a thing for the bottle, and this would naturally lead to dad's little chenshaw melon that comes physically, and emotionally abused, harassed and kept in a Plexiglas cage , via e via, depending on how embarrassing it may be Cap. Cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry London Arbuckle, a billionaire butcher, who would almost make everyone uncomfortable, with or without the loaf. With all these drawbacks, young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision, but how will the big feud do it? It might, or might not be, going a bit like the original, but understanding how this will end will simply not happen, you will never see it coming. <br /> <br /> "The one with Leo" is decidedly indulgent to sleep compared to Tromeo & Juliet, but if it's watered down, over-directed, big-budget, Hollywood, Garbage is what you've been programmed to go, so by all means, go for it, but if you want something a little more colorful, something that really gives you a punch, and doesn't follow the "normal" movie model, and if you happen to have a sense of rather abnormal humor, then he might not hate this movie. Tromeo and Juliet give the finger to everything that is mainstream. All-out exploitation with such petty humor as anything from a young John Waters. Along with a bit of acting, Tromeo and Juliet flaunt a soundtrack that includes the legendary Motorhead, and not to mention many contributions from James Gunn, who really brought this together. For more wonders of James Gunn, check out Lollilove, and for Lloyd Kaufman's excellence, take a look at his next vision, Terror Firmer. Tromeo and Giulietta is an incredibly priceless exploitation for the 90s brought to us by the one and only king of B-movies. Thanks, Lloyd. 10/10
