Great Michael Davis horror comedy. I was laughing so hard that I almost pee! Great acting by Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day and the great performances of Jack Black's performance like Justin Urich. He was simply divine in this film. This guy deserves to be a big star. Also, Aimee Brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the boys of a murderer who remembers Jeepers Creepers. The gore of was given in copious amounts and I loved it. I just hope they release an unrated version. Great low-budget horror comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is simply incredibly fun! ***** outside *****
