This reference film can now be seen in two different versions of the Video version of Grapevine, which also includes the English translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel, which he based on a Swedish folk tale. The first version is the Swedish modification with the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States with the title of THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT, published by Metro (before it was M-G-M). The current version of the United States has long since vanished, but a detailed review of the New York Times tells us how the scenes for domestic release have been rearranged - and both are fascinating to see. Each version of this film was presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with scores from live theater organs provided by artist Blaine Gale. A live recording was made of these performances and are included on the Grapevine Video DVD along with the novel and the notes on the two versions. While THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is somewhat easier to follow. Seeing the two different changes is an education on how silent films could be effectively modified to be released in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers consider this film a horror film that certainly is not. This is a game of morality with the nuances of the supernatural used to hit his petty message at home. The direction and the interpretations of the great Victor Sjostrom were far ahead of the times. It's easy to see why M-G-M took him to Hollywood to direct films like Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND and Lon Chaney in HE WHO GETS SLAPPED. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. He also starred in the role of WILD STRAWBERRIES by Ingmar Bergman, giving a masterful performance. Bergman was greatly influenced by KORKARLEN or THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE in his early days. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful film that is worth spending time discovering and studying. The video version of Grapevine is an excellent way to do it.
