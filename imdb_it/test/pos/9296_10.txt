For the comedy to work, there are many factors involved: <br /> <br /> 1. Don't be afraid to risk it. 2. If someone or something deserves to be teased, do it and keep doing it, <br /> <br /> ... but above all: <br /> <br /> 3. BE FUNNY !!!! <br /> <br /> "The Chaser's War on Everything" is successful in all three of these things. In fact, the show proved so popular and so funny that a first season DVD was released just a few months after its first episode. I picked it up in a few days after being released and hit the floor laughing and I had so many tears # @ in tears in my eyes- That's it, bravo! <br /> <br /> In short and to save me blabbing up for the show: watch it, buy it, broadcast it in podcast, whatever makes you see the best show in the world !!!!! <br /> <br /> Go to the CHASER !!!!
