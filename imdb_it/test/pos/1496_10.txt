Mr Bean was a lot of fun, I loved it, every episode was really fun, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny guy and his facial expressions were hilarious !!! <br /> <br /> The series has been so successful that they also made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also quite fun !! <br /> <br /> It's fun to see all the adventures and situations in which it engages, this series was definitely a classic, and from time to time I still watch an episode. <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of the unusual comedy have to check this out.
