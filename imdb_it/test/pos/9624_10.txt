This was the first kung fu movie I've ever seen. Dubbing is not the best but much better than some I've seen. The plot is much better than some that are made today. Sometimes it's bloody, but that's what gives him that special push. The Oscar-winning material is not so. But if you like watching the fights and a decent backround story, this is for you!
