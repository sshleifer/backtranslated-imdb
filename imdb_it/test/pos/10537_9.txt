I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, in the family section. I'm not sure any of my children actually took the film, but I have to say it was a wonderful short film. <br /> <br /> 'Nostradamus and Me' is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears we all felt growing in the 80s, which in turn extends to how my children feel today. Then, we had Regan, today we have Bush. Instead of nuclear war, we have terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really identified with the main character, and I attended a "Curehead" in high school myself. We all felt "didn't care" when we were 16, but it's nice to see a movie where they find out that everything counts! <br /> <br /> Again, I probably wouldn't have put this in the family section ... there were too many cursing words for the younger kids, but it was a wonderful and fun movie to watch.
