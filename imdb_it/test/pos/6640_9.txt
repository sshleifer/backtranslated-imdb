This is one of Bergman's darkest, most heartbreaking movies I've seen. I also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to human souls. <br /> <br /> The musician couple, who left a big city for a remote island and makes a living as farmers, find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful actions that would ordinarily have been impossible for them to even imagine they struggle to survive a horrible reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as always as a lost, confused and terrified couple that was captured in the middle of a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
