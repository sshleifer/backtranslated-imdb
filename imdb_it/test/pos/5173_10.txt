My Santa Lucia Choir was chosen to be in this film. All 100 pluses. When it was time to film the film I was asked to choose only 10. Oh my God. We had a little girl who went early to get her tonsils out because she wanted to be in the movie. The choices were hard to make. The people of Georgetown are just as adorable as the people they show in the film. Gentle, kind, believer. The city sponsors an annual Christmas market in the first two weekends of December each year. I was there this year and it was wonderful. The city is adorable and people work hard to make it magical. The city appears today as when the film was made. Much credit goes to the Historical Society which works hard to maintain historical value. The principal of the school that was converted into a state school was awarded by the Governor of Colorado for volunteers.
