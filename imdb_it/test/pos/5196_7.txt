This film is basically a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. It is always interesting to see the story from the "other" side to change. This film focuses on a group of German soldiers who, after fighting in the North African countryside, are sent to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most famous and bloody battles of World War II is fought. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mostly see the Germans simply as the "bad guys". In this film those 'bad guys' have a human face and a voice and this makes you understand that the only real enemy in war is the war itself and not necessarily those against whom you are fighting. At first it is rather difficult to concentrate on the film because you always have in mind that the Germans are the bad villains. But of course you get used to it quickly and the Germans soon adapt as the main characters in the film and you start to worry about them too and be interested in them. <br /> <br /> The way this story is told is not the best. It is difficult to keep track of the story sometimes, while jumping from one sequence to another. The film is not always logical in its narrative and presents too many sequences that remain too vague. Moreover it is almost always difficult to keep the characters separate and see who is who. Not always is this film easy to look at, but again, on the other hand, there are enough sequences and moments present in this film to make it useful and interesting, but not the most consistent in circulation. In this regard, Hollywood films are always better than European films. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high and feature some good-looking sets and settings, even though the film was not even shot in Russia. It helps to create a good atmosphere in war situations. <br /> <br /> The character is mostly interesting although perhaps a little more formidable. But I don't know, for some reason formal characters always work well in war movies and reinforce drama and realism. It also helps that they are played by well-cast actors. All the actors are not the most well-known actors (Thomas Kretschmann was also a fairly unknown actor at the time) but each of them fits his role well and gives his characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> All in all it is not the best or most consistent World War II drama in circulation, but it is worth a look, thanks to its original approach of the German part of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values. <br /> <br /> 7/10
