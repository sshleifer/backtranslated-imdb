Enigma is a part of the computer that reshuffles Russian messages, so that America does not understand them. They can only be read by the intended recipient. The Americans know that the Russians will send a message that reveals the plans of five political assassinations they want to carry out. <br /> <br /> Then they send the former deserter Holbeck (Martin Sheen) to take the scrambler and the substitute a fake part, so they will be able to decipher the message and block the attempts at murder. <br /> <br /> However, as we listen to the Americans' espionage leaders, we find that they already have the scrambler, and they want Holbeck to try to steal Enigma, only to convince the Russians that they don't already have it. They don't expect Holbeck to succeed. In this way the Russians, who had stopped transmitting with Enigma, for any eventuality, will begin to transmit again. <br /> <br /> Enigma is in the computer in Dimitri Vasilikov's office. Somehow Holbeck must have access and, to do so, he must find out when Vasilikov will be out. He sends in his ex-girlfriend Karen (Brigitte Fossey) to seduce Vasilikov, so that he can look through his documents and discover his planned movements. Karen is happy to do this, while torturing her father, a university professor, to death. <br /> <br /> Because we know it's better for Americans if Holbeck fails, the film becomes even more intense as a thriller spy. We find ourselves hoping to survive against adversity, especially because he uses ingenious methods to beat the Russians at every turn. <br /> <br /> But what is this? Are Karen and Vasilikov falling in love? Will Holbeck win Karen or will he finish with Vasilikov? The romantic breakthrough raises this spy thriller, already worthy of a ten, even higher, for its originality. Writing, directing and acting unite to make this new and fascinating turning point an irresistibly realistic reality. <br /> <br /> You find yourself on the edge of your seat, holding your chair, not only for the excitement of the espionage story but also for the beautiful and romantic love story. The two themes intertwine perfectly, until the end. You really want to win both sides. So who wins in the end? You'll have to see the movie and find out, right?
