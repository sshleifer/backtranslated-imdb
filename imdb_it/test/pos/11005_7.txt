I think Gerard's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head. Interesting movie, but very long. It is certainly the antithesis to the new school of flashy and sexy Moore style documents. There are no interleaved storytellers, facts or information and no other expedient. What you see is what you get: a look into the endangered world of Saltmen in Tibet. As a big fan of docs, I was surprised at how much attention I lost with this film, especially the length and lack of dialogue. In the end, however, I would recommend it if the topic seems interesting to you. It is beautifully filmed, informative and presents a precious (and in closing) window on the way of living of the Tibetan salt flats (and women :) - all important features of a good doctor. But put on a large pot of coffee, it will help you.
