Harry Langdon's "Saturday Afternoon" is often ranked among the biggest silent comedies, at least for short themes, so it may be a bit disappointing for some. Unlike other classics recognized as "Cops" by Keaton or "The Immigrant" by Chaplin, this film is in some ways a familiar and conventional comedy and does not offer much to laugh about; one could also ask if Langdon belongs to such a rarefied company. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is a perfectly fascinating comedy in its minor key, and Harry is fascinating to watch. <br /> <br /> For a modern spectator who grew up on a television sitcom, the "Saturday Afternoon" plot may suggest honeymooners or his many spin-offs: two dark boys, one of whom is married and very much under his wife's thumb, try to sneak out with a couple of girls in a good mood for a fun afternoon; but everything goes wrong, and they end up having to fight the tough girlfriends of the girls. Does it sound familiar? And maybe a little sad? Well, the premise was already worn out when this film was made, but beyond that nothing on Langdon was typical. It was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged child who was half asleep. All Freudians who capture "Saturday Afternoon" will have a field day with the scenes between this shy and chubby boy-man and his severe, delicately dominant wife-wife. When Harry tries to hide the money under the rug but she catches it red-handed and forces him to hand it over, you would swear you're watching an interaction between a 6-year-old boy and his mom. . . and maybe that's why Harry Langdon has given certain people the shivers, and he still does. <br /> <br /> But it's a compelling screen figure, and it's not what it does as much as the way it does it. In that scene with the coins under the carpet, for example, Harry finds the coins by placing one foot in front of the other, carefully, like a tightrope walker, counting his steps until he finds the right point, and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like no one else. Whether it makes you laugh or not, the boy is charming, apparently in a world of his own. Regarding the plot of his films, Harry is curiously passive, and he hardly ever drives history. In the finale of "Saturday Afternoon", when the big fistfight is taking place, Harry's co-star, Vernon Dent, is in full action, but Harry is stunned most of the time, and ends up doing some of fists. drunk between two cars (sitting on the platform of one, but with the feet on the other) while they run through the streets. It is a memorable image and, as the critic Walter Kerr wrote, perfectly encapsulates Langdon's personality on the screen: he is a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of a frenetic action, blinking sleepily while the world flows fast. It is also worth noting that Langdon and Dent, who have frequently worked together, have a report in this film that suggests a project that Laurel and Hardy would follow when they collaborated a year later. Langdon's style was a likely influence on Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afternnon" and his star may not be for everyone, but the film is worth a visit, and you may find that Langdon makes a difficult impression to shake.
