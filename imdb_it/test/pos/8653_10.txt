The film is a great, very thoughtful watch. I think it's a film about what it would be like if you lived in a world created by catalogs. The scenes are all perfect recreations of an Ikea catalog that even look at the furniture on their TV. When they break into the kitchen they open into another perfect image of how a kitchen would look in a catalog. When he is reborn or as you would like to call him he returns to the harsh reality of life. I love the bit when he tells his new love that he has left his partner. He enjoys commercial happiness by saying that you can have everything and it is nice to have the same things, but some things you don't want to share. A movie without children also for Say is perfect for ten.
