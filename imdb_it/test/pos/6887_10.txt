This program is a favorite of our family and we believe it MUST be released on DVD within the seasons !!! The title of "Promised Land" is very apt, as it is a positive statement on all the good that has remained in this great country and the people who live in it! It is a type of "God Bless America" ​​program with inspiring stories, antiquated values, simple characters, truthful and encouraging messages, wonderful landscapes and well-written humor and drama. It is a show that the whole family is able to enjoy and benefit from - without worrying about swear words, "adult" themes, harshness, violence, etc. We always felt blessed when we finished watching an episode and we can't wait to see everyone again when they finally came out on DVD!
