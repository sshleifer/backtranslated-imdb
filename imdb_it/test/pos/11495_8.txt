I have a feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to overlook. Personally, I found his first film, Manny and Lo, from 1996, as an extraordinarily detailed character studio and the performances were wonderfully wonderful (with a particular recognition at Mary Kay Place). The film played for a week or two in major urban centers and disappeared. One or two critics liked it a lot, but many considered it light. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delay) and similarly vanished. And once again the critics rejected the film lightly and pushed the film aside, praising Heather Graham's film presence to the maximum, but rarely her acting ability. And once again, for me, Committed is a solid success. I feel like Krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that shouldn't be ignored so easily, simply because he works on a very sober canvas. <br /> <br /> The title has different meanings, but above all it refers to Joline (Graham) refusing to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) escape and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive stalkers in recent film history. Her respect for her marriage vows leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yes, the plot is so simple and therefore, just so easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Joline, of course, is the weeping voice of a generation whose parents divorced with a percentage close to fifty percent. And for me, his personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of deception is quite intelligent and powerful. Confident in the belief that people do not have enough faith in one another, Joline must inevitably discover that her beliefs are not in sync with those of society in general. Several comments reported that his character is one-dimensional and I fear it is a simplistic reading of the film. Or maybe even a wrong reading. If Joline were just innocent, it wouldn't be interesting at all. It's the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the "normal" rules that make it so interesting. Sociologically, she is a complete deviant. <br /> <br /> Krueger sometimes falls in moments of spirited dialogue and his directing of this film has a rather excessive reliance on the cloud shots that move across the El Paso skyline. However, his mistakes are quite rare and in this film, as in Manny and Lo, are the performances that bring the day. Graham has never been better because he never had a character perfectly tailored for her like Joline. For the first time in his career, Graham seems at ease in the role of an adult, even one in a slightly arrested development. She brings the film perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (like Joline's brother) both have a series of good moments, like Alfonso Arau, like Mexican Mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the somewhat psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their environments, completely organic and well detailed creations. Sometimes these characters may seem unnecessarily bizarre, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist excited by Joline's devotion, fits in strangely, even though his foreigner is never discussed. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a film that gains depth by looking back. Another commentator here talked about the stereotypical Mexican portraits. And again I'm tempted to call it a misreading. Joline is looking for self-justification. She knows that her commitment is out of control, but she is looking for any spiritual path that can help her make sense of herself. Arau's character understands that most people don't believe in him and play his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I think I can understand how this film can be considered overwhelming, I simply wouldn't agree. It's always fun, often hilarious, and all the characters give off a warmth that is truly wonderful. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this a 7.5 / 10 and when I login here, that will go up to an 8.
