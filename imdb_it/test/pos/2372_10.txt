Dead or Alive: Final, the film that supposedly brings together the three films in the Dead or Alive trilogy, and mostly connected by its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that each film has its share of bullets and neuroses of the bizarre world and a lot of violence, it is certainly the weakest of the lot. The fact that none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material, but to the courage of the pound that director Takashi Miike brings with the environment and the material. Here he presents an openly dystopic future, albeit a low profile one, in which a homosexual mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) drugged the entire village except for a group of rebels. There are also robot replicants in this year of 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot of complete lethal ability but also with the ability to love and learn and so on. Then a policeman, Takeshi (Takeiuchi), is the mayor's main guard. But things are starting to unravel on both sides, Ryo joins the rebels and Takeshi with his employer, although bleeding mishaps like a hostage of compromise have gone wrong, and with Takeshi they discover that his wife and son are robots (not done in an alien mood, mind you, all of a sudden as if in a power went out), and that he himself is one of them. And all this leads to a last inexplicable clash between the two men. Strange that there is another film in which Miike has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding that middle ground in which science fiction can have some meaning. But there is really nothing to be taken from this story, except that the mayor / dictator is a dingbat without a hindrance who lets himself escape by making sure that his drug prevents couples from becoming pregnant and that everything remains under control. He also has his love slave with him, I would say, in the hilarious non-talking part of a saxophonist who sometimes doubles as a human being when he can't drive the moody blues out. Meanwhile, we get the conventional sides of the Ryo and Takeshi stories, and they are never uninteresting, but not convincing enough to arouse interest. Obviously Miike is not above having a little fun, like when Takeshi makes sure that Michelle (Maria Chen) dives into the water to make her swim after an attempted assassination of the mayor, or to have the original rebel leader who speaks English for no good reason at all. At the beginning of the film there is even a playful tribute to old science fiction cartoons. But there is nothing very convincing from the point of view of the substance, with the exception of Takeshi's small shifts becoming "good" in the middle of the film (helping a couple get rid of having a baby), and especially the points of strength of Miike this time they are purely stylistic and the choice of places and sets. <br /> <br /> It's like a grungy Japanese Alphaville where everything still has a contemporary twist through all the special effects. I really liked the yellow-green tint that Miike used during the film, as it had a very positive impact on the outdoor scenes and added just enough grit to the interior scenes. But as far as peaks and valleys are concerned, it is increasingly evident - and the level of the sci-fi movie channel of visual effects, with perhaps a few dollars more - during the climax. This contains some of the funniest materials in the most delirious, the Freudian sensibility of the director, although it must start with an unbearable artifice; the way in which Ryo and Takeshi eventually meet is a kind of casual and just a means for producers to try to tie the last two films cheaply, when it wasn't necessary. On the other hand, in terms of pure entertainment value guilty of a film like Miike's, where you see something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual, it ranks right there with the best scenes in Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall, Dead or Alive: Final is an approximate 90-minute effort that doesn't take TOO seriously, and it's even better for its evil tricks, militaristic decadence and cultural hang-ups on display at the pulp level.
