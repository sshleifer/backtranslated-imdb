AHEAD SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My Humble interprets this film <br /> <br /> Now, for a cinema spectator who has a taste as limited as mine, a niche film like 15 Park Avenue should be pleasing to my sensibility With this thought and a slight sense of embarrassment that I had not seen the complete film before, I watched this film last Saturday. There are some initial similarities with other works such as the mythical Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least 3 concepts: - <br /> <br /> a) Those (at least some) truths are relative b) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam that revolves around a car while the credits are running, is strangely similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita took on in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of investigation seems to be a place that is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film c) The incident that revolves around the crazy beggar woman is still extremely reminiscent of the whole "story behind Winkies" involving a vagabond but while that frightening creature is the embodiment of something and that "something" and the character for If are perfectly connected to other works by Lynch (carefully note the long tousled hair), the effect of the beggar woman in 15 PA seems to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message <br /> <br /> Also the other films of which 15 PA take is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a return to the truth Your perceived truth poser presented towards the end of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the angle of professor and schizophrenia also brings to mind, "A wonderful mind". Although, let's face it, the subject here is the physics of high eyebrows and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those same prophecies. In an exceptional scene of the film, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial building of the world of "making believe" to Mithi But for all their differences, even the sisters are similar. Both are unable to form lasting relationships - one out of choice and the other out of nature. Thus, Mithi's pain to be rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with Shaban's inability to form a special bond with Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm going on alone. Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of two ways: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 1: "It was Shabana all the time" There is a certain part of the audience that thinks so. But this explanation is not only exaggerated, but also devised because it would mean that he was also dreaming of many other characters (ie all those characters he visualized as Mithi with her) <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 2: "There was a true Mithi and the ending is a metaphor "This POV says that the essence of the film is summed up in a dialog box in the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi is looking for something he will never find , his wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophizes that we are all really looking for that illusory utopia, the end of the rainbow in which the mirage of happiness and contentment seems to lie <br /> <br /> <br /> There are other other minor possibilities which have not been much appreciated by our expert audience as: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are alter egos of the same person" Hypothesis 4: "Shabana is also a representation of Mithi's Imagination "Hypothesis 5:" The old man , haggard, perhaps mad, the beggar woman is the true protagonist of the story "<br /> <br /> Do these hypotheses deserve to be tested? Well, your hypothesis is as good as my <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to popular perception that he was thinking of Park Avenue in New York, I believe he was named after the trade name of a semi-popular bathroom soap. Remember, your statement of Jo Jo's profession as "Prime Minister of Shikakai", which as you may know is a popular ingredient used in shampoo production. The prefix '15' is used as it was on December 15th that Mithi became engaged to Joydeep and after his departure, he remained forever in a temporal distortion. The film has its fair share of flaws - the lack of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really increase the narrative, some sloppy dialogue unabated by some forced dialogues. Incoherent shows (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMOs) by some cast members, although many members of this cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be a dimension unimaginably introduced into the plot. I give him 7/10 as he made me think, but no higher than that because I can easily understand his sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, I had fun) the previous ones, I have already thought about similar lines before . Therefore, the post 15 PA experience is undoubtedly destined to be a certain degree of novelty. Where do I come from? I gave 9.5 / 10 to '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although rumors continue to circulate that a ghost Satyajit Ray directed it), 7.5 to' Paromiter Ek Din ', 7 to' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and 5 to 'Paroma'. Existentially, he failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as saying "Truman Show"
