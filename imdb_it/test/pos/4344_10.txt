One of the most beautiful films ever made. The recitation of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply exceptional. This is the crown of the career of director Winner, who has often been quoted saying that this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it has never been completed. Wildey J. Moore, the arms manufacturer, has repeatedly stated that the growth of his brand since the mid-1980s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a film, it is an art that many generations will appreciate and appreciate. Although this film has never been fully appreciated in the United States, it has found a huge following in Europe and Asia, where the film is regularly shown in film schools and is still a popular success in student cinemas throughout Europe. All in all, a true classic.
