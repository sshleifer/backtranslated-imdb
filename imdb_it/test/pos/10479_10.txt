"Babette's Feast" and "The Horse's Mouth" are the two most insightful and accurate films about what it means to be a true artist. The key lines of "Babette's Feast" are not, as other commentators have said, "an artist is never poor", but two lines that precede and follow: <br /> <br /> "I was able to make them happy when I gave my best ... All over the world it sounds a long scream from the heart of the artist: give me the chance to do my best. "I spent nine years producing experimental multimedia theater in San Francisco, raising funds for productions that involved dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists I supported have stretched every penny in their effort to do their best. They were just like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar needed to do their best job. Babette's art is good French cuisine, and for her her art at its best costs 10,000 francs. When, after years of political exile from France, isolated with two generous genitals on a desolate Scandinavian coast, she suddenly earns 10,000 francs, she does what any true artist would do: she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her much better, and so she does it. He spends all the money so he can do his best job as an artist. The turning point in the film is that we do not know that it is an artist of the genre, until it is actually cooking and serving the meal. Until then, he seems to be just a French working-class lady who contrasts a little with traders and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris in 1871). <br /> <br /> For an artist of this kind, it is secondary if there is an audience for art that is competent to appreciate it. This is why the author prepared this dinner in a community of people who could not have any understanding of what they were receiving. Babette did not cook this meal as a present for the two spinsters or the religious community. His goal was not to achieve reconciliation or a spirit of good feelings among the members of the small religious sect. In fact, he never left the kitchen to talk to any of them. After the meal, she sits alone, sipping wine, paying no attention to how the guests react. He is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done his best as an artist. <br /> <br /> That is why it is so satisfying, and so important for the story, that the General appears unexpectedly, because, as Babette knows instantly, a general will know what he has placed before him, and will appreciate it Because there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art that is shown to an audience that even lacks a competent person to appreciate it. She is happy, very happy, she came, in fact she is the only guest she has ever mentioned during the whole dinner, the only one she chooses for special treatment - not one of them. But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first class Parisian dinner, as I did (my father was Naval Attache in Paris in the 1980s, and I had my honeymoon in France ), this dinner, and Babette's satisfaction in doing so, and the pleasure it brings to the guests, is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to stifle the recipient with a sense of joy, it is a good French meal cooked and served in France. This film makes a claim on the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before dinner, the members of the small religious sect are contentious, and bring old grudges to light. The old hymns fail to restore good brotherhood; people ignore them, talk to them. But the shared experience of the great sensual art - so that people can taste the flavors of food and wine even if they have no conception that they are living a great art - makes people happy, puts them in a tolerant state of mind, the reconciles, and making them happy, encourages them to love each other, and therefore has a sacred divine effect of bringing peace. This is the statement found today in the modern art movement - that art can displace traditional religions in making humanity more peaceful. Therefore, contrary to those commentators who claim that this film is about the power of the Christian faith, it is more correct to say that the film claims that art can heal the wounds that the Christian ritual cannot heal. After all my years in the art world, I must say that this statement - that art brings peace that religion cannot - is exaggerated and invalid. But it is a beautiful presumption and is the second main theme of this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> One last note: with the arrival of Babette in the house of the spinsters, a particular French general, Galliffet, takes the name of person who in 1871 killed the husband and son of Babette and imposed a command military man who had to flee. At the end of the film, while the General tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before (before 1871), after some military maneuvers, it turns out that this same Galliffet was his guest at the meal. While the general tells the story, the French general Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman, the only woman who would have risked his life. Of course, that woman was Babette. So, ironically, the same French general who said he honored Babette over all the other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.
