Frank Sinatra has done so many excellent things in the entertainment world that it is difficult to identify one as the best. If I had to name the best thing he ever did, however, it would be his interpretation of Frankie Machine, the poker musician and trafficker who made himself the heroine and who is saved, barely, from the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious Kim Novak). The scenes of "cold turkey" between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The film is almost perfect, in fact, from the graphics of the title of Saul Bass to the soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein's jazz. It may not be the kind of thing no one thinks about the 50s, but it's still a must see.
