THE ENGLISH PATIENT not only has everything (condemned novel, tragic war, great characters), but he does it in a way that no other film does. It's a magical fairy tale told through flashbacks with incredible performances of all the images involved, sumptuous, characters we care about, and the most rapt love story ever told. A cinematic landmark, the best film of 1996 and one of the best of the 90s.
