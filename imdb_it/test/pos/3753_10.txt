here in Germany it was shown only on TV once. today, since everything becomes mainstream, it is absolutely impossible to watch a film like this again on the screen. perhaps it is the same in the United States, or in particular in the UK. The Message is a brutal truth: find friends to make your ideas a little closer to reality, or become a loser, if not a jerk. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is not particularly simple, as it might seem here. Every little scene, every sentence, every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen, when a person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd, which defines itself normal. <br /> <br /> Very well interpreted by all this is a must seen. Who is the main character? John (not Cox, folks, remember ;-) mineral Niles (which is still Bimbo) Decide and you will get the plot as it was designed. <br /> <br /> A bitter look at what society becomes in a repressive system. Type of Salingers Catcher in the rye and Goldings The Lord of the Flies thought until the end. <br /> <br /> The Final may change your mind. word
