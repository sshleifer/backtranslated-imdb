Although this little movie got lost in the wake of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can certainly stand up to that starry classic. It is another story of the piers and the code of silence that governs it. <br /> <br /> Next to the corrupt syndicate that Lee J. Cobb directed in On The Waterfront, Jack Warden is a real time corruption. But he is quite as real as the leader of a gang on one of the docks that intimidates other workers with fists and a rescue hook and takes the rest to return part of their hard earned money. And it's all hard earned money in that job. <br /> <br /> A boy cannot be intimidating is Sidney Poitier another head of the gang and when he tries to intimidate newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two develop friendship rather and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even solve Cassavetes with Kathleen Maguire. <br /> <br /> Warden is indeed a disgusting creature and it is sad to see that by sheer force of personality and physical ability the cows almost all others in submission. In this sense it is harder than Lee J. Cobb who had to rely on an impressive collection of goons to enforce his will in On The Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Edge Of The City marked the directorial debut of Martin Ritt who did a great job with a good cast of New York players and commercials on film location. The film's low budget is not seen, but you are so impressed with the ensemble cast that you don't care much about. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes as the solitaire with a past and the hard and tough Poitier are both fine, but my favorite in this film is Ruby Dee. He should have received an award for his performance, his final scene with Cassavetes is exceptional. <br /> <br /> Catch this, if possible. I wish it was out on DVD or VHS.
