I really enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it's one of my favorites. The story was excellent, although the turning point in the end was too predictable and I knew what would have happened too soon. Usually when this happens the movie is ruined for me (like "The Others"), but even knowing the result I liked it until the end. Looking through the comments of others, many people were impressed by the performance of Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I'm not. His performance seemed to be the weak part of the film for me, in contrast to the extraordinary performance (or characterization) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope we will see more of it. What a great little movie, highly recommended to everyone!
