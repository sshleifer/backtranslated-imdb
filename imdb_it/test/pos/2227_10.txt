I have seen this film since 1972 and I still remember it as one of my favorite movies of all time. I would buy a copy if it was on DVD and it's a pity it isn't. One would think that anything starring Peter Sellers would have been brought back. Much better than "Being There" and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard had a small part for such a gifted artist. You are a bonus in this movie. I think the medical field might not like this movie because it really makes the profession fun and also makes it clear that salespeople have never been willing to treat them like his way of getting sucked into bed, as well as his urine sample analysis .
