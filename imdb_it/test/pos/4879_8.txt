For anyone who has problems with bad, crazy or annoying children, this is an essential program to observe. It's just the best documentary program on behavior, not just for suggestions but for transformations. The rather attractive Jo Frost is Supernanny, with fifteen years of nannying experience she now has a program where she shows a family where children behave badly, very badly. Frost is the nanny who does not let children win. Each episode has small children who are crazy and very, very naughty, eg. throwing things, cursing constantly, hitting relatives and parents and many other horrible experiences. But every episode at the end of the show the children are transformed by their parents (with Frost's help) from little monsters to adorable children. It's simply wonderful when the transformations are successful, Jo Frost is an excellent Supernanny. He was named National Television Award for the most popular Factual program (twice). It was number 15 of the 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Very good!
