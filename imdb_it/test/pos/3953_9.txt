James Franco is absolutely fantastic in this film. Not only beautiful and charismatic, but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere way. At the Tristan show some were on his shoulders to be sullen and grumpy and do the whole thing about James Dean but I don't think that's true. Blind Spot is positive proof of his incredible talent. This film brings with it a different kind of weight. It's a unique performance. Sweet and sour and very moving. The lines in his diary cut you like a knife. Feel an acute intelligence of observation behind his words. The tone is everything. He takes it through action and suspense as well as the sad pieces of gallows humor. I also like the other two actors very much. The blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his perverse stoicism. Some of the hooligans seemed a little rough, but this is really a mini-point. The film is totally solid and Franco is definitely cool.
