I saw this at the Bend Film Festival on Friday amid an uncertain crowd of people, not helped by a poor decision by the event planners, who chose a totally inappropriate film to precede the film. And he really threw the audience when Modern Love came out after a light, whimsical short (name I forget). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really stupid to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious drama. A movie. <br /> <br /> So the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then ... Modern Love. Hmmmm. Modern Love, despite my reservations (a strange ending, a little too tangential) needed a short film commensurate with its strange strangeness, so my advice to programmers for next year is to pay more attention to planning the show. <br /> <br /> The people who looked at Modern Love really didn't know what hit them, - they were guided along the way and it's not their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern Love has some superb performances that sound good against the tangential meanders of the film - a film that its maker seems to have "marveled at" rather than performed in the normal way in which a film is scripted and shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the public has been misinformed. Wrong session, wrong short film, wrong approach by well-intentioned programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to see many more movies and travel to other festivals.
