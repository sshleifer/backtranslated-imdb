Family Guy is the best show on TV. NEVER. He has accomplished great things that no other animated sitcom, or any other show, has even come close to achieving. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated sitcoms, this era should be called "The Era of Animated Sitcoms". because there are so many, and almost all those that can be imagined have been published on DVD. There are some good ones (for example South Park, Futurama and The Simpsons). Every animated sitcom has its own style / technique of creating humor. For example, Futurama is fun because it comments or always acts on what just happened with a touch of humor. The Simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same technique and the same comic style of Futurama, but the Simpsons deserve the merit as it was on the air before Futurama and remains on the air using the technique. South Park, in my opinion, is the funniest show next to Family Guy, because it uses an intelligent mixture of vulgarity and nonsense as a technique to create humor. <br /> <br /> But enough with other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so funny. Family Guy uses a comic style that no other show has ever used before. Use a technique of having flashbacks after every joke. This not only reinforces the joke, but makes it more fun. It also moves at a very fast pace. These two criteria make it the most entertaining show on TV. You have to see the show to believe it, but once you see it, you will most likely agree. (FYI, the two funniest moments of Family Guy were: 1) The 5 minute chicken fight in "Da Boom", and 2) The Dick van Dyke parody in "Holy Crap.") Also, in my mind Family Guy is a very modest show because while other shows create humor by familiarizing themselves with their shticks / routines and characters, most of Family Guy's lines are based on the stupidity of current events and pop culture. This also shows that Family Guy is intelligent, as well as being modest, because he reveals that the show has intuition. And this technique is extremely effective because they relate their references to pop culture with the specific plot of the episode in which they are found. <br /> <br /> Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because while younger children may not understand references to pop culture, they will be amused by the hilarious antics of the characters, particularly by Peter. The show is, however, a bit more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but it is less vulgar than South Park. So, in terms of vulgarity, Family Guy will rank somewhere in the middle when associated with the aforementioned shows, but it would be the number 1 in terms of humor and intelligence !! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was canceled for the last year, not because it wasn't popular, but because FOX kept changing its time slot, so no one ever knew when it was on. Fortunately, we have DVD box sets (which, by the way, are selling like crazy) and we replicate on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim at our disposal.
