"The Great Dictator" is, without doubt, one of Charlie Chaplin's best-known films. He is known for his blatant satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Until I looked at him, I only knew it was fame. Now I know how much the film deserves it. <br /> <br /> The film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, brief fused and impressive dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his close and dear staff: Field-Marshall Herring and Herr Garbitsch. Moreover, it involves the exploit of a Jewish amnesic, emotional and often clumsy barber, a veteran of the First World War. <br /> <br /> Stopping with the plot, I would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it unique and wonderful. While the comedy is definitely both verbal and slapstick and incidental, the entirety of the film shows how serious Nazism or aggressive nationalism is as a theme with various interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills go far and wide in the film, he continues to turn up and down until he simply explodes. The position of Paulette Goddard as an ambitious aspiring Jewish revolter and Henry Daniell's delivery of nasal lines, as calm as death, like a heart attack, make the vision wonderful. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it does not punch. It is not "hidden", has no hidden business. It is a "clear" flash, obvious, in the face, obvious both of Hitler and of Nazism. <br /> <br /> To summarize briefly, look at it. Look at it, you'll see it.
