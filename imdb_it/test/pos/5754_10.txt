I own this movie on DVD and I've seen it about 10 times and it's still fun. The jokes will never be boring and I will often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about it. The premise is that Richard and Eddie of inferior fame are owners of Britain's cheapest hotel next to a nuclear power plant. They desperately need money and when a movie star hides to stay lucky he could be in. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and not become completely bored or disgusted you must first enjoy humor. Some would say that only the most ardent fans really love watching it. But overall it's a great movie.
