By mistake, I ordered a series from the BBC, their new version of Robin Hood. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Terrible costumes and backgrounds. While I liked the sheriff, who took cues from the character of Nick Grace, the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. Like "for example", Marion's costumes seemed suspicious as if they came from Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, he looked a bit like a movie character on outer space! RoS stole the spotlight, probably forever, in the story of this story. Clannad's casts, costumes, plots, sets, filming and soundtrack are superb, as shown by the continuous feedback of about 26 years. RoS is a timeless classic. My thanks to everyone who made the series.
