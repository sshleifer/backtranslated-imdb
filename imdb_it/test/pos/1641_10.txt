This was really a tense and dark episode. 'Excellent, wonderful acting and atmospheric direction,' Ice 'is one of my favorite episodes. Together with "Pusher", "Grottesco", "Wetwired" and "Home" (in my case they are quite good in the dark) It seems to me quite realistic, their paranoia, their suspicion and their ever increasing anger have been perfectly executed by the great actors. However, "Ice" had a problem that I passed after some watches: IT WAS TOO SHORT! I WANT MORE! <br /> <br /> Overall, "ice" had 98% of all X Files episodes: excellent acting, intense story-writing, gritty director. All the works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
