I absolutely love this movie. All about it. It almost felt like watching me and my friends on the screen. The way this film was shot was a pure, very original and creative masterpiece. I referred to these characters and I also had the same thoughts as some. I'm really happy to have come across this movie. If only there was more genius like Justin out there!
