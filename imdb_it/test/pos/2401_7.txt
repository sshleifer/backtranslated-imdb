I watched the film with tears and smiles alternately. The anger increased in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombing. And living in the country right now with my parents, who have lived in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that now we are much better, and it would have been better if the American had not brought the war here. Watching the film, I learned more about the different types of wars America planned in Vietnam and what disasters they caused. <br /> <br /> The series seems to go well with interviews with real people. But I don't like that some people give only generic opinions, like the analyst towards the end of the series, I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary images, such as life in the military camp of South Vietnam and those of the North (if possible). There is also a sudden change from 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure the middle way was censored, because I saw this series on TV).
