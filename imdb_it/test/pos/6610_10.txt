In the mid-1970s a scruffy group of brazen young Venetians, Californian teenagers from broken homes and the negative side of the city known as Z-Boys transformed the previous world of professional skateboarding to the ear with their fierce punk attitude, the guide radically unconventional style and unbridled spirit of pure in-the-face aggressiveness, revolutionizing sport in the process and paving the way for many extreme variations on the sports that have appeared in their influential wake. The director Stacy Peralta, who is one of the legendary Z-Boys, tells the incredible exploits of this fantastic ragtag crew in a fiercely slimy and visceral way that is both informative and wildly fun: the rapid rapid assembly, the incessant rhythm and crudo Gritty photography conveys a thrill of infectious cynicism, projecting a sense of pure joy and frenetic energy that is a total pleasure to admire. Better still, this documentary neither sanitizes nor romanizes his subjects: those rough and squeamish boys were so fiercely competitive and out of themselves that they all went apart when the call of fame and fortune manifested themselves in their lives. The final fate of some boys is poignant and heartbreaking, with the talented and spontaneous skateboarder Jay Adams who judges him the saddest and the most tragic: he let the opportunity slip and ended up spending time in prison. The other guys are also very colorful and nice; The charismatic dance of the arrogant and provocative fire Tony Alva in particular is presented as an arrogant but impressive piece of a furiously assertive work. Wonderfully narrated by Sean Penn, casual and casual nasal ease. Even the fantastic rock soundtrack smokes seriously. But what makes this documentary so successful is its refreshing total lack of fiction: it is both dynamic, exuberant and larger than the extraordinary life of the same gloriously outrageous Z-Boys.
