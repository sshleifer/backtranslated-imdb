I have! This is very nice. I say all right, old man. Or should I say "old bean"? My mastery of British terminology is a bit dusty. However, my biker boots and I have entered this projection without previous experience from Wallace and Gromit. I am happy to say that my boots and I came out happy to have made their acquaintance. <br /> <br /> While not accessible to adults like Toy Story, W & G still manages to be smart enough to provide the adults with a little humor that will surely fly over the heads of the young "uns" who are too much busy snickering at Were-rabbit burps to have the slightest idea that something is wrong. I suggest you pay close attention every time you see books or words on the screen because there are short glimpses of word games that you will miss if you are not paying attention. My favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the Loch Ness monster as "tourist trapps". If you've ever been known to say "I can really relate to Kevin Federline", or if you are just illiterate then you will not only lose these jokes, but you should probably spend your time learning to read instead of going to the movies. Consider this a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of W & G is its clay animation. Thanks to the boring process, it took FIVE YEARS to finish the movie! According to press reports, there were some days when the optimal goal was to make only 10 seconds of completed films. People, sometimes I find it difficult to find the motivation to finish answering a handful of e-mails or add captions to the photos for my reviews (a point that is demonstrated by the lack of images in this review); so I can't even imagine having the patience necessary for this. <br /> <br /> I really like the rough quality of claymation figures. The fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice personal touch. How not to be impressed by the clay characters that show more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves put together? The Curse of the Were-rabbit is, as Nick Park defines it, the first vegetarian horror film in the world that should amuse both children and adults. Counting (and like a male who prides himself on his bristly and cold-haired masculinity, hesitate to use this word) cute and (oh my friend, I probably shouldn't use this word) lovable characters rather than old M.C. References on Hammer, W & G is proof that DreamWorks can create fun animations when it chooses intelligence with a cheap joke.
