One of the most famous of all movie magazines! Still interesting today though it looks like "old movie". The second serial looks better but it's just not the same. The actors have fun, especially Middleton and Lipson. Excellent assembly by the team of Universal experts. The soundtrack was tracked by Universal Destination "Destination Unknown", "The Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Werewolf of London". And what great action music it was! If there was a choice for the best serial of all time, this (probably) should be the number 1.
