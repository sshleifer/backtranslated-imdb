So we saw it on DVD in our apartment here in Paris. We are all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard because so much of what was happening in the film happened to us! I mean, yes, of course it's a bit clich√© but it's still true, I know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I am closer to the quiet boy (the Italian) than Xavier because I am more of an observer in our group. Anyway, I'd like to have a warm roommate like Cecile de France. She looks like a beautiful girl in the film and really, after seeing her host the Cannes Film Festival last month. <br /> <br /> Now I think I want to go to Barcelona next summer after seeing this movie. I also have to take a look at the sequel that just came out here in France.
