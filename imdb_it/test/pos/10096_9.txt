If there is something as beautiful as horror, this film is one of the best in this genre. It is a horror film, which although it is not without gore scenes, is based more on psychology and the magisterial construction of tension to create emotions. And it is one of those films so wonderfully filmed, in which every scene is a world full of symbols and details, all at the service of purpose and genre that can be called but beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is not an easy story, with two sisters returning from their father and stepmother after spending some time in a psychiatric institution. They struggle with the death of their mother and try to protect their world, defending them against the adult world. So the film seems to be at its most external level. In reality the film slowly evolves into something very different, at a slow pace, but no frame is lost to convey the sense of shivering beauty, so I won't say anything else. Look at it, it is one of the best horror films of the Far East that has recently conquered world cinema and really shows that it has managed to do it for good reasons.
