One of the many horror backwoods that came out in the early 60s and fortunately this is one of the best. Yes, it has a poor plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film, because I thought it was really nice and funny, even though the killer might have been a little more scary, but it just looked like a fat guy. <br /> <First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains because they are very dangerous. But when the boys arrive, it doesn't seem dangerous at all, well in my opinion anyway. It's a shame that we don't get films like this anymore, and if we do, it's usually a boring and terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This film is based more on tension and being frightening than on blood, because the blood factor is really low in this film of which I was not happy, but apart from that it is still a fantastic film . <br /> <br /> All in all you will have to try long and hard to find this movie and if you find it, you will like it and you will also look to finish with the final girl and the murderer is not absolutely what you would expect.
