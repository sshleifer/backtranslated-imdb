An evil baron of the earth is holding water in a group of farmers to try to take their property for a few cents on the dollar. Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne) also arrives, who saves the day for Gabby Hayes and her daughter by going undercover as the villain's new killer. <br /> <br /> The first of sixteen films made by Wayne for Lone Star / Monogram Images, this one tries to choose him as a singing cowboy, only with a clearly synchronized voice with his lips. The title card features the character of "Singin 'Sandy" which leads us to believe that this would be the first of a proposed series! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's ridiculous, but also a lot of fun to see Wayne sings songs and shoots rifles, especially when he makes a little song before shooting with the assassin Earl Dwire. <br /> <br /> Riders Of Destiny presents a rare and evil role for Al "Fuzzy" St. John, who clowns around with the bad guys as a heroic companion did, riding with Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
