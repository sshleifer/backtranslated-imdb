(Note: I saw I SELL THE DEAD at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) The Sell the Dead is a jet black comedy set in the late Middle Ages, and the stars of Dominic Monaghan (Lost, Lord of the Rings) , Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). <br /> <br /> The film opens with the brigand Willie Grimes (Fessenden), still indignant and indifferent, dragged to the guillotine and executed. His apprentice and crime partner Arthur Blake (Monaghan) is locked up in the tower awaiting his turn when Father Duffy (Perlman), a drunk whiskey priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult, visits him with the apparent intention of recording the final confession of Blake. It soon became apparent, however, that Duffy's main interest lies in the more ... other business world of Blake. Most of the plot here is told in the form of flashbacks as Monaghan reigns Duffy with tales of his grisly career. <br /> <br /> Initially, Grimes and Blake begin as simple body robbers, working in the use of the macabre Dr. Quint (Scrimm), a callous corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as a lever on our two anti-heroes , and in his work he takes on a rather unhealthy taste. The two have their first encounter with the undead when, one evening, Quint sends them on a mission to a desolate moor in the moonlight to retrieve a corpse mysteriously buried in an intersection, apparently according to an ancient custom. But there is something different about this corpse. This was wrapped in cloves of garlic ... and buried with a stake through his heart ... <br /> <br /> After a terrifying meeting, they not only came up with a plan to get rid of the intriguing machinists, but they also discover a secret subculture of occultists who will pay good money for corpses and even better money for the LIVING CHAMPIONS of the undead. This brings our intrepid duo into the hidden underground world of the "ghoul hunt" trade, where they find themselves head to head not only with vampires, monsters and zombies (and another paranormal entity for which I don't want to spoil the surprise) , but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the Murphy inbred and murderous clan. <br /> <br /> I joined I Sell the Dead waiting for a low-key, slightly distracting and low-budget chiller. I was not prepared for the incredible imagination, the dizzying humor, the quality acting, the great dialogue, the dense atmosphere and the pure personality that makes I Sell the Dead a strong contender for my horror film of the year. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a couple of edges, the production values ​​are really fantastic for such a low budget - it seems to have been made for about $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director made told the public that it was made for much less than half of that (although he was not willing to provide exact figures since the film was still sold to distributors). The "look" and tone of the film are a visual comic strip halfway between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with small artistic inserts in Creepshow style. The plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underground world, which runs parallel to everyday life, but which the general population is unable or unwilling to believe, really makes sense in the context of the film. /> <br /> Acting, as you would expect from this cast, is top notch. The characters are surprisingly well crafted, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors present their distinctly scripted lines with the right amount of unmoved tongue on the cheek to make the dialogue both fun and realistic. Angus Scrimm also turns into a good performance in a somewhat short but memorable role as the menacing anatomist and violinist Doctor Quinn. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I was so entertained by a movie. I find it hard to find something negative to say about it. Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will continue to discover and fall in love with 20, 30, 40 years.
