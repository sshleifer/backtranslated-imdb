I will not go to a generalization and say that it is the best love story of all time, as some have said. Okay, people feel deeply in this movie, love it or I believe ... or just hate it. I do not mean, the best of all, because it is simply too "broad" for me to make such a statement. However, I feel very passionate about The English Patient and millions of other people. <br /> <br /> The awards say it all. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the critics, at many levels, however, those who have chosen this, I could not agree more. <br /> <br /> 9-Oscar. <br /> <br /> 41-wins. <br /> <br /> 37 other nominations, makes this love affair top of the group. <br /> <br /> From the director Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (of T.V.s Seinfeld) said: "Elaine, I simply can't take my eyes off it!" In this case, I don't agree with Elaine's answer. But the story builds and takes the right time, necessary to make it beautifully. Also the cinematography (John Seale) has won numerous awards, as it should also. So far, I haven't paid much attention to Juliette Binoche. Well, not completely true, I loved his performance in "Sabrina" Beautiful story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly different character for her, and as profoundly talented as she was, she simply shone in her subtle and graceful way, it was just what the film was looking for, I'm really glad it was her performance and not other actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this! What can you say except, see this image again. (*****)
