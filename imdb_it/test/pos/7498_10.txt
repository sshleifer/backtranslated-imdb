For those not familiar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a great introduction. While Chayefsky addresses the reality behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine is going today, two decades after the film was made and over a decade after his death. In addition, some insights into Chayefsky's vision of life in general "slipped" into the film as well. The twentieth century could prove to be the first and last century of the United States in world history. If it turns out that the contribution to the arts of the United States was in the dimension of the "film", this is a prime example of that art.
