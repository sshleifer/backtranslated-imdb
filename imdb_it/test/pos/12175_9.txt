Did I enjoy Erkan and Stefan ?? a fresh and quick story that has not been bogged down in the details. Those two guys are fantastic to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time. The high quality of the image and the cut greatly support the film. <br /> <br /> Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is able to transfer successful Hollywood concepts to local "satire" in our cinemas.
