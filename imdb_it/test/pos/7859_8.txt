This amazing Southern gothic melodrama is played by Clint Eastwood as a Confederate officer wounded in the Civil War, welcomed by a rural female school and hospitalized in health. A strange clash of genres follows, with the alleged "dangerous" male falling prey to a group of seemingly harmless women, who prove as brutal as the men who fight each other on the battle fronts. This is a classic spider and the history of flight, but here there is a lone fly and a lot of spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays the school's lover head, and she offers a sensational performance. Page has been trained as a theater actress and shows all her performances. Regardless of the role she played, she has always committed herself to 100% and never let herself leave the character. So it is here, with this lethal spinster, that she takes her sexual repression on this helpless man. Each of the other girls responds to him in his own way. The two most important are the slutty girl who can't wait to throw herself at him, and the virgin one (played by who else but the mannered Elizabeth Hartman?) Who acts as if she falls into a dead faint if someone so much as he said the word "penis" to her. The schematic Madonna and the plot of the whore would seem heavy if the film didn't keep you so freaked out and so completely insecure about what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene in The film for me happened when the group of women performed an amputation of Eastwood's leg, which was infected with gangrene. Again, the spider / fly allusion is clear: they limp so that it is much more difficult for him to escape their network. <br /> <br /> A classic chiller. Not a great movie, but morbidly fun. <br /> <br /> Vote: A-
