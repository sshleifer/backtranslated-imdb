I'm not sure which version of the movie I saw, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I didn't know who the "Twins" (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) were before seeing this movie and I think the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are very well done. I particularly liked them, because there was a lot of judo / grappling that was shot very well. Donnie Yen (seeing him in Hero, excellent performance) as a director is fantastic because he knows how to shoot these scenes. <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to flow for me, except that there is a scene where the girls are in the roof fighting with bamboo poles. It really has nothing to do with the plot, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the best (modern) HK action films I've seen in a while. Although in some respects it is a bit rough, he still pulls it out. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
