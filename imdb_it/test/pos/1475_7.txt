Ah! When good actors take insipid material! If you are thinking of this film as a close detective thriller you may be disappointed. While the situations are very faithful to life, the plot proceeds in a very predictable clip and you can well see what is going on before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary characters are actually just stereotypes in motion. Much of the dialogue is simply silly. <br /> <br /> But! If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and do something with it, then LOVE this movie! Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the monotonous character of Detective Falon come to life with depth and pathos. Those of you who have never seen Elliott emulate more than his usual frowning stoic expressions will be delighted by the range of emotions he describes in this film. And also, in his early fifties in this film, it looks fantastic! His bare-chested scene gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a wonderful job raising his role as Det. Falco eager to beaver new police collaborator. He could easily have interpreted it as a Robin for Elliott's Batman, but instead he breathed a genuineness and a passion in this role. It does work despite some of the limping lines given to it. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! The eccentric police captain plays. He seems to know he is swerving in this movie and is doing a ball to do it. It makes it fun for us too. <br /> <br /> This film is very close to the plot but makes up for it with great shows! Sam Elliott fans should definitely have it, since it's a kick to see him spread his wings and do much more than he usually is allowed to do!
