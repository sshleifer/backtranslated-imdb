I was excited at the opening to hear part of "Chevaliers De Sangreal", but I wanted more so I bought the Hans Zimmer piece. Perhaps the most beautiful and inspiring 4 minutes of music ever written! This film is an exciting thriller masterpiece even without religious considerations. You can visit the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent photography. The opening at CERN where the "particle of God" or the largest amount of antimatter was created with STUNNING images is an immediate indication that predicts the excellence of this film. Who doesn't love Hanks? The plot and turns in this film are simply superb and well designed to the incredibly twisted climax. This film suggests a satisfying compromise between Science and Religion even though many closed heads will persist on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind". A.Einstein
