I couldn't completely block this film from memory even though it's been two years since I saw it. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - I've long since forgotten the main plot - the relationship between Kidman and Law, which made no impression on me, but it was the torture scenes in the movie that really hit. I cried for about two hours immediately after the wards. <br /> <br /> Previously it had never occurred to me that people, in times of war, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see many examples here - in both scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence to hide her son at home. I was shocked by these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a result because the scenes are now perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am happy to have watched the film simply because it has made me more aware of the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that humanity can inflict on itself. <br /> <br /> The blond albino character has been at the top of the list of nastiest villains ever since I saw the movie. His horrible grin and lack of human feeling for the people he tortured really hit me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him by myself (you see the film pushed me beyond the limits of reason, it only came to me after I hit only a big screen - which shows the power of the film and intensity at least) . <br /> <br /> I recommend the film for its pure experience, not for the intertwined love story, but for the way it describes the war without needing a battlefield.
