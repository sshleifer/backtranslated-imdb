Long last!!! A beautiful film made on the most insane serial killer in history. For those not familiar with Ed Gein, he was basically the fool who was known for stealing and stripping his victims (which most horror fans have robbed). Shot in a period style that perfectly reflects the desolate Wisconsin plains, this is undoubtedly the most evocative horror film that still shows Gein and his macabre killings. Kane Hodder (Friday's 13th series Jason) and Michael Berryman (Hills have Eyes I & II), offer chilling performances in this serial killer that easily leaves behind Gein's poor efforts. For now I would say that this is one of the best horror films published this year (Turistas = 0).
