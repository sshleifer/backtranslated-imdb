It's really nice to see that Van Damme's film is slowly improving recently and above all compared to class C "Derailed" and "Second in command" flops, both tragic and not in a positive sense. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action movie with some fantastic action / combat sequences. It's nice to know that Van Damme still knows how to give football since his latest film "Until Death" had no martial arts inside at all !!! <br /> <br /> That said, this film is significantly inferior to "Until Death", which was a good turn for Van Damme. "Until Death" lacked the exaggerated action of most of Van Damme's films, but it was dark and gritty and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. However, The Shepherd is definitely a movie worth seeing especially for Van Damme fans or just fans of the action movie in general, but if you're looking for a movie with a bit more plot ... you could skip this! <br /> <br /> I think this film was done quite well, especially on what little budget it would have been made. The only real problem I have with this film is the title; "The shepherd"? I do not understand! I suppose "Border Patrol" doesn't have the same ring without the word "Shepherd" in front !!! <br /> <br /> My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but it's by Van Damme's film standards not found in any other film category. <br /> <br /> ie Good for a Van Damme movie.
