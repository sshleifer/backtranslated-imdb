Overall, the Dad's Army movie is very funny, although the humor is not as engaging and brilliant as in the TV and radio series. So where does this leave us, the spectators? If you've never seen Dad's army, then the film is a good way to make yourself known and fall in love with the crazy world of Walmington or / S. The downside is that you might not "understand" it because, as I said, the humor in the film is a bit stupid. <br /> <br /> For fans of Dad's Army the film contains nothing new as the story is more or less a cutout of the TV series, but it is a unique opportunity to see your favorites in "high definition" compared to the lousy quality of BBC video recordings. <br /> <br /> The film also shows what the weakest waiting sequence in the history of the universe must be. I can't decide if it's positive or negative, anyway.
