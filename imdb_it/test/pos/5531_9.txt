It is not always certain that mixing comedies together will produce laughter. The comics involved must really appreciate or admire each other, or be willing to endure mutual irritability. GO WEST with the Marx brothers had Buster Keaton write the script as a gag. Groucho didn't think too much about Keaton's ideas and embarrassed him at a script meeting. And even if some of Keaton's gems still appear in the finished film (like the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun), the film was one of the weakest of the Marx brothers ever made. <br /> <br /> A better film, but also influenced by ego duels, was the WC Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, who downloaded the script for a series of lead duel duels. But the interiors were equally entertaining, so the film remains a success. <br /> <br /> But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six comics films that worked well together. The reason is simple: there are really three comics teams working together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were paired in about half a dozen plays during the 1930s, usually with Boland as a rather overbearing wife, and Ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. Fields (usually a single act) was matched three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD A MILLION were the other two times). Skippy has always understood how to control or counter the illicit activities of his man - it is the film in which he moves in his hands with the stolen money being sought (he knows that the local sheriff, Fields, is not the only trust in this) . As for Burns and Allan, they manage to get involved effortlessly with the hoarding of Ruggles and Boland in their off-road car trip. <br /> <br /> Ruggles soon realizes how wrong it was to accept traveling with Gracie - at one point he manages to drop it from a cliff and dangle from a branch. He is relatively helpless when he insists on 1) photographing him on his perch, and 2) correcting his grammar. The presence of the giant dog of George and Gracie ("Ran Tang Tang" is his name) does not make it easier for Charlie and Mary to travel. <br /> <br /> Fields has some moments of choice. When he insists on shouting to the quartet, he says he is allowed to do it - he is the sheriff! He also explains, during a billiard game, the unlikely story of how he got his undeserved "Honest John" moniker. You have to listen carefully to the story, since it is interrupted with its attempts to play pool a few times (once accidentally caught by a billiard ball), but it shows that there were objects that not even Fields would have had reason to steal. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the "Summary Line", I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page - he was the man responsible for the problems Charley Ruggles suspects. Bradley must have a reason to leave the city to join the unwary Ruggles and Boland, so call his girlfriend. He tells her to call up her job and say she has to leave the city because someone died. There is a pause while apparently listening to a question fired by his girlfriend. "SOMEONE!", He says, clearly annoyed. Although the bulk of humor in the film is brought by the sextet of artists, Mr. Page has had the most fun and unexpected part of the film.
