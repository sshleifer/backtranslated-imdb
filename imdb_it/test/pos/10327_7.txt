This film was roasted by the boys of the MST3K, but in reality it is a nice piece of inexpensive noir film. The plot is tight, the characters are credible (in the genre of the good guy obsessed with the bad girl), the rhythm is solid, the climax is well managed and the cast is supported by many actors of refined characters. True, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but in reality it is really scary when interpreting the mind. The scenes between him and his father are quite powerful, in a minimalist way. Sure it's depressing, but that's the point. Nice film.
