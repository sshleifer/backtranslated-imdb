In the Universal series of modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON is not one of the best films - even if it's fun. I think the problem is that much of the "dueling" of the film between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (played here by Lionel Atwill) seems to delay the real point of the Professor's work. <br /> <br /> Moriarty appears in three of Holmes's films with Rathbone. In the ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES was interpreted by George Zucco, who gave a real pleasure to love for evil for its own sake. For my money the performance of Zucco as a Professor was the best of the three (there is also a brief moment of comedy in his performance, when he is disguised as a "Sergeant of Police" towards the end - as if he were preparing to sing "A Policeman's Lot" by Gilbert & Sullivan). Then comes Mr. Atwill's performance here - we'll talk about it later. Finally there is Henry Daniell's intellectual Moriarty at SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN. It's a typically cool and classy performance by Mr. Daniell, but his comparisons with Holmes seem to be boring to him. They prevent him from completing the main plan. In the stories in which the professor appears, he really feels that Holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger while he is alive. Yet, due to the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) felt that Daniell was the best in the film Moriartys. <br /> <br /> If Zucco captured the love of evil in the Professor, and Daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired Oxford Don (in the stories the professor is a well-regarded mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had a "European fashion") ", and who wrote an intriguing book, THE DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID), Atwill demonstrates the Professor as a pragmatic businessman. First of all, he sold his services (apparently) to Nazi Germany. This never came into play, but it is assumed (since this is before the Nazis really started to collapse), he thinks they will win the war. Secondly, he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) proved to be in a state of near physical collapse due to the torture of Moriarty's band, the Professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting Tobel, because he is a good scientist as Tobel and would be able to put together the bomb site. Somehow I can't see Zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot, and if Daniell were to make it, he would seem annoyed by the fact that there is still another delay in his plans. <br /> <br /> By the way, a trick used in all the Holmes series about the Professor is how to free the film from him. If you read the stories of Holmes, Moriarty appears as the villain three times: in the last story of THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM"), in the first story of THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE DEL CASA VUOTA ") and the last of the four novels / novellas (THE VALLEY OF FEAR). It is incredible the mileage that the professor has had since so few appearances (he is also mentioned in two or three other stories). But because of his fate at the Reichenbach Falls in "THE FINAL PROBLEM" and "THE VUOTO HOUSE", we see him always falling to his death. Zucco falls from the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to escape from Gregson and the police, but is hit while jumping and the wounded man can't keep the wall of an adjacent building. Atwill (not seen here, but heard) seems to fall into a trap door he planted in an escape tunnel). After a while it is really boring to see the professor always fall into these films. One turns to the play by Gene Wilder (surely a comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES 'SMARTER BROTHER, in which Leo McKern is a wonderfully extravagant and evil Moriarty (complete, finally, with an Irish accent), who is not killed in the end, but is just came out brooding - in a rowboat - on how his careful schemes didn't work. I liked it better. <br /> <br /> The use of the code "Dancing Men" here, like the use of the "Devil's Foot Root" in DRESSED TO KILL, draws a part of a mystery from a short story. "THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN" appeared in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, and deals with a client of Holmes whose wife received bizarre and bloody messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE, suggests that Sir Arthur could have taken the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know. The code is basically one of the substitutions of letters for the figures of dancing men. The story in the story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a small change that confuses both Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The film will entertain, but I still think that THE HOUSE OF FEAR, THE SCARLET CLAW and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH are better films.
