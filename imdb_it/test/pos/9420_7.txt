It is one of the paradoxes of the anti-Nazi films of Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone's Voice of Terror, wartime Washington) and that, although the plots and settings are mostly terrible, he is so good at them. Despite a bizarre wind-swept hairstyle to make him look younger, he touches on every scene with so much bite and attack that you can hardly record how fragile the plots are. Here he also has an excellent acting relationship with Lionel Atwill, who makes a wonderfully repulsive professor Moriarty - a cockroach with heavy eyelids with a pleasant hint of sadism and depravity (it may not have been acting, guys). At the peak, transformed into a lab coat to drain Rathbone's blood "drop by drop", it is the most extravagant and sinister like the archenemy of Seinfeld Newman. The film itself is an ancient kiddie matin√©e cuisine, but benefits from the attention of director Roy William Neill for the staging and the atmosphere. It also seems pretty clear in the UCLA DVD restoration - don't even think of buying other versions, all faded, looming public domain prints.
