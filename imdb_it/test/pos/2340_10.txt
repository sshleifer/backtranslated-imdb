Seriously engaging, intelligent and inspiring drama at its best. Medium, compelling, moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it because you see it alone. One Life Stand makes you consider your lifestyle and the way you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting make it one of the best cinematic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this profound and gritty film. This is a film that takes care and has an honesty that has no equal in recent years. No car chase, but a film full of humor and emotions. I saw this film for the first time projected at the Edinburgh festival in 2000 and now I'm happy to be able to have a copy on DVD.
