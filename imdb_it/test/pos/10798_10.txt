When you think 'Oliver Stone' the films that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial films like Platoon, JFK, Born On The Fourth Of July, or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio usually not. It is a rather small film, actually. More than half of the film takes place with Barry Champlain at his radio station that speaks into the microphone. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's greatest films and you MUST NOT be lost. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a character study. Barry Champlain is a radiant, self-destructive and risky talk show host who says too much and starts getting into trouble with his boss, his lovers, his fans and even some Nazis. He doesn't like his audience and callers, and he doesn't like many of them (or he likes or likes them, but they have no idea why). But he finally says in his show: "I guess we're stuck with each other." <br /> <br /> See Talk Radio, even if you don't like Oliver Stone movies. You could be surprised. I was sure. <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
