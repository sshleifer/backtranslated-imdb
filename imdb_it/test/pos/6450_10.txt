I'm so happy that Zac is in "The Suite of Life of Zack and Cody" because that's my favorite show and he's my favorite actor. It's a really fun episode and a fun show !! I like everything about the show and the characters. All the artists are fantastic. He continues to act in Zac, and I'm so happy that almost all of my favorite actors (including High School Musical characters) are in this show. Zac Efron is so "hot" and I have his autographed photo! It is not a photographic copy, and arrived from America to Australia and almost did not arrive in time for Christmas. Also, I got a high school music cup with my name printed on it. (Scarlett 8)
