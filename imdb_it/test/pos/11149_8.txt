Having recently purchased the Marlene Dietrich DVD collection from Universal, I was a little reluctant to look at "Gold Earrings". The idea of ​​a 40-year-old Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy in a war love affair seemed unusual and implausible. I shouldn't have worried. With all the professional talent that came into these old movies, it's hard not to see it, really. The film was a joy to watch; it's a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the film was Dietrich, who perfectly played the role of the gypsies. Makeup, lighting, photography and its performance add up to create a truly amazing and unforgettable character. I had never seen Dietrich play a "good" woman convincingly before - but she does here! He played a lot of heartless vampires in those great Sternberg movies, so it's nice to see her in a more relaxed and relaxed role, playing an exotic but very human character. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very nice love story. The love story is credible, optimistic and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
