When I first saw the film, I thought it was sweet - a family movie. For the rest of the night and for the next two days, however, the intelligent moments and the amusing jokes continued to creep into my thoughts and our conversation ... There is much to do, classic elements of farce, good acting of the characters and Wendie Malick's plot is just hysterical. Label it as a "wellness film" belies intelligence and fun - it's smarter than it looks, just like "It's a wonderful life".
