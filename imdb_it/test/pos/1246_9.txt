I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, there was disrespect throughout the film, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that there is more value in considering others, and his life of disrespect must change. This film was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to push down the throat. There are some excellent lessons to be learned in this film. I truly believe that this was one of the best Disneys, although a couple of things may have been left out. I was impressed by the lack of swear words and the lack of sexual allusions. It's not perfect, but much better than most of the rest out there.
