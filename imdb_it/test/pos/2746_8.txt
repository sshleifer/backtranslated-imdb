I liked the shots of the airports - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., Only single buildings with the name in block capitals on the roof. And the tri-engines and well-dressed passengers. 75 years ahead .... <br /> <br /> But what really struck me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent to the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual encounter between Neil and Jill says that Jim became a general in a Chinese rebel army? That, based on the hammer and sickle, could only be Mao Tse Dung's popular revolutionary army !!! Don't worry about your underwear and the unmarried couple in bed: would that logo and that reference survive during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Further comments 27/12: This 1930s film with the Soviet emblem can / should also reflect the influence and appeal of communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Depression . Adds to the historical value of this exceptional film. <br /> <br /> I also liked the American Dream aspects of two Winnemucca guys who conquered at least part of the world, Red-Blooded (literally and profusely in the case of Jim) American Boys. <br /> <br /> Others have commented more skillfully than me in acrobatics, etc. I liked everything. <br /> <br /> This gem deserved more than just the 1.5 stars Osborne and Co. valued it on TCM, if only for recording parts of American history of the early 1930s.
