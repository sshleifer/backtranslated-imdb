A very accurate representation of the life of the little masters of the time filmed in New Jersey. The story, the characters and the script are credible but the acting leaves the ball. However, it is worth looking at, especially for the strong images, some still with me even though I saw it for the first time 25 years ago. <br /> <br /> A young hood goes up and starts doing bigger things (tries to) but these things keep going wrong, leading the local leader to suspect that his end is being eliminated, it's not a good place where to stay if you like health or life. <br /> <br /> This is the film that introduced Joe Pesce to Martin Scorsese. Also present is that perennial wise boy, Frank Vincent. Strong of characterizations and images. The sound is confused and much of the acting is amateur, but a great story.
