I was very impressed by this film directed by Luigi Bazzoni. The story was about a young woman who suddenly lost all memory of the last three days and suffered nightmares about astronauts on the moon. He can't explain how it happened to anyone. One day a postcard arrives for her from the island of Garma, where she goes to visit. strangely even though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before. Even her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very strange Italian film that sometimes seemed very haunting and there were also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you for as long as you were watching the movie. I would recommend this film to people just to see how beautiful it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
