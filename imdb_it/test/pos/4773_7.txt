... But they are also those of Minnie and Pete! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but he is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very sweet and funny. It is interesting to note that Minnie is more than a woman in this respect than she is today and Mickey is less respectful than she is now. Pete is still the same old villain, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, aboard a small steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some side characters have a lot of fun and a lot of annoyances. Even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /> <br /> I really like this episode, although in general I prefer Mickey Mouse in the future. I like animation, the steamboat and the musical theme, the smart gags - and, of course, Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many of the early cartoons, this is very random, Walt invented a very simple storyline and added gags to "gear up". There is also a parrot-side character that is very annoying and rather useless. These are the things I don't like. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this episode, that a color version was not made for this (or if it has, I've never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone having fun with Mickey Mouse and Disney will appreciate this.
