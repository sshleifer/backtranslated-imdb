The works of William Shakespeare are classified as comedy, tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable creations - and most often read - provide us with melancholy humor, gentle poetry and exhilarating trifle. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity. Regardless, he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness, contributing greatly to our young language. So in which category is The Merchant of Venice? I was very surprised to find that it is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never read it before or seen it, but after seeing this latest film version I decided that it is neither one nor the other. This is one of the many questions that the viewer must try to answer when he comes to terms with what is clearly a baffling and embarrassing moral tragedy. <br /> <br /> Players are introduced quickly and easily. One of these, first of all, is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the royal city, creating a vibrant and vibrant backdrop for the acts of the game. The young Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) enters this scenario, returning to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). Poor Bassanio seems to have heard of a princess whose father died and left a sort of lottery to potential suitors. There are three little trunks waiting on the island's beautiful lady's estate, <br /> <br /> only one of which contains "images of the princess". The one who can guess the right one, using only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written on them, will receive the enormous fortune of the father for life. Oh, and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes up the film. This farcical element of the plot guides the story and also fills much of the film's screening time, while a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive on the island, competing humorously and failing to earn this very rich hand in marriage. But before all this happens, Bassanio, very poor in finance, asks Antonio to lend him three thousand ducats to pay for the long journey he has to make to get his coup. <br /> <br /> Antonio, almost penniless, must grudgingly accept humility by seeking the financial help of Shylock (Al Pacino), one of the countless worn out Jews who keep the inflected economy afloat, but who they are despised and persecuted not to end by the zealous Christian majority of the city. Thus dwell in the belly of society, and it is here that the two borrowers must go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident in which Antonio insulted and spat at him in the city market, and proudly reproaches this man who frankly has a lot of courage coming to ask for help. But help him make Shylock. He even canceled any kind of interest on the loan, most likely he has no reason to worry if Antonio will be able to repay it within three months. Yet, Shylock's only contractual request is a kilo of Antonio's meat, if he should deny their agreement. This is a disturbing request, certainly, for Antonio and Bassanio as for us. But it seems that, despite its justified pride, Shylock does not really expect to witness such a gruesome act. <br /> <br /> So the dramatic foundations have been laid here. And while the film explores its gentler side with its love lottery and its mistaken identities, the gloomy perspective of the loan itself is still outlined. In the end, what will become of this disturbing agreement? Meanwhile we are left to take turns exploring the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has a wide dramatic weight to bring here, and does so with convincing determination and passion. There are moments when he is given space for the theatricality that is expected of such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those in which he internalizes this energy, showing a conflicting personality: honest, sincere and proud, but dark, vindictive and completely ruthless. This is one of Pacino's most popular performances to date. And while the rest of the cast plays their roles in a credible and convincing way, it is Pacino himself who is the real owner of the film, especially towards the end, when Shakespeare turns this romantic comedy upside down with a wallop of a third act. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal much here; all I can say is that it involves the initial loan: a powerful shoe that one would expect to fall sooner or later. And it always does. Eventually Shakespeare raised a series of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly unsolvable questions of faith, morality, law and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes, and while the closing of the curtain the position of the playwright may seem clear to some, we are completely disagreed. Are there winners and losers in this, but did the winners win their loot with good reason, or did they end up losing even in a broader sense? Has virtue been rewarded or simply nullified? In fact, was justice right this time? At the end of the game some destinies are painfully clear and unequivocally sealed. But the public must be the one who really decides the verdict for everyone involved. And for some the verdict is still pending for the game. Comedy or tragedy? The author has shrewdly veiled the intense court's final with a final of light cheer and peaceful resolutions. Are you saying that all is well, that it ends well, or is this your final, ironic condemnation? The humor of the game serves to prepare us well for such a heavy accident. And while it is also what, unfortunately, prevents the Merchant of Venice from reaching the greatness of so many other works of Shakespeare, it is still engaging, amusing and stimulating beyond measure.
