And she was really beautiful (Laraine Day, that is) - herself, her part, and her performance. A compelling story of selfishness against selfless love, for the same man, rich heartthrob and dipsomanic Robert Cummings. One of his periods of drunkenness leads to an incident that rages the local community and tests the courage of the two sisters (Jean Muir and Laraine Day) who are close to him (and among them). Their comfortable and slightly superficial environment is resolved when the two girls face the resulting crisis and respond to its contradictory demands for prudence, integrity, loyalty and love, with profoundly different consequences for each of them. With the old vanities and abandoned subtleties, their true characters reveal themselves in a compelling contrast. <br /> <br /> A wonderful discovery on TCM!
