Oh, it's an excellent job, of course. In fact, many of the best cinema scenes, or at least Bergman's movies, are found in this film. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow live up to expectations. Do these two give bad performances? Sven Nykvist offers masterful cinematography, even if not conventionally masterful. The script is pretty good, especially in the individual scenes. Sometimes the film is late and the rhythm is not uniform, although probably intentionally. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem? Well, the film is too dark for his sake. Other Bergman films are similarly desolate, but by no means close to this tough one. In the end, I just gave up and started to get a little irritated. I was very impressed often during the film, but in the end I didn't feel involved. It's a fantastic film, but I doubt I'll ever see it again, or recommend it to friends. Or if I had suggested it, I would be very sure to warn them of what is ahead. 8/10.
