Like all other Mel Brooks comedies, Men in Tights is fun. But seeing this as an outrageous comedy, I think many don't realize that the reason the film is so funny is that the characters themselves have been played so well. Elwes is the well-known former British nobleman, Lewis is an eternally annoyed king (I hope it's worth all the NOOOOOOIII!), DeLuise is a FANTASTIC godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff ... Actors and actresses I am so faithful to their parts that the lines run with ease. Yes, we've already seen this kind of comedy, but the only comedy to get a better character development, in my opinion, is The Big Lebowski. Very very funny.
