Film follows four friends from the 1950s (when I am in high school) until 1981. I am Danilo (Craig Wasson) a Yugoslav immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston) who has no personality and Tom (Jim Metzler) a big boy, strong, handsome and robust. All three are in love with Georgia, but she loves only Danilo. The film focuses mainly on these two - it tells their life, love and mutual attraction over the years. He also joins Danilo trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie but it is not lacking in negative points. Thelan's high and shrill voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps very quickly; The lives of Tom and David are never explained (Tom presents himself with a Vietnamese wife and children and David has a wife we ​​never meet until the end); some crucial scenes are poorly written and there is an obvious preliminary cut (probably to keep the film 2 hours). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good that you can easily forget the problems. The story is compelling: you really know and understand the characters and you always get involved in lives. With few exceptions, the script (by Steve Tesich) is good - in fact, Tesich was a Yugoslavian immigrant and he based most of the script on his experiences. All the acting is great - especially Thelan and Wasson - Reed Birney also throws a strong and pleasant show like Louie, Danilo's college roommate. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And look quickly at Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br /> <br /> Basically, it is a real great story of immigrants, who come of age, love America and cover the 50s and 80s perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film was (unjustly) vilified about its release. The studio didn't know how to publicize it (it's a difficult film to market) and the critics trampled it (Pauline Kaels' review in "The New Yorker" was particularly harsh) He barely played in theaters (I was lucky enough to see him in 1981 in his short theatrical series) and he simply disappeared. It's a shame. This is a film that is just ready for reprint. I'm not betting on it - but you never know! A precise 10 all the way!
