One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog ​​in search of an orange after being animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who wants an orange. The dog runs into an orange after falling off the back of a car while it was being sold, but at night he must protect the orange when he enters a diabolical nightclub with many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog returns the orange to the child and is saved from a terrible death by scurvy. The mascot presents new techniques that I have not yet seen in Starewicz's films. The addition of the synchronization sound and a mixture of live action with stop-motion animation makes Starewicz's old puppet style even more interesting. Live scenes of moving cars and feet of people walking like a puppet sits on the concrete pavement is impressive and fresh. The car horns and street vendors' cries are noteworthy due to the fact that the small studios in the studio are expensive and Starewicz's use of the new technology looks like an old hat. New puppet characters in this film are scary contributions to the devil's club scene. Twigss and shreds of newspapers come to life. Dead bird skeletons lay eggs that hatch skeletal chicks. The characters arrive flying all over on pats and pavilions and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses rapid zooms that are obtained with editing to accelerate the rhythm of what used to be a slow scene. Overall, Starewicz is able to update his cinematic style to meet the needs of a new audience, making this film one of the best examples of his work.
