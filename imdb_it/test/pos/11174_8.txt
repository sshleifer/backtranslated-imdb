Lucasarts brought out another beauty from a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. If further proof is required of these kinds of games, then this is it. Before even playing, there was little concern about how writers would continue to keep up with the gags after the first two games. The fears were full that he should have been a little thin. <br /> <br /> Play and find out how quickly these fears are dispelled. From the introductory video with Guybrush in the dodgem boat (!), To the final stages of the carnival, the jokes keep coming. I was a big fan of the first two games and other Lucasarts works (Day Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.) And this does not fail to provide quality. You will not be disappointed. (Well, I wasn't.)
