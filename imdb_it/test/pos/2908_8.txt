This Fox show was a great success when it was released in 1954. Produced in a prodigious way, with fantastic music and scenery, an intriguing cast, it moves slowly but in an interesting way. Edmund Purdom is extraordinarily beautiful as an Egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor, juggling three wonderful women: a maid Jean Simmons who passively adores him, the temptress Bella Darvi who escapes him, and the sister of a pharaoh Gene Tieney who wants him as his spelled. The film's popularity has not diminished, as it has been re-shown on AMC (preferably in widescreen). Purdom is particularly large, his character seems to have struck with women, ending up never being married and a "thinker". Darvi is incredible and tempting in her role as a femme fatale. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, Peter Ustinov is a co-star. Check it out.
