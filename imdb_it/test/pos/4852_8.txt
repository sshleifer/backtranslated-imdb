This is a film about a man that everyone thinks is Jewish. This is a film about Lawrence Newman, who lives in Brooklyn in the 1940s, at the time of the Second World War. One day when people put on their glasses, people start thinking that they are Jewish. And that alone, because it looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic neighborhood. Some people start treating it like garbage. They make that judgment, being Jewish, of Larry's fresh wife, Gertrude Hart. life is unbearable. Neal Slavin's Focus (2001) is a fairly good view of anti-Semitism. This is a problem that will not go away. The film is based on the novel by Athur Miller, which, I admit, I haven't read. But the film is really good, so I'm sure the book would be too. The actors do a good job. William H. Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant. . almost as scary as the neighbor who wants to keep the Jews out by any means necessary. The character of Paymer is the owner of the Jewish shop. Finkelstein is the cutest in the film. Paymer is the perfect choice for the role. One of the most beautiful scenes is at the end when Mr. Fanelstein and Newman fight against those Nazi people with baseball bats. They come together to fight evil. The Christian and the Jew.
