On March 17, 1974, a man was found dead in the toilets of Manhattan's Penn Station. Although well known, he cannot be identified because he has deleted personal information on his passport and his body remains unclaimed at the city morgue for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73, on his journey from India, where one of his biggest projects, the Ahmedabad Institute for Management, was nearing completion. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential post-war American architects Louis Kahn's architectural heritage includes the parliament house in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a sort of mobile "musical boat", designed to give concerts in the ports of various cities around the world. <br /> <br /> Although celebrated as an architect, little was known about his private life. In addition to his wife Esther, and their daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn is survived by two lovers, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. All three families lived miles away from each other on the outskirts of Philadelphia, but their streets never crossed until the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of this film, was only 11 years old at the time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he embarks on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn's buildings, talking with relatives and colleagues and visiting places that played a role in Louis Kahn's life. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching clash is when Nathaniel asks his mother, landscape architect and lover of Louis Kahn, why he continued playing the second violin with his wife and never faced it with this . Tears lose their eyes, but they have no regrets. "It was worth it." It's such a sad time. She is obviously shattered, treated as an outcast at her funeral, forbidden to participate, it's almost as if she leads a life of replacement. Everything seems strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural nemesis, who was responsible for rebuilding his native Philadelphian in the 1950s and 1960s, suffers almost a stroke on the spot, when he remembers Kahn's unpleasant ideas about architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very old Bacon literally shouts in rage whenever Kahn's name appears. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's greatest creation, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years to complete, a vast and extraordinary building, of which the Bangladeshi are extremely proud. It is one of the very few national symbols of stature in this impoverished nation. Some interviews with the locals have brought tears to my eyes, especially when they find out they are talking - God forbid - the architect's son! <br /> <br /> The film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of Kahn's great architectural legacy and concerns above all the fruition of the film itself and of cinema in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn has wavered like a father, but these flaws in his personal life make a portrait even more interesting in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
