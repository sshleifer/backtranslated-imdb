When I was told about this movie I wasn't too happy to see it, even though for the closing credits, it turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> the film itself is rather graphic (male-to-male scenes, you can't see everything) it wouldn't be a gay-themed movie if there wasn't ... <br /> <br /> the film is very light in humor and contains very funny parts. I highly recommend this movie, about 3 quarters through your feelings for the main characters, and I think it brings the whole movie together. <br /> <br /> once again, very well put together ... more sympathetic Mormon.
