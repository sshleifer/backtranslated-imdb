Hollywood has turned the mafia into a production line that ranges from the trivial to the excellent and despite some good acting and a reasonable script (many of which are - for a change - true!) This "home entertainment" effort must slap in the half. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all the boxes on the checklist end up being checked), but it spends a lot of time trying to make a mess of the best work of others. The Godfather is the most obvious, but there are also other references. I won't worry about naming them. However he is a tasteful borrower! The producer seems to set a quota for the shots and the murder (at least every twenty minutes?) And the ending is weak and "then?" I was told that there are various versions of this production so maybe this is just the version I've seen. <br /> <br /> Gangsters don't make money they take money. Usually from fear. Some seem more involved in the murder and ruin of business than in making money. They were the ones who were the first to go (in real life and here). "You can't make money with a gun in your hand," says Charlie "Lucky" Luciano at one point. One of the smartest gangsters, even if all things are relative. He was a skilled white slave trader and a drug dealer before being transferred to Italy. <br /> <br /> The old school "mustachioed peas" was chosen by the new blood that wanted power and money for themselves and free themselves from the jacket of Italian / Sicilian power (rarely doing business outside of themselves ). The young Turk knew that they needed to be allied with other groups (particularly "Jews" who knew how to launder money) and this is at least a reference and recognized. What has not been clarified is that most immigrant groups owned their own mafia, but most of them made their money and obtained the right. Why not? Who wants to die in prison? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man ready to kill if necessary, but not unfair or stupid. His story was tragic in the sense that he could earn money in the outside world and showed a special skill in avoiding being killed. With luck, of course. <br /> <br /> Despite the range of respectable names and three actors in the title role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi) there is no charisma or talent to bring us and feel something. We are simply passive observers in a life that we are glad not to have lead. The people shown here were born into a cruel world but their only sign was to make it more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can't get enough of the gangster genre it will be better than watching Godfather 1 & 2 for the tenth time and it is even better - as basic entertainment - than the horrible fire that was the Godfather 3.
