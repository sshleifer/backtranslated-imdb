Ray is interesting in part, and technically it's very well done, but Ray is often lazy and forgets some important details about Ray's life. The whole film shows us parts in which it is in its greatest splendor, and most successful, which is good, it's just that I wanted to see some pieces of his previous life. Jamie Fox imitates Ray Charles in a t, sometimes it's absolutely disturbing. I have to say, Jamie is the reason I passed this movie. The 1st time is much better than the 2nd. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph and it's not even remotely as slow as the second one. At first I wasn't a big Ray Charles fan, so I didn't have any expectations for the film, as far as I'm concerned. Ray's biggest problem had to be the long duration. This could have been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes besides those they used. I found the first part of Ray's life when he was starting to get success, the most interesting. He was humble then, and a bit of a gentleman. And while the film may have exaggerated his actions too much, he became a little too full of himself for me to look after. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for the ages like Ray. It looks like Ray, he talks like Ray, he acts like Ray. He even sings like Ray! This is much more than an impression, I really thought it was, Ray Charles. It was the heart of the film and, without his presence, this film would have been completely boring. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Ray is interesting at times, terribly boring in others. When all was said and done, I was disappointed with how the routine looked at times. Just because it is a bibliographic film does not mean that it is automatically worthy of an Oscar. Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar, but the film is above average at best. It's worth looking at, but if I were you, I'd keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
