Big Fat Liar is what you get by combining terrific writing, great production and an emphasis on smart ideas compared to the teenage pap. The two stars work great together, and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Putting "Irkel" and Lee Majors in the film were fantastic touches. Watch this movie with your children. If you don't laugh about it, you don't have to pay attention.
