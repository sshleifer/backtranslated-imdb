This film went into production before the start of World War II, but was not released until it was started. With a significant fascist sympathy in the United States, and Chaplin himself suspected of being a communist sympathizer, The Great Dictator was a very brave effort. Such risks in filming - subtly veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable today. Imagine the fallout if someone today made an equally satirical film that criticized US foreign policy? <br /> <br /> This film is hilarious, touching and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin makes an appeal for madness to end, but it is already too late for him and for us. A must see if you have any interest in history, film, politics or sattire as an art form.
