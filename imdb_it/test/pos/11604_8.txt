I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally managed to watch it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you don't have the chance to see many of the more serious Bollywood films like this. Very well done, but I would say that you need to pay attention to what is happening as it is easy to get lost. When you start watching the movie, don't do anything else! Actually I would advise people to read all the reviews here ... including those with spoilers, before watching the movie. Raima Sen gave his first big performance I saw. Aishwarya was easily at his best. All the shows were strong, directing and cinematography ... go see it!
