How many of us have read a book or seen a play, and then when the film version came out we were terribly disappointed? Well, maybe this would be one of those movies for those who saw the comedy, but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage, I was extremely amused by this movie. The characters were fun, the music was fantastic, and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters, the flaws and everything else. Jonathan Silverman has good comic timing, and his jokes are particularly hilarious. I'm not going to give spoilers, it's just a well-made, entertaining movie that shows the inner workings of a middle-class family during World War II. So if you've never seen the comedy, and if you've enjoyed Neil Simon's other films, don't be held back by the couple of negative reviews seen here. Alone, Brighton Beach Memoirs is a GREAT film. I guarantee it (without refund, though).
