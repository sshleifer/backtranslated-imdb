If you are tired of the same repetitive and non-intelligent material released by the traditional film industry, you will have fun with "You Are Alone". It is stimulating, well turned and compelling. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything you don't find in the first few minutes of the film, this is the story of a young white high school girl in an upper-middle class environment who works as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the film takes place in a hotel room where she hired her to come. <br /> <br /> Through their discussion, you explore two changing views on prostitution, depression, loneliness. Yet the film is not depressing. Talk about dark things without getting depressed. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, your emotions and preconceived notions are moved, but gently. You come out with a lot to think about. I like it in a movie.
