Obviously cheap to capitalize on the infamous "Mandingo", this ludicrously filthy bundle of cheerfully rancid Italian sexploitation stuff really pours into the sordid stuff with an appreciable lack of taste and moderation: the evil arrogant white family that owns and runs sumptuous slave plantations spend most of their time on the screen engaging in the hanky panky both of each other and their various slaves. The director Mario Penzauti and the screenwriter Tecla Romanelli fill this fetid filth with a swarming surplus of sizzling waste: we have rape rape, interracial copulation (a white woman makes wild love with a black muscular pin while tied to a cross), a woman abundant nudity, brutal lashes, vile degradation, a lot of filthy soft-core sex, and a tragic surprise ending surprise that mixes elements of incest, murder and crossbreeding in a questionable attempt to make a declaration on the horrible inhumanity of the slavery. Special compliments are needed for the cute and brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose lustful and uninhibited depiction of the depraved and lascivious evil whore Rhonda positively burns the screen. Moreover, the funky and pulsating soundtrack by Marcello Giombini strikes the most beautiful point. Even the rather refined cinematography of Maurizo Centini does the trick. A piece of drowsiness and slimy slimy swill.
