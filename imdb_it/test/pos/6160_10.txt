Nothing less than magnificent photography / cinematography in this film. The fact that you keep searching and hoping for more flight sequences tells you that they have enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly intertwined and the dogs are splendid ............. <br /> <br /> A must rent, see or see. <Br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> A little aversion therapy applies <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> < br />
