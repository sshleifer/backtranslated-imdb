This is a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black guy who is accused of killing a tourist in Florida and the case of the subsquit case that follows. What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it is to be able to condemn an ​​innocent man and like an old senile idiot who thinks that a black man looks a lot like another and if he rots in prison because I said he was the man who killed my wife. The star is the defense lawyer who is brilliant not only in his work in court, but he also did what the police should have always done. Fascinating stuff 7 out of 10.
