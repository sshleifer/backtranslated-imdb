While I was reading all the complaints about this movie before seeing it, I still had interest from the preview. I don't know if it was because I was expecting a bomb or something, but I really liked the movie. The I wasn't very scared until the second half of the film, but even then it wasn't bad at all. I think most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic, even if a little too casual, but the story had to be moved. I think the house and the surrounding area are the perfect setting for this type of film, it's beautiful and huge, but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary. I also think that the arrangement of the light worked very well because not only did they light up at the entrance, but there was no way to keep them lit, so the house remained in the dark outside the small section where Jill was. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jill, I thought her part was well interpreted, at first it wasn't credible, but after a few phone calls it was fine. In fact, the scenes in which she is scared behave perfectly. And finally, someone has had the right poker fire. I can't tell you how many times when I hear a noise at my house I take Fire Poker, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same, even if she idiotically forgets it when she needs it most. /> <br /> Regarding the holes in the plot, the film is not perfect but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the mystery is how did it get in ... exactly, how long was it to look at it? how did he come out to kill his friend? and when exactly did the gardener die? overall, I liked it and was surprised at how fast it went. It caught my attention, and I wanted to see how it ended, even though the ending was very short and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, besides the ending, was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her extra situation, to give us a taste of her personality and to give us a foretaste of how she will handle the situation (for example, the scene in which she discusses whether to go back for the children, it seems that in the beginning there is a scene that speaks of her that only cares about herself or something like that).
