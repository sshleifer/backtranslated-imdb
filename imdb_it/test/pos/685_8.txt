I swear that if I ever tried cocaine I would be able to relate perfectly to this movie. Its rhythm, like the dialogue, churns out at a speed that some viewers may need to stop and relax their heads. <br /> <br /> There are small elements that appear in the film, as Rob Lowe the character always seems to lose a shoe, or as some characters continue to run the spirals around his zigzag path. The story has been put together very well and the direction seems impeccable. <br /> <br /> The film exudes awkwardly and sweetly. This is one I think most could enjoy. Some moments of laughter out loud, even if it is only you, assure me that I will certainly be looking at it again.
