John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful film is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced the 1951 original, Carpenter retains the themes of Cold War paranoia and trusts as the background of an alien acquisition and a looming fate amid the madness and isolation of the Antarctic environment. Directed by Carpenter is always excellent as his camera slides into the solitary world of characters whose habitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body change. But here and very similar to the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter does not hold back on the episode, since through some fantastic special effects we witness some crazy moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, since in the face of all that is going on foolishly in front of us, we have remained with perceived perceptions of trust and suspicion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
