When THE CHINA SYNDROME was released, many right-wing critics and nuclear advocates blew this film apart, mainly because its three main stars were all known for their liberal politics and their obvious distrust of nuclear power. But it took only two weeks and an almost catastrophic accident at Three Mile Island to close those critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are the Los Angeles troupe who witness a potentially dangerous accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas films the event through the factory's soundproof glass; but the television station will not broadcast the video, fearing massive legal action. It is therefore Fonda and Douglas's task to arrive at the truth, despite a massive attempt by the plant owners to cover the incident. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious shift supervisor (Jack Lemmon) discovered some flaws in the support structure of the plant's pump. He believes that these defects are the cause of the accident and that, although it is extremely expensive and long, if repairs are not made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he can't convince anyone who works with him to believe his story. The result is a nightmare climax that brings together various stories of political, technological and human interest in a single disturbing package. <br /> <br /> Although clearly of a politically liberal nature, THE CHINA SYNDROME, well directed and co-written by James Bridges (THE PAPER CHASE), is also basically a message film about the dangers of putting technology together and nuclear energy. Basically, nuclear energy can NEVER be made safe because people can NEVER be perfect. This is what the film says; and in a very amusing and suspenseful way, he says it brilliantly.
