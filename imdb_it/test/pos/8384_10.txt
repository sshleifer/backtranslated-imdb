That's what I thought when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And they are both from Germany and in the movies. <br /> <br /> That guy is over 50 and so far has only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he hasn't played the main parts. Obviously no one has ever noticed, what he is capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he had a chance to change that - and - let's say so - that it was bingo! He is living proof of what a great Tarrantino caster is. <br /> <br /> By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the film like a German - to be able to understand everything. And the German dialogue is written almost like English. <br /> <br /> Now I could repeat what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: finally, QT is back.
