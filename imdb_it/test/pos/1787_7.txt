Followed by the 1965 film "My Name Is Barbra" and shot with bright colors, "Color Me Barbra" has La Streisand that alternates nostalgia, comedy clowning, feminine romantic anguish and seducing seriousness for a horrible quilt of show-biz razzle amaze. It is a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With his Egyptian eye make-up and his ever-changing hairstyles, he is also a chameleon. His voice is rich and moving, although some of his songs are not ("One Kiss", "Yesterdays"). The circus sequence is not as intriguing as the journey in the museum (with the idea of ​​Barbra becoming images in paintings, an idea that works better than one might think). The circus-medley (built around songs with the word "face"!) Is extremely feminine, without ever becoming really charming. Still, this is a lively, jazzy special - not quite as emotionally stimulating as "My Name Is Barbra", but certainly a third-year effort.
