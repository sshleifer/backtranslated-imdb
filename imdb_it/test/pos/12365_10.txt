Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status among silent films, directed by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the male lead, is based on a story by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of the brutal drinker David Holm, who beats his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drink and is blind for love of nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits down at the end of the year with his drunken friends in the city park and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot (Körkarlen): those who die on New Year's Eve as the last before dawn must serve as a pilot Death and release dying souls from their bodies. But David begins to quarrel with his friends, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks to death on the ground. Meanwhile, the Phantom Transport is approaching. The driver is none other than David's late friend Georges, who seduced him in alcohol and died a year earlier. Since David refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him. Together, they drive to the stations where the people who suffered from David live. They visit Nurse Edit, whose love for David was not able to recognize and who he infected with tuberculosis, so he is now dying. But his unconditional love for David will save his soul. Satisfied with his spirit, they come to David's wife and children. David is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David threw her. They also visit David's brother, who committed a murder after being seduced to drink by David. David asks Georges to return to his body, because he finally sees that his path is wrong. Since it was Georges who seduced him once to drink, David's desire is granted, he has a second chance, and Georges must be another year the Ghost Transport driver to pay for his sins. This film probably belongs to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Deplorably, it is not yet available on international DVD.
