An extraordinary but very pleasant performance by John Travolta starts this comedy very funny. His interpretation of the archangel is like a sloppy gentleman, a womanizer, an overweight. And, of course, it has a hypnotic effect on the women he meets on his trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very low in his role as head reporter for Chicago Tabloid owner Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell has a very important role in the role of "Four Weddings and a Funeral". Maureen Stapleton is ordered in a cameo. His comment, "Michael does not suffer fools", is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the protagonists who fails to connect, a little off the wall. You're mainly there to see Michael take on a bull, hypnotize waitresses and dancers in a western-style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that you're completely free. It is a memorable comedy that is worth more than a vision.
