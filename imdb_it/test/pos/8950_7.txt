Once again, seeing this type of film transforms me more and more into English humor, not too often seen on the screen since the days of Monty Python and Man About The House. Sin. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (The one I first saw in Saving Grace at the beginning of the year, another must see by the way.) It excels, as does Alfred Molina. The rest of the cast, although practically unknown to me, also performs great performances. The film starts slowly and gradually gains pace and fun - halfway through, I had tears in my eyes laughing. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun British film, a thousand times better than the alleged "funny" garbage that comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
