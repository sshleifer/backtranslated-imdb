I've never seen Doctor Who before (at least not in a focused way), so I was new to the concept. I must say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it should also say "comedy" in the description of the genre, many plot turns are acceptable only because of their comic value), it's well written and is doing a poor budget. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current television programs. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first eight episodes, and # 6-8 have been my favorites so far. Even the types of stories that are all too easy to ruin (with time travel, saving dead parents and that sort of thing) work incredibly well here. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and carefree though occasionally gloomy doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him, I'll be rather surprised. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. There is no doubt, however, that the Eccleston episodes will go down in history as classics. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. Doc is much more a paternal figure than a romantic interest, yet there are traces of romantic insinuations between them, which however is much more emotional and human than sexual. <br /> <br /> A beautiful show. The biggest drawback is the low budget: a show like this should have better special effects. And because they don't just use some cheaper effects, I don't know. Nowadays, SFX doesn't have to cost a bundle - just look at the Star Wars: Revelations fan. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
