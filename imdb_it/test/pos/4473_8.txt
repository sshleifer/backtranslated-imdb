A film about the relationship between a man and a leopard that is very reminiscent of "The English Patient", even in a scene similar to when the character of Ralph Fiennes takes his lover's body through a cliff of desert rock. In "A Passion in the Desert", the main character carries the leopard's body on a cliff of desert rock but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded by a very brief history of Balzac, the film is not perfect, but not a wonder. The final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 of 10)
