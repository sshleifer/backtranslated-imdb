In 1982, a small film called MAKING LOVE shocked the public with its frank and open representation of a romantic love story about two men. <br /> <br /> I have waited years for a good old love story between two men; LATTER DAYS is all this and much more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, monotonous, and quite banal. This is what makes it so wonderful. There is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> As for the question of religion, excuse people, but these things happen and people are happening to gays even now. It is not just the Mormon Church that rejects its gay members. Homosexuals of every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It has a perfect blend of a fantasy novel set in the reality of the characters' everyday life. If I could give him more than ten stars, I'd do it. Good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's time!
