Favela Rising is a documentary on the Rio slums, the favelas, in particular the most violent, Vigário Geral. According to this film, many more children have died violently in the favelas of Rio in the last decade or more than in Israel / Palestine during the same period - a surprising fact if true, which shows how little recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world. This is an important topic, especially for those who see hope in basic efforts to marry those most in need and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program. This is a compelling documentary, if occasionally ruined by a somewhat too personal version of events and by digital videos and grainy movies that can sometimes make you think you need to have your eyes examined. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen of the drug the dominion in the favelas and the adolescents who armed with pistols are the main drug pushers, as in some parts of Colombia. Fernando Meirelles' film City of God / Cidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of the favelas of Rio). But the first section of Favela Rising shows that in reality the favela boys celebrate violence and want to deal with drugs where money and action are. It's nice to carry a gun there, nice to work as a drug dealer: it's fifty times more profitable than the profits available by other means. <br /> <br /> Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson Sá and José Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly convinced his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come to make a film with his promise to finance it. Sá's eloquence and charisma and a surprising turning point in his life make him the center of the film and its main narrator, but like the favelas themselves the film is full of other people. No doubt that Sá is an extraordinary leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia: filming was very dangerous. Anderson Sá's friendship and protection and prudence and diplomacy allowed the directors to gain access to and take detailed footage of their subjects while (mostly: there were close calls) avoiding any serious confrontation with the drug lords or policemen. They also trained the kids to use the cameras and left them there for travel home. This resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare blows of violent incidents including police beatings. It is difficult for a stranger to keep track of the police massacres in Rio. There was one in the early 1990s that looms over history and inspired Sá, who ended his first involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. Policemen are everywhere in drug trafficking and if someone doesn't like it the badly trained paramilitaries of the police (often wear black ski masks) and shoot at a neighborhood, killing many innocent people. <br /> <br /> This is more or less the photo we receive in the City of God of Meirelles, except that this time Sá, Junior and the other boys enter, in Vigário Geral, but they spread to a number of others favelas to give percussion lessons that attract dozens of young people - girls and boys. Their AfroReggae program (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR), formed in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young blacks in the ghettos of Rio. It leads them to quit smoking, alcohol and drugs (this is the rule) to explode in rap, songs, percussion and gymnastics in expressive and galvanic performances. In the end the best of the artists directed by Sá appears before the large local audiences with local producers, and their Banda AfroReggae has an international registration contract. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups have been created by or through the GCAR over the years in Vigário Geral and in other favelas to seek the improvement of youth by providing training and staging of music performances, capoeira, theater, hiphop and dance in the GCAR centers. <br /> <br /> Performing arts are not everything, just the focal point. GCAR is also a movement for wider social change By gathering public awareness through such shows, the centers also provide information training (newspapers, radio, Internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education, to try to fill the gaps between rich and poor, in black and white and to offer workshops in audiovisual work, including the production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> There are many favela street and home life scenes in Favela Rising and they look a lot like the images in City of God with the important difference that the focus and the result is much, much more positive. Not that it's not an uphill battle. And the corruption of the police, the injustices of the social system and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of these. But there is a scene in which Sá speaks with some boys in another favela, the cynical non-enthusiastic Afro Reggae boys and determined to work in drug trafficking as Sá himself did as a boy. Sá does not seem to convince any of them, while stressing that the traffickers do not arrive at the age of fifty. But we learn that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also a report of a bizarre incident that disabled Sá, but with a positive result. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story had been modified a bit, but this is lively and stimulating material and represents a committed and risky documentary film, and it's nice that Favela Rising has been included in seven film festivals and has won numerous awards, including one for best new documentary filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival. He is currently exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London. However, a large audience of artisans in the United States seems rather unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in the SFIFF 2006.
