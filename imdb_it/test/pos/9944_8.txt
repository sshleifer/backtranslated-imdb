I noticed that many people are doing the Opera because of the way Betty reacts to the murders. I think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a "normal" person would react. The fact is that ... Betty is not a "normal" person, due to traumatic events in her childhood. He has problems long before the film starts ... and at the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... it has become totally upset. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILER -------------------- --------------- ---- You have to keep in mind that when she was a very young child she testified that her mother's lover committed at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochistic mother was taking off looking at her. <br /> <br /> She had grown up from a woman who achieves sexual release bound to watch girls being hacked, cut and strangled to death. This is not for a healthy home life. I think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would use all kinds of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to make sure her daughter never did her espionage. It is also likely that at his impressionable age, Betty may have been deeply confused by what she saw. It's just something that adults do, etc. <br /> <br /> Betty obviously looks at her mother ... I mean ... she became an opera singer like her. If Mom likes it, it can't be bad, she can ... Mom can't be bad, can she? He couldn't tell the police about his mother or this mysterious hooded man he associates with his mother. <br /> <br /> Betty has many deeply rooted emotional issues. His mind has been trying for years to block the memory of what his mother saw ... but it keeps coming to the surface, manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares, headaches that throb with skulls, dependence on relaxation techniques, and sexual frigidity She associates brutal violence / bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. There is an inner struggle between the part of Betty who confused murder / sex and the part of her that believes these things are wrong. <br /> <br /> After seeing her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man ... she calls the police, but is not willing to give her name. The part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call, but the part that is ambivalent won't allow her to admit personal involvement. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. So he turns away from the phone in the rain ... and when caught by the director he plays surprisingly calm, not as angry as one might think that a "normal" person would be ... because the part of her that was blocking things from when she was a child she is looking for her most damned to block the horror of what she has just witnessed. <br /> <br /> The state of affairs in his life contributes to creating an impasse in Betty's psyche. His singing career is starting to bear fruit ... he will be a great opera singer like his mother. But will she become like her mother in every way? In the darkest ways? Or will he be able to make his way? Add this to the re-emergence of the hooded man who kills everyone around her. <br /> <br /> It is not until the hooded man kills the character of Daria Nicolodi that Betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer. Here is someone who loves Betty, who has supported her with all her heart in her emerging career, which in fact is a mother figure in Betty's life since her mother died. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then see the woman who is the closest thing to a mother to get shot through the eyeball. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I won't. The main essence of what I'm saying is that Betty's character is far more complex than most reviewers here have been willing to acknowledge. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of the best ... and not only for the graphics (even if they are truly magnificent) and not only for inventive murders (even if they are). There is a depth here ... and attention must be paid.
