"Valley Girl" launched the career of Nicolas Cage and was an 80s version of "Romeo and Juliet". It is a clear example of the 80s teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have a brilliant portrait in this film, but will never surpass "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as a teenager movie of the 80s, because if it wasn't for "Fast Times", then the generation from the 80s of teenage gestures would be just a big blow to the head. Certainly.
