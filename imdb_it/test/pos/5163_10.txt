A brief review follows without spoilers. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. I'm so happy that movies like this will be made in our blockbuster era. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new film "You, The Living" is nothing more than a complete masterpiece. You, The Living is composed of about 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. I won't give away the content of the scenes here, because I hate when people ruin even the smallest details. But yes, most of the scenes made the thousands of people in Claude Debussy's theater utterly bewildered and amazed. When the film was finished, we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice. <br /> <br /> So what is the score of "You, The Living". Hmm, Andersson isn't afraid to face the heavy questions; History, Guilt, Gandality The Holocaust during the Second World War are great arguments (and these themes work very well together). <br /> <br /> The images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes exceeds "Songs from the Second Floor". <br /> <br /> Well, sorry for this ranting, praising review. Look for the Flying House at the beginning people! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars - A masterpiece (I never throw this grade).
