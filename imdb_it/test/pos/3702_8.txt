At first I didn't have much confidence, but as a citizen of Costa Rica I can confirm that the film shows the reality that we live day by day, and shows many things about our culture, like our way of talking, our music, our way to defend our rights without fear, without weapons. <br /> <br /> I am really proud of their work and how they didn't forget the message they wanted us to receive, regardless of money, but actually working on a tight budget, making us appreciate the beautiful scenery and the beautiful photographs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend seeing this movie, you won't regret it.
