I don't know the English version of this film, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest film I've seen in many years. The characters say so many fun things and make so many strange references to current events that I'm amazed they continue to have more options, like the architect who can never correctly say the name of the magician Miraculix. It becomes something like Malcolm (i) X and "utenriks", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. <br /> <br /> Like the word "utenriks", many of the translations give no meaning in English, and probably not even in French, so the translators must have invented their lines, and they did it very well. Of course, they have a very good base to build on, with a film that is simply comic from start to finish! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with a good translation!
