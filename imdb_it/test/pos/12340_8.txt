ONE DARK NIGHT is a very neglected and little known movie of the early 80s that deserves an audience that I fear will never get, and it's a real shame. I saw this film over others that have had a bigger name over the years, particularly PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a very different film from those and I don't see the comparisons besides the mausoleum, which is a bit similar to that of PHANTASM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I'm not sure how this slipped without broader acceptance. Maybe it's all in marketing, I don't know. Perhaps a remake would give new life to it, unless Raymar drained all his life. I'm not too big for all the remakes that are abundant these days, but I think they work well with lesser-known films (except the terrible GHOST SHIP remake, which in addition to Mudvayne's opening scene and non-Falling blues, total crap). So if a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT happened to fall into the right hands, I think it would make a lot of people come to watch the original. I know that's what I do if there's a remake of a movie I've never seen before. So, apart from a remake, I'm afraid, I wouldn't want to bring this film back to life. Unless, of course, Raymar doesn't think about it. <br /> <br /> In any case, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must for horror fans, especially for the horror fans of the 80s (because we all know that the best horror movies were made ). Disturbing setting Quite good acting. A really nice story Campy. What more could you want from a horror movie of the early 1980s? What is that ... nakedness and cold blood? Well sorry. No nudity or blood in this film, but it's still great! A solid 8 out of 10. Have fun.
