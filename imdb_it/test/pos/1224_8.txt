This is a decent movie. Although a little short in time for me, it contains a lot of action, determination, common sense and emotions in that period of time. Matt Dillon and the other main character do a great job in this film. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the film. It's not a typical Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was really a very satisfying price film. My evening was fantastic thanks to this film. This film is a traditional action film with great acting, history and direction. I would recommend this movie. The development of the character of the characters was good and makes you believe that they were actually witnessing a real event. Since this film I believe was made with a lower budget, the acting and quality were much higher.
