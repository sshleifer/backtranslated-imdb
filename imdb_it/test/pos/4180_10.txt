Try to look for another movie that is such a journey without having a story or a storyline and you will be very busy. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentation. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time capsule of an era, but also an experimental feature film that challenges time, space and conventions in a way that only underground films of the 1960s could have. reflection of those films. No matter how you feel about the Monkees, this is a film that every filmmaker should see because it opens up the infinite possibilities of the film as an art medium. Had it not been for the film's unconventional advertising campaign (and the fact that when the media-saturated Monkees came out that the public got tired of them and every critic was ready to jump on them) this could have had a much greater impact. Studying the way the film was edited is much more important and exciting than it really is in the film, yet there are some great things (great songs, great photography, etc.). It should be seen after midnight for maximum effect due to its overall dreamlike feeling. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a request for change (hence the working title of the film "Changes") and HEAD perfectly reflects that moment.
