I was one of the lucky people to be invited to watch this movie in New York. It's a compelling story of how an extremely close group of friends faced the September 11 tragedy. This film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit, through love and friendship, can resist and create wonderful things in one of our darkest days. The directors really captured the emotions of the people involved. It was surprising to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people. That day I left the theater to call all my friends just to say hello. I would recommend everyone to see this documentary. I would rate this film with an A ++++++++++. Look at it if you have the chance.
