I was shocked to learn that Jimmy Caan left this show, does anyone know why? I consider James one of the greatest of all time and I am not surprised that he ended up on TV, which may be better than the shit you see on the big screen. The stories are smooth and the camera faster than a projectile accelerator! We must not forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch .. Also, someone can tell me why on earth there is a melody for crap, but Elmi JXL's remix of Un po 'less than conversation is used on initial NBC transmissions ?? Doesn't it make sense to use a motif that would be associated with the mecca of gambling in America for DVD versions?
