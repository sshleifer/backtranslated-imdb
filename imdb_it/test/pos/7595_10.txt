I think Never Been Kissed was an absolutely fantastic movie. The casting was really good and they played very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and obviously it was excellent for me. At first I was scared because he said he didn't go on video. Boy, I'm glad it's because it's a movie out of the ordinary. Go see it if you haven't already!
