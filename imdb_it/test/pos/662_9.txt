OK, so the following review is more of a synopsis than actually a spoiler, but it's better to be safe than sorry to avoid being blacklisted, right? Right! Consider yourself officially warned and read ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the most beautiful moment in the history of horror cinema - the 80s - a group of stupid teenagers are gathering to host a session in the home of the notorious McGee murder, who slaughtered his entire family a few years ago and buried them in the back yard. As I'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "Where's the beef ??" and in the typical fashion of horror movies of the 80s the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is banal and the beautiful women are taking off their clothes whenever they have the chance. Good times ... <br /> <br /> No clique or clich√© characterization of the 1980s horror film is not represented here. In fact, no stone was left unturned ?? we have the nice hero, his innocent girlfriend, the girl Goth, the stout thug (thinks John Bender), the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, the shy idiot in love with the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, a pair of beautiful half-naked lesbians and two great geeks. <br /> <br /> As you can clearly see, the cast is quite large. Usually, the larger casts are where things can collapse quickly, with one or two sour apples flapping the entire barrel. Not in this case though. Not a single cast member left me disappointed. The acting was very well done. Everyone, from the nice hero of his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to groovy Goth played by Renee Dorian in Geeks One & Two starring Cory Assink and Jonathan Brett ?? they played everything straight, brought their A-game and threw it out of the park. If you're a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you'll immediately fall in love with geeks. <br /> <br /> The director / co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a guy to keep an eye on in the future, trust me on this. If this is what he can do on a low budget, there are nothing but good things for him when he gets more money for future projects. The characters were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughter was enormous; the blood flowed, and splashed, and sprinkled beautifully ?? it was like watching a horror movie from the 80s. Call this "THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets THE NIGHT OF THE DEMONS" !!! The tag line says it all, and says it honestly: "EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE, FREE NUDITY, ZERO BUDGET" - no false advertising here, folks! As a fan of this genre, we have to look at the indies and support these hard-working people who are tearing up their bumps by bringing out original stories, so as not to get stuck forever in a world full of great PG-13 watered down by the studio. 'horror' or useless reworkings like The Hitcher. No thanks - no more than that for me. <br /> <br /> In closing, I must honestly say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best independent films I have had the pleasure of watching this year. It's a damn good moment, and resists repeated views. From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe ... also the theme of the final love over the end credits (which, if there are no laughs, resonate remembering the 80s ballads of REO Speedwagon - R on every word too pronounced starting with the letter "R" - then I will eat my dvd now) ... basically, if you are a fan of the horror or horror of the 80s in general, there is no more hesitation - this film deserves to be in your collection!!
