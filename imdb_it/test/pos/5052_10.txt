As a Czech I am very happy when I read these comments here. I am absolutely sure that this film is fantastic. And what you may not know is that the story was written specifically for Mr. Brodsk√Ω. The man you see is him and his typical attitude: to live and resist death. He was one of the great actors and we are very fortunate that we made so many good films during his life. You're lucky you can see at least one of them. To enjoy.
