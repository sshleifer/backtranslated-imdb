If you are one of those people who think that Lucio Fulci has to do with blood, courage and zombies, you have to look at this too (and also "The Psychic"). Although the film includes fairly brutal violence scenes and a disturbing topic, it's not the main thing here. This is a truly awesome murder mystery, based on stories and characters that could be the director's masterpiece. Here, he proves to be a true craftsman, creating a memorable, disturbing but extraordinarily beautiful masterpiece, full of gruesome Catholic images and interesting social commentaries. He also has an exceptional cast, including the beautiful Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (by Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. Still, it's Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also played Fulci's bizarre "Lizard in a woman's") who steals the show in the role of Majara, giving an excellent performance of a woman driven by her superstitions, and her murder vicious the scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the film is the cinematography of Sergio D'Ofizi who, together with the melancholic Morricone soundtrack by Riz Ortolani, helps bring to life the "secluded village of Italy with a dark secret". I have to admit that I thought that the fake head that hit the rocks pulled me out, but nevertheless it is a definite Italian horror classic - a work of moving genius, sad and ultimately stimulating. 10/10 for me. If you liked this, I suggest you look at "Alice, sweet Alice" by Alfred Sole, because they are somewhat similar and are both undervalued gems.
