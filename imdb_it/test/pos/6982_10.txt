(VERY moderately spoiler) <br /> <br /> I have to start by saying that I'm usually not impressed by science fiction, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. It made me fall in love right from the start with rhythm, intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my place. I am very happy to say that this film was the best (ok, at least * one * of the best) science fiction pieces I have seen for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> The plot in short may seem simple - a (space) ship crashes into an apparently deserted planet and the captain, Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. At first, a cold-blooded murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with a very credible stock style), may seem to be the biggest problem of the group but when dusk begins to creep, the creatures of the night begin to waking up ... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape bloodthirsty predators, which, as we can all imagine, do not lead to a happy family picnic. <br /> <br /> It is not the plot itself that makes the film worth seeing - - After all, let's face it, if it is reduced to the basics it is not * the original * - but the skill in which it is said. The story flowed forward, it didn't let me yawn (at least not very much) at any point. The direction was a fabulous job. This was a very visual film, even a beautiful one; the purple night view was a real treat. Although "beautiful" may not be the right word to use; Yes, the images shown were candy for the eyes, but they also added a touch of grotesque, ghostly unreality, as if something was about to explode from beneath the immobile surface. (Not to mention the fact that the monsters were really well made, they seemed realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe people don't let themselves be bothered to make them look real ...]) <br /> <br /> I not only appreciated the visual side of the film but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the film we see how the characters unfold - some fall, some get up - but what fascinated me most was the development of the character of Riddick. I enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the film. To go even further, the other thing that I really enjoyed with Riddick was the incredibly well-executed and originally performed MISS (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between Fry and him who "didn't" (you will understand what I mean when you will see) . [There is no denying that they had chemistry. Don't even try or I'll look for you and I'll make you listen by listening to my wands until you scream * grin *] It was cool. As Radha Mitchell once put it (a modified quote), "Pitch Black is a really sexy movie with no sex", which is what makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> So to summarize, I recommend this movie - even if you're not really a fan of "space stories". The suspense was maintained until the end and, what is important, we were (or at least I was) left to desire more. If you can't be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and so on (as is my bad habit), you will still find Pitch Black extremely amusing. Kick your shoes and have fun.
