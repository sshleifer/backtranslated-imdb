Another round with the king of monkeys going west ... kind of. <br /> <br /> Starting in the middle of some action the film goes from the first frame onwards. <br /> <br /> To the monk and his three disciples they go to a city to obtain the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world. But an evil force intervened and kidnapped all the children in the city. The force of evil wants the monk because if you eat it, you will live forever. Servants fight the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk out for safety (the monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the villains). The monk ends up with a group of goblins who cry at one point to eat it ... but the bad guys arrive and he is out of an odyssey with the ugliest. <br /> <br /> Is a movie that starts off the rails going down the rails? Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this movie, but it's so scattered and everywhere that the plot and logic simply fall off as some scenes simply take half the action without knowing how we got there (The final battle to save the disciples is completely outside the left field). This is one of the mildest films I've seen in a while, but it made me laugh and smile as if I hadn't been released. The film starts and you have no idea where things are and then what is on the screen is interesting or fun and you just go. How we can get from one thing to another is often beyond me. It is full of strange references and strange references as we go from the sky to the ocean to wander in the rib cage of some mythical animal to God knows where. This movie floats everywhere and helps make it fun because you don't know where it will end (and that's why "I'm keeping the details to a minimum) and it's fun. Very very funny sometimes. <br /> <br /> And the action is very good, even if a good part of it is the unabashed CGI animation (which provides some interesting images, the golden stick, the formation of spider attacks, the flying angel ...) And it is precisely Action and comedy aside this is actually a wonderful love story, it is the story of an ugly imp and a monk who end up falling in love (and having other complications) .It is an interesting look at the nature of love and what is true As much as I liked I was still bothered by his scatter scatter construction. The film's inability to hold together his ideas and tell a complete story really hurts the film and takes away from the fun every time we get to a bump on the road, the doss i take you out of the movie itself and make you realize and how much is encrypted from other sources. <br /> <br /> A must see as it has many moments of choice, prepared only for a few bumps and you will have fun.
