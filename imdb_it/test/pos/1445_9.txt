Otto Preminger was one of the great directors of independent cinema. As John Huston was a character in one of his films, as Mr. Huston was a wonderful ham who entered and left the performance at random, but the end product of his work was unmistakably his. With few exceptions films are now made by companies, not by private individuals, and as a result they are usually highly polished "packages", a product more or less like a golf ball, a box of dog food or a motor car it is a product. The involvement of human beings in the process is almost incidental. There is an appetite for the product that does not seem to finish the line of well-finished, shiny, superficially amusing but ultimately empty films that flood the countless TV channels and movie outlets. There is no time for a man like Mr. Preminger to stand apart from the torrent of "product" and create a personal work of art. Obviously there has always been art "Art for art - money for the love of Christ" in the film, but now "Ars Gratia Artis" has been, in everything but without a name, given to the floor of history. Today Otto Preminger would be lucky to get a job delivering pizzas to Hollywood. Half a century ago, after making very influential, "Laura", "Where the sidewalk ends" and "The moon is blue", began filming the controversial novel by Nelson Algren's "The Man with the Golden Arm" in his eccentric and individualistic Instead of taking his camera through the streets, he stayed in the studio and used almost expressionistic stylized sets, an eccentric casting (Frank Sinatra - warm from his success in "From here to eternity", the young lady, inexperienced but of an extraordinarily beautiful beauty Kim Novak and Mr Arnold Stang, a man whose oddities were tied to his own heart) and an extraordinary age: the soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein with the cream of the West Coast jazz musicians. A film by Otto Preminger has always been an all-round experience, to be considered as a whole rather than breaking down into acting, directing, photography. What appeared on the screen was Preminger's vision, his creation and his interpretation of Algren's novel, not a film of Algren's novel, any of the twenty competent Hollywood hackers produced it. From the first cymbal rhythm of the Charleston that accompanies the iconic Saul Bass title sequence, we are attracted to Preminger on what is now called "The Life", actually a dark area occupied by hustlers, drug addicts, policemen, drug dealers stone players, jazz musicians, their women and their hangers. The lines are blurred in "The Life", and it is the dog that eats dog there. The inhabitants surround each other like sharks, looking for a sign of weakness to exploit. Frankie Machine (Mr Sinatra) a professional card dealer, ex drug addict and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victim. When things get tough, go back to the needle. Even if he kicks the habit by going to cold Turkey, there is absolutely no guarantee that he can't go back further. Sinatra's description of a drug addict in retreat has divided critics, but the fact is that even fifty years later most of us probably never saw such a thing in real life, so we don't know how accurate the portrait. When I first saw the film in the late 1950s, I was very impressed, watching it recently on video, it seemed, to put it mildly, hammy. Perhaps he is a victim of his own success, given that many actors "make" the cold turkey has, over the years, taken his performance and refined it in some way. Arnold Stang is as exceptional as his friend Sparrow from Machine, a performance that he only surpassed in "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world". Try watching it on the big screen and watch it as the cinematic vision of a real author, a giant among today's pygmies - Otto Preminger.
