"Tourist Trap" is one of my favorite movies of the late 70s / early 80s. A group of young people is heading somewhere, a couple in the front car, and that car has an apartment, and our movie opens with the young man, Woody, pushing the tire in search of a service station. He finds an apparently abandoned place, yet he hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe in his stomach for his efforts. The rest of the young people arrive (in a VW Thing) and collect Woody's girlfriend, and find this same place, the Slausen Oasis, or something like that ... and then Mr. Slausen happens while the girls are having fun immersing themselves in the flow . Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point, so strange Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum, with many wax figures, and lives in the museum, but behind it is a large house, where he says that Davey lives. And who is Davey? Because, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it was Davey Crockett, they'd probably all be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen goes to help fix the car, but of course the curiosity gets the better of one and she goes to investigate, and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and a rather animated one named Davey. What follows is a night of rather gruesome terror as one by one, they are taken prisoner by Davey, who claims to be Slausen's brother. A girl (previously abducted) is treated with a facial patch, which results in her death when she covers her air supply. However, there is something strange about this and in the kind (but strange) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what it seems to be. A beautiful horror film from the late 70's creepy and a lot of dummies create a very scary atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
