When it was first broadcast on Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound effect on me. It is beautifully filmed and played. I read Mary Webb's book immediately, and it remains one of my favorites ever. Janet McTeer is as wonderful as Prue, and I expected her to become a regular on the British drama scene. I imagine he chose to concentrate instead on the British stage. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that with the American success of Janet McTeer years later (with Tumbleweeds) this film would be available to us again. Alas, it hasn't been released on DVD yet. If anyone is listening, make it available again!
