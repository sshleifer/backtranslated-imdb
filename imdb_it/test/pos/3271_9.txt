"Two Hands" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalog. <br /> <br /> It's that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love that the Australians have developed themselves. > <br /> Heath Ledger is basically a good and naive boy. Wanting to climb, he falls with a "Big" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But the moment he puts his finger on the dark road to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the mistake to change his life in unexpected ways. After accidentally getting on the wrong side of Pando, things get really bad very quickly and if it weren't for a little otherworldly help it would have been a short sad film. Yes, Jimmy learns some lessons in life and no one can save himself in one way or another, but in the end he has a feeling of well-being. Although there is a lawless theme throughout history, it is not glorified and helps to demonstrate how destructive crime can be on normal lives. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is as excellent as Jimmy, innocent and wise at the same time, Rose is hypnotic while Alex and Bryan are wonderful as usual. This is a small ensemble of credible characters and I found myself looking after the good guys and not pleasing the bad guys. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in the economic corridor so I suggest you also add your DVD collection, it would be well worth the money. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
