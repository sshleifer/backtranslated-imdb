This happened just starting on TV when I opened it, and since I felt too lazy to change channels, I ended up watching it. Friend, he was so lucky. <br /> <br /> This film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama, sometimes openly sentimental. It's definitely what could be called a wellness film, and I usually find it boring or irritating. Yet this film is so well made that I couldn't help loving it. The script does not distort your brain; it's conventional, but impeccable. The actors are brilliant, everyone is perfect for the role. There is not much of a score, but the pieces of music improve the film beautifully. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate other things besides expensive pyrotechnics, vicious murders or save the world in a movie, watch this if you've ever had the chance. 5/5
