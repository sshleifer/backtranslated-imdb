... that maybe one day people will wake up. People who can resist the urge to separate everything and everything, and who see the 60s for what they were. People who can see what individuals have been doing those times; Not the other. <br /> <br /> The "Forrest Gump" comparison is good. Both films look to the 1960s, but "Four Friends" is about humans, unlike caricatures. FF deepens deeply the thing that FG (quite successfully!) Tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a background. But while "Gump" stores the '60s in an attic like old toys in a box, "Four Friends" collects and embraces every toy, thus blurring the lines between what you hold dear and what you are. <br /> <br /> If you associate romance with shoe polish, you won't like this movie.
