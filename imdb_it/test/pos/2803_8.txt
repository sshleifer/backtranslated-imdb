In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young economist of twenty years and something, trying to get a job in a government department through a friend of his father. It is advised to have a specialization in economy and Spanish language to get a good position. He decides to enroll in a European exchange program called "Erasmus" and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledge in Spanish language and culture. He leaves his girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou), promising to maintain close contact with her, and once in Barcelona, ​​he is temporarily hosted by a French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his solitary young wife Anne -Sophie (Judith Godrèche) met at the airport. Later, he moved to an apartment with international students: the English Wendy (Kelly Reilly), the Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), the Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D'anna), the Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and the German Tobias (Barnaby Metschurat). Then Belgium Isabelle (Cécile de France) and Wendy William's brother (Kevin Bishop) join the group and Xavier learns Spanish and finds friendship and love in his experience abroad. "The Auberge Espagnole" is one of those films that the viewer becomes sad when it ends. History is a delightful and amusing tale of friendship and love, in a globalized world and in a united Europe. This very fascinating film made me feel good and happy, even though I never lived in a student republic. The newcomer William causes the most amusing situations in history, with his big mouth and his short brain. Furthermore, it is nice to see a new approach of students living together different from those foolish American fraternities and their stereotypes, common in American films. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish Auberge ")
