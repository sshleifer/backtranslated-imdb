'Fame' (1980) is brilliant. It has all these qualities that made the films of the 70s so great. He is proud of his immediacy and is not ashamed to be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> What really matters here is the journey, not the destination. Ignorant idiots with a soap opera mentality will never understand that "Fame" talks about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not their careers. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of the most talented 'Fame' actors came to Hollywood. 'Fame' marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. It is the last statement of a generation that has its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
