"The Desperadoes" (1943) is a true classic, not for its history (which is rather ordinary), but for its technical production elements. This was a western landmark, the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a Columbia production, a light studio with an underlying reputation. Only "Jesse James" by Fox (also played by Randolph Scott) of some years before gave a touch of prestige to the genre. Although it would have been eclipsed in a few years by "The Searchers" and "High Noon", "The Desperadoes" was a revolutionary effort and a historical treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy in the city of Red Valley, Utah, is based on rounding and selling wild horses to the Union army. The script is a bit messy here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utah's future) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important elements of the plot. <br /> <br /> Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; stealing his own bank every time the government pays for a herd of horses. The city is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steve. He wants to go straight, especially after falling for the beautiful Alison McLeod livery (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is mainly there for comic relief like uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and city judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character on the crystal ball of "Wizard of Oz" by Frank Morgan forger). <br /> <br /> Don't take chances with their huge budget Columbia has packed this thing with tons of action and every western cinematic element, but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best wild horse escape ever filmed, a spectacular bar fight, an explosive climax, romance and three-striped Technicolor. All this stuff does not necessarily combine, but who would come back to mind in 1943. Unity is a problem as it seeks to be both a serious Western action and a comedy. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of shooting. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the outdoor nature photography that is really impressive; both static lyrical shots and moving footage of action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were the best, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, which would soon become their biggest star. And director Charles Vidor used the film to show his new wife Keyes (whose portrait of Scarlett's sister in "Gone With the Wind" was connected to the public more than any small part in the history of films). <br /> <br /> The dynamic of Ford-Keyes is the most unique and important feature of "The Desperadoes". Rather than opting for the "love triangle" clich√© with Scott and / or Trevor (which will appear for the first time), the entire romantic attention is given to the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever had and she made the most of it. Playing a tomboy but extremely sexy young woman who looks fantastic in both pants and leather clothes, and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in "Pirates of the Caribbean". This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the formation of the 1942 WAAC for the military service of World War II. <br /> <br /> "The Desperadoes" is a well-kept film and the print looks brand new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
