What do you get when you have a tough and seasoned French police inspector named Maurice Martineau called to solve a murder case? Well, just a very funny and fun movie. The remastered black and white film "Quai des Orfevres" offers the products despite the romanticism, jealousy and marriage that seem to hinder the truth about "who did it?" <br /> <br /> Thumb for inch, technique for technique seasoned by experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector affects the truth - but obviously, with the help of a bag full of dirty interrogation tricks of police. <br /> <br /> Martineau is the centerpiece of this film. The use of director Henri-Georges Clouzot of a raucous background music to intensify the noir-style drama is a wonderful envelope around the visual experience. Martineau finally solves the mystery and arrests the culprit. Hey, he's good !! But alas, Martineau can also keep a dark secret in his past. Who is that boy who maybe isn't his son? <br /> <br /> Some things can never be resolved - even beyond the credits.
