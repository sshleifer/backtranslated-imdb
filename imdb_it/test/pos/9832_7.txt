Random hearts made fun of me. Criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the coupling of an IA policeman and a member of Congress, as well as for its slowness, the film seemed right to me, and even ended up being surprisingly engaging. I found my interest engaged while the film moved back and forth between the newly discovered and faced Ford lives in very different ways in very different environments with the death of their spouses and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. It could happen; the spouses of the two unmarried could be on the same level, the plane could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the consequences. So what if it's unlikely? Not unlikely is the same far-fetched thing. So ... what if it happened? Why not speculate? <br /> <br /> The performances of Ford and Thomas are credible and nuanced. Instead of finding their implausible coupling (opposite sides of the tracks - give me a break), I felt that it was driven by pain and betrayal that neither side knew how to deal with. The script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and even the end of the film does not resolve their relationship in a conventional way. Where I find it unsatisfactory is when dialogue brings out interesting wrinkles or insights into the ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but it never seems to pursue any of them very far. And if you make the mistake of thinking about it too much, Harrison Ford looks 10 years too old for the part. <br /> <br /> For five and a half dollars at Wal-Mart, with a complete commentary by the director and the featurette behind the scenes, the DVD is worthy of owning. I don't think I would pay $ 20 for a bet, but my wife could. OK, ten ...
