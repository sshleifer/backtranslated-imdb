I expected this film to be a stinker, but I wanted to see it for myself, but I was surprised how beautiful this movie was. I know that longer movies often don't go well at the box office, but because this has been pulled and can't be seen by the public it's beyond me. He kept my interest everywhere and the scenery and photography are breathtaking at times. The plot was good and the work of morality was good. I liked the realism that was along the lines of "Unforgiven". I had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it.
