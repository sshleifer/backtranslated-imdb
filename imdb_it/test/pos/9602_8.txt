Aircraft aside, I don't think I've ever laughed so much in a movie. <br /> <br /> I love football like crazy, but I hate almost every song or movie about soccer as they tend to be unrealistic. This was not. <br /> <br /> I saw it once, it was over 2 years ago and it was fantastic. Everyone I know loved him. I remember the gay physio, the step tilted about 45 degrees and "Shoes" (a player named like that because he once showed up to train with a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what happens in park football. <br /> <br /> A score of 10/10. If anyone in the TV industry is reading this, considering all the shit you're repeating on English TV, please have the good sense to show it again (and the Muppets while you're at it). Does anyone know if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking them if they're going to show it again. They should do it.
