"The Saint Takes Over" plays George Sanders in the role of Simon Templar, aka "The Saint" in this 1940 entry to the series. Also interested in Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On board the ship traveling to the United States, The Saint meets and tries to find time with a woman (Wendy Barrie) who gives him the brushoff. Simon is coming to New York to help Inspector Fernack, now completely discredited due to gang-up gangsters; $ 50,000 was found in his home. The gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), of course, was found not guilty at the trial, and he and his fellow Mafias pay the bill for the structure and legal representation - $ 90,000 in total. Today it is necessary to defend yourself from a parking ticket. This was a murder. <br /> <br /> Rocky sends his bodyguard, Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the lawyer's house to steal the $ 90,000 from the safe. The lawyer takes him in flagrante and sends him back to his boss with a message. A few seconds later, he died. Rocky meets a similar fate. And back and forth - who's killing this gangster group? The Saint has to convince one of them to talk so that Fernack can be cleaned up: can he get to someone before he is killed? The woman she met aboard the ship reappears and figures prominently in the case. <br /> <br /> Few actors have a way with a line like George Sanders, and his dry spirit, good looks, smooth voice and depth as a perfect suit actor for Simon Templar. Paul Guilfoyle offers a bit of humor like the nervous, the milk that Pearly Gates drinks, and Jonathan Hale is as big as Inspector Fernack's sometimes exasperated but worried inspector. Wendy Barrie, who has appeared in many episodes of Saint, is very good as the woman who captures Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very funny.
