The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC serial called 'My Friend Charles', and as such gallops through the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast, fun and unpretentious. Has anyone noticed the scenes towards the end where John Mills was gassed? - the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes - maybe the censorship? - but they notice when they are sitting near the flat window, breathing deeply followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The periodicals of Francis Durbridge seemed to all inhabit the same universe, that of unexplained events, people are not what they seem and the bad is someone close to the hero / victim. A predictable universe in some way, but with its rules and rules.
