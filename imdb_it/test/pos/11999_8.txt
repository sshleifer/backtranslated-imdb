In the end, it is clear that the killers planted the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car and was at the police ballistics lab. <br /> <br /> But where does the gun under the hood come from, used in the demonstration? Wouldn't the killers clean up the stuff under the hood? Have they had a whole week? Or did Columbo cops replicate the camera / gun under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do it without breaking and getting into the car? Maybe that's why the murders seemed surprised in the end. But how could Columbo replicate his camera / gun device and have it calibrated on their keychain? Columbo must have recovered the gun from the ballistics and re-planted it under the hood of the car, and was very fortunate that the rest of the camera device was still there and transmitted. <br /> <br /> a 10/10 show until this dazzling printing error at the end.
