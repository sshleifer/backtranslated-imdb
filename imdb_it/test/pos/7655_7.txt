Latcho Drom, or Safe Journey, is the second film in the Tony Gatlif trilogy of the Romans. The film is a visual representation and a historical recording of Roman life in European and Middle Eastern countries. Although the scenes are mostly planned, tried and staged there is no traditional storyline and the dialogue does not explain the activities from one scene to another. Instead, the film allows the viewer to sometimes have a look, sometimes a more in-depth view of these people during different eras and in different countries, ranging from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. /> <br /> The importance of music in Roma culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication. All they do is expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Like Roma music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something that only they know how to do correctly. We are offered glimpses of their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. Rather, it is a testament to their culture, focusing on the music and dance they created and which made them unique. <br /> <br /> Gatlif portrays nomadic groups in a positive way. However, we are also witnessing the rejection, distrust and alienation they receive from the non-Roma population. It seems that the culture they have developed in countless generations and inspired by different countries will fade into oblivion because conventional society has no room for nomadic ways . <br /> <br /> The other films in the trilogy are Les Princes (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
