Batman Returns is a truly obscure film, showing the Caped Crusaders fighting the penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll get to it later). Michael Keaton behaves as well as Bruce Wayne, proving himself to be a good actor. Tim BUrton directs this image well and the film's settings are impressive. The bad guys: Danny deVito is as threatening as the penguin. A cruel but disturbed man who had a very difficult childhood. But, Michelle Pfeiffer steals the picture. She is the BEST Catwoman ever! She is threatening and extremely sexy. There is a scene in which she kisses Batman, the way of the cat, which warms the film. The action scenes are also good, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows he can handle a Batman movie very well (he has already shown it with the first Batman) and gives Batman a darker nature. Like him.
