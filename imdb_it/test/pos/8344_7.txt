This film is apparently intended for a young evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For this I give him a vote of 7 out of 10 points. It's a decent movie to show a youth group, but I don't think it will be very well received beyond that. For any other audience, I would rate it much lower. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who saw "It's a wonderful life" were right in this, even though I didn't think about it until they mentioned it. I was more reminded of a "Chick Tract", those little 3 "of 5" gospel comics. If Jack Chick had ever made a film with one of his tracks, it would probably look a lot like "Second Glance". It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence that each of us has on the earth, but it is somewhat hindered by Christian stereotypes. Christians are all very nice, a little passive and very clean, while all non-Christians seem to be bad. <br /> <br /> Muriel the angel plays an important role, and is the bravest, cheesiest character in the film. It's the most unpredictable angel I've ever seen in a movie, and the biggest negative. I don't know if the directors wanted his personality to come out so badly, or if he hit me that way. (I admit it reminded me of someone I know.) Dan's love for a very worldly girl who is not at all her type guides the plot in this movie. The reason he fell in love with her in the first place is the only question I wanted to answer. <br /> <br /> But the film shows positive Christian values ​​and your group of young people will be entertained as they see something healthy with a good lesson.
