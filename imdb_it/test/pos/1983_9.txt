eXistenZ combines the traditional love for blood and blood and explosive heads of director David Cronenberg with the most confusing aspects of a David Lynch film. And it actually works effectively. I won't bother trying to give the bare bones of a synopsis plot because it will only cause more confusion. All you need to know is that the film is about an incredibly realistic virtual reality video game that becomes difficult to understand the difference between reality and virtual reality. The film almost seems to abandon its technological focal point at the end, but then throws the final twist into the last line of dialogue. <br /> <br /> There are also some very coarse sexual images based on 'bio-brought' in the backs of the protagonists, as well as some very coarse acting by Jude Law. He can come out as naive and stupid and boring and any other nasty habit you can think of thinking about. Jason Jennifer Leigh gets along much better, and everyone else can be called secondary characters, including Willem Dafoe in a functional role, though not spectacular, like a mad mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective science fiction film about the possibilities that technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.
