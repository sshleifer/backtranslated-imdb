I can't remember the series, I think it might have been "American Masters", but it was aired on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge of the development of bomb A, and those who have little or nothing I probably think it's a pretty dry topic. Anyone who has seen this 7-part series does not think so. You will know the turbulence in Oppenhemiers' mind and how development has changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure that has become and why. With 7 episodes you know the most important players, the intrigues and the stabs behind you. I contacted PBS about the possibility of getting a video or a DVD, but I never received a reply. Too bad, I'd like to see it again.
