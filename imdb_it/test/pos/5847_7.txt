I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you learn very well about knowing the killers. You also know the two detectives who hunt them. The killers are two high school kids. They are very intelligent and want to show they are smarter than the police, so they plan the "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not prove perfect. What we don't know is whether they will be caught, or they could just be one of them, or even none. In a sense, I hoped that both of them would get away with it, although I don't know if this was the intention of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a nice way. You're getting to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is nice but has her secret, which works against her. Ben Chaplin is as good as Sam and the two children are both fantastic. The scenes between them are the best scenes in the film. I think you can say that the film is pretty good and not so predictable. For a nice evening with a movie, "Murder by Numbers" is a good movie.
