Imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience: gray instead of white, no snow fights and certainly no wonders. This is Finland played by "Frozen Land". This film follows a group of people whose lives are strangely linked to one another with results that go beyond anyone's nightmares. Yes, many characters are imperfect in the way that only celluloid characters can - completely annoying and frustrating to watch, but for some reason you want their luck to transform. <br /> <br /> With a casual humor and a cast that brings together the slightly mainstream faces of Finland, Frozen Land offers a glimpse of the Finnish mentality that, despite the downward spiraling downturn, manages to restore a certain faith humanity. More than Kaurism√§ki, to say the least.
