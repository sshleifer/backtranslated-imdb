I saw this masterpiece on VHS for the first time 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation of the angry-kid-painfully-against-established society that it carried has remained in my heart ever since. The director Hector Babenco is such a good humanity, that he finds a delicate point to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of children from the class of poverty. Even marginalized children have their beautiful innocent dreams. But the corrupt reality never gives a chance ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the editors for the recent DVD version, now I can keep this fantastic movie in my favorite collection.
