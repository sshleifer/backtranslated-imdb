She's the Man was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so much that I was crying. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely gorgeous and can really act. It certainly doesn't hurt that he even has some scene without a shirt. Channing and Amanda have an incredible chemistry and they were absolutely wonderful together. I love this movie. When you look, make sure you watch the last scene deleted. It was a big mistake to cut that scene because it's one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been more fun. And Channing will be a big star. This is just the first of many for this brilliant new star.
