In Sudan, Arabs dominate and are constantly at war with Christians and animists who inhabit the southern part of this East African country. This film follows a group of Dinka boys, a tribe of cattle herders, orphaned after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack carried out by Arab forces. Most of these guys are now teenagers and have been nicknamed "The Lost Boys". <br /> <br /> The director follows a group of "Lost Boys" on their journey, as they have been accepted as refugees in the United States. , where they will land in Houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees get celebrity status because they hear (from what they heard) that America is amazing. Taking a trip from Sudan to America is like "taking a trip to paradise", says the only young man. A big party is launched for their departure, and they are told to do good Sudan and, once educated, to return to Sudan so they can contribute to the Dinka society. They are also warned not to be like "those with baggy pants" who are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and also, no matter what happens, not to forget the Dinka culture. <br /> <br /> look at how the boys come from a third world country in America and how they try to integrate into American society, since they have gone from a place with practically nothing to this abundant world where everything is enormously overproduced and overcrowded. They are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the utilities we take for granted on a daily basis. Sometimes it's humorous, humiliating for others. <br /> <br /> Listening to the comments they make about Black Americans and American society / culture are quite interesting. As the film progresses, see how American culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, Peter, is not content with working and earning just enough to survive, so he got up and moved from Houston to Kansas City so he could follow an instruction. When other kids visit it, they talk about how they can't get into any school. The main reason they came to America was to get an education and the media is saying that the boys were brought from Sudan for an education. This occurs because the boys were given an arbitrary age, making them older than they actually are, preventing them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> The film juxtaposes images from Houston to Kansas. We look at Peter as he enrolls in school, where he makes friends with a group of conservative Christian boys, and while Santiago tries to lead the school (though he drives without his license anyway), and works at Walmart. We see Peter struggling with high school life as he struggles to form his school's basketball team, and how Santiago has difficulty keeping up with work, rent, calming tensions at home in Sudan and, most importantly, facing loneliness. <Br /> <br /> Get to the point where kids want to go back to Sudan and tell them that everything they are taught about America, there are lies. "You have to do it alone here, do it all yourself," says one of the boys. An overwhelming message for a liberal capitalist lifestyle, which shows how this leads people to become radical individualists (a trend that led to the creation of both neo-conservative and radical Islamic movements). Their biggest beef with America, though, is that there's no time; time is money and we don't waste a second! <br /> <br /> Despite all this, kids never lose the sense of Dinka culture. They celebrate South Sudan Liberation Day, which marks the day when the SPLA started fighting in Sudan, a struggle that continues today. They also meet other "Lost Boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experience in America compared to when they returned to Sudan. When asked, a boy says that if he could earn a living he would rather live in Sudan. He is too alone in America, he adds. They never lose their sense of community, which has been conditioned in them as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This film challenges us the way we live, makes us question the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our societies have created within us. It will also change the way I look at refugees, I will never again take for granted how hard work and what immigrants mean for a country like mine, Canada. This is a wonderful film. I laughed, I cried .. a very exciting journey, and a very well done documentary. 10 out of 10.
