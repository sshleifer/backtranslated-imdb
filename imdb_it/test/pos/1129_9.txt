I've seen two episodes so far, I really like it. Even though I'm no longer in college, it makes me lose my wonderful college life. I would like you to spend a little more time socializing. I identify with rusty. When I was rushing a fraternity, my older brother was not at all like Cappie, I wish I had an older brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people identify with the characters, then it's a pretty good show. <br /> <br /> It's more realistic than the American pie with less explicit sexual jokes. Can we also call this younger version of "desperate wives?" some of the writers must be the same Greeks, the story seems to reflect a bit of the real life of the brotherhood and sisterhood. It was shot in high definition. And actually they turned outside instead of inside the studios. so the image quality is very good. They could easily make this a good movie. Unlike a movie that can only last a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it for free on TV every week. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, the actors are the right age, and I'm new and fresh, which makes them more real. This show is about everyone. There are also Asian and black confreres and sisterhood girls in the show. It is almost a bit shocking that they had a little story about two boys from the brotherhood having sex in the first episode, then they tried to hook them up again in the second episode. I don't think I've seen anything like it on TV before. This show reminded me somehow of a Warner teen TV show called "Young Americans" that was canceled in early 2001. On that show, a girl dressed like a man kissed a boy, and that boy thought that he was a homosexual male. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time, students must study for exams, etc .; at a time when people actually have some free time in their lives, there is no brotherhood of sisters to join them. I don't know how long this show will last, sooner or later, even these people will have to graduate. Maybe they will find some new actors for another 4 years of fun in college life!
