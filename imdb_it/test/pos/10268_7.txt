From today's point of view, it is quite ridiculous to rate this 18 (or X in the US) movie. The film has a sexual erotic, but sublime story to tell, but the images are quite innocent. Throughout the film you can hear and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in fashion, dialogues and typical experimental cinematography and lighting. And this is exactly the part that is worth seeing.
