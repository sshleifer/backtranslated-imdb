My God ! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the most intriguing and important people in the world, especially in my culture. It's incredibly stimulating and its story is the story of a great woman! When I took this movie for the first time I thought the cast was wonderfully put together now we see them in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and is now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I think it's the greatest of all time. This film took me to the edge of my place and I searched for Kleenex and at the same time it reminded me that no matter where you come from if you decide you will be great, then you will be great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ...... 100% FANTASTIC ... and now also "I know why the caged bird sings".
