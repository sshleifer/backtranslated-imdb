"One Dark Night" is a staple in the low budget horror genre of the 80s. Filled with retro word games, clothing and set designs, "ODN" transports the viewer into a simpler time, when horror movies were just ... Horror! <br /> <br /> Nothing so intense that you can't understand what's going on, the film tells a dark tale of what happens when you mess around with the dead. Well played by his royal team, and a great directorial work by Tom McLoughlin, who enjoys himself over time and makes you believe what he is presenting. There is no "Who did it?" and certainly no major breakthrough at the end. It is direct and in the face is a horror from beginning to end, with a lot of 80s humor thrown to add a spice. I give them "8" simply because some of the special effects don't come to the end of the film, but at least there is no CGI ... A perfect movie for new fans of the 80s horror genre, or for anyone who wants to relive. a fun evening of classic horror bliss.
