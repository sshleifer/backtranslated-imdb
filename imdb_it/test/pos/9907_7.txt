Sometimes a movie is so bad that it's good enough. This film was made in Germany and is nicknamed in English, so you have to move on. Even the acting was forced and forced, apart from what was done by the real mice, which IMO did a great job playing the part. Shoot towards the rat's mallet. However, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and as a result the local garbage collectors go on strike, thus leaving heaps of garbage everywhere. This plot has been used in the past, not to mention reality (unfortunately too often) and the public has no surprises. But this is fine. We know what will happen and when, and sometimes an audience needs a film where many brain cells are not needed to follow. We have our hero, down to the sculpted face and body, the semi-hero (s), and of course our heroine, who seems to be the doctor, but only still in training, even if she finds out what's really going when so many people end up sick and die, and not just from a rat bite. Obviously the bad guy has to die (okay, all the bad guys, meaning the rats), and the final scene is one that reminds the public that a sequel is being worked on. This is one of those movies that you sit and enjoy for what it is and for what it is not.
