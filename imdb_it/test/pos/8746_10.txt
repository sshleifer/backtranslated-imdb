This is a wonderfully gritty drama, which describes in detail the various aspects of the international trade in heroin drugs: from the hills of northern Pakistan, where the tacit allowed cultivation of opium poppies occurs on a large scale; at the "Euro-Trash" jetsetting in Germany and England that organizes the import of heroin transformed into multi-grain smuggling shipments; to end users involved in the addiction network and the crime needed to support their growing habit; and finally all the levels of corruption and hypocrisy of the international government surrounding police efforts to control the "drug problem" --- this drama is outlined with a wide range of in-depth characters, a fully evolved storyline and a excellent character acting and location shooting. <br /> <br /> This puts in their place Hollywood epic films such as "The French Connection" <br /> <br /> Traffik is a deeply inspiring and suspenseful story of modern drug-related espionage and international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> Unlike many "criminal dramas" that revolve around drugs, Traffik focuses strongly on discovering the * social * reasons that people slip into drug addiction. As one of the characters says "... until we, as a society, build a world that people want to participate in, instead of wanting to escape, we won't be able to prevent people from taking drugs ..." <br /> <br /> This is a fascinating and completely compelling drama. I highly recommend it!
