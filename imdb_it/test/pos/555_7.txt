This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role, even if it comes from the traces of a child in the film itself. Ann, (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who plays her new divorced mother, Adele, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills. There these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as Portman's character grows. Unknowingly at the beginning of Adele, she grows and becomes a better mother for this. <br /> <br /> Ann sees her mother telling her that she wants to be an actress, or so she thinks. Adele uses that crutch whenever there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle as mother and daughter in terms of themselves and being alone, having left their old lives behind. <br /> <br /> Acting is first-rate for both. Apparently they become mother and daughter before your eyes. You can almost feel that there is a bond there beyond the real movie. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not actually bring us to a new terrain in these types of films, the fact that the acting is well done, and the story is not too imperfect, let me recommend it. <br /> <br /> But I will say that it will probably go away soon, I don't think it can have the necessary energy for a huge Christmas movie season starting from about a week. Watch it now before this happens if you like both of these actresses.
