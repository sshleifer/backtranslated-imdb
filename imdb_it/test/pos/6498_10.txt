Excellent performance. There are still good actors around! Also great direction and photography. Very loyal to Shakespeare, and a must for all Shakespeare fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monologue (outside a short candle, outside). He gave the sphere of moral decadence and dark forces a human face, which makes it the most interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible woman, Macbeth, who can sometimes be very cheerful and sometimes just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decadence, and Shakespeare's lyrics ... this is it.
