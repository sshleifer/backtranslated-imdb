Who doesn't remember the movie Muppet ??? <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is now an icon of American culture. Which child does not appeal to this character? <br /> <br /> Like the first real Muppet movie, the film simply called, The movie Muppet did very well. Kermit takes the advice of a Hollywood agent and leaves his swamp to respond to the publicity. Along the way he meets a pig, a bear, hens, a rock band and some other quality puppet. See dozens of cameo appearances like Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and many others. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.
