"House of Dracula" is not so bad in a movie and it's pretty decent sometimes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Arrived at the home of Dr. Franz Edelmann, (Onslow Stevens) in his beach house, Count Dracula (John Carradine) discreetly searches for a cure for vampirism. He starts working on a potential treatment involving blood transfusion, the Wolf Man, Lawrence Talbot, (Lon Chaney Jr.) arrives on his estate looking for a cure for lycanthropy. Working with the two patients, he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory, and after searching the area, he finds the Frankenstein Monster, (Glenn Strange) buried nearby. Being obsessed with reviving him, Dr. Edelmann continues to neglect Dracula and Larry's requests, and after asking them to seek treatment instead of working with the Monster, they turn to each other in a stage battle. <br /> <br /> The good news: this was a rather dignified film. There is a main idea that is quite creative and imaginative. This is the first film to openly propose the idea of ​​vampirism as a blood disease, and one that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of body fluids, something that would be absorbed by subsequent gender work but rarely directly like this . There is even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed to be responsible for the condition. It works with some pretty well-used ideas and looks like a pretty ingenious idea, even if part of the execution is a bit stale. The fact that each of the creatures has at least one exceptional scene is a well-made idea. The Wolf Man has a wonderful scene in which he turns into a prison cell for research team members and becomes mad. The initial appearance of Dracula to look like a bat and fly to a prone figure that sleeps and then appears in human form looks really impressive. Monster fury is well managed and an adequate amount of destruction is caused. The big bat turned by Dracula into always looks for a decent time, and is quite realistic. It's absolutely decent. <br /> <br /> The bad news: there are several things that weren't that great in this. The fact that the film combines so many plots and potentially intriguing ideas that it doesn't really know what to do with them. There are several secondary stories that need to be mixed and that should be clear enough to mix well and seem consistent. This actually has none of this. The plot is rather inconsistent and does not actually give preferential treatment to any of the stars, and instead focuses on one and then the other and then includes all three in the end. The monsters only seem to engage with each other for the smallest possible reason which makes it a great distraction. The finale is for once a great disappointment and seems to have changed completely at the last minute. There are few other small things that were not all that spectacular and also contribute to this. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: it's a pretty decent movie and can spend most of its time in a fun style. Nowhere near the classic status of each monster's debut features, but it's a nice enough watch for fans of monsters and Universal movies in general. <br /> <br /> Rating PG-Today: Violence
