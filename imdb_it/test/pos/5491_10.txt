I've seen a lot of action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! There are very few films that I also consider looking at several times and this is one of them. Everything in this film is right: Clint is the superb main actor, Rene Russo as his non-stupid companion (this is a very rare combination - sad, but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves much praise for his excellent villain, but let's not forget Eastwood's initial friend, played by Dylan McDermott, who I think fits the role perfectly. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but unfortunately never published on an original CD for the soundtrack (shame for the producers!). The plot has a sense and there is no loss of rhythm, the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. Do this at 10 stars!
