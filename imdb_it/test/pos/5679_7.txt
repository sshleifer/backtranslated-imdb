Like most, I thought "another crocodile film". So far we've had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do again? Where both films are about action and violence, this is about fear and tension. <br /> <br /> The shows are not worthy of Oscar when nothing happens, but in moments of anguish or terror, these people suffer so much is like torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe the crocs don't behave like this as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective that it's a stretch to say that you'll like this movie. It will leave you uneasy as the Passion of Christ.
