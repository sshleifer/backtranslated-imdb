Finally I had the chance to settle down and compare the two versions of this film currently in circulation - Firstly, the good old scummy, poor Embassy VHS press called SCREAMERS, and then a new Italian DVD completely restored by the new favorite media company of all, No shame of Italy. <br /> <br /> The American ads on "overturned men" are as they all say, totally misleading, and indicative of a capture of Roger Cormanized on what would otherwise be a superior fantasy-adventure thriller for adults. The full Italian version is a somewhat sprawling, well-designed and deliberate approach on "Island of Dr. Moreau", and there is nothing wrong with that. It is a sumptuous, beautiful, exultant Euro Horror with a brain, good conspiracy, character development, location shooting, period costumes and scenes, etc. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that the 14-year-old pufferfish with weeds is still lurking somewhere inside me I took a bigger kick in Roger Corman's more filthy, slovenly sloppy , which has quite a bit of gore, a striking but absurd segment, and then most of Martino's original film, albeit a bit abbreviated to make room for Roger's idea of ​​entertainment. The pace was a bit faster, the shock sequences closer, and you see the fantastic shape of Mrs. Bach as in the extended Italian version. <br /> <br /> I don't have much of an idea yet about what the specific story is about though: there are a number of twists and secondary characters that were pretty hard to keep track of. A subtram of the local voodoo has not been of great help, and it is strange how everything culminates in another fistfight between the imprisoned nobleman and the mad scientist ... Perhaps there are other observations in order. I will say this: movie fans should take advantage of one of these PAL imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than another old and obscure home video - panoramic format compositions once again reveal that Martino had an eye to fill his screen with interesting things. No one gets their heads screwed up like in the SCREAMERS press, but it's still interesting, and once again the proof that while its standards may have been almost completely limited to the area around the gutter, Roger Corman had a lot of fun. when he did it for him, and side by side these are actually better films than they had to be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
