"The Gymnast" takes place in short scenes and short scenes, revealing his characters and messages over time. Reserve assembly is accompanied by a nice and simple score. This intimate approach is wonderful to feel like you're on a journey of discovery as much as the characters. <br /> <br /> The reserve approach is also its disadvantage; there are some scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context. There are some decisions made by the characters that seemed pretty upside down until I watched the interviews that were in the bonus material. I'm glad I did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more complete understanding of the film in general. <br /> <br /> Apart from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their bodies. Filming was done very tastefully; very practical. One has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold, not a voyeuristic film. The physicality of the athletes - their reality - is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> It is not a film that I will have to review anytime soon, since the plot is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
