How important is the director, anyway? In this film, made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 1960s, where the issues of social organization were the main conflicts, he asks this question by making a film that takes the camera away from the action and asks only to reveal the director, William Greaves. It is an important job, as it shows how no other film shows the difficulties in blocking, organizing and setting the scene; reveals the role of the crew, something that most filmmakers would frankly disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential to suspend disbelief; and also takes into account the role of performance and scripts and how they match / do not correspond to reality and what it has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality (if at all). <br /> <br /> documentary, or pseudo-documentary, or fictional fiction (whatever you prefer, through your interpretations of the themes) has the brain in the hyper-educated, hyper-intellectual troupe, its courage in the lost artists who struggle to understand the vague and ambiguous directions, and his heart in the director, who presents himself as the desire to portray, represent, express without any idea on how to do one of those things or because he wants to do it. It is a film that intentionally repeats platitudes just to see if they can become more banal. It is a film that sometimes shows multiple shots simultaneously, only to leave the editing to the public and also reveal how disturbing different shots change perspective. <br /> <br /> It is an important job, and something that interests everyone in the industry and the process of creating the film should look and understand. Like many experimental films, it has no real appeal for the mass audience, it is not for them. It is for industry, and for the 1960s, asking what to do with a group effort that is still based on a single "voice" and "author". <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
