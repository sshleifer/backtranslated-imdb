Susie Q. is one of those rare and sweet films that give you a feeling of warmth. It is bittersweet, but healthy, and its characters are fun and engaging. At first, I thought the film would be the pampering clich√© movie that bored me after five minutes, but I was wrong. Sometimes it made me tear, and the plot was tempting, making me cheer for good guys. I loved the movie and I still remember it 9 years later !! I highly recommend it to ALL, and the film is family-oriented, so you won't have to worry about inappropriate content. Actually, if Disney showed more films that matched Susie Q., it would be the most popular family channel in the world. Now, if only Disney could only show it another time! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q. !!
