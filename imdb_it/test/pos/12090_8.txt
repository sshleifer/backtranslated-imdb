A European musician and composer aims to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. A lover of sound experimentation, Alexander Hacke (of the German avant-garde group Einst√ºrzende Neubauten) toured the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and the "magic mike" to assemble an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a wide spectrum ranging from modern electronics, from rock to hip-hop to the classic "Arabesque". While wandering through this seductive world, Alex collects impressions and traces of artists such as the neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, the Fusion DJs Orient Expressions, the rock bands Duman and Replikas, the nonconformist rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's response to Public Enemy ), breakdance interpret Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, the famous clarinetist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk singer Brenna MacCrimmon, street artists Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay, and legendary divas Muzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu .
