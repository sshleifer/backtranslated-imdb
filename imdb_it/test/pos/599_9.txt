Who doesn't love the Muppets ?! It is impossible to look at them without having a warm and confused feeling inside. So, I guess it's important that this film managed to successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much of the details of the plot but of the various moments and characters of the film that I remember fondly. In fact, there was a rather nostalgic atmosphere throughout the film, but without being self-conscious in any way. Refreshing for someone who could also be hung up with meticulous and technical details; the "magic" transcends all other things. It's really about what movies are made of. <br /> <br /> So how does the film get these things? Hmmm, good question! Am I stumped? Let's see. Really, it seems simple enough. The filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. I would probably not say that the film has many really inspired moments, but it has a certain life (in a strange and funny way that a large number of "real people" films are missing). A taste. You really want to believe these funny people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them even more appealing. <br /> <br /> Generally I have the impression that the people who made the film weren't afraid to try anything they had time that gives the whole a pretty loose feeling. A bit like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. A lot of talent, little predictability and a lot of hot personalities coming. The cameos were obviously a lot of nice surprises, for example. Maybe I don't think I have much to say about it because I was half asleep when I saw it (and / or as I write this review). Anyway, I'm almost repeating myself here, but I really liked the sense of the film's family. Full of love, I suppose you can say. Again, I am reminded of a feeling of nostalgia that not many films manage to reach so effectively or effortlessly. <br /> <br /> And repeating myself once again, one of the film's best talents is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the quotation from Nathaniel Hawthorne that happiness is (like) a butterfly, so the film Muppet largely fails to seem to try to do it. The same is true of the beauty that is best discovered or not touched or forced or something. Anyway, if this sounds mushy, I also think it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> So all in all, this film was very funny, touching and hard not to smile. It also offers a lot of fantastic music! Highly recommended for all human beings, both young and at heart.
