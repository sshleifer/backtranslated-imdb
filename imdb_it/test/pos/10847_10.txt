Both the book and the film are excellent in their own right. They differ slightly but this improves and takes nothing away from what is an excellent script and acting. The historic atmosphere, the young girl looking for love, the extraordinary background of the music hall and the journey into the London lesbian world of the early twentieth century make this film exceptional. Andrew Davies as a screenwriter excels while writing this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both excellent actresses and give their best to these parts. The rest of the cast is very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10, I'd give it!
