First of all, despite the low rating on this site, I saw something very worthy in this film and I will gladly defend it. And no, I'm not connected to the crew in any way ... <br /> <br /> I accidentally came across the DVD of The Wind, and I had the strong feeling that it wouldn't be quite like the video packaging described. So I took the opportunity, and I was pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. I suppose the DVD marketing and summary is the work of MTI Home Video to hook up a rental or a sale (the tag line "Love comes in many forms" has been changed to "Terror occurs in many forms"). Of course, rents and sales of small films depend heavily on attracting a person's attention, especially if they have never heard of the film before (a similar case happened with the film THE ITEM). This is probably what is working against this version, as horror fans read the description of an "ancient wind" that carries "omens of the apocalypse". It's easy to think that this is all about this movie and will turn some college students in history into crazy savages who go wild in a murderous madness. So, at the time this review was submitted, it is most likely the reason for the lower rating on IMDb. I can understand that people get angry and think they have been deceived by that summary, seeing the apocalyptic introduction but then experiencing a dark drama. I can forgive the marketing choice since I enjoyed The Wind and I thought it was a refreshing change of pace compared to the main Hollywood offers, it's just that if the intended audience was brought to attention, the more they could rate more high. <br /> <br /> The "wind" in this film is basically just a metaphor for society, and it's the story of four friends who make bad choices and how their lives quickly turn into a desperate self-preservation . After exaggerating in "teaching a lesson" to one of them, a death occurs and everyone tries to save their position. The manipulation between them becomes the norm, and in the end we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation for good judgment. Civilized to the wild, basically. This is very noticeable, noting that the use of a knife, branches like clubs, punches and kicks are tools of violence instead of firearms. These characters, in a sense, do all the wrong things for the right reason just to keep up with the situation since they have already taken things too far. While there are many implicit violent images, it is interesting to see that there is an absence of curses and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works in favor of The Wind are the "unknown" actors. Initially the biggest stars were intended, but I find it works better when you have less known and capable actors. In this way you can enter history without thinking "oh, this is Tom Cruise" for example, instead of a tormented person dealing with an extraordinary situation. Even unusual conversations (like the one between Mic and Billy in a field and Mic facing Claire in his bedroom) hold up well and feel completely natural in the strange world of Fairview ... which has cozy homes, a forest and wide fields open. I kept thinking of the calm landscapes that hide the darkest secrets in The Reflecting Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions as a source of inspiration in his comment. <br /> <br /> The Wind manages to convey messages without being heavily manipulated. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look closely you will see many symbols and dialogues that the other directors would just beat you over the head. I even understood the infamous "kiss scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of the story without being surprise what happened. I'm still amazed at how some people (guys, mainly) who complain about two men kissing in a scene would obviously have no problem if the scene was instead of two kissing girls. Everything is handled well here, and the additional visualizations will make things clearer without making you moan and say "oh man, how I lost myself THAT ...." Things sink gradually and I appreciated it. Or you can also listen to the comment on the DVD for other things! <br /> <br /> For those of us who have "taken" the intentions of this film, The Wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) at a time when most films are made for JUST to make money and be heard throwing other films out of their "box office competition" when mentioned on Entertainment Tonight or CNN. <br /> <br /> Years later, it is always the great little discoveries like The Wind that remain in my mind, they are not turned into stellar blockbuster films. <br /> <br /> Once you have overcome the marketing tricks of MTI Home Video, you may find this story really compelling. I highly recommend it to friends looking for unusual films like this.
