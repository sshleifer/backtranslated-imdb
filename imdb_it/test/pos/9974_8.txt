"The Merchant of Venice" is one of Shakespeare's most famous works and is still regularly represented in the theater. Incredibly, however, this film seems to be the first English-language version created for cinema rather than television. There were a number of versions made in Britain or America during the early days of the cinema, but these were all silent. <br /> <br /> The reason for this neglect of the game may be related to sensitivities about the alleged anti-Semitism game, a theme that has been even more sensitive since the rise of Nazis in power in 1933. (This could explain because all previous versions were made during the era of silence, in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a direct villain than it would be today). And yet, in my opinion, the film is not at all anti-Semitic. It should be remembered that during Shakespeare's life there was no stable Jewish community in England; the Jews were expelled by Edward I in the late 13th century and were not allowed to return until the time of Cromwell, some forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare has never traveled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any Jews personally or had experienced direct the effects of anti-Semitism. The game is not simply about the Jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. Indeed, it could be a codified examination of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor in England (something Shakespeare would surely have had direct experience with) and a call for greater tolerance among them. <br /> <br /> Then as today, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes had always depicted Jews as misers, but Shylock's main sin is not greed; if it were, he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice the amount borrowed from Antonio. Rather, Shylock's disturbing sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way he and his fellow Jews are treated by the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews in general considered second-class citizens, but Jewish usurers like Shylock are specific targets of abuse, even though the services they provide are necessary for the Venetian economy. The game shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. Not only do opinions of this kind corrupt the Christians who hold them, but they can also corrupt the Jews who are abused. Shylock's revenge is disproportionate to the injuries suffered. Spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like a rude bigot, but obtuseness and fanaticism are not generally considered crimes worthy of the death penalty. Moreover, Shylock tries to take revenge on Antonio not only for the undisputed wrongs that Antonio did against him, but also for all the wrongs, real and imaginary, which he suffered at the hands of the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo. <br /> <br /> It is thanks to the director of the film, Michael Radford and his protagonist, Al Pacino, who understand all these problems. Pacino's Shylock initially has a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive anger and finally, after his humiliation in the trial scene from Portia's reasoning, to pathos. We clearly see that he was the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. From my point of view, none of the performances of Pacino that I saw ever equaled those he gave in the first two films "Padrino" (not "Profumo di donna", for which he won an Oscar, and certainly not "Padrino III "), but" The merchant of Venice is the one who comes closest to those benchmarks. The other performing performance that stood out was the bright Portia by Lynn Collins, who delivered his lines with great clarity and simplicity and highlighted the intelligence and resourcefulness that make his character more than just a romantic heroine, I was less impressed by Antonio than Jeremy Irons, who seemed too passive Antonio is a complex character, a loyal friend , contemplative melancholic part, religious bigoted part and enterprising capitalist part Although Irons captured the first two of these aspects, it was difficult to imagine that his Antonio spat on someone of a different faith or risked everything in risky commercial activities. <br /> <br /> Radford's interpretation of the drama was attacked by the film critic of the Daily Telegraph who, while admiring Pacino's performance, disliked the setting of the period and argued that Shakespeare needed to be set in a contemporary context if it is to have "relevance" for a modern audience, citing a recent theatrical production that triggered action in Weimar Germany. I would disagree deeply with this approach. Theater and cinema are very different media and, while there have been some surprising modernist approaches to Shakespeare in cinema (Trevor Nunn's "Twelfth Night" comes to mind), a traditionalist approach is often the best. (I preferred, for example, "Romeo and Juliet" by Zeffirelli to that of Baz Luhrmann). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern guise is pure intellectual laziness; we are not willing to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that produced him, but I prefer to prefer him dressed as an alleged twentieth century man. <br /> <br /> Radford's traditional approach does not only allow us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are old universal problems, but it also creates a visually surprising film. In the show, the scenes set in Venice are characterized by a turbulent action; those set in the country house of Portia in Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film, the external Venetian scenes were filmed outdoors on a background of foggy and winter gray skies, similar to those obtained in "Do not watch now". The candlelit interiors, with faces illuminated by a dark background, recall the chiaroscuro effects of a painting by Caravaggio; I suspect this was entirely intentional, as Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. Unlike dark or foggy Venice, the Belmont scenes (taken in an enchanting Palladian villa on an island in a lake) were characterized by the sun or the peaceful moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Shakespearean adaptations of recent years; an intelligent and visually appealing look for a complex game. 8/10. <br /> <br /> A couple of mistakes. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were not introduced into Europe until 1596, the date on which the film is set. Furthermore, Portia's portrait in the lead coffin is painted in the style of the Florentine Botticelli, active about a century before that date. Lynn Collins could remember a beauty of Botticelli, but it seems unlikely that a Venetian lady of the late sixteenth century would have had her painted in the manner of late-fifteenth-century Florence.
