The film is not for everyone. Some might think that acting is bad when it is actually undervalued and natural. There are obviously no evil deeds and there are no wonderfully beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision, many mixed feelings. <br /> <br /> Actually this film shows a very honest look at a very complex subject, Sex with minor. It's complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when their body and hormones are still developing and their minds and personalities are still developing. Also complex because society has a simplistic view of sex with minors, and complex, because the characters do not know if the society is right or if their instinct is right. <br /> <br /> Some people won't like the film because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions such as who was really responsible for the relationship, who was damaged, came out well, it was art, who was the most injured, some of the problems with their relationship stemmed from the fact that it was forbidden by the company, it was part of the problems derived from their same immaturity, and probably the most important thing, was it really a crime? <br /> <br /> The film is decidedly neutral on all this, and it is precisely this neutrality that is its strength. It is the reason for the sober acting, the simple sets, the lack of background music, soft lighting and the general "flat" presentation. The message is clear Today we do not really understand this type of relationship, and quick judgments must be superficial.
