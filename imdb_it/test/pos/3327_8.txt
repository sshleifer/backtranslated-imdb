"Side Show" is one of the strangest horror movies ever made by Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer proves (The Trailer for this film shows all the bloody parts). Furthermore, acting and visual effects are well done. I recommend this movie to horror fans all over the world. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should see the puppeteer, dead skin, slumber party slaughter, Away Camp sleep and other Full movies Moon Pictures.
