Film noir meets anime ... brilliant! This was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative Animatrix short films. This was one of my favorites if not my favorite (I also loved the World Record). This is basically a reference to those classic yellow and yellow movies and movies from the 1940s, except that it is animated and involves the Matrix. But being animated, he is able to take the extreme corners of the camera, the detective lifestyle, the shadows and the whole film noir to a whole new level. La Femme Fatale? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to live in his mind in the 40s but is stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black enters his office. . <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
