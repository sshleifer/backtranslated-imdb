Like most sports movies that have come out in the past, this film is similar in its respects, which is based on the fact. What sets this film apart is that it is a rugby team, a sport not too many Americans are familiar with. That being said, this film is a very rewarding film noir. It reminds me of "We Are Marshall", but with a lower budget and an independent film atmosphere. It's a nice attempt by director Ryan Little to bring us a story about a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (Never Back Down), like Rick Penning who is in a strange place, both on and off the field. Despite some gaps in the plot, this film has a heart, rewarding each of its viewers with good characters with whom we can identify. Good performances also with the support of actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix and Neal McDonough as coach Penning (Ricks dad). I felt myself going through many different emotions watching a movie, in the end it left me with a feeling of trust in humanity and a hope for the future for my children, especially if there are coaches out there like Gelwix.
