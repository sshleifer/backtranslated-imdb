This is an excellent Anderson production that is worth comparing with the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Obviously it is not an SFX extravaganza or a triple pseudo-mystic of Star Wars, but a thin film that has a slow rhythm, but conveys the disturbing, disturbing and disturbing atmosphere of Anderson's best productions: for "cerebral" lovers sci-fi. Lynn Loring's voice is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. SFXs are good for this type of product and even acting is good. Two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun, but they crash home instead ... or not? Ah, videophones! Sometimes it is sold as the next "gadget of the next ten years", but it has yet to happen 40 years later. The Earth's twin planetary device on the opposite side of the sun also returns in Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969), so who copied who?
