After winning a championship fight, boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates with a binge drinking, which leads to the murder of an intrusive journalist. Although his manager killed the man, Mr. Garfield is charged. When the manager dies in a car accident, wearing the watch stolen by Garfield, the authorities think the boxer is dead. Another WANTED man, Garfield changes his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as Spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as TB), and Bernard Punsly ( as Milt). Garfield binds with the young "Dead End", who were sent to stay with the sweet "Grandma Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to the reform school, courtesy of his brother, the late priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to keep an eye on the children. Of course, does Garfield's past haunt him again? <br /> <br /> "John Garfield and The 'Dead End' Kids" create wonderful music (Max Steiner) together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in excellent shape. Garfield and the children "Dead End" are a winning combination; although Garfield did not make any other films with the "East Side" band, the studio revisited both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan almost immediately for "Dust Be My Destiny". <br /> <br /> Boxing the scenes are well represented. But the most exciting sequence has Garfield and four of the "Kids" of New York (Halop, Jordan, Hall and Punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. Other, shorter, highlights include Floozy Ann Sheridan (as Goldie), bizarre Barbara Pepper (as Budgie), and young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas) who loses at strip poker. <br /> <br /> ****** ** They made Me a Criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan
