The last few years have seen a number of biographies of famous singers, and "Ray", the story of Ray Charles, has much in common with "Walk the Line", which was released the following year and told the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were almost exact contemporaries, both born in the early thirties and dying in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in the deep South American. Both lost a brother in an accident in childhood. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both had problems with their marriages, and both were drug addicts. All these issues are emphasized in both films. There are also similarities with "A Beautiful Mind" by Ron Howard. Although the film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, this one, like "Ray" and "Walk the Line", emphasized the role played by his subject's wife in helping her husband overcome his problems. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he began his career as a musician he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In a sense, Charles had an even more difficult time than Cash, having to face two further disadvantages in the form of his blindness and the racism that affected all black Americans, especially in the South, during his lifetime. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother George in a drowning accident and becoming blind about a year or two later. He seems to have been obsessed with nightmares and guilt over George's death all his life. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film is rather slow and is a show-to-rich rags-to-rich biographical film, which tells the story of how young Charles is taught to play the piano, he becomes a nightclub musician and then he becomes famous as a great artist, falling in love along the way with the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks of Charles's childhood. There is an effective recurring image of colored glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. There is also a memorable scene in which Charles, a teenager, puts a bus driver to shame with prejudices to get him on the bus, pretending to have lost his sight on Omaha beach (in fact he would have been only thirteen when he landed in Normandy). <br /> <br /> The second part of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his relationship with Margie Hendricks, one of his support singers , and its battles against racism. At the beginning of the sixties, Charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in Georgia (although, contrary to what was stated in the film, this did not imply his ban on performing in the state). He also fought against racial divisions within the music industry itself, not only traditionally performing "black" styles of music like gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditional "white" ones like country and western (considered by many black Americans as music of choice of the redneck community). <br /> <br /> As Peter Bradshaw, "The Guardian" film critic, he observed "Ray" is a solar film that diplomatically moves away from the dark side of things. He omits any mention of such matters as the death of Charles Aretha's beloved mother during her adolescence, her brief marriage to Eileen Williams in the early 1950s and her eventual divorce from Della Bea in 1977. It also reduces her woman's extension and the number of his illegitimate children. There are similarities with "A Beautiful Mind" that has also omitted a series of controversial details about his subject's personal life, including divorce. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles fans will undoubtedly appreciate the film for the music, but it is worth looking at those who don't know much either, especially thanks to Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance as the title character , thus reproducing Charles's mannerisms so precisely that we think we are looking at a blind man, even though Foxx himself is sighted. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line", however, Foxx did not sing his own song - no doubt the characteristic singing voice of Charles was too difficult to reproduce). It receives good support from some of the other artists, particularly Sharon Warren as Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The film is irregular and too long, but nevertheless gratifying. 7/10
