I remembered this cartoon for over 50 years: what has the power! It was fun and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It sits right there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to discover that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These first shows have done a lot for them that today's kids' cartoons don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against dangerous or dangerous circumstances. Even if the first cartoons didn't face the bad a lot - it was a much more delicate and safer moment - they allowed us to develop our talents and our character.
