A bizarre but fun diversion. You should see it from the beginning to follow what is happening, but every report on earth has its little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget science fiction v.v. to exhibit. It's fun to watch. A little in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even lower budget. For someone who is just entering the middle of one of the episodes, what you need to understand is that these kids are all incompetent, because they have been moved to the command ladder because the other officers are dead. Furthermore, the main boys come from the laundry body, which is why they have laundry all over. If you like Red Dwarf, you'll probably like it. Slightly different concept, as all you see is the Commander's report every day. <br /> <br /> It would be better if this were explained more, not only at the beginning of the first episode, but then it was rather difficult to find out what had happened to Red Dwarf, if you were not told.
