It was a long time ago (1960), but I never forgot this series and I often wanted it to reappear. So taken with it, I corresponded to Mr. Rathbun, then president of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a picture of the tapestry (actually a charcoal rendering) used behind the credits. <br /> <br /> To the opening theme of Bayco's "Elizabethan Mask", my family and I gathered around our black and white TV to drink in Shakespeare's words spoken by a group of excellent players but relatively unknown (at least for the American public of the time). <br /> <br /> We were introduced to actors such as Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have continued to enjoy their successes ever since. One of the most interesting things was the way the actors continued to age in their respective roles where Shakespeare's "Kings" were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell those actors how much this series meant to me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" could be revived on VHS and / or DVD, it would be so pleasing to those of us who wish to see it again and those who lost it the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS has just released a DVD of "An Age of Kings"! SEE THEIR CATALOG OF JULY 2009, PAGE 19, OR CALL IT FREE. I ONLY HAVE MY ORDER!
