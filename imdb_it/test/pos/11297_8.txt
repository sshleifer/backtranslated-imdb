One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is very successful in everything it does. If they weren't, we could have other little animation gems like "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". The story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called Up-And-Down-Land (I could have the wrong name). He is hated by everyone. His favorite hobby is shooting birds, and at some point in the past, presumably killed Mr. Wonderbird's wife (a bird, played with the typical talent of Peter Ustinov) leaving him with four young chicks to raise. Meanwhile, we see that another of the evil king's hobbies is painting. He made three paintings in particular: a self-portrait, a painting of a shepherdess (which he fell in love with), and a chimney-sweep painting (of which he is jealous). One night, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep come out of their pictures and run away together. Even the king's self-portrait descends from his frame and makes the real king disappear (do you think he is inventing it? It's the real plot) and sends the royal police after the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird therefore assists the lovers in an attempt to escape the forces of the king. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderfully surreal and the Up-and-Down-Land setting is an incredibly imaginary place, full of impressive buildings accessible only by elevators. It is an equal mixture of the worlds of "Metropolis" and "1984" and of the drawings of Dr. Seuss. <br /> <br /> Watch it for a truly unique visual experience that doesn't fit the standard formula for most cartoons Features.
