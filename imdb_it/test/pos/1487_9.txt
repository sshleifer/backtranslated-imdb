This television series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who wakes up with all kinds of happy incidents. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing Mr Bean with my family in 1990, when I was still a child. My family laughed so hard at each episode, and the content of which still emerges in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes that are still in my head include Mr Bean trying to get out of his parking lot, shooting the lights, counting the sheep and he in the pool. We bought all Mr Bean videos on VHS, no matter how expensive they were. It was worth it because we watched them again and again! It is so rare to see a very entertaining TV series suitable for all ages.
