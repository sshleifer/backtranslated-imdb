For those of you not familiar with Alisdair Sims, it's obviously the real Scrooge of all of Carol's Christmas movies. (Me? I guess I'm REALLY bad .. I didn't really see the damn thing). I imagine that those who HAVE seen Christmas Carol and so used to his character could find the Bells of St. Trinians quite surprising. See, in this movie, Sims has two roles. One, it sounds much better, and in the other it is dragged as director of a girl's private school! So, once you get this through your big skull, this movie offers many delights. The plot deals with the way the school tries to get some money desperately needed through a horse race. It is actually a bit more complicated to handle for small children, but I think they would be worried about their antics and horses to really notice. Even adults could have stumbled over all the thick accents being thrown around. But again, the story is reasonably light, the action is crazy and hectic, because one realizes it. PS, the boys all seem to have come from the Eloise school of sweetness.
