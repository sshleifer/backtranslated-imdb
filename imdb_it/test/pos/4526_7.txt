"Murder Over New York" is a funny voice in the Charlie Chan movie series, but if you pay attention, a lot of story holes turn out to the watchful eye. While traveling to New York for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland Yard detective Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. Now occupied by military intelligence, Drake is tracking Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected of sabotage around the world. Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he will be able to locate the real criminal. <br /> <br /> When Drake ends up dead in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, Charlie theorizes that he was killed by a poison gas recently discovered called "tetrogene", administered via a glass bullet that releases the poison once broken. Summoning Kirby to bring all his guests to dinner together, Chan and police inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question the audience, because one of them could be the murderer. Among them Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), an Oxford student of Drake, the actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake but who asked him to participate, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), chief designer of the airline of Kirby, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), Kirby's stockbroker. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after Number # 2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) surprises him while opening a cablegram, the content of which concerns Boggs himself. <br /> <br /> There are some other characters cleverly planted in the proceedings. Ms. Narvo introduces herself as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and contrary to the suspicions of Drake that he could take him to Narvo, in reality he is on the run from his ex-husband and a disastrous marriage. She is involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), principal of a chemical research company, and therefore a suspect in the tetrogenic corner. <br /> <br /> As in many of Chan's films, racial comments must be taken in accordance with the acts. This offers two obvious ones. When Kirby's black servant is questioned, he says he knows nothing about Drake's murder, which is completely "in the dark." Chan's answer: "The conditions appear contagious". <br /> <br /> Subsequently, following the order of Inspector Vance to gather all the Hindus in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival with "They are starting to resemble me all the same way." In fact, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the film, as Shemp Howard impersonates Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid", but is actually discovered by the police to be the scammer Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the film ends, two other victims fall on the clever Narvo - his confederate Ramullah and the aircraft mogul Kirby himself. To discover the killer, Chan, in concert with Elliott, organizes a test flight aboard a new TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before. Before he can release a deadly poison, the British Fenton takes the capsule that falls in mid-air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Arrested and interrogated, Chan states that Fenton is not Narvo. The real Narvo is revealed when he offers a cup of poisoned water to the nervous Fenton, anxious to keep Narvo's secret. But Chan was smart enough to watch out for such an attempt and reveal the real killer - Narvo now in the guise of stock broker Jeffrey, after having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident. <br /> <br /> Now for the hole pattern. When he first investigated the murder of Hugh Drake, it was maintained by the police that the fingerprints found in the library did not match those of dinner guests. However Jeffrey / Narvo was present at the dinner. It had already been established that Drake had a visitor not belonging to the library, the chemist Elliott. If the fingerprints didn't belong to Narvo, making them a problem was useless. <br /> <br /> Also, at the end of the film, when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water, how did he think he would escape? with it with everyone there as a witness? But going even better than that, as it would be a world traveling saboteur like Narvo having the time and the means to establish himself as a New York stockbroker, makes no sense. <br /> <br /> For curiosity enthusiasts, mention a few more points. In the film, Number # 2, Son Jimmy is a university student who studies chemistry while helping the "Pop" to solve the case. In the previous film Chan - "Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum" - Jimmy was a law student. <br /> <br /> The poison gas formula would have been reworked in a later Chan movie, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the role of Chan in "Docks of New Orleans". In that story, poisonous gas is released from similarly shattered radio tubes to claim its "victims".
