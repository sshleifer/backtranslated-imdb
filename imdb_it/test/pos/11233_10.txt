The Polish brothers are unique film artists, and they really pushed the envelope here. A fantasy that has points in common with "Wings of Desire", "Northfork" tells the story of a small city in the 50s in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being submerged and submerged thanks to the desire of the US government to make a tank in the place where the city stands. It is an ironic parable about loss and memory, with angels, dreams, premonitions and the most exhilarating government recovery official from "Repo Man". The performances are all exceptional, in particular Nolte and Woods. I noticed in reading some of the comments that there are people who have been offended simply by the fact that the Polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics, and I mean, it's one of the things that makes this film so fantastic: its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. David Mullen's cinematography is amazing. Highly recommended; if you suffered a significant personal loss, such as the death of a parent, I would also call the viewing of this film. - Ray
