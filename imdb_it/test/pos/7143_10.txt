Easily one of my favorite dramatic films, in many ways beautiful but sad, stimulating for the heart and stimulating, this is a superb dramatization of some years in the life of C.S. Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it incredibly engaging with excellent "realistic" dialogues and situations. It all seemed very 'real', but there were also 'magical' moments that almost leave you breathless with joy. Ackland and Bloom as central characters were excellent, as was the supporting cast. It is one of those dramas that I find difficult to criticize, simply because, for me, there is NOTHING to criticize, it works so well on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
