It was unusual: a modern film that was very beautiful. In fact, it was so beautiful that it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts. While watching this story based on a real life, I was thinking, "nobody is so cute, tolerant". Mostly, I was referring to the role of Ed Harris as "Coach Jones". I think they were a bit exaggerated in his character, but it is better than the opposite: to show him worse than he was in real life. It is strange to see Harris also play the role, since he has a long resume to interpret unpleasant and profane characters. <br /> <br /> However, I never complain about a beautiful, beautiful film, and it's nice to see a group of well-intentioned and kind people. These people direct their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy", better known as "Radio", a mentally slow high school boy played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid-70s in South Carolina. Gooding does a good job with the role. However, like the role of Sean Penn of a mentally challenged man in "I Am Sam", an hour and a half of a character like this is a lot. After that, the volume of those kids gets boring to hear. <br /> <br /> Note: it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this DVD to discover that, in real life, it took years for "Radio" to make its transformation, not months as shown in the film.
