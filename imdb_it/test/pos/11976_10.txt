If you want to have fun, this is THE movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Let's take the premises - There is this college that admits people with minimum qualifications of BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take into account the time consumed and therefore it is obvious that all students are over 40 years old. Furthermore the school admits the students of a "heavier" dispensation and has a slimming course in PdD and the only student who failed this Sure is Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Not convinced yet? OK keep reading. <br /> <br /> Here's a scene. Akshay Kumar, a university student, is chased by Arman and pulls out a bazooka and shoots him! So he throws grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But he does not die and continues to fight, Arman, the snake, dips a half-foot dagger into Akshay and tramples, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay gets on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman suffocates Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead. So we think that, as soon as Arman is out of the picture, Akshay swims to Raj Babbar, headmaster of this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest. <br /> <br /> But no one, I repeat, no one takes the cake but a certain Mr. Nigam. You are looking to learn more. :-)
