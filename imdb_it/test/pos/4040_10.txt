This is a wonderful film, and I still love it! It's so magical and it's fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you won't be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will love them! The story of Gerda and Kai who fall in love will amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life. <br /> <br /> I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was great! I didn't even read the book, and guess what? I don't care. In fact, if the film and the book are so different, you can simply call them two separate stories and be happy with it. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was really amazing! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen, so evil and so cold, you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a girl in love who is determined to find her love regardless of what is needed and embarks on a wonderful adventure. And I love all the Snow Queen sisters (the spring witch, the summer princess and the autumn robber) are so funny and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in a while, so forgive me if I make a small mistake ... but there's no doubt that I'll always love this movie.
