At the beginning of the 19th century, a young woman with a cleft lip comes across her family's ambition and the superstitions of the local community, but she meets a man who could see her differently, and could, change Pru's life for always. <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is an adaptation of the British Broadcasting Corporation of the acclaimed novel by Mary Webb. It's a wonderfully filmed film that has an incredibly high level, Maggie Wadey's script is excellent, and the detail of the period and the use of dialect are second to none. It is a pity that this film has not yet received the release of a DVD, it would have been thought that with the great success of Clive Owen (as big as Gideon), the BBC would have achieved the result, but unfortunately not, so the only way to capture it is on the rare occasions when TCM shows it. Janet McTeer's main performance as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, courage and sincere emotion go hand in hand with McTeer. Pru must struggle not only with his facial disfigurement, but also with the constant undermining and wounding of the ignorant villagers. This is a time when people believed that if a hare ran in front of a pregnant woman he wrote doom, a period of Bull Baiting, a time of superstitions and witch stories. Despite the constant setback, Pru is strong and resourceful, even his family rejects his dreams without realizing it, but this road could be terribly disconnected, but hope is eternal and Pru has an abundance of hope. > <br /> 8.5 / 10
