There are so many '10 Best 'lists that could easily fit into "The Dead" - Best Screen Drunk, Best Literary Adaptation, Best Use Of Music not specifically written for the film, Best Use of Poetry, Best Screen Speech, Best Ensemble Cast and finally, perhaps, the best film ever made. This was the last and greatest film by John Huston, adapted from the son of James Joyce's short story Tony and set on the night of the Epiphany Festival in Dublin in 1904. It is confined, in large part, to an environment, the house of the Sisters Morkan, and not very often it happens in conventional "dramatic" terms. They entertain their guests; there is song, dance, recitations and a lot of talk, but watching this movie you can't imagine anywhere else you'd rather be in this company. <br /> <br /> Finally, of course, it's "up" much, much more. It's about love, loss and regret, those stable pillars of a great drama. In the final scenes of the film the tenor Bartell D'Arcy, (Frank Patterson), sings a song, "The Lass of Aughrim", which evokes in the mind of Gretta, (Anjelica Huston), wife of Gabriel, (Donal McCann), the ghost of his first and probably greatest love, a boy who died in complete safety of a broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly Gabriel realizes that he never really met his wife and was not the great love of his life, after all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, firstly as Gretta tells the circumstances of her lover's death and then how the voice in Gabriel's head sums up his feelings. This is a great cinema, the monologues delivered superbly by Huston and McCann. <br /> <br /> But then all the performances are extraordinary. This is a world-class ensemble game and while it would be misleading to distinguish one performer over the other, the screen has never given us a more sympathetic, ingenious or convincing drunk than Donal Donnelly or the poem has ever been transmitted with such passion that Sean McClory, (the IRA man in "The Quiet Man"), leads to his reading of Lady Gregory's translation of 'Donal Og' here? It was added that the intensity is due to the awareness that Huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me to be the culmination of his life's work. Death could be his central theme, but watching this film is a life-enhancing experience.
