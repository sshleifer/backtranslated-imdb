Oliver Stone, always ready to make films with a political theme, makes another one here. "Talk Radio" is freely based on the career of Alan Berg, a Denver radio host who was assassinated by white supremacists. In this case, the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), a debut talk show host in Dallas who loves nothing but irritates the people he calls. As it is, most of the people they call are a handful of racist witnesses. And things could heat up more than anyone doesn't understand. <br /> <br /> Bogosian performances bring a light comic tone to an otherwise serious film. I really liked the scene in which he hit a calling redneck. Of course, I would never call Oliver Stone's greatest film, but it is a good reference in an age when the media is becoming more and more concentrated. The good performances of Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
