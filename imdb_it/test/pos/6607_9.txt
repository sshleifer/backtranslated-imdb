Take a topic I didn't know much about and make it exciting, why not? It so happens that in 1979, director Robert Altman said he didn't believe he'd ever made a real movie and that he expected one of these skateboarders - if he didn't break his neck - make the first movie. Well, I wouldn't want to give such an expectation to Stacy Peralta, but it's a skateboarder who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use the existing movie, and it is certainly a good thing that so many archive films existed. Peralta mounted it well together with the body of his former colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense, but this has been done. Altman's prediction did not come true. What Peralta did, however, is to capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate as it must have been when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys. Everything is alright. I highly recommend "Dogtown".
