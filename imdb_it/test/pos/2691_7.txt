I recently started watching this show in syndication and find it a bit fickle. Some episodes are stupid - Doug is upset about something trivial / youthful and acts stupid, etc. <br /> <br /> Again, others are quite amusing and sometimes touching. These include those episodes that address the complexity of the characters. For example, the theme "lovable overweight boy marries sexy wife" is found in several sitcoms. (Even Carrie has something about her, wise-looking. Not just a run of the sexy girl.) But Carrie has an advantage: she could be pretty to look at, but she has too many personality traits not too different from her father. <br /> <br /> And, she readily admits - for example, an episode revolves around her lack of desire to be kind to work colleagues. Personally I find it sexy, but you have to be the right kind of person to be able to live with that. Amiable Doug is a good match. And, after all, I like simple things too. Perhaps not as much as Doug, whose nirvana is watching TV and is eating a big snack next to his big screen, but no culture. This lack of a too sensitive side is one of the reasons why the two have no children. <br /> <br /> Of course, a boy's simple pleasures are nothing to ridicule to anyone, and add to the charm of the show. They live a sort of ordinary class life in Queens: it is realistic in this sense. And, generally speaking, fun and enjoyable sitcoms, esp. if you just want to relax. Eventually he gets a little tired, so it's probably going well. It worked well. See also, Becker.
