I was happy when I saw that my husband rented "Labyrinth of Passion". I love Almodovar films. We both loved the movie. We couldn't stop both of us laughing. We particularly liked the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel, and while he is presumably threatened by a killer with an electric drill, he is told to answer the phone and say "I can't talk to you now, I" is attacked by a sadist serial killer, if I survive I will call you back ". (It would be a great message for the secretary to come to think about it.) We also liked the lady who told her her new loved one," I went to an orgy after the concert but I couldn't stop thinking about you. "(I'm waiting to use that line on Twitter.)" Labyrinth of Passion "is a bizarre farce with lots of high jinks, hilarious dialogues and eye candy for everyone. The movie has aged well: the costumes of the 80s and hairstyles are added to the extravagance. I would give a 10 out of 10 vote, but I give it an 8 for two reasons: the first is the scene that involves laxatives that includes a shot of a dirty woman: absolutely useless , and po Put down the tone of the movie to the coarse Hollywood comedy for a moment. The second is the suggestion that Queti is sleeping with his father: shocking, yes, but again, it spoils the tone of the film. However, I would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy and fun time.
