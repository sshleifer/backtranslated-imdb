I'm not a fan of this brand of comedies - stereotyped characters who intrude on the cops and the farce of thieves. But there are enough nice characters to support the interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is adorable, but the person who really brings the film is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as the gangster's boss (named Tony, no less). <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is the reason I'm writing this review (and the only reason I'd recommend it), in fact. You will be tickled by his time on the screen. Play perfectly with the mafia boss, with comic touches in the right places, managing to avoid becoming a bully clich√©. In fact, Stockwell is a real pleasure to look at: a master of the "double ciak" and a true "observer" in those elegant and fedora dresses. <br /> <br /> Meesa Says: A good movie to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers.
