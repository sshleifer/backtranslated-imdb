This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. He has action, but not this bullet, good guys - bad guys, van damme - stallion action, but quick, realistic and nervous action, he has a plot, because until the end of the film you don't know how this ends, he has characters, aidan quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect, and it has suspense, this movie won't let you go before you've seen the end of it. <br /> <br /> Although there are only a few characters, I have found it difficult to keep my attention on the story, and as far as history is concerned, it is basic (not too difficult to read, difficult, but simple and raw ) and realistic. <br /> <br /> If you find yourself in a movie with a good story, a little action and a fantastic acting, look at this and I promise you that you won't leave until you've seen the end. The end itself.
