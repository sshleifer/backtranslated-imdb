Watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can shape a person's opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree young woman, but very relaxed, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard up the charts with wonderful songs. As with all today's celebrities, they have often been criticized for their music as well as for their looks, styles, etc. This had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. Initially, this film about the heart was not something I would have thought to watch. But when I started seeing it, I was hooked. In the same way as the story of Tina Turner, this film illuminates you and allows you to see in the lives of young artists. The acting was superb and even after about 20 years from its realization, the directional and the dialogue are still fun. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't looked at it yet. He is incredibly precise and emotionally charged.
