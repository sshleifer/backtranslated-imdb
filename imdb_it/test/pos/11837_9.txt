toplines this comedy ok on an elderly father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to reunite his children brought up from all over the world. Davies works as a choir girl in New York when she receives the news that "dad" wants her. Hmmmm, it sounds familiar. Davies' considerable talent as a comedian, except for this eccentric comedy, upsets the seductive British campaign with his brash American personality. Not as sharp as other Davies comedies, but it's still worth a look. Ray Milland interprets his "brother" long lost. Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also fun.
