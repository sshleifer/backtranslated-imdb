Engaging characters, beautiful animation, dynamite songs ... all this and even cute kittens. There is a lot of excellent humor, but no real threat, so don't worry about your little ones. The two dogs on the farm steal the show, even though they appear only in two scenes. The artwork has a linear quality that can discourage some people, but I find it fascinating.
