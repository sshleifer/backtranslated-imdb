This is the film is actually one of my all-time favorites. I'm not a fan of Renny Harlin because most of his films suck, but TLKG hits the mark every time. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) who suffers from amnesia. she is married to a child and as she says "I am a damn member of the PTA". and then his world crumbles when the pieces fall on the spot of his previous identity. Samuel Jackson plays a policeman with artists who does PI concerts, is dragged by her to solve his identity and to get paid a little money for his work. along the way we find out that Samantha is really Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy who has been dead for years before. the plot is great, making this story look real and Jackson does a great job as Davis' second violin (who always does a great job of acting). the explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with a memorable scene after a memorable scene. quite impressive visually even if the child put my nerves at the end (watch out for the machines!) I'm tired of kids ruining a movie to save but, anyway, this movie is worth it when the child adds to the movie. again, this film is really good, I never understood why it didn't do more at the box office, but if it were a man starring in the film I'm sure it would have grossed a hundred million. what is good is that over the years more and more people are discovering this film and giving it good grades as the average of this film on this site has increased over the years. I hope it increases further as this is a great action movie. and I love action movies
