Joe is the film on the dark side of the 1960s American strength, and Susan Sarandon has nice tits. This film scared me so much when I saw it in the theater that I never liked Peter Boyle until Young Frankenstein and I was still quite wary of him even after that comedy. Looking back on the experience of today, this film seems to be new and to the point that half of John McCain's "Joe The Plumber" and the fear of electing a black man as president of states United in the coming weeks. A black Prez would be seen as a sweet revenge of the "Negroes", but destined to still bring fire to many minds if not to the streets, this time by Joe's fans. So, Joe's spirit in the movie is resurrected in the Joe The Plumber campaign! However, I love being American and terrified of both and the awareness that illustrate what ironically Gregory Peck said that even our civilized law is: "a living and breathing reality!" God help us.
