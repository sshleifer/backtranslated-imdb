...this. The thing that came to my mind immediately was Loving Annabelle, since it has the same kind of mature humor and how to deal with matter with detachment. We simply observe how the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to face "moral" problems (or, of course, we are, but we don't feed them with a spoon). Of course, there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make, but it simply flowed. Basically it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sex. <br /> <br /> I personally found the girls who have good chemistry and had fun with them during their night outings. The only thing I could really identify as a problem would be that I felt like ... kept. Withheld. It's not about the sex scenes (or the ones that are missing), but since I heard the film more alive during the moments when they were together having fun, it's somehow in contrast with the rest. Lowkey is good, but it has never been as sparkling as Loving Annabelle, nor has it touched me so much. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I highly recommend it, it's not a waste of precious time at all, on the contrary ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
