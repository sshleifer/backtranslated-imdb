Well, obviously the critics hated him. This is not a film that stands for great critical acclaim. But the fact is that it is really very good. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you don't like that Chris Farley physical comedy brand, or David Spade's excessively dry humor, you won't like it. But for the rest of us, the film has many hilarious sequences, and for what they are quotable, and the plot is not as stupid as that of "Black Sheep". The parts that don't want to be witty are actually well done, not what you'd expect from a film of this genre, and the acting is really very good. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is without question the best film by Chris Farley. I give him an A and I suggest you give him a vision.
