As everyone now knows, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her stepsister. <br /> <br /> The manifestation of Schizophrenia is still seen as a disease that people often feel may disappear if ignored. There are also those who, though they may seem unlikely when shown in the film, think that the disease manifests itself as a consequence of a sort of supernatural influence. I think Mrs. Sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 Park Avenue". It has made a good turn, not only for the general public, but also for those who deal with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psychoanalysts. The film actually helps to dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I was told that the film is based largely on his personal experiences with a person very close to her, who suffers from this mental affliction. In this sense, I am sure that none of what has been shown is blown out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of the facts. <br /> <br /> The shows are good, in the whole, as can be expected. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose are really very good. They emerge as very "real" characters ... credible enough to be able to identify with them sometimes. People can consider me terribly strange, but I think there are times when you can also identify with Meethi! I suppose we all have a series of "madness" within us ... maybe some more than others. These are the people that are identified. After all, don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? Those impossible at times? Would we be nicknamed "out of our rockers" if people could see these areas of our mind? A person with low self-esteem, being considered schizophrenic because he refuses the company ... preferring instead to live in a world of his own because this is the only space where there is a sense of security? > <br /> Konkona, like Meethi, is exceptional !! His performance is so simple ... he lives his part. He has shown that he can lull the audience by forgetting the division between reality and acting! A case in point is the part where it is distressed on the scene, shown on TV, of the arrest of Saddam Hussein. His reaction seems so casual and intense ... like he's really upset by this tragedy! Even his brand of Indian English is so spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> However, the same cannot be said for at least a couple of other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, both wonderful actors, seem uncomfortable when they conduct their dialogue in English. Their diction is not perfect ... drawn and influenced, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than evident. Their delivery of the dialogue is strident and tends to break the regular flow of the unfolding of the fairy tale. <br /> <br /> The brutal rape of Meethi (Konkona) seems a bit pointless. Any other accident would have been enough, I think. The point here is that something triggers the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, it cannot be said, with any conviction or certainty, that the rape incident was instrumental in bringing the propensity until then latent to schizophrenia, to the fore. So why are we subjected to the scene where the bleeding and unconscious liar is. Ms. Sen has tried to make a social statement on the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence to stay in power ?? If so, then the rape scene is justified but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film. <br /> <br /> The finish looks rather blunt. Does the public expect to find a solution? Where does Meethi disappear? Mrs. Sen wants us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about her reality is more real and therefore credible, is it true? In other words, are you trying to say that we are not without prejudice when we judge who is on the side of the fine line between sanity and madness? I'm not very sure. <br /> <br /> A stimulating film on the whole and worth looking at. However, IF you are the kind of person who likes things in order and in order ... all cut and dried, with a watertight solution for every problem that emerges ... this movie is clearly not meant for you!
