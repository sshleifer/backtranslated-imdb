Apart from the disco scenes that embody the swinging Sixties (especially with all those who dance the instrumental versions of the Monkees' hits), I am surprised at how light this farce holds 37 years later, but it does so thanks to the bold execution of its deception- plot based and the acute interaction of the three derivations. Directed by the formidable scriptwriter Gene Saks, this 1969 comedy talks about Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan bachelor and confirmed bachelor, who pretends to be married to avoid a long-term commitment with his young year-old girlfriend, Toni . In response to Toni's unconvinced suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni insists before meeting his wife to alleviate his conscience. Enter the devoted nurse of Julian Stephanie to interpret the wife, and the inevitable complications follow one another with white lies that turn into big winners that lead to alleged couplings and decoupling. <br /> <br /> Like Julian, a relaxed Walter Matthau deftly plays the deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic way, but lets his two female co-stars move away with the image. In his big-screen debut, a 24-year-old fold, Goldie Hawn, still retains his "Laugh-In" character, but provides an unexpected sense of depth like Toni. She and Matthau have great unforced chemistry in their scenes together. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, still serenely regal at 54, obviously has a ball that plays Stephanie, initially tired and witty but blossoming in a liberated spirit as the story evolves. I particularly like his nonchalance after his nightly fun. There is a nice supporting work by Rick Lenz as Igor Igor and Jack Weston's neighbor in the role of Julian's actor friend, Harvey. The longtime collaborator of Billy Wilder, I.A.L. Diamond, provides the sparkling script and opens the story beyond its origins linked to the stage for Saks, which is not the most cinematic of the directors. Apart from a couple of trailers, there are no significant extras with the DVD.
