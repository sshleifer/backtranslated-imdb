I had never read much (or even seen) of the group of English comedies of six men The Crazy Gang, but my positive experiences with their contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and in particular Graham Greene praised THE FROZEN LIMITS ("The funniest English image yet produced ... can stand comparison with SAFETY LAST and THE GENERAL") - it made me take the plunge with Network of this DVDs R2 bare-bones and their next film GASBAGS (1941, see below), both of which were released earlier this year with virtually no fanfare. <br /> <br /> A western of British production is a rarity, but a Western English parody is even rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still about 25 years apart). Incidentally, returning to the silent classics quoted by Greene, the film seems to me more clearly indebted to THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). Also, it also sounds like a variation on the fairy tale "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs" (which had just been immortalized on the screen via Walt Disney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh member is played by an ancient comedian and frequent Will Hay lamina Moore Marriott; the Gang actually calls the beautiful heroine Eileen Bell with that name in everything, and there's also a fun sequence with the six of them getting ready to go to bed and whistle the dwarf song from the Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three series of comic duets: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) could be the biggest group of films of the genre - although not all of their personalities emerge here: my favorites were the great Bud Flanagan (similar to Jim Backus), the hetero Chesney Allen and the teddy Knox with the squeaky squeaky voice; however, bald Charlie Naughton often took the limelight - since that's what others always seemed to catch on. Still, it's Marriott that steals the film from its very first scene - where it manages to impersonate every officer in the crumbling theater of a ghost town! a very young Bernard Lee is also notable as the villain of the piece. <br /> <br /> The Hours routine between Flanagan and Allen actually anticipates the famous "Who's On First?" by Abbott and Costello (the film, in fact, hinges on a lot of word games due to its humor - which doesn't necessarily travel, especially in this situation). Nevertheless, there are several fun sequences in all - some of which have even brought tears to my eyes: the opening scene in which the Band is stripped by a band of angry creditors; they dressed as Indians when they hit the Yukon; the band's ploy to make everyone rich with the same piece of gold; all impersonate the sleepwalker Marriott to confuse the villains (a gag that can be originated from the exhilarating sequence of mirrors of Marx Bros. in DUCK SOUP [1933]); the theatrical theatrical sketch that makes fun of hoary melodramas; the surreal moment in which, pursued by villains, one of the Gang climbs a staircase that is part of the scenario painted in the theater; and especially towards the end, when a group of mounted police singers gallops so slowly until the Gang is rescued (despite being encouraged by the increasingly impatient Ranger hero). <br /> <br /> The subtle soundtrack and the frenetic nature of the gags themselves made it difficult at times to do all the jokes at times - the subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case. The Crazy Gang made only five films - even the first two were well seen, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938), and a much later meeting (although Allen had, at that point, abandoned due to bad health and was replaced by Eddie Gray) called LIFE IS A CIRCUS (1960, directed by Val Guest who, incidentally, co-wrote both the Gang films I purchased, and some of the already mentioned Hay and Askey vehicles!).
