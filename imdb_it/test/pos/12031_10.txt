I was a schoolboy when I saw this movie for the first time. The next day I knew that all the students of our form looked at him and everyone was fascinated by the film as I was. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later I watched it every time it was shown on TV and I wanted to watch more. I think the comparison with "Back to the future" or other science fiction films is not appropriate. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you've looked at it, you never forget it. <br /> <br /> This film is full of faith in the results of peaceful science, full of confidence in the beautiful future of our world. It is not only the film, but also a forecast of many inventions and scientific results. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a pupil Kolja Gerasimov traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Seleznyova came from). The year is 2005, many inventions and expected results in the film have not yet been realized. Like "Mielophone" (a device that can read thoughts of any animal and human), expeditions on Venus and Mars (as easy as going for a picnic on the weekend), creating and launching satellites as homework tasks, easy to drive flying machines (which have completely replaced cars), biorobots, "historical identification" of any type of material or creature performed in a couple of minutes and many others. Meanwhile, some of these have become much more realistic than they looked in 1984! Only wait for 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also describes the typical Russian schoolchildren and female students (and does it naturally!). With their inventiveness, curiosity, humor, dreamy. Look for example at Fima Korolyov, one could find such a character in almost every form of every school of the Soviet Union, a similar character was in my form too! Alisa Seleznyova ... I myself, like many of my classmates fell in love with her at first sight! By the way, later an actress who played Alisa became a scientist - I think she was influenced as much by the film as by those who watched it on TV. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful creation, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ("The Wonderful Far-Away") ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is that different remakes and "new" versions of the movie's song and even the movie itself have been made later and broadcast on TV and on the Internet. "Original. I shouldn't even comment on them, my comment only concerns the original. So, request the original and have fun!"
