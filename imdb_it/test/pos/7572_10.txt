Jack Palance, (John Witting), was usually a bad boy in most of his films and in this film he showed his great acting talents beyond my expectations. John Witting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after years and years of separation. Christopher Walken, (Jacob), has difficulty trying to accept his father's appearance after spending the night in the family stable. Jacob's son and younger daughter welcome their new grandfather and welcome him like him, a very old man, at the end of his ropes. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), deepens the character of John Witting and begins to bring out the truth about what happened to him during his years of absence from the family. This is a very warm and loving film with down to earth about real events that happen in most families for generations that come and go.
