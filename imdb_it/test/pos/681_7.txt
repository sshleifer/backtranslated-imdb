Intense domestic suspense with the landlady (Lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a migrant psychotic maid (Ryan). The 2 masters of the genre are at their head, the best erotic as they combine wits, emotions and wills in a strange hostage situation right outside the Saturday Evening Post. Black and white photography in intense colors with an unusual amount of close-ups. The girl who makes fun of Ryan is really well directed here. Unlikely, but satisfying suburban melodrama.
