The closet earth is not a happy film. Nor is it related to any kind of social realism. This is perhaps his strength. The distance from time and from specific nations reinforces the message, makes it more powerful and rips off the burden of nationalism and propaganda that you often perceive in films made to criticize nations in opposition to their own (I am obviously talking about US propaganda in some films commercial). <br /> <br /> The bit closet earth is much more than a message. It is a film of pure surreal beauty, full of the same clean and clinical form that you find in a work like 1984 and it is the same. <br /> <br /> I'm a big old Alan Rickman fan, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, I might add, the irresistible sex appeal ;-)). The match between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see it, it seems to play a character even worse than the previous one ... <br /> <br /> But enough sweettalk. The film lacks action. I don't want any cars crashing, but I want something to happen, except the chatter. After an hour I got really tired of the interrogations, of the predictable actions and more than anything else I wanted a more complex vision of all this, the world, the previous lives of the characters and all the rest of the picture that was missing. For some people a nice touch. For me, something less positive. <br /> <br /> However, Closet Land is a film that is worth it if you are ready to take a journey into the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course for us who really loves the always bad Alan Rickman.
