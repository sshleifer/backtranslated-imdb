Fans of American war movies may be bored to death by this film, but that boredom stems from ignorance. The guerrilla suppression operations are always like this. Sit down and wait, grab some prostitutes, get drunk at the base, turn and face the businessman, kick a prisoner around, hide the street merchant's murderer from the private green. Then, boom, there are two trucks of fuel, and for 10 minutes a battle of small arms with a large caliber machine gun. So wait for the brass to plan a way to knock out their fortress, and then end up killing some civilians in the process of doing so. If reality does not work for Western viewers, there is always Top Gun or Rambo (Top Gun realistic nope) <br /> <br /> The best part of Afganskiy Izlom's realism is the way all the planes launched flares like confetti. They had to do it because Carter and Reagan gave the mujahedin so many missiles. Moreover, the wave of Mi-24 was excellent, a helo attack even better than Apocalypse now. The sight of their falling and firing missiles was a scene of imminent "death from above" for anyone who turned them. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the Soviets managed to make an honest film in Afghanistan within a year of their departure, but it took six years in the United States. Afganskiy Izlom is just as real if it also applies to the occupation of NATO. Someone will always take the gun and shoot you because they care more about the earth. It is a film that Westerners should watch. Unfortunately I don't think anyone ever did the English subtitles; I might have to do some.
