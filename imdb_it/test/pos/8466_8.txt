There have been several books that have cited this as the first gay cinema. I don't see this as all that is gay in the homosexual sense, but then seeing two men dancing in what must be the first musical in the world has its attraction. <br /> <br /> There have been several previous comments on this film that reject any homosexual nuance. About those who are ready to liquidate this film as if it were just silly and an experiment done late at night after too many drinks ... Well, I've heard that story before. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting as an oddity and if people want to consider it the first gay movie so be it. Better this than the depressing 1919 Anders als die Andern.
