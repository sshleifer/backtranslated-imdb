In one of the most viewed films of the late 1980s, at a time when Oliver Stone was riding with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his film Born on the Fourth of July), he co-wrote and directed this look on world of radio, in particular a radio host in central Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, at one time in the career of Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original comedy and also co-wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those pundits you hear in the radio stations that many of us could turn off. He has ideas for his mind, opinions and not only is he not afraid to talk to her, but also to oppose telephone callers. The callers, in fact, are the driving force of the film, since Barry must fight against the disrespectful, the obscene, the racist and the mere distractors. While continuing, he must also struggle with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a successful agreement to go nationwide, outside the confines of the southern station where he is. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie I felt curious to see how it would be done on stage (I guess it was a show for one man, since Bogosian had several on the side), the direction of the film it's phenomenal. Stone was known, almost as a voice actor, as a director who loves fast cuts, unlimited editing effects and effects with camera work styles and other little tricks, which give his films an appearance in the 90s distinctive, almost author. But in the 1980s it had this energy and a feverish quality in the appearance of the film, and it wasn't as hectic as the other films. In order to add the right intensity within the studio and the head space of Barry Champlain, he and DP Robert Richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times, gritty, unsafe and definitely on the limit. The scenes in the middle of the film, when Barry isn't in the studio, are pretty standard, but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best I've seen from the Stone / Richardson combination. /> <br /> And Bogosian's performance cannot be miscalculated, which can be hateful, offensive, irritated, passive, and everything we love and hate in radio hosts. There is also a fun, almost inattentive supporting role for Michael Wincott in the role of Kent / Michael / Joe, who jokes about him one night, and the next one is invited to the studio. These scenes are a bit awkward for a viewer, but they come into the head-space of the 1980s subculture that Barry is as intrigued as he is critical. The stoner might not 'figure it out', but as he says "it's your show". In fact, it is difficult to cover everything that happens within the speech, and there is a lot. But it's never boring, and like Champlain himself, it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian enters its climatic pull on air, with the background going around 360 continuous turns, it becomes intoxicating and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful. <br /> <br /> Stone was synonymous with a director of hot topics, who deals with topics that were or are still controversial and gives them a life force that is not always great, but is all his. Here his abilities and ambitions do not interfere with those of Bogosian - it is enhanced, if anything, by an extremely skilful vision of what is essentially a show for a single man, which in itself is already well written.
