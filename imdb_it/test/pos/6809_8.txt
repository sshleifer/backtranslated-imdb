In "Lassie Come Home", "National Velvet" and "The Courage of Lassie", Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ?? However, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what was lacking in talent and experience was well hidden in a beautiful production that was nominated for five Academy Awards ?? <br /> <br /> As a horse instructor or dog master, as a wife or dishonored lover, Liz is a woman absorbed in giving and receiving love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life ?? Does little Liz smell of love for horses and dogs with considerable intensity? Ecstatic; a dreamer with a turbulent, persistent emotional life, does the young Liz dedicate herself to the prize-winning horse like the way she later devotes herself to men? <br /> <br /> Anticipating his subsequent images of the young sex goddess, Liz as Velvet is both holy and mature ?? Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child who "lights up with the integrity of a great passion". <br /> <br /> Directed by Clarence Brown with love for details, the film that made her a star is a bestseller from another era set in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, the daughter of a butcher, do you work with a teenager tramp named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for the competition of a horse that won in a lottery ?? <br /> <br /> From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, to the thatched cottages and to the miles of country walks, "National Velvet" is the product of an era gone by in the cinema? <br /> <br /> Following closely the structure of the popular novel by Enid Bagnold, the film is partly a tale of horses, partly a family portrait: training and riding scenes are balanced by welcoming family scenes, cartoons on the young love and sermons from the mother on the virtues of courage and resistance? <br /> <br /> Are the Browns a noble version of rustic Hollywood ?? Dedicated to a sober work ethic, live peaceful and exemplary lives ?? Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the spirit of popular folk wisdom; the spokeswoman of common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her crazy horse daughter, and let the girl do her dream ?????? Anne Revere won an Oscar as mother of Velvet, as did the publisher Robert J. Kern ??
