Swift's writing has much more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with fantasy-adventurous writers, so it's curious that Gulliver's Travels was considered a children's novel. Lucky children! <br /> <br /> The same goes for this film. There have been some really terrible versions of this story, which must be why people are reluctant to watch this version. I mean, it's a TV movie and it comes from the muppetteer Jim Henson, so how should we expect anything but cuteness? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty appears in the strangest places. Kids love this movie enough to sit for all three hours, but it also takes time to get Swift's dark vision. I hate special effects, but here they are used to continuing the story instead of dazzling us. Keep in mind that the producers have taken the trouble to recruit classic actors like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole who perform their eccentric roles with perfection. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the love story between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch is moving and moving, as well as fun (it's a girl, but twenty times bigger than her size). The frame story has a theme about absent fathers to which many children will relate. And the part about Gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror that deals with the abuse of authority (apparently deriving from "Bedlam" by Val Lewton [1946], another forgotten masterpiece). <br /> <br /> The VHS is always running in the small business for a few cents, which is an insult to the many great artists who have put this together. I encourage the public to recognize a good thing by getting this film and inspiring others to watch it. Even though he has a lot to offer children, grown-ups will find that he stands up well with classics like Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other fantastic works.
