After some further reflection on this film, I find it all too easy to dismiss it as the boy's dream. Actually I received some spiritual strength from Northfork ....... Angels exist .... we are surely entertained by the Angels .... most of the time we are not even aware of them ..... In a moment of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life, I personally really needed this film. Yes, as I wrote before, talk to so many ...... I can't wait to get to Heaven ... <br /> <br /> "Being so fed up with all things about FX and Formula, "I found this film like a real cinema. All I can say is that it touched me in so many ways, that I'm still solving everything. North Fork is a wonderful film. One that takes the viewer's mind out of his heart. "Spirituality is very intriguing to me. Be careful, because you will have to use the brain and the heart that God has given you to follow the story. I think it is perhaps a bit above the heads of some, but I feel those are the people who he reports in a more important way. I want to see it several times, just so I can take it all! <br /> <br /> The industry needs to study this film to realize that we exist. <br /> <br /> My thanks to all those involved in the making of this film.
