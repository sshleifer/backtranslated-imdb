Forgiving the Franklins is the best film I've seen in recent years. The acting was fantastic. Especially Mari Blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. He gave birth to Peggy with incredible skill and made her as real as my neighbor. I also liked Robertson Dean in the role of the father ... he is a true professional and managed to make even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances of the entire cast were very good, excellent, actually, but the role of Peggy as played by Blackwell made the film. The cinematography was beautifully completed and it was really impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is a slight weakness of the final scenes, which were overly elaborate, repetitive and a little too focused on the wrong character. I would have liked to see him finish with a note of forgiveness .... but despite that slight defect, it is worth observing and applauding all those involved in its realization.
