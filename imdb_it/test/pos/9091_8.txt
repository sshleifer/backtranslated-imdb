When I first saw Flatliner, I was stunned. It had all the necessary features of a good movie: the cast was superb, the plot was superb, and in the case of thrillers, there were genuine "chills" in all. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland offered a wonderful performance as the male protagonist in the piece, depicting a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then returning to life, essentially "stealing" the secrets of death . Kevin Bacon offers excellent performances as Keifer's more morally decent counterpart, while Julia Roberts offers her more convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and apparently in sexual intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another exceptional performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple, but original and the acting is refreshing - certainly a prominent film for the genre, and one that set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
