Suppose for a moment that you have never experienced the psychotropic fungus and are wondering about the so-called bad experience and how something similar could happen? Well, go ahead and insert a new copy of The Beguiled. You see, with the film you have your clean trips (Solaris and anything else directed by Andrei Tarkovsky), whack trips, that is the experience from which you never recover (Sweet Movie and El Topo), and you're bad organic journeys, a category specifically reserved for a film like The Beguiled which is the kind of content that Times's passionate writers made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the Harvard Department of English as "tone hallucinogens". With the third act of this film directed by Don Siegel, you may not notice exactly that your two heavy hands are shrunken and take on all the characteristics of a digging insectivorous mammal, nor will you fall into exactly the suspicion that your spine has reached the same shape sinuous and the gnarled texture of a blossoming tree of incalculable wild berries, but you will feel something. <br /> <br /> In 1970, when this film was shot, most Americans were looking for an anodyne for their pain, a film like The Graduate perhaps, a lot of world-endism was happening and, of course, you had the nightmare break down the war in Vietnam. What you get apart The ambiguous metaphors of the drug, aside, is a script adapted from a novel by a boy who, at least for the moment, wanted to be known as Grimes Grice, and directed by the director who helped carry on the Work and career of Sam Peckinpah. In The Beguiled, Donny Siegel, born at age 12, in Chicago, Il., Less than 45 years later The Great Fire is showing his attempt to fight with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970s in the form of a cinematic artifact classic. The Beguiled is an incredible film and an exceptional contribution to the film arts in almost every respect: the shooting, editing, direction and plot are all fantastic, and it's not likely that you'll see anything else. Undoubtedly, a sinister film, its effects, as I said, are both dizzying and adulterant; frankly it is hard to believe that Universal has ever given his name to this image, but you will see the vision of some of the sweet and sweet moves of the camera, and the director of photography Bruce Surtees that uses every fragment of the dark myth you have in mind about the 'American South Plantation, which combines beauty and evil in every position. Clint Eastwood, needless to say, has never been like this. Old Clint, moves instantly from shy to bruise, his eyes like two spirals of Archimedes in the near middle. The rest of the cast is equally demanding and disturbing. <br /> <br /> This Beguiled will never make the AFI 100 in my life, but that doesn't stop me from postulating that it's one of the best synchronized American sound films ever made. While most people categorize it as a western, to include people at The Western Channel, The Beguiled is a problem because you don't really know what it is: a kind of war movie? A drama? Psychological thriller? Perhaps the answer to all those emotionally beaten Noir movies with Kirk Douglas? Actually I call this piece a horror film because when my old man, who likes to relax with gratuitous and free violence projected in fun like The Wire, he saw that long long medium angle of Geraldine Page that wrapped a tourniquet around at Clint's bloody leg, Pa was pretty quick in suggesting to look at something else like the Outback Bowl, just before escaping to another room. My advice: look at this, and make sure it's on a very large screen, preferably on that DPL home theater projector you're contemplating. I would put The Beguiled together with that important consumer purchase, turn the overheads upside down, throw some cinematic light on the big white wall and try not to lose the grip because just like Norman Bates, "We all go a little crazy times ", even the deceived.
