I went in search of this movie after reading the Tom Clancy novel "Red Storm Rising". Timeless masterpiece of the 13th century Russians who were invaded by the Germans. The film was made in 1938, by order of Joseph Stalin to warn the Soviets about Hitler and Germany. The battle scenes are wonderfully done, proving that you don't need computer animation to create an exceptional fighting scene. Probably the greatest work of Sergei Eisenstein. See also "Battleship Potemkin". Any fan of history or poly-skiing should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.
