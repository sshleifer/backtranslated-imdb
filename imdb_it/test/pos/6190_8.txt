To be completely honest, I was completely fascinated by the original concept of "Sleeper Cell". Having seen the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky broke in the sense that I missed the crucial ending. But what I saw of this, I thought it was a great plot, a good acting and since I don't watch "24", I thought it was great, and it was confirmed for a second season ... <br /> < br /> One of the best TV programs I've seen. Much more realistic and credible than "24." Excellent character development and plot. It does not beat Islam, but gives a thoughtful and thoughtful approach, showing the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
