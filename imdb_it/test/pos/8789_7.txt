NO SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> After the success of Hitchcock's first American film, Rebecca based on the lush novel by Daphne DuMarier of romanticism and gothic intrigue, has returned to some of the most familiar themes of her British period - mistaken identity and espionage. As the United States settled in World War II and the large-scale "war effort" of civilians building aircraft, weapons and other necessary militias, the thriving cinematic entertainment business began to generate paranoid and often chauvinist thrillers with time-related themes of war. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators working in the shadows among good law-abiding citizens. Knowing that the director was at ease in this kind of espionage, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock to run a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero stuck in a whirlwind of coincidences and identities wrong. The most obscure elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of the literary producer Dorothy Parker (during her brief period in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in New York), co-author of the script, were a perfect combination for the sensitivity of Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> This often overlooked film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work in a Los Angeles airplane factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later it is framed to commit sabotage. Fleeing from the authorities who do not believe in his unlikely history, he meets various characters headed for Soda City, Utah, and finally New York. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of useful "monsters" and a famous billboard Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of her life and national security, falls madly in love! Obviously in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the alleged sabotage Barry, falls in love with her captor, adding romantic tensions to the mix. <br /> <br /> In good shape for this release, Hitchcock produces a national network of older women, middle-sized Joes and respectable businessmen who act as secret agent terrorists who host criminals, throw guns and do detonate bombs to keep things moving. It's a terrifying storyline that takes its time to go on and once turned on, culminates in one of Hitchcock's most memorable endings. Incredibly he seeks life as New York tourist attractions (which were recreated by Hollywood art directors due to the ban on shooting wartime public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most popular films, it is a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with lots of clever twists and, as usual, terrible Hitchcock criminals. Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the movie. The original idea of ​​Hitchcock's cameo that was shot (fighting in sign language with his "deaf" wife) was taken by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who was afraid of offending the deaf!
