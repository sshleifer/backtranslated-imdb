This film is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a constant rhythm, told mostly not by words but by the means of cinematographic expression. The perfect combination of spectacular special effects and classical music creates creations of human imagination in a realistic and poetic way. The story itself is quite simple at first sight. As the title suggests, there is an archetypal journey, a motif repeated for thousands of years. This motif was always used not only to describe a journey through space and time, and beyond, but it also had a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic contemplation of the most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great on its own, yet, in my case, the resulting impression will always be mixed with that of the book. I read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like "what is the relationship between the evolution of humanity and the development of human morality". But the impression was big enough to make me fall in love with an entire genre of science fiction. <br /> <br /> The day I learned that "2001" only got Oscar special effects and was not even nominated for the best film was the day when "Oscar Award" became completely two words they meant nothing to me.
