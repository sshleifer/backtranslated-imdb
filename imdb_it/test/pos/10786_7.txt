Barry Champlain is a presenter of radio talk shows in Dallas, whose ideas, with no holds barred on a multitude of social issues, disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of the truth, or a social misfit to attack his audience? <br /> <br /> This is an intense and provocative character about a man with almost no salvific characteristics that at the same time seems to be on a really profound philosophy. Although written and directed by Stone, this is actually the Bogosian piece to the hilt and offers a surprisingly sharp and penetrating performance from which there is no escape. Barry is sometimes one of the most disgusting characters imaginable, spewing a bile mercy to all those around him, especially those who take care of him. But at the same time he is also strangely empathetic, hypnotic, wise, even lovable. The hawkish traits of Bogosian burn in the frame, with its green eyes constantly flickering as if they were permanently seeking an answer to a riddle. The film is essentially an angry and hypocritical outburst against all the bigotry, injustice and banality of the world, which culminates in Barry's wild single three and a half minute shot that offers the ultimate hate-whole speech. , but the boy makes a fist. The supporting cast is great, in particular Greene as ex-wife and Baldwin as head. The passionate photography of Robert Richardson manages to keep the single radio studio and the soundtrack of Stewart Copeland interesting, with a moving tail with that nice piece of music by phone, Telephone And Rubber Band of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. If you're not familiar with Bogosian, take a look at his incredible talent in this film - like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he's one who rarely appears in the mainstream media, just because his writings are so out there. I find that Stone's films are variable; I don't care much about his great successes, but when he is more orderly and objective, like this (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more incisive and compliant. A great primordial cry of an image, based on a play by Bogosian, inspired by the true story of Alan Berg, a Denver radio host who was assassinated by the neo-Nazis in 1984.
