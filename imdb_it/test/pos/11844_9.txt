I saw this movie the other night on one of the channels in the film and I didn't laugh so long. This movie was so funny that I went out and bought it the next day. I love this kind of comedy. He seemed so real in the way actors react to different situations here. I was Rollin. I had never heard of it and started looking only for the "Seeing Other People" title. The title made me try and I'm glad I did. I laughed so much that it hurt me. Now it's part of my collection. I highly recommend it to everyone who loves the kind of smart comedy. I will watch it over and over again.
