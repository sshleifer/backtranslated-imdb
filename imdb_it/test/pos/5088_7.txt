Continuing with the exclusive film program on complicated relationships in some European courts, "Anna Boleyn", a film directed by the great German director Herr Ernst Lubitsch, was screened last night in the Schloss theater. The film describes the terrible story of the queen consort of the British king Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not exactly, the king ordered the executioners to do his dirty work) without mentioning that this marriage caused an important historical political and religious event, the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> The film features the star Henny Porten, the first German screen superstar in those early years and Herr Emil Jannings, Germany's fattest actor in that silent era. Both interpret their characters adequately; Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and Herr Jannings as the unscrupulous, extravagant and womanizing British monarch, a character very suitable for this appropriately behaving German actor and the excessive personality of the character himself. <br /> <br /> In the first period of the cinema, Herr Lubitsch was known for his exceptional costumed films, colossal productions with important budgets ("Anna Boleyn" cost about 8 million marks, a fortune also for this German count) paying great attention to magnificent decorations, as can be seen during the coronation procession in the Westminster Abbey scene that employed 4,000 extras (German idles of that time were used, causing revolutionary workers to create confusion when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the set during filming). <br /> <br /> In addition to the show, one of the most important aspects of this and each of Herr Lubitsch's films, even during his epic period, is the complex relationship between the main characters. We experience a game of different interests, double meanings and the complicated art of flirting, but what is treated lightly ends first in tragedy. The importance of these historical facts is carried out effectively, but Lubitsch is much more interested in changing the relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Bolena. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to temporarily take leave because this German count must make sure that one of his rich and wealthy heirs does not lose his head for this Teutonic aristocrat. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
