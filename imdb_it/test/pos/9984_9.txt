I was amazed by this movie. I am one of those people who only take a risk with films that I don't particularly like, sometimes, and I have to say that this has paid off. I mean, Wow! My boys also enjoyed the film (5 and 6 at the time), although I'm pretty sure this wasn't suitable for their age groups. <br /> <br /> Also this film was clean, which is a big plus. It's so nice to sit in a movie that you like completely without swearing, violence (except for a very short scene) or anything else that is likely to find morally questionable. <br /> <br /> This film has taken you on a journey you are so ready to believe because of the great acting. You feel the wide range of emotions portrayed together with the characters. <br /> <br /> I never thought that a golf film would take me to the edge of my place, but I couldn't help but be intensely interested in how this would come out. I have nothing to compare to because I've never seen golf in reality or in films before, but everyone has done a great job in keeping the rhythm and captivating emotions here. The score also worked miracles; excellent, excellent score. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't think this would be your kind of movie, watch it. You could be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was.
