This is a very well done film that shows the life of international students during their "Erasmus year" in Barcelona, ​​which by the way is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is an ideal location. <br /> <br /> The very idea with all the different languages ​​is exceptional and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about countries, but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries. <br /> <br /> After experiencing "Erasmus" about myself during my exchang semester in Italy, I can say that the film is incredibly authentic. I have had many similar experiences with the characters (except that I haven't been fired more often). The film is also quite funny but not like all those stupid American university films. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film also touches on some important issues such as the transition from student life to work. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (maybe I'm not very objective)
