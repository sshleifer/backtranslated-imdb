to history. It is a reality mixed with Americana and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage in New England. His shabby boss offers them - he resigns and takes some money from the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida is not a short trip, and his Ford Escort dies. Then he meets an older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have a camper van and kindly offer to help her - it's not safe for a girl to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is as realistic as Alice, and initially allows Judith Ivey's character to help her; buy his decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. In the beginning it's a nice vacation for Alice, who hopes to connect with her girlfriend, who is attending college in Miami. There is an interesting cinematography, since the trio leads the camper in Florida: the stops, the bland landscapes and finally the beautiful mountains of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> In the end there is something strange, and the character Ivey apparently has stories invented about his daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a little sinister. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the result of this film - but it ends positively as the audience anxiously awaits - This film reminded me of a bit of Spielberg's "Duel" - while initially not so threatening - the moral of the story is - you never know what people think - especially if you're driving cross-country. Caution !!. You will like this movie.
