This 3-hour epic (it seems much shorter) explores the will to power and conquest and the conflicting motivations behind this research by tracing two parallel lives: Emperor Q'in, whose desire to unify Chinese feudal states it has its bases in noble purposes but turns into violent oppression, isolation and extreme impotence; and the killer Jing ke, a mercenary killer who comes to recognize the unintended consequences of the murder and finds a form of salvation. As with all great art, this can be understood on many levels. The film aroused for me images and ideas of Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I verified it on britannica.com!), so this film will appeal to history buffs. It is ironic that Q'in spent much of his last years in a futile search for immortality (not shown on the screen, but consistent with the plot). <br /> <br /> The film can also be seen as an allegory of Maoism and cultural revolution. Through the film, one can understand that the last 50 years of Chinese history have had their precedent in the last 3000. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for the public, these complex ideas are developed into a film full of images, action and pagination. The battle scenes alone are worth the admission price.
