There are films that are just a different version of another, not remakes, but only similar to others, it is not. Although he talks about the Mafia, he is looked at in another way and often seems only a secondary theme. I went to see that movie by accident (because the other's theater was full) and in the end I was satisfied. It surprised me, because of its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting objects to analyze. It doesn't follow the classic ways of movies, it's just different and I think I'm not the only one to like it. I'm also very happy because he is Italian and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers weren't brave enough to change the subject. In this film you can also watch the new Italian style, but it's not blocked in clich√©s. I hope to be quite understandable, I know it's difficult, I also hope this film can be exported from our borders, it's a good product to export. I also want to emphasize the music, excellent soundtrack, the film needs it because of its long silent pause and they are perfectly covered by that music. Many congratulations to the director and, thanks, the cinema needs these films.
