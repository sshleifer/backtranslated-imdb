I remember seeing this in theaters when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be and being so pleasantly surprised that I promised to buy the video when it came out. <br /> <br /> Even if I don't go too deep into filming this movie, I'll say I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in other users' reviews. <br /> <br /> What I will say is this: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. He's the closest to a textbook audience grabber I've ever seen. Once I put this film at a party, where everyone was relaxing and getting ready to go. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everyone, who watched the opening, stayed until the end.
