I had the feeling that I was a boy that I loved this movie. I've always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. the boy had pure talent both in this film and in Jurassic Park. I looked for the DVD or VHS to buy in a shop near me I can't find it I hope it goes on DVD! good, however, excellent film. If anyone knows where I can find this please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Someone can really explain what happened to Bobby. was it real or was it false and he was an imaginary friend and his escape? lol, I'm clueless. my favorite part was surely the one in which they created the monster's juice and spread it throughout the kitchen, it's a fun but also sad part for what happens to bobby because of the mess .. engaged boyfriends because he played his part pretty well. I think the mother was a great actress, I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or a name like that ... well, that's all please contact me <br /> <br /> wrp24
