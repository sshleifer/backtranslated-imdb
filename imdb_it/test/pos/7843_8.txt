Another piece of moral ambiguity well done in which the anti-hero makes it difficult to decide who to support. <br /> <br /> If nothing else "The Beguiled" silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in the movies - at least in 1971. In this film there were four excellent parts for actresses and all were well made and well executed. <br /> <br /> Pamelyn Ferdin did a great job as Amy and would continue acting in "Wanda June". This must have been the first time a male adult box office star shared a long kiss with a 12-year-old girl at the camera, wondering if there were many controversies about this at the time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy "Randolph's" turtle, it is not surprising that Ferdin became an animal rights activist. <br /> <br /> Even Geraldine Page was excellent, playing a complex character with the right amount of moderation. Interestingly, she died only three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth floor window) because they had also worked together on "You're a Big Boy Now". <br /> <br /> Hartman (who seems to be Blair Brown's sister) was as wonderful as Edwina and would have to get an Oscar (no other show was even close that year), but given what we now know about her you wonder how much of her performance has been studied and how hard it came from within her. Edwina shows such raw pain that it is difficult to look at. Like the incredible performance of Marilyn Monroe in "The Misfits", the viewer is probably seeing a lot of his demons in the character he's playing. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is extraordinarily perfect as Carol flirty. For my money Harris was the sexiest actress of the 70s, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. It was the best reason to watch the television series "Most Wanted" and the only reason to watch "Wild Wild West Revisited". Hard to believe that someone who could bring this to the screen has never become a big star.
