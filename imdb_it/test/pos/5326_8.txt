Before seeing this film, I read the comment of someone who was not very fond of it. I have to admit that he made me learn to spend 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life on it, but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, I particularly loved the believer. Even Don Cheadle was fantastic. The film presented an interesting vision of life and death. It was very touching and very sad, but it always interested me, that the most moving stories can't do. It is a film that regardless of whether you like it or not, you should see it. It was unique, and I don't think anyone will ever be able to duplicate it. All the young actors have surprisingly well given the subject and the emotion that must have entered. I was pleasantly surprised.
