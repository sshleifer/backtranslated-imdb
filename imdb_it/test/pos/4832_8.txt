Having finally managed to get the DVD of this 1997 HBO movie, he is at a minimum watching it. When I finished, the old saying "those who cannot learn from the past are destined to relive it" echoed in the mind. First shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers (and four years before the events of 9/11) Path To Paradise reveals the series of close encounters, errors and official decisions that led to the first bombardment of the twin towers and the lessons that we should have learned from them. <br /> <br /> Path To Paradise presents a beautiful cast of credible actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the cast as FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their New York counterpart Lou Napoli (Paul Guilfoyle ). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack, each of whom plays his roles not as potential clich√©s, but as true living and makes the film even more beautiful. A special mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem, the man who, had it not been for the FBI skeptical officials, could potentially have been informed about the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well produced. Despite having been made for the cable, this film does not seem at all a low-cost film with its production values, particularly in its sets and locations in New York. The film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style sometimes. When all these elements are combined with the script, everything contributes to giving the film a sense of reality that makes the events even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about the film is the script. The film's events are real (minus a dramatic license that is always needed) and in hindsight they are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago. The film reveals how a group of men was able to smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center. They did so due to the lack of Arab translators, government agencies that did not exchange information, the FBI that ignored contacts from a source and that police departments were unable to collect clues. Worse still, the inability of investigators to connect points is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed 9.11 attack but in some cases (such as lack of translators) are problems that continue even today. Even more chilling is the ending that really happened and seems too prophetic today. <br /> <br /> Path To Paradise is a film that should be an essential vision today. The film is not only well acted and produced, but teaches us a lesson that we should have learned before. The lesson of the film? That those who cannot learn from the past are doomed to live it again. If you can find this movie, watch it and learn from it.
