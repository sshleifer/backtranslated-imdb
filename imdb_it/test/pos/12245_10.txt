A truly fantastic and moving film. The female melodrama at its best, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Every woman can relate to the story because it is a classic: you're in love with "Mr. Right" but have no interest in you until a guy who seems completely wrong arrives and you fall madly in love. Of course, it's not so simplistic. The characters are real and all the performances are perfect. Even the film is hilarious, every scene strips society. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written script of humor and melodrama. You can relate to each character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A great and underrated film.
