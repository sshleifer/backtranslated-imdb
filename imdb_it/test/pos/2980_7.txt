I haven't seen this movie since it came out on a record in the theater, and I've been looking for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending escapes me. It was the young love that absorbed me the most, not to mention John's voice and Taupin's lyrics. History (at the moment) has affected my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental films and this is still alive in my head after 35 years - it's so beautiful. Put yourself in adolescence and let your fantasies pass. If this film did not arouse your curiosity, then you were simply too old. I can't wait to see him again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is in your home, I'm sure this is an interesting movie to watch. It's innocence is simply amazing and its simplicity is so easy and fun.
