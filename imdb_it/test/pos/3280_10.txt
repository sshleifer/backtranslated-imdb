I think the Posse movie by Mario Van Peebles is a very important film. It is an excellent entry film for one side of the story that many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cows and foot soldiers returning from the Spanish-American war with a gold reserve. The main character Peebles is obsessed with memories of the murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and the infantryman is explored in this film with an excellent cast, including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios' father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> One senses that Peeples strove to use as many black actors as possible (and some less notable - smiling) :) Perhaps too many, some noteworthy people (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier) are only cameo scenes, others briefly as Tone Loc. The feeling and efforts of Peebles' efforts to exhibit these actors will be understood by some. The large cast (a feat for any director) works well and does a good job in telling the story in the classic "revenge and fight against justice" Western. <br /> <br /> The most notable was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor Woody Strode (from Once Upon A Time In The West), his very life was a nuisance, in the context of an earlier era not yet completed, faded from memory. No other actor could have done this role better. Read the mini-biography on Woody Strode here as a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of balancing the action with some sardonic humor. The dialogue was excellent if a little contemporary! And as others have mentioned, vulgarity was not precise at that time. The sex scene was a little too much - not really necessary. There are some historical inaccuracies such as the apparent electronic brand of cattle, etc. But Posse is a good attempt to open the door to the hope of further historical and creative works that reflect other untold stories and events. The real photos of the real cowboys at the end credits were very nice.
