This is a very pleasant, soft and charming 1940s musical. 'Cover Girl' has turned Rita Hayworth (formerly dark-haired Latin senorita, Margarita Cansino) into a true all-American star. He confirmed the incredible talent of Gene Kelly as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It represents the exuberance and the color of the musical genre. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is as big as Rusty Parker, it's her image and her presence is always at the forefront. His singing is nicknamed, but his dance is absolutely brilliant and combines very well with Kelly. I think Rita has been underestimated as an actress: she plays every scene superbly here. Gene choreographed the dance sequences (in this case he was given almost complete creative freedom), and his dance number "Alter Ego" is surprising. Such artistic talent. The highlights are "Make Way For Tomorrow", "Put Me To The Test" and, of course, "Long Ago and Far Away". The plot is rather thin, yet it has a moral. It is about the dangers of rapid fame and quick money, and how any happiness with just these factors will eventually be condemned. This will cheer you up, lift you up and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> That said, "Cover Girl" is not the greatest musical ever produced - it has a number of flaws that need to be addressed. It can be said that a bit of Phil Silvers has a long way to go. His character gets boring rather quickly. However, I was impressed by his dancing skills and how he was able to keep up with Gene and Rita. Another big problem is that too many songs aren't really great. The issue of "Cover Girl" is fantastic, but I'm not a fan of lyrics or singing. 'Poor Tom' is a huge downer. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've ever heard in a 1940s-50s musical. Stink. Grandma's subplot borders on being ridiculous. But this is just my opinion. Others might appreciate these elements. <br /> <br /> Yet, apart from the faults, it is a very, very good film, much better than most of the baked product today. Dance and song are sublime, production values ​​are excellent, and the mood is contagious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
