I don't know why all the critics say that this was a bad movie, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a great couple. Tommy is the fool who spent seven years in college, eventually passing with a D +. Richard is the smart guy who was hated by everyone in school. How can you not laugh when the two of them sing "The Carpenters Superstar" with passion and suddenly the hood opens? In all this is a great film, I recommend it.
