I saw it at a projection in the German press. Without giving too far: most critics seemed to really appreciate it. There was also applause later, which was quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the most entertaining movie of the year. It retains the charm and spirit of the three W + G shorts and is expanded with many references to these and other films. Of course, there are obvious allusions to the films of monsters and werewolves, in particular to "An American Werewolf in London", "Jaws", "King Kong" and even to "Braindead" / "Dead Alive" by Peter Jackson, but also to other genres. <br /> <br /> The characterization was best done in "Chicken Run", but that movie had a new full "cast" that needed introduction. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new movie "Wallace and Gromit" is best enjoyed if you have already watched (and appreciated) the shorts, but it also works alone. "Chicken Run" had the most convenient plot, but also more "narrative". Instead, this new masterpiece by Aardman maintains that crazier and somewhat more "isolated" feeling than W + G shorts. Even kids should have a lot of fun, especially for sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must for you !!!) and because Gromit has a lot to do and really steals the show (even children love dogs ... :-)). But many jokes are meant for a more adult audience (there are also soft sexual allusions in it). The film manages, like "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles", to satisfy high-level entertainment for the whole family, with the addition of a British touch and at least a little more obscure to the humor of the films of American animation. > <br /> The animation is ?? as expected ?? superb, and they remained faithful to the Aardman style because they didn't put too many digital effects - I only understood a few when it came to Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works well in the film, although one of the main themes is certainly "borrowed" from "Dragonheart" by Randy Edelman. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is: it will probably take another six years from now until we see a new Nick Park & ​​Co. gem animation
