"A Cat in the Brain" / "Cat in the Brain" is one of the most glamorous horror films ever made. There is a lot of blood and blood, including chainsaw butchery, bloody and numerous beheadings. The film is also an interesting parody "of Fulci, but blood and violence are the key element in it. Some of the FX gores were taken from Fulci's own films" When Alice Broke the Mirror "and" The Ghosts of Sodom " (both from 1988), plus Gore FX taken from Fulci's "The Snake House" under the supervision of "Bloody Psycho" by Leandro Lucchetti, "Massacre" by Andrea Bianchi, "Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta" by Mario Bianchi, " Non Si Sevizia i Bambini "by Giovanni Simonelli and" Luna di Sangue "alias" Fuga dalla Morte "by Enzo Milioni (all in 1989). The scene in which Brett Halsey beats the woman's face in pulp is taken from" When Alice Ruppe lo Specchio ", a film made by Fulci for Italian TV in 1988. At the beginning the chainsaw of the corpse is taken from the same film, as is the head in the microwave and the boy is guided over and over again. Highly recommended, especially if you like extreme cinema!
