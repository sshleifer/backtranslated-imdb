"The hawk and the snowman" is the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who become disenchanted with US foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. The film's events are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the main parts and develop interesting characterizations. Even the supporting cast performs well, particularly with a performance by David Suchet of the fame of Hercule Poirot as an experienced Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> The film is generally effective in defining its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two guys were trapped in something they didn't understand correctly. However, it seems too long and cumbersome in the central points. The finish, however, is tense, surprising and effective. There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but unfortunately also a sweet and repeated synthesizer track that doesn't fit a spy story. There are other espionage films that are worth looking for besides "The falcon and the snowman", but it's still a decent film.
