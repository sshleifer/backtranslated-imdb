Excellent drama on 2 insane and spoiled punks who come into conflict with the federal government, each for their own reasons. One, a drug addict, just wants to earn some money for his next correction, but the other has a much more sinister program fueled in part by resentment against his father. Good performance and an engaging script make this a winner.
