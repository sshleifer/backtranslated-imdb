If you are looking for a movie in which an out-of-control nymphomaniac is chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man, then look no further than the latest Paramount Vantage release "Black Snake Moan". Not exactly looking for what I just described to you? Well, then you better think about yourself and go to the bottom of your local theater and keep seeing it as Samuel L. Jackson's character, Lazarus would say. As long as you have an open mind and don't take everything seriously, there's no reason why you won't leave the theater happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> In the third offer from director Craig Brewer, we are caught in the deep south, where, as the movie tagline says, everything is warmer. While we introduced ourselves to the Godfearing bluesman, Lazarus as previously said interpreted by Jackson, and Rae almost always half-naked; a role boldly played by Christina Ricci. In the film this unlikely couple crosses paths long enough to allow their characters to learn a lesson from one another. Both lessons ultimately convey the message that, regardless of what, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone understood it, then we would be much better. The question of whether this will be understood or accepted by all those who see the film is another story. <br /> <br /> Something wrong with the debate is how big Jackson and Ricci are. You would think with the role of a woman gone crazy for sex, it would be an excessive fact, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that is also his best result. Then we have Jackson who disappears completely and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he is too. Unfortunately, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake, who plays Rae's militant boyfriend, is not that great. At first, it fails miserably while it seems like it is trying too hard. Later it takes a step forward, but it is far from the level reached in January by Alpha Dog. <br /> <br /> The other thing that boasts "Black Snake Moan" is a wonderful soundtrack. Containing songs from The Black Keys, John Doe, excerpts from the Scott Bomar soundtrack, and of course four, counting, four tracks by Jackson himself. It is actually one of his songs, the main performance of the film, "Stackolee", which is the fuel for the fire of this great collection. Only the ticket price applies. Other notable musical delights of the soundtrack are "The Chain" by Bomar, "When the Lights Go Out" by Black Keys, and the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film in which Lazarus sings Rae on a stormy night. <br /> <br /> Craig Brewer's efforts cannot go without mention though. His latest film 'Hustle & Flow' which ended up exceeding low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map. What he did with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from other newcomers in the industry. He not only directed "Moan", but he also wrote his script. The end result is a story that is surprising and intelligent. As you watch you feel like you know exactly where it is headed despite its brave calm. Just as you think you've predicted the next move, Brewer changes gear and takes a completely different path. There are however some spots in the script. The characters in the background are gray and flat while the finish is somewhat disappointing. It left me wanting something more exciting. After so many highs, I imagine the final scenes were a bit weak compared to the rest of the film. I guess most people who see "Black Snake Moan" won't like it because of the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking about how unlikely the situations are. The depressing part about this is that there are many other films with equally unlikely, even more scandalous scenarios that are widely welcomed. It is the themes of race, religious motivation and sexuality that the film exhibits that will have more effect on the opinion than anything else. The idea of ​​a black man who chains a white woman in his house is enough to make most people not even think about seeing her. Simply put, it's not for everyone. As I said, to enjoy it fully you have to come in with an open mind, otherwise you're just wasting your money. For those of you who can do it, I highly recommend it.
