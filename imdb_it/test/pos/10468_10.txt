I don't know if this film hits my heart like it does with feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation that creates Babette's cooking, but when the party starts and for the rest of the movie, I often choke . <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a wellness film, but without a grain of sweetness or easy sentimentality. Please note that the plot elements are discussed. The Feast of Babette tells its story with moderation and care, and makes us discover for ourselves the values ​​of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee who was hosted by two elderly sisters in a small community on the Jutland coast. The sisters guide what remains of their father's flock. He was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self-denial. The sisters made their sacrifices for duty and faith. Those who still remain honor the teachings of the long-dead pastor and his spiritual guide. However, as they grew up, the small community became querula and controversy. The sisters do what they can. For the shepherd's 100th birthday, Babette wishes to cook dinner for the small group that the sisters will invite. The sisters reluctantly accept, but when they see the supplies that Babette ordered, they and their guests become uncomfortable. They are used to the usual community dish of dried, boiled cod and a soup made of bread, water and a little beer. Although Babette has made improvements over time, what they are seeing now seems close to impiety. At dinner he will also be a visitor, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who years before had chosen ambition for his love for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What do we live? There is the austerity of the faith of the old community and of the stone houses, swept by the wind in which they live. There is the candlelight heat of the small and crowded sisters' dining room. And then there is the transforming power of Babette's artistic ability as we watch her cook, look at Erik, a little boy who helps her, serve and pour, and watch the old parishioners, with the help of good wine and exquisite cuisine, to gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship. The General is our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating. The general tells a story to his non-inclusive dinner companions, a story about a famous woman who was the exemplary chef at the famous Café Anglais in Paris. "... this woman, this head chef, had the ability to transform a dinner into a sort of love story ... a love story that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite". He too is turning into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and love of what he chose not to accept long ago. An old couple kiss. Two old men remember past friendships. And Babette, who spent everything she had won in a lottery for this dinner, had the opportunity to be the artist who was once in France, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, now as poor as she was when she arrived without a penny years before, will continue with her sisters. The general in a carriage with his aunt returns to his estate. And the elderly guests leave the nuns' house to return to their homes. They stop and look at the clear night sky and the stars above. They spontaneously hold their hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn ... <br /> <br /> "The clock beats and time passes by. Eternity is near. We use this time to try to serve the Lord with heart and mind, so that our real home will find, so that we will find our true home ". <br /> <br /> They smile at each other. Everything has been reconciled. <br /> <br /> Babette's Feast is a wonderful film, full of contained emotions, unspoken understandings, wisdom ... and, of course, a meal that will leave you with a growling stomach as you exit the theater. If you win a lottery and you can afford what Babette has created and you have his skills and abilities, here's what he served: <br /> <br /> Potage a la Tortue (a rich turtle soup), served with amontillado sherry Blinis Demidoff au Caviale (small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar), served with champagne Veuve Clicquot Cailles en Sarcophage with Perigourdine sauce (boneless quail filled with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira), served with Clos de Vougeot, a good morning of salade and fresh fruit Baba au Rhum with glacé fruit and fresh figs Coffee and a good brandy
