Released as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This film was essentially the FIRST kung fu film to be released in the UK. Many of us had grown up through Kurosawa's surprisingly gritty and engaging dramas and were accustomed to oriental cinema being beautifully filmed and lit up, with a rather contained rhythm, all in all it's like flipping through an album of beautiful photographs that have just moved. <br /> <br /> Next come Run Run Shaw and co. with their widescreen "home movie" production values ​​and the surprising dubbing mature for parody and all the rules have changed. KIng Boxer was the first to cross the door, leaving a clearly marked track that others can follow with their feet firmly planted on top of the burnt steps. <br /> <br /> Despite the hokey plots, the pantomime, the cheese skipping -cuts and the western-style zoom spaghetti, this film was wonderful. Splendid without being opulent and with the most brilliant fighting choreography ever to embellish a screen. We loved nauseating violence, anguish, testosterone. The martial artists among us have found some of the fascinating techniques, if flaming and often stupid. He was very different from the Japanese things we all knew, and he had an acrobatic grace that suited perfectly to the sickening violence and blood-stained floors. Delicious. <br /> <br /> The scene of "KIng Lear" was, at that time, a real milestone in schlock "Cruel bastards .. My **** !!" Now it's a little less shocking, but still a bit of a guitarist ... We didn't realize that the women in sight were absolutely one-dimensional. After seeing more films like this, it now stands out as a sore thumb, but at the moment it didn't matter <br /> <br /> This movie quickly defined the clichés of the kung-fu movie. All of them. Watch it and remember that until it exploded onto Western screens, there was no genre to get into. It was unique and fantastic. It was the first kung fu film and it is still, for me and many others, the best.
