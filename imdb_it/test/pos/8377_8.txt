A fast and fun noir set in Vienna immediately after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who does not find legal work because he has no documents. No document means no work permit, which means there is no way to get a passport. He survives by driving a friend's taxi during the night. If caught, it means three months in prison. One evening he takes a fare in a large hotel and drives the man to an airline office. Buka takes the man's luggage and returns to the car. There he finds that his client has acquired an unnecessary hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will take a hold on him very quickly. No, he needs time to think about it. Drive in a secluded place, empty the man's pockets and hide the body. Now he has an American passport and a lot of money! He drops from a contact in the underground world to change the passport photo. Now he just needs to go to the man's hotel and pick up the man's plane ticket. His ticket to freedom! Needless to say, it would be too simple. Waiting in the hotel is the lover of the dead, Joan Camden. Camden is on the run from her rather ugly husband, Francis Lederer, Lederer is, of course, the pig who has run into the man in Buka's taxi. Camden has called the police since he believes Buka has robbed his lover. Buka shows her new passport and manages to get out of the confusion. Camden breaks when hubby Lederer shows up at the police station. Lederer convinces the police Camden suffered a mental breakdown and she was released. She runs away again, finds Buka, and the two decide to flee the country together. Lederer makes his appearance again and Buka has to decide whether to help Camden is worth his freedom. This film is much better than how I play it. Buka is best known as the killer of the low-life cop in 1950 "Between Midnight and Dawn". The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
