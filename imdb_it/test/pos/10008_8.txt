"Quitting" could be as much an exit from the preordained identity as the withdrawal from the drug. As a rural boy who comes to Beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist's face as an appeal to separate himself from his roots and far exceed the success of his peasant parents. Problems arise, however, when the new man is too new, when he demands too great a deviation from family, history, nature and personal identity. The resulting divisions, and the confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the substance of an instinctive control on the one hand or of a complete escape from oneself on the other. Hongshen slips into the second and his long and lonely way back to his self can be sad. <br /> <br /> But the exceptionally convincing peculiarity, honesty and sensuality of the director Zhang Yang and his actors lead on this journey. No clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender role, no sex required, romantic or violence scenes, no necessary street language and, for the start, no money supposed to float the character's acts and whims. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is about twenty-five years old. He is a talented, impressionable, vain, idealistic and perhaps emotionally hungry actor. The perfect recipe for its enablers. Soon he is the "cool" actor, idolized by young people. "It was hot in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most fashionable." It needs extremes, and goes for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting means arts, friends and roles, but not the type that offers a challenge or personal input. And his self-criticism, opaque from the immediacy of success, opens the door to an irrational insecurity, self-hate ... "I didn't know how to behave" "I felt like a fake" - and readily available drugs to fight them. He says "I had to get up to do what the director wanted". Thus, his superficial identity as an actor becomes, through drugs, an escape from identity. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent and stubbornly his. Loneliness, space, meditative thinking, rejection of speech, replacement of therapy. The abstract is out. And much of its change occurs outdoors - not in idealized locations but mainly on green areas under Beijing's highways, bridges and skyscrapers. Physicality is almost romantic, but it is not. The bicycle takes you to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the sun and rain soaked, the grassy picnics, the patterns of the sky and the kites that absorb its reflection are very specific. Drift to arrive, all the time collecting ideas for a more real and realistic identity. "I started to open," he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body that projects a kind of dancer (awkward, graceful, humorous, narrative) positioning in a current circumstance. If the mind or spirit is missing, his legs can force him to walk all night. <br /> <br /> At the center of his return is the rejection of fixed roles. To punctuate his end to acting and his determination towards a new identity, he destroys his videos and his TV, and beats his head to bloodied against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He has disappointed his iconic anti-establishment artist --- but it is the only viable guide I know. He even imagines himself as the son of John (Yoko Ono) and adopts his "Mother Mary" as an intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of difficulty". (the excruciating and trembling pain in the park - hallucinatory tests and skitzoid) "Music is much truer than acting" he says. And he talks about Lennon's influence as "showing me in a new way". In the mental institution, life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to hang his hero's poster again in his renovated room. <br /> <br /> If Lennon's influence is lively, Hongshen's father's influence is rooted. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drinks), it is Fegsen's differences from his son to subscribe its change. Because the father is more confident in himself: he agrees to be Chinese, a peasant in a row of peasants, a director of a rural theater. And he exercises control over both his habits and emotions. It is this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat it as a resonance chamber, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (blue jeans, the Beatles) and passivity. In his wildest and most violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake, he exposes more than himself to his father: "all the actions I played before were bullshit ... life is bullshit." And with the emphasis of Hongshen "you are NOT my father", he answers softly, "why can't a farmer of yours be your father?" <br /> <br /> Under these two teachers and with much more help from his mother, sister, friends, detained at the rehabilitation institute, he creates a tangible connection with a real self (not whole). As the long-term effects of the drug recede, so does his old identity. Debt replaces pride, trusts in distrust. Integrity banishes its black cloud. All its edges soften. "You're just a human being" he repeats over and over after being freed from abuse for refusing medicine. Back home, the lard peasant soap is fine with him now. And his "rare and true friendships" once started again as is evident in the back part of the poignant fence scene with his musician friend. Hongshen says of this film: "it is a good opportunity to think about my life". And I could add, become a new actor, one tied to art and life. Like Lennon, he achieved success without loss of identity.
