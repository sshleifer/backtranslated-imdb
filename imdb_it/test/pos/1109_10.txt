I took this film at Glenwood Cinemas over the weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual, provided a thoughtful and eclectic champion of world cinema. <br /> <br /> I have been passionate about Australian Film for several years, so I was glad to know that this film was included, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> Superbly shot, firmly directed, it is a disturbing tale of a man and his journey into the heart of darkness, so to speak. It reminded me a little of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has that weird madness, but I was glued to the film for other reasons, which is to say that it presents a portrait of Australia that is ... well, very credible. <Br /> <br /> I have been on holiday at Land Down Under a number of times, once in the 80s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I don't want to dwell on explaining my holidays, but director Frayne seems to have an understanding of what I find so strange and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for the end of, for example , Nick Cave on one side, and Steve Irwin (the "Crocodile hunter") on the other. <br /> <br /> A corny spell - - I would have preferred even more than the "unknown" Australia. Much more indeed. But I also realize that there is only 1 hour and a half to do everything in ... 'Sigh.' <br /> <br /> Overall, however, this film is very, very accomplished.
