I was given a DVD of Public Enemies and I expected it to be the 2009 version but it wasn't - it was this! Of course, it wasn't the greatest film I've ever seen - not with ANY medium - but, heck, it was worth more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw that terrible evaluation on IMDb, I wondered what I would get but, since the disc was in the drive, I was content to watch it. As other commentators have pointed out, Public Enemies is NOT a historical film per se - and I've noticed that, unlike the 2009 version (which I haven't seen yet) IMDb doesn't classify it as such. <br /> <br /> Force people! It's a STORY based on real people - that's all! If I wanted a history lesson, I'll sit on this computer and read Wikipedia or something. But Barker (current name Arizona - or Arrie - Barker) has NEVER been accused of any crime and, as other commentators have already pointed out, he probably never even took part in the activities of his children. They sent her to the movies while they were "working"! (I hope it wasn't as critical as some of those who saw this movie!) <br /> <br /> Theresa Russell had the not too easy task of portraying a woman from the age of 17 up to her death at the age of 52 - from a young girl running from home to the hardened mother of four children of thugs. I think he did it quite well. The cheeky little smile he used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I agree with some of the critics that the direction of this film was below average and I sympathize with the actors. Theresa should have told the director to forget topless shots - they didn't contribute to the story. Perhaps some bigger name stars would have been able to inject some of their skills to override the bad direction, while the latter were not so brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But even if this was certainly not a block-buster, it was worth more than 2.8 !! I have all my dvds on a personal database where they mark them BEFORE looking at the IMDb score (although sometimes it slightly influences subsequent changes). I take what I get in its merits rather than make a film against others of the same genre and this that I heard was pretty fun to get 6.8. (Yes, I will accept that such a practice tends to depend on my mood at that time, but isn't it true even for those who vote on IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise when I look at IMDb and saw the pitiful score got here. <br /> <br /> Given the surprise, I decided to read some of the other comments hoping to understand the low level and noticed that they are quite polarized. I agree with those who have said that the film deserves to be seen and has come to the conclusion that some people are simply hard to please. Well, since some were absolutely pungent, why not go out there and make better films? I look forward to the gems that they must be able to achieve! On the other hand, if they can't do it, then why aren't they just silent?
