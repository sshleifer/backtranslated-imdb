I'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it doesn't fit the movie. The rest of Imaginary Heroes, however, represented a realistic family that went through realistic issues, such as death, drugs, relationships and high school. I could have sworn they were my own family, not a joke. <br /> <br /> Emile Hirsch was quite credible as a teenager struggling with his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother who tries to preserve the remains of her (slightly) dysfunctional family together. <br /> <br /> Although this family can take their problems to the extreme, anyone can relate to what they go through, whether it be graduation, expectations or parenthood.
