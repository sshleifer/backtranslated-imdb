For having made only a few films with his life the late great Chris Farley. Farley died in late 1997 and will be lost mainly by his Tommy Boy co-actor, David Spade. From the blades Police Academy 4 Spade has really done well with his career in the movies. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we look at him. From the appearance of Saturday NIGHT LIVE to make Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverley Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley has had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was the best in my case and I watched him again and again and always laughed at the same part. Thanks Chris Farley.
