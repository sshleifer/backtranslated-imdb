After having spent a lot of my youth watching movies like this, I found this very easy to follow in both the unmodified and cut versions (although the story has much more to keep together in the unreleased version. A much more serious note and I think that's what struck me. The animation while it's grainy is very original, and I love the way the artists of that year have accentuated the shadows to show different emotions. I think the story is perfect. really strong and with the progress of the film one has the feeling that you are moving forward in this adventure with the characters.When they meet, they become allies and discover their greatest strengths, a lot of heart has been put into this.
