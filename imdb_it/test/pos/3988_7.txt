I totally disagree with the person who first commented on this film. for me, this plot is about a man with hormonal growth disorder who does his best to look for the love he wants. Trying his best to adapt to the society that does not seem to accept it. <br /> <br /> He then met someone who treats him with the love of the best friend and was shown the way to receive the love he always wanted to have. the man who created all that happiness in return has received something important from the giant, which is the love of family and spouse. <br /> <br /> and the comedy, it's just part of making the audience hear some bugs of laughter in certain parts of the shows. <br /> <br /> and I must admit, it made my eyes water a little.
