The film is really about choices. In the state of oppression seen in the Fire, where good women had to be obedient and do what was right in the eyes of tradition, there seemed to be few options for Radha and Sita. However, assuming it was not their only option. What is life without desire, Radha questions Ashok. Yes, it is true that life offers us a series of options, but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors. When your world is confined to a small Indian family, being a dutiful daughter-in-law to a silent but observant yet powerful matriarch, a dutiful wife of 13 years to a man who has made a vow of celibacy because of your not being able to have a child, a man who just wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. I felt that the ladies had no choice but to find comfort in each other's company. I think the fact that so many women applauded Ms Mehta's work was because it offered them an option to think for themselves. An option to do what was perhaps unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I heard were simply to put that point. Every scene in the film from the first to the Taj Mahal to the last to the Mosque is etched in my mind. How frustrating it is to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. Feel that you have had to give up the human touch to be a respectful wife just because you expect it from you. To suppress any desire you may have and desire the human touch. What then is the meaning of our existence? In the scene where Sita cries alone in the room and Radha comes in to comfort her, their lips accidentally touch and wakes up in them. Something of which they were both private. <br /> <br /> Bravo to Ms Mehta in translating her vision so clearly. I particularly like the flashbacks of the young Radha who tries to "see" the ocean. It is a metaphor for freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom to transport us to places that normally we would not be able to reach. In those scenes, we are kindly told that his sense of duty was also transmitted by his mother, who I assume lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and enriched by the soundtrack of A.R. Rahman. Since the film, I became avid fans of the two main actresses and the director. I look forward to more of Ms Deepa's future productions.
