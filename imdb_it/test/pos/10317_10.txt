Not wishing to repeat what everyone has noticed, I will only say this: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone says they loved Curly the best ... but I will put BRIDELESS GROOM against ANY of the other courts of Stooges. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most exhilarating from beginning to end, as well as being the most traceable. <br /> <br /> The out-of-key singing student ... Christine McIntire's cousin Basil's routine, and of course Emil Sitka's JP, are the highlights, but only around the impeccable timing of the Stooges and also to the great writing! <br /> <br /> Nuff said.
