My friends and I rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very determined to rent it even though he had no idea what it was. We all thought it was like "a Canadian American cake", but when we looked at it we were completely surprised, we were all silent throughout the movie and we loved it! It was nothing like American Pie and had a plot that teenagers would surely love (since in the end the boy makes fun of him), after that night it became my favorite movie not only for the plot but also for the actors great writing. There was not a moment when I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and related to anyone who lives in a small city with few prospects. I absolutely love this movie and I would advise you to rent it the next time you get the chance, it's worth it.
