What can I say about this film that will not give you any preconceived notions when you see it? Very little. The plot has to do with the return of a teenage girl from the hospital after she broke down. What follows is the film. It is one of the most amazing films of recent years. Everything in the film is just off-center and leaves you uncomfortable after the movie is finished. It's not a perfect movie. The film has problems in its last half hour that makes a story already confusing, even more confusing. (If you've read any number of other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, you'll know that a lot of time has been spent trying to unlock what's going on.) I'm not sure what I actually think of this movie beyond of the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that the best known horror movies have ever had. If you like horror, and you don't mind if you don't have everything clearly summarized, I suggest you try it, as it will probably make your skin crawl.
