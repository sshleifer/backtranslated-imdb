I heard about this movie a long time ago and finally found it on ebay for five dollars. I didn't expect much, but wow, I was surprised. It is the story of a boy and a girl in love who tries to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo. standard but this movie is crazy! It is hard to believe that such an original animated film was made in 1952. Furthermore, the king was probably one of the most disturbing characters I've seen in a long time, with a female walk, strange eyes (usually crossed) and a soft but scary voice. The only problem I had with the film was that the boy and the girl had no personality and almost no line except to call Mr.. Wonderbird (A big talking green bird) to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells were missing in some scenes that sucked. It's incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and sometimes even laughing out loud, it's a real shame that it's such a dark title because it's really a good movie. Check it out sometimes.
