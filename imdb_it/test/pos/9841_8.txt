Remember - first there was Sidney, there was Dudley. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges is barely recalled today - because his heyday as a fixed film in sound films goes back to the late 1920s and into the 1930s. Except for a major performance: the ship's good humor, a tipsy doctor in 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, most of his films are barely resurrected. More is the sin because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931 he played Casper Gutman (the original actor to play that villain) with Sam Spade by Ricardo Cortez in the first FALCON MALTESE. Similarly, around the same time, he played the recording angel in Leslie Howard's version of OUTDARD BOUND - the same role Sidney Greenstreet played in TRA DUE MONDI a decade later. <br /> <br /> Digges could be likeable and lovable (again the ship's doctor), or detestable (in CHINA SEAS, when the First Judge Companion grins at poor Lewis Stone but then proves himself a coward in a moment of crisis). He held his against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter who works with Gary Cooper on THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN. Digges could do anything. <br /> <br /> Here, it is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical and thief guardian of a reform school to whom Frankie Darro and his friends were sent for committing a robbery and injuring a Greek shop owner American (it's the last incident for most of them). Digges is ugly here as in CHINA SEAS, but it's a close thing not to love him completely. He is able to somehow transcend his roles ... later. <br /> <br /> Darro has a gang of urban delinquents (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As noted in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shake up car owners to pay them to "monitor and protect" their cars. When a guy doesn't do it, he quietly ruins his car. The robbery and robbery at the Greek-American store are also shown rather graphically: his skull fractures when pushed. <br /> <br /> The boys are gathered and brought before the severe but decent judge Arthur Byron, who realizes he cannot leave the children with their parents: the parents are unable to observe them or are incompetent. Unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a Jewish father who is more interested in his business than his son, the stereotype of Farina "Yassum" father and an Italian father whose willingness to collaborate brings his son out of school reform. <br /> <br /> Once there the boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally one of the guards or nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak for them. But Digges has no time to cuddle. His regime is determined to break the boys so they behave alone. Unfortunately, Digges and his accountant are greedy. They served food inferior to the boys and pocketed the profit. <br /> <br /> One day a new officer comes from the state to look at the reform school. It is Jimmy Cagney, who is a heck ward heeler whose band got the vote for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he failed to get the job of the Park Commissioner) Cagney was appointed as a school inspector. He is supported by his chained friend and his factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother film). <br /> <br /> The irony is that if Digges were a little more careful, Cagney would probably have allowed him to continue to manage things. But Cagney arrives to see Darro brought to Digges to fight. The Warden and Darrow have had problems of respect before, and now Digges intends to punish Darro who escapes, but seriously injures himself from the barbed wire fences of Digges and his free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans treat Darro's wounds. And he explains the reality of the situation to Cagney, and his idea of ​​the real reform of the boys' reform by reinforcing trust in them with responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film follows him to the end, showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right track, turning the reformatory into a "republic" for the boys to function properly. This leads to the conflict with Digges, whose profit is reduced because it no longer receives supplies. But the scheme is derailed when Cagney himself discovers that he may be in serious trouble with the law. Digges sees his opportunity and fully accepts it. But then it goes too far ... much more than it ever took. <br /> <br /> The 1930s have many films that show children working to correct wrongs and change things. Darro appeared in WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did THIS DAY AND THE AGE, where the children teach a lesson to a gangster played by Charles Bickford who scares him to death. So it went in the 1930s. THE MAYOR OF HELL reaches a similar intensity of revenge and search for juvenile justice. But this is the only problem with the film. Digges' character is a rascal and a hypocrite, so we never encourage him, but if he wasn't a thief we could follow his point of view (even if it's counterproductive). The scenes at the beginning of Darro and his band that prey on people actually make the hardness that Digges would follow seem quite understandable (even if his ways of thief are not). He also has a moment where he is rightly angry with Cagney - at which point he hides himself from his own confrontation with the law - giving orders for a phone from a long distance to a confused Digges. When Digges finds out what really happened, he is rightly furious when Cagney tells him about the correct behavior. It's the closest thing to making Mr. Thompson sympathetic in this beautiful movie.
