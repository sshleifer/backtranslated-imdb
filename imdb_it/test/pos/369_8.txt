I was fortunate that this film came to TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's pretty hard to find, despite being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its flaws, some of which Hitchcock repeated later. First of all, the finish is a little too clean and "perfect". In the last scenes, up to the last five minutes, there is a huge amount of tension; then, the five minutes make everything perfectly clear ... very unsatisfactory. The ending is too dramatic for a Hitchcock film. He is, was and always will be the master of suspense ... why would he have lowered himself to something as low as an economic action sequence for the finale? Apart from the few imperfections, the film is fantastic. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal of all time. The theme? Simple. Meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know you have someone you want (at least, unconsciously) dead. The socket? He asks you to do the same for him ... would you accept this bizarre but ingenious arrangement? You are not suspicious, and so is he ... after all, neither of them knew the victim. And you don't know yourself, or ... you're just "a stranger on a train". A brilliant concept, which can affect virtually every single person. The pace is good, you never lose interest or patience. Cinematography is good, but not as good as in other top Hitchcock movies. The acting is impeccable. The characters are well written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements he often uses; the dominant mother, the mothers' boy, etc. The film is very good, but it just seems a little watered down. Did not go that famous extra mile that would have made it great. He stopped before he crossed the line between what is common and what is audacious. This is the main reason why the film fails to be great, but remains mainly good, with the potential to be more than that. The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed. However, everything that leads to the end is very good, so the film still gets a worthy 8/10. Good, but not exceptional. Any Hitchcock fan should see it, because it's among his best ... a little at the bottom of the list, but it's still there. I recommend it to all Hitchcock fans. 8/10
