One thing that came to mind when watching this film is that it was fun / exciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going against the budget constraint with enthusiasm and dedication because apparently they liked the people involved. <br /> <br /> I like B movies that are original and have a heart, and I think it's one of those jobs. It seems to me that the actors are putting their heart into it more than usual, perhaps because of good direction by the actress / director, and evidently they were clear enough in their parts of the story to create a coherent and watchable work of art. <br /> <br /> The criticisms of this film that more or less say, "because we don't rent only a hardcore porn movie", underline why they didn't like the movie. Going into this movie hoping for a lot of T & A without patience for the plot material is why it's so nice to them. It could be said that the film is more romantic than a softcore porn movie, although I believe the star has done its part of soft porn. I think she graduated. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing, dialogue is not a big part of the film, like in a Tarentino film, but the plot is decent and the turns are original and sometimes funny. In particular, the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure, with the villianess / heroine and the "protagonist" learning from their complex network of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer has obtained a contract with 3 films. Hats off for trying a few tens of thousands of dollars, if you have a certain artistic sensitivity and pride you can go very far. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and the other girls with nudity scenes were nice together with being hot, not just bimbos with empty heads, so like a piece of erotic fantasy science with some stunning naked art, even with limits of the B-movie land, not disappointing.
