The story of The Milkwoman is a simple unrequited love that, despite the passing of the decades, still remains strong. Now 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works twice ?? one as a salesman in a supermarket, the other as a housewife, making his daily tour in the Nagasaki hills. One of his stops is at the home of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who tends his terminally ill wife Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita saw themselves as schoolboys, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who appears to have a relationship together, their relationship was destroyed. Finding herself in her sick bed, Yoko knows that her husband's feelings for the girl are not completely gone and, for Kaita's sake after his death, he tries to design a way to put them back together. <br /> <While the story could be simple, the emotions it faces and the way it expresses them are right where the heart and beauty of the film are. The film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, whose actions are recorded by an elderly lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her husband who shows signs of dementia. In the process he describes the social circumstances of people coming from different ways of life, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships are formed and how the past and the present can collide. The director handles it wonderfully with a strong structure and a visual style. It is only later in the film that history begins to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it were actually built to adapt to the narrative structure of the book being written. It is all validated by the emotional depths that the film touches, represented more effectively in the exceptional execution of Yuko Tanaka.
