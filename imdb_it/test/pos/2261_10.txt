If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely fun. As teenagers who wear gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to joke about airbags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this film really captures pieces from Ukraine that you would never know if I didn't go there. I spent most of the film nodding my head and thinking, "Yes, it's really true." It's very funny if you also understand Russian because subtitles don't always do justice. The actors are so believable and Elijah Wood does a great job playing a socially inept Jewish boy. My favorite character is certainly Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the grandfather's "sighting dog" who is really a psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and funny that they believe they are real people.
