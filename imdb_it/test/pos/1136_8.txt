When I first heard of "Greek", I thought I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. Another one of ABC Family's bad shows that are almost good. But tuning into a college friend made us both appreciate the pilot episode a lot more than we expected. <br /> <br /> As a member of a Greek society, I can say that many of the stereotypes that are here are reported that occur almost every time someone starts talking about sisters and fraternities on a campus. And they are also very fun to play with just themselves, let alone watch on a TV screen. The opening scene welcomed a slightly dramatized version of preparation for a real official rush in some sisterhoods and continued from there. <br /> <br /> This is not a show for the sensitive Greeks. If you also feel offended at jokes about things that are not so great for Greek life, then you'll spend the entire first episode, and probably many others, screaming and shouting. But everyone else should have a lot of fun watching it. It's nothing new, but when it comes to college, it never is.
