I would just like to emphasize (in addition to the request to publish the series on DVD) that a show does not have to be realistic to be fun. These days, with all the blood and blood in criminal news and dramas, in reality shows, etc. It's nice to get lost in a good and fun show with funny characters. PWOG adapts to the account. Was it an Emmy material? No, but it was fantastic all the same. <br /> <br /> I also have to put a vote for the second cast: they were more charismatic than the cast of the first season. I totally agree that the first season had a more serious tone than the second one, but I was certainly more absorbed by the latter's cast. Even if the series has not been on the air for years, I will never stop hoping that it will be released for purchase.
