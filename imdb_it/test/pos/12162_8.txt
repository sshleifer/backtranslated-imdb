The Frozen Limits is a big screen for artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British entertainers formed in the early 1930s. Overall the six men in the group were Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Extremely popular in the halls of the variety, the group was also a real treasure of the royal family. The plot here sees them as the troupe of the Wonder Boys who set off in search of their fortunes in Alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. The only problem is that when they finally arrive at Red Gulch it turns out that I'm 40 years late! <br /> <br /> I often complain when I see the phrase "it's very British" because it implies that those not the British islands could struggle to get it. The reason it bothers me is that in this age of www / internet I have collected a series of non-British non-film friends who have been known to break their parts to the best of Ealing, Will Hay and the imperious Terry-Thomas. So, is it true that something like The Frozen Limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non-British audience? Well yes it is true, so here it is topically English, but in reality it must be said that the classic cinema fan is quite an expert in history, and when all is said and done visual joy is universal here. With the anarchist "not" so wild west he makes an absolute winner. A winner who has every chance of being more appreciated by an American audience now than the British public will be. Not all the comedies work, and in truth the "big 6" are beaten big by a film that steals Moore Marriott. But here there are skits and parodies that deserve respect and a nod of approval from the most illustrious comedies. It is unlikely that you almost fall out of the chair like I did because of an Ovaltine gag, but what if you are a fan of the classic comedy movie? I am sure that, at worst, you will understand that there are very talented people at work. <br /> <br /> Now, then, do the Dontties always get their man? 8/10
