Based on the true story of Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn), and their involvement in selling US secret government documents to the Soviets during the 1970s. Boyce works for the government, and his job is to keep these particular documents, which ultimately disillusion him for the affairs and practices of his country. Then he enlists his friend the drug dealer, Daulton Lee, who has become a wanted man, to be the courier of these sensitive documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian Embassy in Mexico and makes contact with Alex (Suchet), and both start playing the spy game. <br /> <br /> Lee's interest is purely about money while Boyce is behaving in anger towards the system in which he is involved. Alex believes that Lee is the man in the US government. Things start to get serious when Lee's drug addiction and reckless behavior in managing the courier's position make up for both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial espionage game becomes more lethal and consequential for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is a real spy thriller without reckless action. The character's motives and the analysis of real-life subjects are comprehensive but well-written, and the film intelligently intertwines real-life events with underlying political themes on human predatory behavior. Where a larger nation uses its political power to control smaller nations. Well directed, and intense in the parts, especially where the protagonists become immensely over their heads in the espionage game. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give incredibly compelling performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system. The drama of the protagonists becomes the basic message within "The falcon and the snowman", and makes it an intelligent political thriller with a touching element on society, human relations and the American system. Great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 on *****!
