This probably fits into my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I wasn't a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was very different! He made fun of Robin Hood and it was HILARIOUS! I was extremely happy with how it was put together, and how well it was played! In addition to Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I particularly love the song; "We are men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor, you will love this movie!
