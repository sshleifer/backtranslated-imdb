This was an interesting study on the sexuality of society, as well as on the "dark interests" of man. <br /> <br /> Although I can't say that his wife was a strong character, it was the wrong choice for the part, in my opinion - she was a rich girl looking to escape her life of drooling. She was indeed a rebel and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). It is obvious that he married her for her money and to cover her sexual desires, which is a taboo. Rickman played his part in a t-shirt, his flirtations with the young man and very subtle subtitles of gayness. The young man was gay all the way! When he did the imitation of Marilyn he should have told his wife everything. He too was perfectly cast. He wrote hustler all about him. <br /> <br /> I wasn't crazy about the finale, because I knew what would happen. Overall, though, Rickman's acting was great, Reedus was good, Walker went well but I had doubts. For a gay-themed movie, it was average, but not brash at least. It's worth seeing if you don't have "Truly Madly Deeply" around for a ride.
