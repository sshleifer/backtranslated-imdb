Bruno wants to kill his father, but he doesn't want to do it alone. <br /> <br /> Bruno proposes that it has to do with Guy's wife, while Guy's business is to eliminate Bruno's father. Guy rejects this idea since he is not interested in getting his wife killed. <br /> <br /> Bruno carries out his half of the proposal. While Guy becomes the first suspect in the murder of his wife. While law enforcement officers continue to investigate Guy, Bruno continues to torment Guy, asking him to complete the other half of the proposal. <br /> <br /> 'Strangers on a Train' has one of the most exciting endings of all Hitchcock movies.
