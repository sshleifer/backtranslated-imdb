Not knowing much about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, I can only consider it a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded by BBC2 earlier this year), but once it started I had to watch until the end. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it is actually a court drama - never my favorite genre - but it is extraordinarily photographed (mostly in super-saturated oceans) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the while, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do justice to music and photography. What happened to her release in theaters? I've been a fan of Chiwetel Ejiofor ever since I saw him in Dirty Pretty Things, and Hilary Swank looks fantastic - very feminine and sexy for a change (maybe out of place, but adds to the film's visual appeal). <br /> <br /> This photo deserves a wider audience than it seems to get.
