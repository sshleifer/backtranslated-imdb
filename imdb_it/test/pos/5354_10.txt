There are some aspects of Park's films, especially Wallace and Gromit, which I would say make them so fantastic. The first is subtlety and observation, whose flagship is the character of Gromit. He does not speak, he does not make noise, he has only the eyes, the forehead and the posture of the body, and with these he commands the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. Comedy and emotion are transmitted through subtler movements and work superbly. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie you need to be aware of the entire screen. Normally you will be guided to things in movies, the screen will not be too bulky, there will not be many things to take your eyes off the main clue or the action. Park seems to need to look the other way with his films. Throw extra content to your audience, there's action in the background, on the side of the screen, even off screen, and there's always something in the foreground to get your attention. His films speak of multiple visions and discoveries, are layered with jokes and auxiliary actions. <br /> <br /> In this film there are layers of things that happen on the screen, jokes in the foreground perhaps on a label and on a background of shadowy vases that give away the action. You can imagine that for Park the film has always been an event, and that the movies he loves are the ones he wants to see again and again. This is what he shows in his films, and through his most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Then there are the bizarre and extravagant inventions that Wallace makes, something that is reflected in the plot and meanders of the plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world. You can imagine that inside Park is the mind of Wallace. <br /> <br /> There is also another thing that makes these films so unique, and this is the precise modeling and animation of the hand. I must admit that I was worried when I learned that Dreamworks was involved in the making of this film, and I thought they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. What I was afraid of was that Wallace & Gromit became CGI entities, or at the smallest, CGI used to clean up the feeling that the modeling had made to the film. <br /> <br /> Not so. You can still see the fingerprints and tool marks on the characters, and far from distracting from the movie, this only adds a real feeling and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on the screen. <br /> <br /> So what about the movie? I must say that the twist was something I had thought long before the film was in the cinema and it wasn't a surprise, but that didn't affect my fun a bit. Actually, the turning point opened up and the comic moment of discovery and reactions was everything, and it made me suck it like a thriller, yet all the time I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie the film was fascinating in various ways. To see the animation completed, how wild are the inventions, how Wallace is going to get in trouble and Gromit take it out, where all the cross-references are in the movie, and where are all the jokes! I must admit that after talking to my friends I could not believe how much I had lost. <br /> <br /> There is something different about this film than the others, there is a new level of adult humor here, and I do not mean rude jokes (although there are a couple that are so English that you can't help but laugh), I mean jokes that simply fly over children's heads but slap adults in the face. The type you're used to seeing comes from somewhere like Pixar. This adds even more charm to the film. <br /> <br /> Okay, let me try to be a little negative here. I didn't notice the voices in this movie, you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was too busy with the movie to worry or to notice who they were ... ok, it's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and compelling as I expected, and I found myself caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves ... again ... not a bad thing, the film was so richly rich entertainment. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst thing I could say is that the title sequence at the end is pretty repetitive ... until the final title ! Really, this is the worst I can say. <br /> <br /> The plot is very funny, well set, well written, well executed. There are many fantastic characters here, not just Wallace and Gromit. So much happens on the screen, lots of references and jokes (look at Lady Tottingham's clothes), jokes of cheese everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are superbly absorbed and you will find that you took them before you knew it. There is so much in this film for everyone. <br /> <br /> There is so much I can say and write, but I know it will soon turn into a backward exercise for Park and Aardman, it would also turn into a series of "this piece was really fun" and "there is a little when ...", and what I would prefer is to tell you that this is a superb film, go see it and experience everything for yourself. But I will say that bunnies are excellent!
