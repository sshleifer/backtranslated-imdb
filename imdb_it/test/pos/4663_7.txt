**Warning! Slight spoiler on the plot in advance! ** <br /> <br /> "Italian work" is not the best film you will see throughout the year, or probably this summer. But it is worth two hours because it is colored within the lines, knowing its limits and not trying to overcome them. <br /> <br /> What brings the film is the cast work. In a film about a group of thieves, individuals must have a good relationship with one another. Without that touch of cohesion, the public does not believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the film never has a chance. But from the first scenes, in which men joke and rub each other while infiltrating a Venetian palace, the right chemistry is in place. The characters themselves are nothing new; they are your gang of basic criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and decisive competence. But every actor brings the right products to the table for their part. Mark Wahlberg's sober recitation and humor fit perfectly into his mind planner. Edward Norton offers aptitude and turns the mustache well in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the paternal figure of the crew, and looks like the sweet and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally spry. Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def don't do much beyond their character's abilities, but each of them cancels those parts. Statham as the regular operating driver; Green as the technology geek wizard with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the demolition man. Charlize Theron slips well into a part that doesn't ask too much about her. She is mainly asked to drive fast and look good. That she does. None of the characters is so deep or three-dimensional, but in this kind of familiar movie, two dimensions are all that is required. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the film has a European touch to "The Bourne Identity", partly because it was shot on location in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Also the contribution to the euro is the rhythmic and bouncy music, which adds to the cheerful nature of the film and completes the relationship of the cast. Even the look of the film is perfect. The bright colors of all the rooms improve the atmosphere and increase the attitude. The Minis not only provide a fun variation in pursuit of the machine, but also work as a necessary plot device. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less direct. There are some surprises, but it is more like the variety of fast and smooth tack, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin bend. Even with those, the film accelerates. Once the first act has laid the groundwork, everything progresses continuously. Fortunately, there are no pauses in the action for a love story, something that the film has wisely avoided. There are not even pauses for "real life". History has its purpose and runs that course without distractions. The lack of depth of the character prevents "The Italian Job" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of robbery planning, such superfluity would have dragged the rhythm and quality of the film. <br /> <br /> There are a number of implausibility that I thought of both during and after watching. But the movie is so nice that I didn't do it and I don't care. In the real world, most of the film probably couldn't have gone so clearly. But "Italian work" does not take place in the real world. It occurs in an elegant criminal world with a light heart that appeals to the rebel in all of us. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is a film, in the true sense of the word. It has no Oscar claims and does not contain a profound moral message. It provides pure escapist entertainment and does it quite well. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Perhaps the best popcorn film of the year so far. 7 of 10.
