It is clear from the initial blow of the conveyor belt in the bank that this would have been a great film. <br /> <br /> A minimalist touch to feel with a touch of retro this film oozes style - the brilliant camera - work, acting, screenplay and the way the protagonist's secret life is completed complement each other as much as possible make the best Italian film I've ever seen (up there with La Stanza Del Figlio - even if it's different). <br /> <br /> Too bad for the people sitting behind me who made it clear that they couldn't see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously made by the camera. Not to be missed
