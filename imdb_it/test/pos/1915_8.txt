What a journey into memory. <br /> <br /> Don't look for acting, credible plot lines or something that looks like a quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is pure blaxploitation at its best. Extravagant clothes, unrepeatable dialogues, objectification of women and the most appetizing cops imaginable. <br /> <br /> This piece of vanity from the "Godfather of Rap", Rudy Ray Moore, who left us last week forever, is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured. <br /> <br /> Not only do you see blaxploitation in the best way, but you can see his comedy genius, and find out why his records have been kept under control.
