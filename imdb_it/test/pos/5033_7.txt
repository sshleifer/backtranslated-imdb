Continuing his return, John Travolta played a slightly twisted angel in "Michael". He may be a messenger of God, but he is not the nicest guy, as journalists Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I saw this movie for the first time, it was before I started watching "All in the Family", so I didn't recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her in this way, I try to imagine Archie who popped her for hosting an angel (who probably would have classified alongside blacks, Jews, etc.). I know, it's not like the movie. But I like associating things this way. However, it is a rather interesting film. Also played by Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
