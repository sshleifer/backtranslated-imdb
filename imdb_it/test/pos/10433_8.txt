Many comedy films for teenagers come and go without too many fans, however, sometimes a film can get to be honest, fun, fun and memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special film that has found its place and has stood the test of time by mixing all four ingredients. This film follows three mishaps (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") in the world of sex and true love for the first time. Along the way they learn difficult lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow the desperate romantic Gary (the main character) in his quest to conquer the girl of his dreams who leads him on an uncertain road with a surprise touch to his finale. If you weren't lucky enough to watch this movie, take a look ... with so many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things at a steady pace. L.A.V. it's really an original film, a rarity among movies of its kind.
