I saw this on Sky TV late at night, as I'm a Vampire fan. I have to admit that I almost expected it to be a B-Movie disaster, but I was pleasantly wrong. <br /> <br /> Subspecies speaks of a family of Vampires. When a Vampire Lord dies, his two sons, the beautiful and Noble Stefan, and his brother, the Evil, horrible Radu, start a war with one another for their birthright, the Bloodstone. The bloodstone is a holy grail for Vampires and the blood of the saints bleeds, giving the vampire who drinks it a supreme High. <br /> <br /> The fight for Bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students show up in the Brothers territory during a school trip and Stefan must protect them from his Lusts brothers. <br /> <br /> As I said, I went to this film I didn't expect much, but it was one of the best low budget movies I've ever seen. The sets and locations (Romania I think, for some time I've seen it) are very nice and the soundtrack does justice to the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was adequate, but its Anders Hove as the evil radu that steals the film (and all subsequent Sequels). The performance of Hove as the twisted Vamp is truly breathtaking and gives the film simply from okay, to bella d @ mn good!
