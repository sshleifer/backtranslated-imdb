The sad thing about Frontline is that once you've watched three or four episodes, you really start to understand that it's not very far from what happens in real life. The really sad thing is that it also makes it extremely fun. <br /> <br /> The Frontline series 1 team is made up of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who lives and dies simply because of the ratings he has received from his show. Occasionally his stunts to get these ratings see him meet his Line Producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost all her journalistic integrity and is ready to defend moral scruples on occasions. The same cannot be said of the journalist Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - a reporter who had all the substance sucked into her - so much that when interviewing Ben Elton she needs to be instructed to laugh. His reports usually consist of interviews with celebrities (with whom he has or has not "crossed over" previous relationships) or outrageous unethical relationships that usually backfire. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is the reporter with whom the team relies on gravity and dignity, since it has 21 years of journalism behind it. His has no principles as much as the nous of what makes a good journalistic story, even if it draws an occasional line. Challenging this chaos (by name) is Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) a selfish and naive reporter who can't see that it's just a pretty face for dirty journalism. He often finds his moral compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and lets his stupidity do the rest. <br /> <br /> Frontline is the kind of show you need most, because it shows that while in modern times happiness, security and deep political intuition are interesting things; it is much easier to assess the scandalous, fearful and scandalous celebrities.
