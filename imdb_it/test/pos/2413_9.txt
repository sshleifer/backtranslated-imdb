For once a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did a great job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi, worked with Julie completely differently from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie preferred karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most grumpy person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete with. And there will also be humor in this film. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her and saw her change clothes in the process. It was very funny! Even the classic "Wax on, Wax off" scene was different. It was fun when Miyagi tells Julie "Uh-oh, missed post". The Boston set was far from California. The Militant group in that group was like the "Cobra Kai" in Boston. And Colonel Dugan of Michael Ironside was not John Kreese. His group practically abandoned him when Julie kicked a serious kick. They all paid the price when they blew that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they will find redemption from Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid sets some moral principles, unlike the last three, who spoke of "Honor" and "Respect". Hilary Swank is exceptionally hot in every movie and every thing else she does. Film 9, Hilary Swank 10!
