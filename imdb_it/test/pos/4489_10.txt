This is one of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, in which in the simplest situations the spectator was involved in an apparently symbolic conflict, only to find the surprising and strangely acceptable solution. Five figures are inside a container / prison: a major, a dancer, a bagpiper, a clown and a tramp. They are certainly a strange choice of types to be in this isolation room, but they are all (anyway) and are trying to understand why they are there. What do they have in common? No one can understand it. But little by little the major organizes them to work to bet on the shoulders of others. And the major, going to the top of the row of figures, reaches the entrance, and ... I'll leave it this way, even if one of the other reviews on this thread actually gives the story away. <br /> <br /> The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, Pirandello's famous work. If the real purpose of the show was to spoof that game it is questionable: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and their relationships. But the five characters here, while trying to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of Pirandello's six characters who know their current situations. This uncertainty of what is happening allows viewers to think that it is an abstract drama. <br /> <br /> The actors, William Windon in the role of the major and Murray Mattheson in the role of Clown in particular, give good stories of themselves. And the conclusion, whether programmed as a parody or not, is quite effective.
