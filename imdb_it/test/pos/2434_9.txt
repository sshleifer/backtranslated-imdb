Sacchi is the best Bogart imitator ever ... dry and funny like Sam Marlowe. The music of award-winning composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] are just fine as the famous director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco The Avengers] leads the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a parody of each obscure detective film made. See this if you loved all the old serious gestures and you have a sense of humor ... this is a hoot.
