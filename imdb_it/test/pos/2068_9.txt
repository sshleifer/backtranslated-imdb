Incredible, incredible, incredible. What else can you say? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to embellish the stage and capture every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is represented and represented well. Some people have complained about his age, but honestly you can't tell when watching the movie. If anything, it looks drastically younger than 40 years. I only hope that a more worthy Ofelia may have been found. His acting is passable but does not seem the part. The only truly exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudio. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is what really elevates this teleplay.
