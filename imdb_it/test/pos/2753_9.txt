The show is FANTASTIC. There are no words to describe it. Wonderful music Incredible dance. The editors could not ruin it, not because they were not * that * ugly *, but because the show is really * the * good * one. <br /> <br /> Publishers are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without cut for more than 15 seconds. It's ok to show different angles, but those guys worked with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they'll remember how many cameras they have on average every five seconds ... They can film the start of a jump with a camera, then cut it in half and show the rest in another angle. <br /> <br /> No matter how much they tried, they couldn't ruin that wonderful show. It is a must for lovers of dance and music.
