This film is about a teenager who is struggling with his social status at school. He is a "good Christian" and feels that all the fun in high school is being lost. So he wants it never to become one. After getting his wish and experiencing a mundane lifestyle, he realizes that his quality of life has been drastically reduced and he wants to be the person he once was. A good movie for families with a positive message to be proud of who you are even if you are not the most popular.
