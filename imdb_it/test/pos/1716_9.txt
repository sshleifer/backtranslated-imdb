Russell T Davies was given the task of recreating a slice of my childhood: hiding behind the couch, watching scary monsters fight with Dr Who. He and his crew are clearly all true devotees of the original series. <br /> <br /> In much the same way that Star Trek films used their budget to make the original concept of Gene Rodenberry much more believable, Russell T Davies has both the money and the advantages of the excellent CGI to create the best monsters ever.
