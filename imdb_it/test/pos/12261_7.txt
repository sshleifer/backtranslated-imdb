As a Golden Globe nominated producer / screenwriter / director James L. Brooks (Terms of Tenderness, As Good) this is a good satirical comic film that shows behind the scenes in the life of a journalist / anchor / journalist or producer being like. Basically Jane Craig (nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe Holly Hunter) falls in love with the new reporter Tom Grunick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominee William Hurt), but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar nominated Albert Brooks) also feeds strong feelings for her. The network is preparing for big changes and the sparks will fly with all the members of the studio. He also played Jack Nicholson as anchor Bill Rorich, Lois Chiles of Moonraker as Jennifer Mack, Robert Prosin of Mrs. Doubtfire as Ernie Merriman, Joan Cusack of School of Rock as Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson as Bobby, Robert Katims like Martin Klein, Ed Wheeler as George Wein and Stephen Mendillo as Gerald Grunick. The comedy is subtle but strong, the love story has its moments, and it is certainly a film of credible situation. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Direct Screenplay and Best Film, and was named Golden Globe for Best Film - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay - Film. It was the number 64 over 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
