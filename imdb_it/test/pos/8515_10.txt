Basic information - The films Octopussy and Never Say Never Again were both made in the same year of 1983, so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. Connery. Bond vs. Bond. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people claim that the "official film" Octopussy is far superior. Well, I just saw Octopussy. Bond is riding an airplane 100 miles an hour (impossible --- the wind would blow him away), using his feet to force the plane to land, and then jumping down about 60 miles an hour (still impossible - - try jumping out of your car --- you'll find yourself with a shattered body). How should the octopussy scene be "good" in every sense? Suddenly Bond has a superhuman strength and a titanium body. And do you do all these stunts at the age of 56? Complete shit. Unbelievable. Farse. <br /> <br /> ---> Now we contrast the previous scene with Connery's "unofficial" Never say never again: he doesn't have the same polish because of his independent film status (less money), but at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in danger. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Bond showing his age (he is 50) and is sent for recovery. Completely credible. But of course, there is no "day off" for a world-famous spy, and Bond soon finds himself a target, even within the hospital. From that moment the story unfolds in another adventure, with Bond trying to locate his attempted assassins and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons. As usual Sean Connery has done a brilliant job and avoids the over-the-moment / incredible stunts. This film looks like the natural successor to Connery's latest film, the 1971 Diamonds Are Forever movie ... the old Bond style ... before the franchise became silly. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
