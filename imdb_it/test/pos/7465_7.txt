This film starts a little slow, but quickly takes over the comic effects. Each of the three "teenage girls" offers their own credible, distinct, assertive and amusing personalities. I particularly appreciated the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If you looked beyond the superficial "action" that was taking place, Keith's character treated Lisa's "defloration" with tenderness and consideration. The comic development that followed was also expertly accepted in my opinion. David Boreanaz offers a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets in trouble more than he can bear. The dialogue was strong, fast and flowed well. The director and screenwriter of this film clearly showed that none of the main characters could claim moral superiority after all the cheating they did. Although the film appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming adults, emotions and human desires.
