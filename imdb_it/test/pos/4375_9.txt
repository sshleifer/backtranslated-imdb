Mr. Carlin left our common forum in June 2008, shortly after he went to the hospital for chest pains (he had a history of heart problems). The media and comics from around the world covered the loss more than he or she ever expected ... but it was the grandfather of the observational comedy. <br /> <br /> THIS recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the theme of death and the prospects of life from then on. The project took place shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to have achieved (observed?). I have been following Carlin's career since the days of fuzzy television in black and white and I enjoyed his current albums. <br /> <br /> It is a privilege for ANY Carlin fans to at least see (if not own a copy) of this particular show. He was still in rapid motion, and with great timing, even at 70! As he would say, "He is NOT" smiling from Heaven on you. "If he is doing something, he is not taking harp lessons; perhaps he is looking up !!!
