I was chosen as the Surfer Dude in beach scenes. I almost became the muscular technician, since the real muscular guy was really very late that day. Pauly made me and my brother (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo site) do some scenes from VJ, taken live from Venice, since he was still doing his thing on MTV. This movie is really good. Would have become my top 100 if I weren't there ........?
