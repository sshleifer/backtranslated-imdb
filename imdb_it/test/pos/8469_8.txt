It was in a day of 1891, when the Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his remarkable work in film development. After many experiments, Dickson is now able to capture scenes from real life with his camera and reproduce them through his invention, the Kinetoscope, as if a fragment of time were kept in celluloid. Soon, Dickson's Kinetoscope would become a huge success as a new way of entertainment, with many people eager to pay for the nickel that was charged to watch people dancing, or acrobats who performed stunts through the Kinetoscope peepshow . However, the invention was not complete, in order to capture real life as we know it on the film, sound was needed in the movies. So Dickson continued to experiment and this brief experiment, the first Kinetophone film, was the result. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, code-named simply as "Dickson Experimental Sound Film", the director William K.L. Dickson is faced with a recording cone for a wax cylinder (the first sound recording method), with the violin in his hand, while playing a song called "Song of the Cabin Boy". The idea was to record the song in the cylinder at the same time as the camera recorded its movements. To prove that it was a movie, two of Edison's "Black Maria" labs decided to dance a little in front of the camera. Unlike what Vito Russo wrote in his book, "The Celluloid Closet", this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it is obviously a reference to the environment of the solitude of the laboratory, similar to the solitary sailors at which the "Song" of the Cabin Boy "was dedicated to (the Russian title suggests," The Gay Brothers ", is anachronistic as" gay "had no homosexual connotation in the late 90s.) Unfortunately, Dickson he was not able to get the desired effect, and the Kinetophone never really managed to produce the audio synchronized with the images.While he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images, the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumière's Cinématographe prompted Edison's team to focus on projection systems and eventually Dickson left the company. Fortunately, in 1998, the Ci Dickson's cylinder with the sound of the film was rebuilt and editor Walter Murch performed a restoration of the experiment as expected. Finally, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with a synchronized sound, just as he had intended his creative inventor. Although it was not a successful attempt, this exceptional film is a testament to the enormous genius of Kinetoscope's father. 8/10
