Yes, I am a genre romantic who likes musicals and comedy and this is in line with the law! Julie Andrews offers a fascinating performance at the beginning and end of this film with the production number "Whistling in the Dark". The sedative-outrageous number he plays in the middle of the story when he believes that Rock Hudson saw a dancer / girl call is amazing and will surely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> I just wish this movie could be found on video or DVD as I would definitely buy it in a flash for my home library!
