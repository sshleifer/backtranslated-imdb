Van Damme has made some great films over the years and this has hit a dozen in my books. From the Mexican setting to the five-star fighting scenes, this film was fantastic. The film is about border patrols that protect the territory that is the border of Mexico. Former naval seals are smuggling drugs from Mexico to the United States of America (USA), Van Damme and Scott Atkins offer stunning shows like the cop and the bad guy. Although this film was not as good as it was until his death, it still gave the action, the acting and the film a five-star look. I always look forward to these B-level action films and continue to improve. Keep having them come to Damme. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you enjoyed films like - Until death, The hard body and the second in command.
