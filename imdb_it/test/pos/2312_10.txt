I've lost count of the times I've seen this movie, but I like it and find it very funny every time I see it. The facial expressions, the slapstick humor and the timing of the beats make it exceptional. The characters, in particular "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are hilarious. I thought that Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this film was chosen for the first time. I think it should be released on DVD before wearing my VHS version.
