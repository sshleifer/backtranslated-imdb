I loved this movie from beginning to end. I am a musician and I let the drugs interfere with my things that I loved (skateboarding, drawing) but my friends were always there for me. Music was like my rehabilitation, life support, and my drug. It changed my life. I can totally relate to this film and I wish there was more I could say. This film has left me speechless to tell the truth. I saw it on the Ifc channel. I usually hate having the satellite but this was an advantage of having the satellite. The ifc channel shows some really fantastic films and without it I would never have found this film. I mean the obvious language barrier lets you believe that this is what they are saying, but it's not a big deal I think. I have hardly ever seen this film INCREDIBLE. I stood up instead of going to bed ... well earlier than usual. I hope you enjoy the hell out of this movement and I love this movie just like I did. I wish I could type it all in capital letters but it's the rules again I think this is a scream, but it would really show my excitement for the film. I Give It Three Thumbs Way Up! <br /> <br /> This movie has been swept away!
