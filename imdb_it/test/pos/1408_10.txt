William Haines reveals this story of a cheeky cadet who thinks that West Point will really be something now that he has arrived. Haines' extraordinary comedic performance was his trademark - one that made him one of the best box office films from 1928 to 1932 and one of MGM's greatest actors. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are also doing well. And although this plot may seem trivial now, this has been a great success, putting Haines and Crawford in a history of university football (a national craze during the 1920s). After Haines breaks his big mouth once too often and is almost avoided by his fellow cadets, he turns into a wonderful performance as he swallows his pride and enters the big game against the Navy. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the Army and resumes his post at West Point. It's easy to see from this film and Show People (with the underestimated Marion Davies) because Billy Haines was a big star of the time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
