Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not make the main characters sentimentalized. David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a deeply in love couple struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and must also do to survive a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Tennant, like Alan, brings humor and a dangerous lust, like an engineer recovering from a memory loss caused by a car accident. Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim, but as a human being with feelings that do the best he can to make sense of his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a stationary housewife, who will do everything to support her husband. Fight with Alan's falling in love, for the man she once was new and loved is now a completely different person - alien to her. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some opinion, this - in my opinion - makes perfect night vision on Sunday. Too often, we are shown family dramas or detective series, such as heartbeat, that rot and rot the brain. The commissioners of the program seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep. A more stimulating and stimulating drama like recovery would seriously change the situation.
