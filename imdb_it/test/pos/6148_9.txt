An example of a brilliant director. The epic story of three great phases in the life of a boy told with eloquence and fearless crude. Rarely is a film that makes me say out loud during most of the vision, "this is really a good movie ...." again and again. This is exactly what happened when I saw this movie. I really don't understand how someone can't like it. I found myself at times crying and laughing at the same time, unable to control how I felt about the scene. The acting is exceptional. Eric Mabius: why isn't it on all movie screens? It was really extraordinary. His seemingly effortless attempt at the screen struck me in a profoundly visceral manner. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmakers around, and I hope he continues to face the challenges he faces as he tries to give us the art in front of the fierce commercial direction. <br /> <br />
