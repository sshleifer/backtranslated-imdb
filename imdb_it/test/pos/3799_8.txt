I saw this movie on TV late at night from Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm going to die of seeing it again before I ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after the tiger (Eli Wallach) "captures" its prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely amusing. The portrait of a neurotic university dean (?) Or head of department of Charles Nelson Reilly is priceless. How many films can you name that are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in the same struggle regardless of class, race, gender or religion. And who can forget the scene of the owner of a house in the suburbs on his hands and knees that attack those few weeds that dared to appear at night on his perfectly manicured lawn!
