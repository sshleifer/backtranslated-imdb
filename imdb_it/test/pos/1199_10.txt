The anti-war musical "Hair" is my number one cult film. I don't know how many times I've seen this movie in theaters and on VHS, or how many times I've listened to the CD with the wonderful soundtrack, and now, this masterpiece has finally been released on DVD in Brazil. br /> <br /> The pacifist and moving story is still surprising, a hymn of freedom, friendship and freedom of choice, and represents a generation's resistance against the stupidity of war. I don't know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70s and their dreams, since the current world is probably worse than the 70s. I don't remember who won the Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least one nomination for their fantastic performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocritical and spoiled girl. I saw "Hair" probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet while Berger goes on the plane singing "It's me, it's me, it's me", and I start crying with his headstone in the cemetery. I believe this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions in the history of cinema. My wife, my daughter and my son also love this movie; therefore I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended to any public. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
