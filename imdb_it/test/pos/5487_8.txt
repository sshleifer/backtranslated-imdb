When I was working as a person, I remember having a really hateful customer to deal with who insisted on doing everything on a personal basis. I was telling him things that my agency could do and couldn't do and he firmly believed that I was personally out to get him out of what was rightfully his. I swear I was thinking of this boy watching John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of wits. <br /> <br /> In The Line Of Fire he casts Clint Eastwood as a veteran secret service agent who was at work in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was murdered. He always had his doubts and was given a drink and his life at one time was a real disaster. Now he's back on the White House details and when a landlady of a potential rat murderer on his tenant for the secret service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott drawing the case. <br /> <br /> But the killer is not a normal crank. He is a professional in his work, trained and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Tommy Lee Jones that year for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich was better. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Malkovich could have been better, but he saw Eastwood as the responsible agent who broke into his apartment while he was at work and insisted on making it personal. He calls Eastwood for the whole film and taunts him. And after a while, what Malkovich says and sues Clint becomes personal. <br /> <br /> The presidential assassins we have had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless we believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the murders. A boy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imaginary resentment, is the most dangerous type of enemy. <br /> <br /> The others to notice in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as chief of staff of the White House (and being president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls for the male charm of Eastwood, John Mahoney as head of the secret service, Gary Cole as head of the White House secret service, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as President and First Lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is in charge, he owns In The Line Of Fire. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
