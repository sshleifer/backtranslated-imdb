This movie is shaken !!!! I've seen it a couple of weeks ago. It's a strange story, in which James Franco plays this idiot who marries Sienna Miller just to get out of the country and go to Niagara Falls for the honeymoon. I don't want to give it away because the film hasn't been released yet, but it's absolutely fantastic and you would never expect things to happen. I thought I would hate him because it was a love story, but he's also a little twisted and stuff that I really like. The acting is really good and Sienna Miller is completely smoked and plays this really sweet girl. I think she should do more roles like this. James plays an idiot but ends up pleasing him and the end of the film is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and is good at it. I gave this film a 10 because I got out of the movie and really liked it and if I wanted to see it again I didn't expect it and my girlfriend loved it and cried. good shot of date
