This film is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a surprise from Crying Game) and the best soundtrack I've ever heard ... if that makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds practically tell you that you're around for a twisted ride. (I was surprised no one came out right away during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film turns into a talk-fest between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> I am lonely, messed up, and boy talk about sex. Daphne brings her most interesting escort stories to life, some are rather funny (Mr. Chang) a little creepy (the Harlan scenes with music that tell us what we see could be what's happening, or what Daphne feels really), and because I have a friend who used to escort, I might add, most seem real enough. <br /> <br /> You Are Alone is multi-layered and mostly bright. Okay, maybe a couple of minutes less conversation, and I don't know we would have missed something. <br /> <br /> Then again, I need to see it again knowing the ending. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked the people of Brooklyn public to write a review on IMDb because many people read them.
