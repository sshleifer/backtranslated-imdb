It seems to me that many people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on a par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the like. What all these heroes (and in the case of the hero group X-Men) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue suit) chasing vampires because of personal resentment and eventually confronted Dracula himself and was missing a better boring word. So boring, in fact, that the character has been shelved and in fact has never been used in the Marvel universe. At least until it has been reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer made a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a dark knight dressed in leather. He is unable to take all the credit, and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington, who brings out the best in character with his distinct visual style. The character of Blade (Wesley Snipes) is quite surprising in this film and mixes martial arts with the darkness of Batman. Snipes is quite good as a title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is, however, a rather rigid actor in both voice and posture and is only interesting for a film (which is clearly seen in the lower sequels). Kris Kristofferson is also good and brings to life the troubled character of Whistler with energy and sense of time. N'Bushe Wright, however, is quite weak as a protagonist that makes his character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and can do a lot with a minor character. Even the German, Udo Kier, should be mentioned because he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and, I hear, it renews the vampire genre (something that was not done by "From Dusk Till Dawn" by Robert Rodrigues) adding many contemporary elements and maintaining the atmosphere of comics. Saying that the film has a comic look doesn't mean the film is unrealistic. Away from it. A great effort has been made to try to make the film as realistic as possible. Including the effects that are good enough for their time. I found the vampire "dusted" to be a nice touch. Instead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies, Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously make themselves busts that look great. The fact that the overall effects are well done adds to the credibility of the film that otherwise would have fallen to the surface. <br /> <br /> As previously stated, Norrington has a very particular visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade films. Del Toro is almost as good but I prefer the Norrington style. His style gives the film a very special look but above all gives it a cinematic atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere that works perfectly in tune with the main character and the story. Along with the visual style, the music works well and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> All in all Blade is a very funny film that probably should have had an 8 from me, but a few annoying flaws (which can't be revealed without ruining the movie, suffice it to say, many of these are found near the end of the film) makes the film settle into a high 7. <br /> <br /> 7/10
