Almost every commentator mentioned the way in which some of the shooting interviews are superimposed on the concert footage in some places. This is true, and it is the biggest flaw in this film. However, it is not so often, or so badly, that you should not see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you must see this. Apart from having seen Black Sabbath in the 1970s and early 1980s, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also highlighted OZZfest just like in this video. The concert was fantastic and I really enjoyed it, which is why I rented it in the first place. It's just the best geezer-rock out there. Check it out.
