Feisty Dianna Jackson (a captivating performance from the beautiful former Playboy "Playboy" Jeanne Bell) goes to Hong Kong to eliminate the evil heroine ring that killed her brother. Dianna, aided by the sympathetic karate master Joe (amiable Chiquito), faces the opposition of the narcotic agent under cover Elaine (the beautiful and thriving blonde Pat Anderson), and makes fun of Charlie arrogant, ruthlessly ambitious (tested with supremely arrogant aubno by Stan Shaw) while plotting his revenge against the nefarious drug boss Sid (an actually slimy Ken Metcalfe). The director Cirio H. Santiago, working with a shamelessly trash script written by none other than Dick Miller (!), Fills the lively and eventful 72 minutes of execution with a plethora of nudity free of charge and a lot of martial arts fighting scenes badly staged (Bell is clearly doubled by a squat man wearing a giant afro wig!). The unbalanced highlight occurs when a topless bell beats a group of thugs in its hotel room. The crude, grainy, scratched cinematography of Felipe Sacdalan, the clumsy use of the slow movement, the funky-groovin soundtrack, the inept laughter of fight choreography and the surprisingly gruesome conclusion add immensely to the total fun of the stable of this delicious squalid exploitation of fun grindhouse.
