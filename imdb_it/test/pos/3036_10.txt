I will make it short and sweet. Not surprisingly, you didn't need this movie. This is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities inherent in meaningful education. Based on your pathetically compounded comments, I can see that your own education has been sadly neglected ... or worse ... completely wasted. Your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. I would advise you to do something about this condition ... but in your case, I think it's probably too late. My hope is that you yourself do not intend to enter the teaching profession (especially in film studios) because you could only do damage. Oh ... one last tip. In the future, if you intend to write more pieces of opinion, you should really reread your work. It will make people take you more seriously.
