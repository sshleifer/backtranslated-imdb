Bears is a lot like the Dean Koontz novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist. If you've read the book, I suggest you put it as far away as possible from your mind before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Observers are your typical "The boy meets the dog, the dog becomes a super experiment of intelligent government laboratory, dog and boy are hunted by super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monsters created by the same laboratory, and, oh yes, did I mention the shady government agents chasing the monster that chased the dog? "film. <br /> <br /> Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the bad guys in the government, and Sandy the dog is, well, the dog (named Furface here, Einstein in the book) . <br /> <br /> The effects of the monsters are ridiculously malicious, much of the dialogue is ridiculous, the script rarely makes sense or is credible - a good example is the unconditional acceptance of the character of Haim to the intelligence of the dog, as if every Fido from the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it must be the puppy, right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky, as he carries on the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill. Ironside was the highlight of many bad movies, and is no exception. It easily gives the best performance of the film, even if I have to add that the dog (who is a really damn good actor!) Comes into the background. <br /> <br /> All in all, atrociously stupid film, yet. . . Yet I watched it three times in a week. Yet I can't help you please him. Hey, what can I say, I have a taste for garbage - and Michael Ironside (not that I've ever tasted Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against this). But any film that can make me laugh so loud (yes, even involuntarily) cannot be all negative. Chalk to the point of guilty pleasure, a film "yes I know it's insultingly stupid but I like it anyway". <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to evaluate this. On a normal scale I am forced to give him a D-, but on my personal cheese scale, he is expelled up to an A-. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm so strange.
