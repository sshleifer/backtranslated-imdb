After seeing the full version, I thought this movie was made beautifully. It caught my attention from beginning to end; the tension has been wonderfully transmitted. Nasaan Ka Man portrays the typical Filipino family with precision in his presentation of secrets and lies. Even the religious culture, the human tendency to maintain appearances and maintain a pure reputation is shown with crude vividness in the character of Gloria Diaz. There is not a small scene in this film that has no purpose - the cinematography is excellent and the genial writing. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is great, I personally discovered that the turning point in the end, a revelation to make with Jericho's character, was not so much a shock as it should be. But maybe it's just for me, because otherwise, Nasaan Ka Man is a very intelligent film. <br /> <br /> The casting was a good start, but the acting of Deither and Claudine was the icing on the cake. Don't miss it if you're looking for a Filipino film that surprises and exceeds expectations. Congratulations to the director.
