At the beginning of this film, which I found myself looking at in IFC early in the morning, I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped without a way out was so powerful that I didn't know if I wanted to keep watching ... even though it didn't seem like I had much choice, so was the situation. <br/> <br /> Little by little, however, that feeling of discomfort fell (although it never completely disappeared), and I felt attracted by the difficulties of Tessa and Bobby, and I really hoped only to hope that they could return together. <br /> <br /> Actually a moving and powerful story fits perfectly into a small package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with until she examined her curiosity, so now I love her even more. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. ... If you're lucky enough to take it on the Independent Film Channel sometimes, or enough to figure out another way to view it.
