I just saw Eddie Monroe and was very impressed. The story was easily traveled while the plot unraveled in a surprise ending. Shows, action, humor and drama fill the screen. Topnotch played by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film Fred Carpenter has ever made, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on point. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe that this is a low budget independent film. Imagine what Carpenter can do with a budget in Hollywood. Paul Regina's latest film and he is very missed and loved by everyone. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and a great human being. He will look at us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and his spirit. Great job for everyone who participated in this film. Some beloved scene that steals and amusing cameos to break the serious content. You will like this movie, go see it!
