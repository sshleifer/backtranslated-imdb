"Death Wish 3" reports Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey, once vigilante, now retired. Yeah, right. Before Kersey returned to his old ways, but this time, it's not just a couple of robbers at a time, it's a gang that took over a part of the city (again, New York, by the way.) this time its war, so Kersy Hauls eliminated the big cannons (literally) for this. The body counts in its only rival Stallone or Schwarzenegger this film is actually a little fun to watch, especially for some linings and, of course, the bad guys die, or are seriously injured in creative ways, which is always a good thing . Violence is not so personal in this one, his, obviously on a much larger scale, a bit like bombarding your victims from afar rather than one on one. This film is lighter than the first 2, making it easier to watch. There is not much importance for this film, it is more escapism than anything else. It is also a bit of cheese at times and pseudo-inspiring, but the tube scenes fall flat. they should have left the original "Death Desider" alone without sequel, but since they didn't, they should have stopped here. 8/10
