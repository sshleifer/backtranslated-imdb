I really enjoyed this movie! It's my favorite number one. Although there were some flaws (which film has no flaws?), This film was written, directed and produced very well. The characters in this film are very real and credible. They brought all the characters back into a specific role. I think the most obvious thing about "Here On Earth" is the love triangle and the other emotional situations introduced in the film. It's not one of those movies where you just can't relate to anything, because in it there are situations where everyone is or has been. There are so many different things in this movie that it's hard not to relate to it. I'm only 18 and I can even identify myself. It was heart warming and heartbreaking at the same time. "Here On Earth" will make you laugh, cry and sometimes get angry. I consider this film an excellent review and I recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
