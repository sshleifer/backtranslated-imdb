I'm serious too, I mean, don't get me wrong, if you don't have an inclination for this kind of grade Z, squeaky creature characteristic {why would you be watching is my first thought?} Then it's an evaluation of about 3 or 4 on 10 floors, but for me it is a special kind of nonsense that brings me back to a beautiful moment of my childhood. You know the type, the memories that never leave you. Taking it all with youthful enthusiasm while Doug McClure and Peter Cushing dig under the cloak to fight with a myriad of subhuman creatures and species ". And boys!

But no matter, mad and awkward and flooded with colors glorious, At The Earth's Core is a return to a special pre-ILM era when kids like me line up to see such nonsense.
