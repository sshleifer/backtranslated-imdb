Although it is a low-budget and clearly last-minute movie, it has a certain charm that is hard to spot. I tend to believe that it is the screenwriter - Grant Morris (see Dead Dog), who, despite the plot's distorted plot, injected a fantastic slice of humor, seriously absent in many of today's box office hits. A must see for a laughing Sunday. Speaking as a real single girl, and a very skeptical one, this film didn't particularly inspire me, but turned on a little flame of hope for a loving love. It's not my beloved life, as much as the lovelife of my crazy little madman who lets his hamster sleep in his bed with her. You could find someone.
