PLOT SPOTTERRIFICATORS !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is the head of medicine in a major New York hospital. He left his wife, his children denied him, he is powerless, he drinks a lot and thinks about suicide. Also there is a killer who wanders around the hospital. Then he meets VERY strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. Do you want me to run away with you - but can you give up your old life completely and start a new one? <br /> <br /> Very strange film with an Oscar winning screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky. Presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of nurses or overworked doctors that is incompetently managed. It handles (somehow) actually make this look rather fun. It's not laughing out loud - it's VERY black humor. Even the acting is perfect: Scott is simply fantastic (and nominated for an Oscar) here. You see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. The character of Riggs is more than a little strange, but his de facto ways work and he is also incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and brutal, but never too much. I think he fiddles the ball at the end with a situation that goes too far over the top - but it's still worth seeing. If this had been done in a completely serious way, it would probably be impossible to take. Also look for Katherine Helmond in a while and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in unaccredited pieces. Personally I had problems taking it seriously. From what I felt in the ERRIVA hospitals this back pain in the 70s, but not anymore. Watch it for acting and screenplay. I give him a 7.
