Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the United States as "Distant", was directed, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge <br /> <br /> Ceylan. > <br /> This film is a gritty and gloomy version of the battle between a "city mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a "little mouse", Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are superb actors and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skills. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in a car accident shortly after the film was completed.) <br /> <br /> In most country cousins ​​/ city cousins, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyles is depicted in a humorous way. In this film there is little humor or even warmth. Both men have lost touch with human society. Mahmut's work as a commercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. He divorced a woman who clearly still loves, and has no satisfying human relationships. <br /> <br /> Mahmut lost his job due to the closure of a factory in his small town and lacked the skills or energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are mainly limited to the silent observations of other people crossing his path. He is clearly a warm and caring person, but he cannot express these qualities in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> Cousins ​​do not relate well to the world and do not relate well to each other. Neither makes an effort to behave in such a way as to provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this film portrays a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> In all likelihood, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was missing in the other's life. Instead, they lead unhappy parallel courses. The two men are distant, which is a situation suggested by the title of the film. <br /> <br /> One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds details on the details. These details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we could learn with mere exposure. <br /> <br /> Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It is not a "work film" in the traditional sense of that genre. It is a film about work because it demonstrates the damaging effects of unsatisfactory work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a dark, absorbent, dark film. Although it is not for a happy vision, I came out of the cinema <br /> realizing that I saw a truly creative and important film <br /> <br />. This film deserves to be seen and seen!
