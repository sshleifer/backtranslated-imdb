Anthony Wong plays Lok, a husband whose wife is seriously ill. Because of his illness, Lok has long been without sex. That's why he is tormented by a series of nightmares with nurses and students. "Erotic Nightmare" is a fun Cat III movie full of sleaze and voyeurism. There is also some blood when the first part of the film shows some terrible murders committed by Wong's character under the influence of the monk's mystic powers. The dream sequences are rather erotic and dreary, so I'm not complaining. Of course those who expect the gruesome horror of Cat III in the tradition of "Diary of a Serial Killer" or "Red to Kill" will be disappointed, but fans of the squalid exploit cinema should take a look at this.7 out of 10.
