What some Hollywood films look for and practically never succeed, somehow creating metaphysical connections between people (without becoming unrealistic), perfectly manages this beautiful film (it looks a bit like the wonderful "Veronique's double path" of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL film, which changes the perspective of life a bit: an intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully direct, excellent main actors, a masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if I'm not happy with the "White" finale - "Red" happily puts an end to the whole trilogy.
