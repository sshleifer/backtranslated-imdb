This film hits the heart with a reality like no one else I've seen. Show what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and what we are lucky enough not to try. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remember that the film is a dramatization and not a real life. Mr. Rickman does miracles with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator completely dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of a theater "in the round", which does not add or remove the emotion of the action: this film tries to open the eyes of the spectator and I would say that they have achieved success in that goal.
