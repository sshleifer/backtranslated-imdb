I just started watching this show. Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30pm in the afternoon (to 26 July 2006). <br /> <br /> This program literally makes me laugh out loud and I can't boast about sitcoms (apart from the English 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it). <br /> <br /> Today's TKoQ episode (July 26, 2006) was one in which Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and leaves to make some coffee and Doug wants that Carrie has no "external" friends, so she raises her top and shows her "belly hair!" and licks dishes when he goes out for dinner! But another funny episode was the other week when the old fella (with dad) won the Bingo and that episode made me laugh especially when they went out and took a replacement fridge and Carries father stayed there watching him and thought it was new. <br /> <br /> So I don't know how long this will have to be done on Irish TV or at what stage (recorded year) we are, but I hope it won't end soon because I'm summarizing there are some great scripts, some great characters and comic acting (especially Carrie, Doug and Carries father), some great jokes and a good presentation - a bit cheeky and close to the mark sometimes (send the kids out of the room!) but I think this American Sitcom is a winner and a lot of fun.
