I saw FAREWELL HARRY at the Plaza Theater while I was in New York and was rather taken. William Hall Jr.'s performance is tremendous. This is a film for the classic movie goer. Directed by Garrett Bennett reminds me of the early works of Barry Levinson and Robert Redford. The film seems to transcend the typical independent film. It has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique. I saw this with a small audience (400) who was fascinated from the moment of the first credit until the last and even if I wasn't out and I was crying (like the lady next to me) I have to admit that I had some watering in the eyes. .. <br /> <br />
