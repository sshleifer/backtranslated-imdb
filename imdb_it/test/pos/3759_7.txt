The "all I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ..." scene was a riot. I also chuckled for the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horseradish and threw the bird at the Japanese guy and said "Friend of Pearl Harbor". I think my IQ is over 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high. <br /> <br /> Funny, this 10 line requirement. It seems as if they beat you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't get to 1,000 words before I get to line 10. <br /> <br /> It's still two lines less. Forgive me while I think and drink, or drink and think. It depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. Well, I think I have reached the limit of 10 lines. Thanks for reading!
