This is one of the best and moodiest Vampires Tales ever! I really love this movie. The character is fantastic, even the places and the story. Actually the image is not a big budget production, but it is a must see. <br /> <br /> OK there are some flaws (in particular the names of the castle and places) in this film, but such errors are typically and are almost in every horror movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery fits the story perfectly and is close to reality, I can honestly say, because I visit them once when I was in Romania on my vacation. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this is the best part of the Subspecies series.
