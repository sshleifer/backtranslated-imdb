I haven't seen this movie since it was released in the mid-70s, but I remember it as a very realistic representation of the music business (right there with Paul Simons "One Trick Pony" .. another underrated IMO film) <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in and the commercial "tripe" that the "suitable" record company wants me to work with. <br /> <br /> Since I spent my entire career in the music industry as a composer / arranger / producer, I can truly attest to the verisimilitude that this film possesses. <br /> <br /> If you ever go out on an uncut DVD, I'd buy it!
