There is an interesting split in the vote for this film (at least at the moment). Those who expect a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed. I predict that those giving the movie 1 in 10 are those who expected a war movie or a revisitation of the invasion of Gallipoli. <br /> <br /> So - if you want to see actors, shots and a cool head, this movie doesn't suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary on Gallipoli, without prejudice to anyone (the only enemy in these events was the war itself), then you will be struck and impressed. I found it a very moving film, and even quite beloved Captain Guy Nightingale in the end.
