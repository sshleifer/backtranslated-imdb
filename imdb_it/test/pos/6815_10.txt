I loved this movie ... So many emotions in such a short time. I loved the beginning and the way you completely drive away. I love history and the deer that is brought inside. I know that when I think of deer I think of innocence and prosperity. Moreover, in Psalm 42: 2 in the Bible it is said: "As the deer panting by the streams of water, so it lowers my soul for You, O God" That could also link the last moment the woman says it will be fine. As if he knew he was going with God. Maybe I'm thinking a lot about this. But sometimes it's interesting to see what happens in people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. I live in Texas and have it played on cable ... I immediately took the computer to learn more about this film and this extraordinary director! I really liked the music used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. Definitely defines the atmosphere perfectly. Good choice! <br /> <br /> Thanks again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
