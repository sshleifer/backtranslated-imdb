The way I discovered this film was when I saw the American pie 2, at first it had a trailer for Ali G indahouse, I watched the trailer and forced me to buy the DVD, it looked incredibly fun! so the next day, I went to my local store and got it for Â£ 3.99 (Bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is a "gangster" from the West who paints a lot of troupe, his rivals are the troupes of the East. Ali has a bunch of "Cub Scout" children in which he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to blaspheme and steal cars, after Ali discovers that the government is stopping the money coming to the recreation center where Ali teaches children, runs for MP for the spots and overthrows another MP in his attempts to get rid of the recreation center to make room for an airport with stains. Throughout the film there are many laughs while Ali gets up for crazy things! Also Borat makes his appearance for a few seconds in the film, this is a film to watch absolutely for all Sacha Baron Cohen fans!
