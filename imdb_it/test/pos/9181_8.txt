OK, OK, I have to say I was impressed. It is hard to say what I am most impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch, so as not to open my eyes or the film itself. However, "Hitch" was damn good. Hey, it was good enough for me to watch twice. Will Smith was fun and good. Kevin James was simply hilarious, and absolutely essential to the film. Although this film focused on Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James it's not the same thing. <br /> <br /> The story is: Hitch is a game producer who helps the boy to woo the girl. His job is to create the possibility for the girl to notice the boy when he wouldn't do it otherwise. After the meeting, the rest is all for the boy to make or break the relationship. It works only on referrals and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time, and Albert has his eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta), a Paris Hilton type figure. As that plot unfolds, Hitch himself has his eyes on Sara (Eva Mendes), an acute, independent, fanged gossip writer who wants nothing to do with a relationship. <br /> <br /> The two stories make some fun moments and bind together for a bit of quagmire. Obviously no love story is complete without the incomprehension, misunderstanding or incident required to send the boy to chase the girl. Fortunately, they make it short and inexplicable. Hitch was a fun and entertaining film that flowed very well and flowed smoothly.
