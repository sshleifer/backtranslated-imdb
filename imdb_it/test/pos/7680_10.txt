When I was little, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired Dorothy Dandridge so much and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as exceptional as Sportin Life. The music has just taken a breath. When I had my first child and the film came on TV, I allowed him to see it, and to this day he never forgot this movie. He loved it. I will always remember Porgy and Bess. He has a special place in my heart then and now. I would really like them to restore this film, because it was one of the greatest films that ever existed with a "Black Cast" cast.
