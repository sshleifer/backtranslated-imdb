The splendor of this film does not lie in the film production process, which is a conventional story, but executed, intertwined with the lies of three soldiers after the Second World War, but in the fact that this story was told to everyone. Samuel Goldwyn deserves the credit for having the nerve to pass on a film that has for his boss a disabled veterinarian with pincers for the hands, an alcoholic and an underachiever.
