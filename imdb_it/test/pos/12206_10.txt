Surface was fantastic, I don't know how many Mondays I survived at school just thinking about the new surface episode. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mom to register it for me. I was pretty upset when I heard that it had been canceled, I meant the way to get us through. So, they can have their new Tina Fay play (you couldn't pay me to watch it, I think seeing ads made me more stupid). I will miss my correction of Surface Monday night, even if my sister made fun of me. although, the kidnapped looks good and still have L & O: SVU (I think, I still have to check) (I only wrote the 2 lines above, because they said I needed ten lines).
