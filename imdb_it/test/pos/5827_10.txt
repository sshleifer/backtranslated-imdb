What a fantastic show! A very underrated dramatic show. It's great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character (s) are the main characters. I think the best character in the show is Vern Schillinger. He is a tough, bad man and an Aryan on top of what makes him a real bad prisoner that there are many who are known to be. This show has many murders, I think it's a bit of an exaggeration for the killing on the show, but I have to admit it's one of the reasons why I think the show is that big. I think some characters were killed a little early, but some surely left their mark. You can't compare things like Prison Break at this show, they are totally different. I think some of the actors of the show are also very good and undervalued and should be what is due to them. A great show, my favorite. A show that should be considered great for years to come.
