Do not Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploit movie that gets a hit because of its poor quality and bad acting. Of course, it is not a masterpiece by anyone's standards, but it is a very fun B-movie with many things to tell and also many disturbing scenes that will stay in your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, acting could have been much better, but that's the case with most exploitation, so I can't really complain. The story is smart and has great twists that will keep you guessed. I thought that even the gore was a lot of fun. There's something nice about the older gore movies because they didn't have CGI back then, so they really had to fix it all by themselves. See this for a good time!
