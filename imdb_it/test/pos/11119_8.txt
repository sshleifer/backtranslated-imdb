Fame was released in the United States a year before I was born; I was too young to remember the original version of Fame - yet I have heard and read many things about it. Like the fact that it generated a TV series and that its soundtrack was led by Irene Cara, the success of Giogio Moroder, "Fame". <br /> <br /> Fame was probably the first of its kind to portray and show the world of the performing arts as a feature film. The lives, the difficulties, the obstacles that the students and some teachers have undergone have been under the eyes of the spectators. <br /> <br /> The shows were fantastic, but one that caught my attention in particular was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the annoying and promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and at first rude, his character later became less angry, frustrated and more engaged in his studies, not only with the practice of the show but also with the theoretical one. Irene Cara was as good as Coco - the scene with her taking off her blouse while a pervy director was filming her was rather annoying to watch-, as was Paul McCrane for his incredible portrait of a vulnerable but closed homosexual trying to face the lives and enrolls in a performing arts school in New York, after being ousted by the army when he said he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting, but sometimes his character got on my nerves. <br /> <br /> The choreography was excellent, there were some interesting dance numbers and the "hot lunch" scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. Another scene that was great was when the song "Fame" was played and all the kids started running in the streets of New York and danced wildly and carelessly around the world. It was a confusion of roads like no other. <br /> <br /> The only star to benefit in the long run was and it is Debbie Allen who later became a producer, director and star - although she mostly worked behind the scenes at shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later starred opposite Peter Weller in the film, "Robocop", where he played a villain and ER as the hateful Dr. Romano. <br /> <br /> The British director Alan Parker has shot this film really well - it has allowed artists to dance, act, sing to their heart content without wanting to interfere and influence their styles. <br /> <br /> For the duration of the film, we see the various stages that students encounter during their 4 years - from their auditions up to the first year, until graduating from New York's High School for the Arts. <br /> <br /> Fame is one of those films that addresses or addresses a particular audience that is not necessarily the general community that loves mainstream cinema - it is definitely NOT for everyone. <br /> <br /> I had fun first because I have an interest in the arts - not technically in terms of being a performer because I'm not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be c Annelled through hard work, commitment and passion towards what is done with their talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor or simply someone who is creative, you may be interested in a film like this - even if the events in Fame are something like what is actually in a college / performing arts school actually life, therefore, is a completely different matter. <br /> <br /> The 2009 remake of this film was recently released and, frankly, practically pales by comparison. <br /> <br /> As for the original Fame, at almost 30 years old, it's a bit dated, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is not an absolute classic, but like a cult classic of the 80s, in line with other dance films of the 80s, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Isn't it a coincidence that all those dance films start with the letter "F"? <br /> <br /> Gritty, moving and intriguing, this is worth a watch.
