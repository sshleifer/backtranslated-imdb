I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It provides such a detail of what the news industry executives will do just to get a story on the air: in particular Jane Craig rushes to Kenny to finish assembling the piece to get her out, and then Joan Cusack struggling to get it , and William Hurt, who according to Jane commits an incredible violation of ethics, falsifies his tears during his interview on date rapes, a defect that is emphasized by Aaron. Another high point is when Tom uses Jane for his benefits, and then turns and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant and the direction is almost as good. All three main actors were great in portraits of their characters, especially Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, which is the most fun in the film. Even William Hurt is very good. This deserved at least three Oscars, best actress (holly hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and best film. I enjoyed the last parts of the film showing them reuniting 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
