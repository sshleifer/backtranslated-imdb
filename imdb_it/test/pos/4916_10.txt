L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient, adventure-seeking public. There are no explosions nor is the drama directed. Like the films of Lynne Ramsey, the director is working more deeply with the atmosphere than with narration in an effective and incredibly moving way. Because it does not rely on free nudity or superficial pop-cult. plot, this is frankly one of the best foreign gay movies I've seen (see also Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). "Do not Look Now" by Nicolas Roeg receives a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film. That film, like L'Homme, is more than it could lead you to believe in the box. If you're in the mood to sit and be absorbed by the subtle and transformed powers of cinema, you'll love this movie.
