When I was younger, this movie was always aired on Channel 40 in the summer of summer (Fox had been a network for years and took over the programming). I've always looked forward to it. I went shopping with my parents, then sat with my Swanson and Lady Lee Cola television dinner (the only time of the week when I was allowed to drink coke and I enjoy myself. Sure, the script is predictably late in the 1970s Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray runs with a little effort in the film, but it's fascinating. I must love Spaz and the glasses with the tape (pre Revenge of the Nerds). pretty much the same character he played in "My Bodyguard", but he does it very well.
