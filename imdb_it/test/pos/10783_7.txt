I really chose this film for my husband, who works in radio broadcasts. I thought it would be more like a movie he would have enjoyed too, even though it was from the eighties, so it was a little dated. This movie really involves you. Sometimes you just want to strangle the guest, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some of the bigots they call to a real concentration camp. Sometimes you're really sorry for Barry, because he really got too big for his jeans if you know what I mean. It was on the Drama channel on Encore, so I think this is a true story. If you really like dramas, you'll like it, even if you don't know all the details of the broadcast business. If you're a fan of Alec Baldwin and you're watching him to see it, you shouldn't do it. His part is really a little part in this film.
