If we could have "Separate Tables", why not "Separate Lies". <br /> <br /> This is somehow involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while he is cycling. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter had a relationship with a friend and drove the car with his lover inside when the accident occurred. To further complicate matters, the housekeeper worked once for the boy's parents and he had her arrested for theft. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. Looks like revenge. <br /> <br /> Everything gets complicated. When our housekeeper discovers that her boss is driving the car, she finds her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case. <br /> <br /> As if that wasn't enough, several months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to take care of him. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good here despite the infinite "Peyton Place" theme. Tom Wilkinson, is a lawyer, who tries to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The film is a good film, but we could have done without the terminal illness. Oh well, the marriage ended anyway.
