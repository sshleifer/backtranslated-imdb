This was a great movie! It was a completely enjoyable teenage fantasy. So what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think if this were the only criterion, our culture would be poorer. So this film is for "The Godfather" as the new wave music is for Mozart. The point is that it is one of the best films of its kind I've seen. Women are all beautiful (as seen only on the beaches of California when making films). It has a little bit of everything, a sort of gallic battlestar meets the baywatch meets the Playboy video playboy meets Wayne's World. There is a lot of charm and a reasonable (though predictable) storyline that keeps you interested until the next piece of eye-pleasers fascinates the screen. Joe Estevez may not have the career of his brothers, but he does a good job focusing his attention on the eternal adolescent Uncle Bud. It contains many of the expected absurdities like the female rock band that plays without the connected guitars. (Was it so intentional?) If you are attracted to the box, rent the video, you won't regret it. As promised, it's good non-violent erotic fun!
