The three main characters are all hopeless, yet you only regret one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. This was part of the frustration: shouting at the Mercedes to get a clue and abandon the bad Harry, without success. <br /> <br /> Then there's the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a big part in disguise, and the moving story of Harvey Keitel about his unworthiness as a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino is making a half monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a rich man. <br /> <br /> Every time in history great moments appear, but in the end it is difficult to know what to think of this film. It doesn't have a happy ending, or even a happy ending, but somehow it feels right. <br /> <br /> This film is weird, but so am I; No wonder I liked it
