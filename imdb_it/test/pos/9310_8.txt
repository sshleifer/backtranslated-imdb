Ok, maybe it was because I was in Yangchun, China, when I saw this movie. Maybe because I finally had something on TV, I could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just fun. Whatever it was, this movie was worth it. <br /> <br /> I had just arrived for a foot and head massage when they gave me the remote to watch TV. I used to go around the damn thing, but I came across this crazy movie and got passionate. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can define a plot, revolves around a cooking contest and a sort of love story and the food in this film is the real star. If you like Iron Chef and many other cooking programs currently in TV mode actually, then you'll love the food scenes in this movie. <br /> <br /> It goes fast and the subtitles are so fast that you better be on the reading speed for this. However the action is mainly slapstick so you don't always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea. <br /> <br /> The main actress is adorable and the main actor is not bad to watch. They are both worth watching. Finally, if you have time to kill and want a good laugh, it's not a bad choice for both. <br /> <br /> I don't speak a word of Chinese, but I was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film. For those who speak Chinese, maybe it's even better. Overall, I gave this 8 out of 10 and am currently trying to find a copy to have while I'm in China, and by the time I get home, it will be a nice reminder to me of my time in Yangchun and a silly afternoon at the massage salon a stupid movie.
