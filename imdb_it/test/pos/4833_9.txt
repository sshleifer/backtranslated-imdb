This film is oxygenating in a way that is difficult to describe. Although it is fairly accurate in describing previous events and subsequent investigations concerning the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, now seen after September 11th, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this film prophetic, but it certainly makes the common wisdom of the game "make fun of me once shamed, take me twice in embarrassment". Come alive. <br /> <br /> Our government learned nothing from the 1993 World Trade Center attempt and subsequent readings of the 9/11 Report show that many of the errors that led to the bombing in 1993 have been repeated. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized the First and Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution partially responsible for the fact that Islamic terrorists are able to carry out their evil plans, but this is wrong with everyone the possible ways. <br /> <br /> Surely the people who support this argument do not support a ban on freedom of expression, freedom of the press or freedom of religion? I certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials in the possibility of breaking into someone's home or office to look for no reason or without a warrant. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the FBI, INS and even the local police could get the warrants based on the information they had in their possession, but they chose not to do it for a series of reasons. Moreover, no matter how disgusting or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak ill of America or its leaders. Likewise, it is not illegal to possess guns or pray for Mecca. <br /> <br /> Consider this, until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired his gun at President John Kennedy, he wasn't really breaking any laws. Living in a free society has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> Still, Path To Paradise is a must-see film that I fear will never be seen by so many people. As far as I know, it's not on DVD and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revisions to it. <br /> <br /> I'm not very surprised, people don't like to document their failures and this movie certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us didn't do their job right and for the smallest reasons, like the disputes over jurisdiction and refusal to share information. <br /> <br /> This is a shame as Path To Paradise is well done and compelling and as many have already said, the final scene in which Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik), the bomber who built the bomb truck which was used in the first attempt to destroy the two towers is flying past the World Trade Center after its capture and the extradition simply says "Next time we'll bring them both down", it's a cinematic moment that froze me in place for several minutes.
