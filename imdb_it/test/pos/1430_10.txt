The man with the golden arm, controversial drama of Otto Preminger's panoramic crime, takes place between the mental descriptions of his living and architectural occupants, in rhythmic and lashing arrangements. The opening of the film, a close-up inside a Frankie bar that looks through the window, already tells us the prominence that the protagonist's subjective experience will capture. Pulled in the direction of smaller and smaller spaces, the film goes out, while the long game of the local gangster's poker goes off by daylight, fits in, while Sinatra's Frankie Machine closed in a room in her celebrated scene heart-rending struggle to overcome his habit. Exploring the shapes and faces of its urban paradise, the visual traffic in Man with the Golden Arm characterizes the disordered psychological circumstances, forming an oppressive environment, as claimed by the repeated monitoring shots in close-ups of Frankie's eyes. <br /> <br /> The grace of this fiery drama, which strikes from the moment of the exciting launch with a crane, shows the command over the perceptible world that studio production allows. The wonderfully dilapidated urban ensembles define an independent place with no beginning or end, an indeterminate state, the type that actually lasts just as long as this slippery line seems to have been gentrified or leveled. The fascination of certain performances, in particular those of Robert Strauss as the nicknamed dark-world gaming boss Schwiefka and Arnold Stang in the role of Frankie's trusty four-eyed puppy dog, makes this surrealistically pleasurable fun. The premise of drug addiction, the performance of Sinatra, the infectious soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein and the famous opening sequence, influential and controversial of Saul Bass focused on the animated clipping of a heroin addict assured that, in his era, The Man with the Arm Golden pushes forward the cause of realism in Hollywood still reticent. He is impressionistic and subjective, as I say, but his intent, his strength and his spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What absorbs me most in this film is its appearance as a gangster movie. It has illegal card games, disadvantages, fights, cannons, double crossings, runaway characters, a femme fatale, an incredibly sexy moll, shady nightclubs and the urban landscape, but it does more than take advantage of this environment for entertainment. In reality, it is the perfect environment, and gender, in which to tell this story, an urban neighborhood full of crime where it is all too easy to escape through a bottle or two, or three or four, or a drug, a transient dose that it really only works to keep one in the dark from any lighting and all the clear scenarios that the world could do.
