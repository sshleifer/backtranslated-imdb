Return to Me is a fascinating gem of a movie. With an absolutely star-studded cast, who can go wrong with this modern fairy tale? It also includes many, many lines written by the funny girl Bonnie Hunt, who wrote and directed this film. David Duchovny is also very good, showing a different approach than his alter ego alter ego in my favorite show the x-files. a great movie for dates!
