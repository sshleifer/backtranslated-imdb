Tenacious D: in The Pick of Destiny tells the imaginary story of the formation of the Tenacious D band and their quest to find the Pick of Destiny, a pick with supernatural powers made by Satan's own tooth (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), united by destiny, must go to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the biggest band in the world. The film is hilarious and offers endless laughter. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work perfectly together, having been true friends and collaborators for over 20 years. The film is partly a musical. All (or most) of the music was written and performed by The D. All the songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack certainly deserves to be verified. This film will mostly be appreciated by Tenacious D fans, but if you're not a fan of The D, I still think you'll like the movie. If you are a fan of D, then you have to watch this movie. Acting is not as bad as one might think, and laughter and rawness never cease to come. I highly recommend this movie to anyone trying to take off their socks and laugh as much as they have laughed for so long. Look for the cameos of Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Polpettone, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
