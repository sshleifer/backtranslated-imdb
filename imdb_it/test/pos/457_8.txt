I've seen several Yul Brynner films, but this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in the foreground as he growls, smiles and laughs. Brynner could have been just as interesting in the Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot, but none of these films captured her range of talents in the foreground as this one. It is bold and tantalizing to look at in every scene. <br /> <br /> Equally fascinating and sexy, without taking off your clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive - she took up this kind of role years later in La notte di Iguana. The film does not suggest she slept with someone to help free the group from the clutches of the Russians, in fact it is shown as escaped from the Russian major (in contrast to the story of Maupassant or the story of Isak Denisen). Yet the film explodes with the suggested but real physical appeal of Kerr's character. <br /> <br /> Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my opinion, but she is a superb actress. He puts his soul in dignity in the characters he portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes his roles in Il viaggio, Quo Vadis and La notte di Iguana memorable. <br /> <br /> Why is this an unusual film? It's not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was still a great Abraham Polonsky cinema, but it was never recognized as such due to intolerance towards the left in the post-McCarthy era. <br /> <br /> The film is also unusual for its cast - great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee - join Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways the film is international compared to the American. All four are great actors and add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Those who have read the works of Maupassant and Denisen will find that the film is not true for either of them. Yet the film can stand alone because its sterilized (censored?) Version has its own dignified charm - provided by the reality of the night that led to the publication of the group. I think Litvak deserves the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible turn to the stories that led to the making of the film, while it has woven parts of both written stories (for example the last bus ride and the final kiss) <br /> <br /> But I have a groin: why does Hollywood never recognize the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (for example, Insomnia) did the original works begin to be prominently mentioned in the end credits.
