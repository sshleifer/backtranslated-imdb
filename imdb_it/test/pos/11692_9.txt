Beauty in Trouble (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a great title. All the descriptions of this film fail to capture what it really is ?? a fairy tale for adults. A poor girl is courted by a prince. The "girl", Marcela, played by the beautiful Anna Geislerová, has a beauty Isabelle Huppert, with red hair, captivating, sexual and infinitely fascinating face and figure. She has a husband louse, but they have a great sex. Children listen to making love through walls. He is rude and passionate, since the sex of the working class seems to be often portrayed in a film. But it is also for us to recognize that this is the thing that binds them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage. The husband, a professional car thief, is eventually captured and thrown into prison. We don't know how she came to this marriage, but she isn't exactly a high class herself. But she is beautiful, intelligent (we suppose) and loves her splendid and resistant children. You deserve more. And she could get the life she deserves - in the end. (no spoilers!) She is forced to return with her mother after her husband was sent to prison. Mum has a horrible second husband (read the ugly stepfather). It's a real horror show. It borders on being a child who abuses children. He is obsessive about cleaning, but he runs rudely at the table, always asking for ways and decorum for children. It's a real socially poor wretch. Mum endures it, like Marcella's husband, at least he's lustful - horrible but excited. Ambivalent, confused and layered characterizations are what make the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have flaws, some seem driven by the class, others by an innate character. These flaws and details of the character are fascinating in a minute and contemptible to the next. The public really has to negotiate mixed feelings of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment and the role of a woman as mother and wife through the rapidly changing terrain of history. In conclusion, as in many films like the wonderful Icelandic film "Thicker Than Water" (Blóðbönd), children can be victims. What is right in the end could be what is best for children? which are our salvation and our future It is a theme played these days in films ranging from Pan's Labyrinth to Children of Men. Foreigners Cinema is recognizing in intricate stories of morality that life is confused, brutal, unjust and, as adults, we must act together to pass something useful to the next generation. in the process. The extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in Kráska v nesnázích speak of the qualities of what makes a man, what drives a woman, what embodies hope, what the class is - is the economic status of the plot of one's character ? The film is rich in humanity as embodied by the last two shots, which moved me in an incredible and unexpected way. so subtle and intelligent that to compare it to an American film seems unfair. Americans sometimes seem to have no desire to consider that the paradoxes in human nature do not offer fixed resolutions. But here, dangerously expressed in the apparent fairy tale for adults, there are interesting moral questions. Don't be fooled by simple history; this is a great movie.
