Honestly, this is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. I was fascinated by the story, petrified by Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat throughout the ride. I don't really understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The set-up has already been thoroughly discussed; Captain Howdy is an online predator that organizes meetings with teenagers, kidnaps them and introduces them to his favorite pastime of body modification and piercing. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and is one of the scariest psychopaths ever created; maybe it's the scariest thing because it's so human and you make sense (especially if you're interested in body modification) that there really are people like this in the world. <br /> <br /> But the main reason I liked the movie and the reason why it's so horrible is that Captain Howdy becomes the hero. At the beginning of the film, the roles are clear; the victims are innocent, the policeman is the good boy and Howdy is pure evil. With the second act, however, things have changed a little. You want Howdy to be bad, but it turns out that he's really just a victim of circumstances and maybe good and evil aren't obvious. It's terrifying to find you cheering for the "bad guy". <br /> <br /> A couple of people said that Strangeland should have been split into two separate films. To be sure, there are certainly two separate "acts", but this film works so well because the two acts are back to back. The first act is the typical psycho-thriller, but the second act is the most disturbing due to the reaction of spectators to the situation. I don't think it would have worked the same way if the second act had been expanded and turned into a sequel. <br /> <br /> As a fan of a great horror movie, I highly recommend this movie. It's the first horror movie I've ever tried to give me nightmares.
