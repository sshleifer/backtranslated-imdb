I played this movie incessantly this month and I love it. I was around the 60s (oh dear), so in a sense it's nostalgic. However, it is the funny premise, the snappy dialogue and the great performances that make me look. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's reactions to Stephanie at the end of the film are priceless. (I'd be more specific, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone.) Who, besides Matthau, can play a man not completely up and down and yet still love him? As for the Bergman costumes, I think it looks sloppy as it should. I think "the only time she appeared in an evening dress was being robbed". It's not good at all, which is a shame. I never liked it when I saw it for the first time and I still don't. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought it was a revolutionary performance at the moment, yet it's the only performance I don't love as much as the others. He still has the right amount of sweetness and sympathy, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree: I thought Rick Lenz was great and it's a shame his film career didn't work out after that. <br /> <br /> I hope more people watch this movie ... they will love it!
