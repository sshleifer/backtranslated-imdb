This film came into fashion more often than the miniskirt. A post-war triumph, it has been practically forgotten since the 1970s except for film students. Recently, it has begun to be recognized as perhaps the most impartial representation of the integration of soldiers in post-war life ever made (and which certainly includes films like "The Deer Hunter".) I like it, but my total evaluation is from some part between those extremes. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Three very different soldiers who gathered after World War II (The Big One!) Fly home to their Midwestern city and try to resume or create civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a quiet job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to do but determination. <br /> <br /> There are some good performances, but unfortunately irregular. Fredric March won the Oscar for best actor for playing an old sergeant who returns to work at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for "It's a Wonderful Life", which also earned the award for best film, but clearly this film touched the nerve of the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has a fantastic scene, a humorous speech reminiscent of a similar incident involving World War II hero Pappy Boyington, and the rest is solid but not spectacular. <br /> <br /> I'm going upstream here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was rightly ignored by the Academy. I barely noticed a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking he would slap Frederic March for bothering her. He practically made a face whenever they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in his forced smiles and in the air of tolerance rather than joyful. I think all this nonsense about her being "the perfect wife" is correct only if you think that an unscrupulous 50s housewife is your ideal. You may not agree, but apparently the Academy's voters are not. It's a big deal with this film, terribly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews as a former soda fool who became a war hero, then ends up behind the counter again, it's incredible. He is joined by a wife who evidently married him just before leaving for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks gloomy. But then he has the chance that March's daughter, Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), explodes the fireworks. Both are fantastic, but then again comes the inequality that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera are intricate, punctuated by the classic line of all time, "I'm going to destroy that marriage!" Romanticism is edifying and reflects a common condition after the war, that of the return of the soldiers who find love on their return. <br /> <br /> Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. It has a naturalistic quality due to its acting, or it is a non-acting, which sounds equally true today as it undoubtedly did then. Taking a nonsense approach to his situation is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best of all the cinema, is when he takes the girl he likes to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. "I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys." Really great things. <br /> <br /> The film has some flying moments. It also has some moments that belong to afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad guy and see this for the highest points.
