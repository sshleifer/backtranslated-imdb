Having seen the movie years ago and disappointed by its squandered potential, when I heard it was becoming a TV series, I categorically refused to watch it. My best friend immediately became a huge fan and, knowing my love for horror movies, I couldn't believe I wouldn't watch a single episode. I told him that the film had marked me all my life with regards to everything about BUFFY, and he told me to forget that the film existed. He insisted on giving two episodes a shot: "Once More Feeling" and this. <br /> <br /> Both are because today I am a BUFFY fan. He was right - I was immediately kidnapped. I have never seen a show with the courage to dare to try an episode that has almost no dialogue, and nothing else could have done with the panache and pure creativity of BUFFY. I think X FILES could have gotten away with it if they had thought of it before, but I'm glad that BUFFY did it instead. <br /> <br /> It is an honor for all those involved for the whole hour, sometimes hanging on the edge of the seat. And when it was all over, I wanted to learn more about each character. So I went out and bought the first season set. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee that if you've never seen it before, we recommend seeing more if you make this your first episode. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not giving it 10 out of 10 is because I reserve that score for "Once More ..."
