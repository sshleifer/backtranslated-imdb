I originally saw this film as a VB block rental from Blockbuster. It was a while ago, but I still remembered it. Blockbuster no longer has it. Netflix did not have one and there were not many copies on the web - only a few expendable VHS copies. Recently he finally found it available in DVD format on eBay at a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player will play PAL discs on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> My wife and I enjoyed ourselves. The style of the film is a bit strong, and many, if not most, parts are rather strongly over-played as if they were amateurs (especially children), but it's not annoying. The contrasts of societies are accentuated in overexposure. <br /> <br /> There is some political preaching in terms of the statement that young people in Russia should not try to escape their not so great life, but instead they should at least try to make things better first. But it is not dominant. It's pretty funny most of the time. <br /> <br /> Some minimization of the West commented by others is not at all IMO, but I take it as a comment on the expectations of Russian characters. At least if taken from my Western point of view. Maybe it's a downplay of the west from a Russian point of view (which is literally from the characters who say it). <br /> <br /> I can't say how literally English subtitles are for the film, but I can say that the subtitles were done very well, full of English idioms as if they had been written by a native English speaker - complete of "colored" language.
