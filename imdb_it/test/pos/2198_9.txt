"Sweeney Todd" is in my opinion one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story" it has a wonderful and intelligent soundtrack. It offers interesting roles to the two protagonists and to different support roles. It has a timeless theme, revenge. It has a lot of humor, and is equally powerful when presented simply or on a large scale. <br /> <br /> "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a man simply offended during the industrial period in England. It shows the inhumanity of man to man, as in the words of Sweeney himself: "There are two types of men: there is what is in his place and that with the foot in the other". In an attempt to correct the wrong that was done to him, Mr. Todd devises a plan to seek revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, owner of a meat pie shop under the barber shop of Mr.Todd, they decided to have "those upstairs, serve those below". <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to have seen the original Broadway version eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I saw the awakening with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler, and several other versions of concerts. <br /> <br /> While the technical aspects of this production are missing, to say the least, I believe that this filmed production version is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles, and enjoy playing with each other. <br /> <br /> Excellent support work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, like the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry, and they are basically unwatchable. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
