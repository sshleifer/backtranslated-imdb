I have just finished the screening of El Padrino in Germany. A great movie. We look forward to seeing more Chapa movies in the future. It was wonderful to see a film so well thought out with such suspense and a story that it will remain an instant classic. The ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. Seeing a high quality film outlines Chapa's true potential and his skill as a writer, actor, director and director. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant interpretation of "blood in and blood out" and has now demonstrated to everyone who has seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with genuine artistic control. Something that few directors can afford.
