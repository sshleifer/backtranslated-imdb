Like Richard Pryor, Mason never received the material he deserved. Whatever you know of him is probably wrong. Overcome the accent and go see his stand-up. You'll be very surprised - it's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of cabarets (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeld to Chris Rock - Jackie Mason is definitely up there). It is known to be a comic strip. Even Howard Stern said he was one of the 3 funniest comedians ever. <br /> <br /> The accusation that Mason is not Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known to have been a big Mason fan. Dangerfield's career went nowhere for a long time until he started following Mason's shows. It was then that Mason gave Dangerfield the inspiration for his "no respect" routine. While I think Dangerfield is great, you see that both are standing up and you will see that Mason is the best comedian.
