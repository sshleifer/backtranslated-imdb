This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! The director did a great job showing the contrasts between the social classes, a situation that is very relevant in France today. All the characters are adorable, especially Juliette and her family. The development of the love story is, although not entirely realistic, at least plausible, and does a great job showing how many people will change for love. I discovered that this is a story of Cinderella that warms the heart, but in which Cinderella is a powerful woman in and of herself. I laughed this whole movie and I loved it. I recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who loves unique characters, comedies and non-traditional romantic stories.
