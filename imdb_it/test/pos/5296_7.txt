Said to be inspired by Disney, The Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Cliff is the master of Japanese animation, Hayao Miyazaki's next great work after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his unmistakable style Animation of fantastic kingdoms and characters for children are once again on display. <br /> <br /> Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the protagonist of the film discovers a "goldfish" trapped in a glass jar while playing at the sea under the cliff. Stay with his mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and above. Sosuke shakes the jar with force to try to get the 'goldfish' out but the little 'goldfish' is blocked. He then tries to pull it out but can't get away. Sosuke then places the jar on the ground before breaking a small rock on it, breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger. So check curiously to see if the 'goldfish' is still alive. While observing it, the "red fish" reacts by suddenly licking its blood from the finger. Excited, Sosuke rushes home again and puts the 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water in the hope that it will survive. He did it and called it "Ponyo" (Yuria Nara). <br /> <br /> The above scene would mean what will come for the rest of the film. It's interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And that's what Hayao Miyazaki did meticulously well in the portrait. It must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before painting this communication chemistry between the two main characters. The children's behavior would also extend to the rest of the film in their further meetings. <br /> <br /> The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progresses from the moment Sosuke took Ponyo to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two met after a brief separation when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical sea dweller, took the wandering pony back before encapsulating it in a magic bubble with gentle intent. <br /> <br /> Fujimoto, who was once human, grew up to refer to humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing his life. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and be with Sosuke so he flees for a second time, accidentally emptying his father's precious elixir pool into the sea, creating a tsunami storm and swallowing the small town in the process. /> <br /> The following are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded city. <br /> <br /> Is there a forever happy ending in this? Will true love prevail? Discover it. <br /> <br /> Looking at Ponyo's art on the sea cliff, there seems to be a deviation from Miyazaki's past work in terms of rendering. It seems unfamiliar because the environment, apart from the characters involved in each scene, is not colored as usual in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is taken for granted by those that look like color pencil drawings. Objects and characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> This is peculiar if taken on the face value but by the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki is allowing the public to watch the film with the color of a child, yet allows adults to remember a Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented future viewers, new in Miyazaki's work to see it. The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo as well. Dealing with the case in Japan would still be a different story as Miyazaki's credentials far outweigh any marketing techniques. <br /> <br /> In summary, however, the whole was not the same as its parts. Apart from Miyazaki's ability to launch animated and animated characters, the film lacks elements of excitement and wonder when measured against previous works, resulting in a deficit of presence on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed to illuminate the film in style but the moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for children , but for children who are all or were once.
