Sean Astin brings out another incredible performance in "Toy Soldiers". He plays the highly intelligent prankster, Billy Tepper along with Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan who play his best friends, Joey Trotta and Jonathan "Snuffy" Bradberry. During a regular day at the Saint Anselm school for boys, a group of dangerous terrorists take all the boys and teachers as hostages and threatens to blow up the school if the leader, Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff), is not released from the 'American prison, but these are not just ordinary boys taken hostage, most of these children are children of very powerful people in America and half of them were expelled from other schools before coming to Saint Anselm. They are mouths and the actions could make them kill. When the government desperately tries to find a way to help, Billy, Joey, Snuffy and other guys decide to take matters into their own hands.
