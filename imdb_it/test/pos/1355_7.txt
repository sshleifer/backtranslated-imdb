There is something that one of the characters (the elderly director who pretends to be dead) says that he could summarize the whole film: "In Italy he is the dead man who governs". True! This is a country with no future, in the hands of tired old men. And the cryptic portrait of the town of Bellocchio, centered on the seemingly senseless story of a director who has to film the wedding parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what doesn't work here. But foreigners can lose the point, as it is not clearly expressed. I understand that the Australian or Canadian people who watch this year get bored and wonder if there's a meaning - well, there's a meaning, but it's only clear to the people who live here today, and keep their eyes wide open. . Like Bellocchio. Surely it is not one of his best films, and it is not as powerful as Buongiorno, notte, but it is worth seeing it ... for the Italians who live in Italy.
