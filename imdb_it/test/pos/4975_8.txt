This is one of my favorite westerns. What a cast! Glenn Ford plays his role in his usual mild, controlled but firm manner. Ford plays one of the smallest breeders in the shadow of the mighty anchoring ranch that wants to swallow the entire territory. Edward G Robinson plays the paralyzed patriarch of the anchoring ranch and Barbera Stanwyck plays his astute intriguing wife. There is a lot of action In this western that is quite impressive, the scenery is delightful and the letterbox photography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is stereo! I would say that this western has a pocket budget. It seems expensive. One of a series of great westerns by Glenn Ford.
