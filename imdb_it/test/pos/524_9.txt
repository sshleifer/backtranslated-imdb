This film must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a bizarre and gloomy film on four different stories from four different places in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, a strange story about love or career. I'd like to see all four of them as a movie on their own that can be much more extensive. <br /> <br /> Even the only break in the middle is something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the series (if it is doing one) or the DVD extension. Apparently they had cut a lot to fit it for only 3.5 hours.
