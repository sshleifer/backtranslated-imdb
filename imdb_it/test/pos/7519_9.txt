If you liked the "net" of Paddy Chayevsky, you will probably also appreciate this black comedy, as it is another brilliant chayevsky script, a wonderful satire in big city hospitals and a perfect vehicle for Geo. C. Scott. He plays a burnt medicine chief on the most chaotic day he or his hospital ever saw. His personal crisis is coming to a head and his hospital is falling around him, as local residents demonstrate against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an alarming rate, thanks to a sabotage of biblical and assassin inspiration. The latter, who theatrically declares himself "Matto per Cristo", "Parakleet di Kaborka", "Wrath of the Lamb" and "Angel of the Bottomless Pit", beats the doctors on the head, administers lethal injections and exchanges the identities of the patients , causing treatments and operations to be performed on the wrong people. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you uncomfortable, as do deadly mistakes like these (hopefully not so many, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time make you laugh at portraits of priceless characters . One is Richard Dysart ("L.A. Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends much more time worrying about his investments and publicly traded shares than his patients, who are fatally suffering from his great indifference and neglect. There's Diana Rigg in the role of Barbara Drummond, a free-spirited hippy girl who seduces the besieged head of medicine (Scott) and tries to make him run away with her. Then there is the deceived murderer, who appears to be Barbara's father and who "works quite well" in the Indian reserve where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, but who is driven to madness simply by being relocated to civilization . The strongest portrait by far is Dr. Scott Bock, who discovers his soul of a former boy genius, failed father and husband, brilliant doctor and responsible administrator, who constantly dreams of committing suicide but must endure the demands of his work. Scott is exceptional in this challenging role. <br /> <br /> Until the final scenes it is not known if Bock will leave the hospital for Barbara's Indian reservation and a quieter, simpler life, if the murdering father will be captured or if the locals revolt and revolt will take over and put the hospital on its knees. Looking at the crazy killer at work, it is suspected that Chayevsky is telling us that our crazy society makes him do these things, as we are told that he is a different person from cities and people. <br /> <br /> As my father was the chief administrator of a large number of large hospitals over the years, I had an idea of ​​the demands of his work and the enormous responsibility he took on. This story makes this responsibility the focus of Scott's crisis. This is both a funny and a scary movie, with actors meeting the considerable demands of Chayevsky's script. It's also a movie I get more every time I watch it.
