This film is a piece of study for my English course, but the depth and meaning amazed me. Since we are closely watching all the facts and characters of this film, his interesting story of love, hate, war and prejudice. Well recommended! <br /> <br /> History: A well-to-do girl named patty, Bergen, meets a escaped prisoner of war, then hides him in his little house in his immense gardens, and as they get to know each other, they begin to see other qualities and yes they earn each other love. Patty's father despises her and treats her as if it were dirt. Anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his cover to protect her, but the patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.
