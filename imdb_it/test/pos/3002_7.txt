The team of husband and wife doctors Carole and Niles Nelson are doing very modestly in their careers, but Niles has a problem with gambling. His fortune changes when he (unknowingly) saves a gangster's life from the crowd of Joe Gurney and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself. Loving his change of fortune (and his new and appealing apartment), Niles continues to receive profits to patch up other wounded members of the gang. Unfortunately, his shady dealings come to light in a police raid, which also blocks a shadow on his wife's career. <br /> <br /> At this point the plot is brought into focus, as Carole Nelson must save her career before her license is suspended. This involves bringing the gang to justice more or less alone. <br /> <br /> This is not a gangster image with sharp outlines, but a plot that could have been comfortable in a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is a bit of tension, but the atmosphere is illuminated by Bogart's ironic performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the "Napoleon of Crime". His other band members also function more like hooligan minions. And there is a lively dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when he is treating his wounds in his hiding place. Obviously, like in all gangster movies, there is a great shooting finale, but with a humorous touch. This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to fame.
