Okay, I love the acting of Aidan Quinn even with a bad script. This is not the case in The Assignment. As other viewers have said, this was a film I came across in the cable and I got so into it that I didn't want it to end. Take an American from the Cuban Navy (Quinn) who is a strong and robust soldier and a family man. Add a mad agent (Donald Sutherland) who is looking for the most famous terrorist in the world and add a Ben Kingsley and you have "The job". Sutherland is a witness to Carlos' most famous terrorist actions in a cafe on a beautiful day when he is so deeply shocked by this evil evil that his only reason for living is to take this man until he has his breath. <br /> <br /> Take a soldier on a pass in Israel who is a dead player for this man and is beaten and held by Kingsley until they realize they have a plan. Confronting Carlos from being him, or being forever responsible for never helping to free the world from him, is a very heavy task and a sense of guilt. Not helping his country he is bound like a man and his military duty to choose wisely. Then the training begins. Let's say that Carlos is training right there with the academy of arts and holocausts. When I say that this film with an intense and wonderfully cast, scripted and executed cast is the best, I'm not underestimating it. All three actors could save almost all the scripts .. together this is a film to see from frame one to credits. I'm not interested in terrorism or movies, but I'm passionate about it! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn who for once plays an important role that could hold any actor, including Gary Oldman. This is a compliment. Rent it and get lots of popcorn. Oh, did I talk about sex? Works better than "Last Tango!" And its educational program.
