This film shocked me. I thought I knew a little about the revolt in the Attica prison. After seeing this, I see that I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the lawyer and the black prisoner. Both the personal history of these two men and the drama of the court that was taking place were compelling. The flashback sequences in the prison were fantastic. It's hard to believe that it wasn't a documentary film that was so real. It wasn't just a great drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter of American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I give him two thumbs up.
