A young girl becomes a pen pal of a navy and when she visits the end of the war she expects someone a little more "available", resulting in comic complications. In the end everything works well, of course, but not before all the people have chewed the scenario completely. Errol Flynn's impression of Humphrey Bogart from "Casablanca" is a highlight, as are several gimmicks of his swashbuckling image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a revolt). It is Tucker, however, who "puts" the film under his arm, lowers his head and barricades beyond the goal line. He demonstrates the most fully developed comic talent twenty years later in "F-Troop" and conveys a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays to improve his performance. Eleanor Parker does a great job as the persecuted woman, and little Patti Brady enchants like Tucker's current pen pal friend. A beautiful comedy "coming home" in a stately environment that children and romantics of all ages should find amusing.
