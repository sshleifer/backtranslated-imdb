Certainly not only for fans of urban legends, Campfire Tales is often a scary and always fun ride through several popular stories. It is also a film that exceeded the (low) expectations I had. A horror film of which I had never heard or read, a straight-to-video version (granted, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise, but with horror movies nowadays it can be all or nothing), a cast of mostly unknown. .. well, I'll leave the math to you. <br /> <br /> The film turns out to be a fun, suspenseful and very enjoyable experience. The four stories are well rhythmic and satisfying. The only one I felt was a little weaker was "The Locket", for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for the characters' plot or actions; however, I have always loved the story, its atmosphere and its end. My favorite was the third story, "People Can Lick Too" - the suspense in it is not only palpable, but also educational. <br /> <br /> I found Campfire Tales as one of those horror jewels that one finds possibilities, and then continues to recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
