This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times. I will come so far to put it there with Ray and The Aviator. It is the story of a young bi-racial boy who lives in a pension run by the incredible Miss Rachael aka "Nanny". You fall in love with Tata, a woman who gives all of herself to those around her. S. Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully, and the other cast members do the same. If I were to praise every actor for the way they played their roles, I should mention everyone in the whole cast. <br /> <br /> The music of this film blends perfectly with the story, almost dictating the way it goes. And what's more, this movie is actually fun. It won't bore you at all, not even for a minute! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to spend an evening at home watching a very intelligent, very entertaining film.
