This film deserved better. Mike Judge's satirical humor has brought to light something too much in this country that they are trying to deny ... we are becoming more stupid as a society. <br /> <br /> Could Anna Nicole's coverage be 24 hours a day be other tests? Mike Judge paints a scary future, where the dumb survive and thrive. It makes you stop and think, and laugh. Can you watch the world and not ask if we are becoming more stupid? Are we overtaking from human garbage and from our garbage? (Watch out for landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is really fun. I'll tell you more about the plot but I don't want to ruin it. <br /> <br /> So, why publish this film with the ZERO promotion? Could it be that the stupid are already taking over?
