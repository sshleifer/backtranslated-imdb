This was a TV show I watched in the 1960s as a child and was fascinated by it. In the past many years, I have often thought about this show and how nice it would be to watch it again, but remembering that the things of the past are not always as good as the memories. This was a great show in the 1960s and lost nothing, even now in 2007. Of course, there are some production errors that can be seen by watching old shows, and it takes a couple of episodes to get used to the voices dubbed, after doing so, I was fascinated now that I was back in the 60s. The Samurai is played by Koichi Ose, who plays the role in a very humble way. I remember that during the 1960s, due to the popularity of the show here in Australia, he went on tour performing with the sword, etc., and was overwhelmed with interest in the show and for him. It was great that one of my favorite shows always retained the magic he did during my childhood. A series not to be missed.
