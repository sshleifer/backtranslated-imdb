Here is a film of adventure, determination, heroism and courage. Moreover, he returned in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. It is a wonderful and adventurous story, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful in playing the healthy, confident, no-frills Fizzy ... a great role model. This is one of my favorite movies. It's a film to watch again and again and it will inspire and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the plot excellent, but the film also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully direct. This film is as good as gold!
