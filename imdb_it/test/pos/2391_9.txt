I found the film very interesting. I really liked the movie, the actors were fantastic. It was entertainment. Benny the uncle was wonderful He was real in his character. The finale took a wonderful turn. I would recommend you to see it. Eddie Mores's girlfriend reminded me of a little sandra bull that was sharp as a nail. I also like the girls who act in the film, it was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because that's the way most people cook lol. I actually saw the movie twice and learned more the second time.
