The inaugural evening of the "South Asian International Film Festival" (SAIFF) in New York was an event that many of us have been waiting for. <br /> <br /> Could I finally see "Hari Om" ?? I was tired of seeing the "promo" on a loop and the lingering taste of Nitin Sawhney's song Angel in the promo, he let me pray to hear the rest. I was impressed by the images ?? and tremendously curious to know how the robust auto rickshaw driver would have conquered the heart of the extraordinary and sophisticated French tourist! I remember being rather intrigued by the theme, when I had read one or two lines in the newspapers, centuries ago! Above all, since I was personally very fascinated a few years ago, by how fanciful the rickshaws in Jodhpur were! The snow and the crowds outside the theater have only increased my anxiety. <br /> <br /> Once inside the theater, I discovered that the SAIFF organizers presented only disasters. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed by the poor organization of the event and found myself in a difficult place, trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends (of mixed nationality) whom I had invited to the VIP guest list. Was I hoping to show them that Indian cinema hasn't always been about Bollywood? In the end and FINALLY, the film started sending some fresh air in our own way. Or so I thought ?? Hari Om ?? started with chaos and noise. Autorickshaws honking, traffic and a lot of chaos. I found myself smiling as I felt the sense of "home" filling up inside me. <br /> <br /> Thus begins the journey of Hari Om ?? an auto rickshaw driver in Jaipur ?? The director could not have made a better casting call with this character. From Monsoon Wedding to Hari Om ?? Vijay Raaz, despite his non-hero appearance, takes this film exclusively on his acting skills and his way of playing the character, full of all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in Rajasthan. He is a winner to the end. But how and where did he learn to speak fluently in English, that's the question! However, his character shows beautiful nuances of humor and sensitivity. Do you love his innocent portrait of a simple village boy? who has great aspirations to be famous one day? yet he knows when to cut to reality. <br /> <br /> Camille, on the other hand, enters the film wearing clothes that no one would ever have dared wear in a place like that. It's still funny that no one seems to care too much about dressing that way. She looks very very dazzling though! Especially in the second half of the film, when it changes Indian clothes. His relationship with her boyfriend still seems very vague. It probably adds a touch of reality to certain types of relationships. <br /> <br /> Does the film take us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan ?? The surprising part is that none of the places have been portrayed differently from what it is REALLY. See the dirt, see the primitive houses ?? see Rajasthan exactly the way it is !! But yet ?? is there only one adjective that leaves you ?? 'beautiful'. <br /> <br /> This is the first director who probably knows how to play India exactly as it is - with dirt and noise and all the negatives to which India is attached! ?? Yet it seems to be one of the most beautiful places to be. <br /> <br /> Kudos! to him for that. <br /> <br /> The only downside of the film I could see is the rhythm ?? Did I find it slow in some parts ?? but I assure you that you will never be bored. <br /> <br /> Nitin Sawhney's background scores add an international, but very Indian touch to the film. The song "Angel", which plays at a crucial moment in the film, blends beautifully with the graphics. I also heard that in addition to the main characters, all the other actors are actually just normal people who had never faced a camera before !! This is laudable considering, most of our so-called established actors ?? I still can't portray realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> All in all, was watching this film a good experience ?? It is a pot pourri of emotions. Do you have romance, humor ?? realism?? beautiful images and settings ..., great music, an exceptional cast ?? A DEAL PACKAGE! When I left the theater - did I feel proud of being Indian ?? A few days later, I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who had seen the movie with me, if he wanted to see another Indian movie? and your answer was ?? "Is it better than Hari Om? If so, then I'll go? If not, I think I'll pass. From now on, Hari Om will be the reference point for every Indian film I see." Mr. Bala, are you reading?
