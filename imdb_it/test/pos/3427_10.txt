Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely my favorite, said that everyone should see this film because it is something that can help heal the world .... <br /> <br /> It is one of the most touching films that I have seen and commented on Tutu's comments .... I read many comments and while they go from good to average comments on the choice of actors ... The fact is that it is one of the most extraordinary events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission .... for the first time a country has chosen to broadcast its horrible story, to find a way forward and to create a way for people to heal ... <br /> <br /> WHile the film begins with the White Policeman who offers him the chance to absolve himself of brutal crimes and Black is trying to make sure he doesn't leave, he goes into the humanity of people and the enormous need for healing that we all need .... <br /> <br /> Definitely a thumbs up ..... To everyone involved ... Once again, I am proud to be a South African ..... <br /> <br /> An interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
