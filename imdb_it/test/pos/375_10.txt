When Alfred Hitchcock did STRANGERS ON A TRAIN he was a precursor to most of the public film that was back on top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not a box office success and his contractual agreement with David O. Selznick ended up for just that. Actually he made some really good films in the period, like NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were appreciated, the public was driven by Hitch's attempts to experiment: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with ROPE along confused the public (by ignoring the merits of that film), and Hitch's willingness to deceive the public by a lie told by a protagonist in a flashback was not welcome - much more nasty than later deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just like the scandal of star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it look like a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that had very little in its favor. <br /> <br /> With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock avoided the special tricks that interested him in recent films. Instead he focused on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story tells of how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets a fan - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who is traveling on an off-road train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and talkative, and Guy sees him as one of the typical fans he met ... if a little eccentric, with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket in space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton, a senator's daughter. Bruno knows that Miriam will not divorce her celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno mentions (apart from a cuff) the idea he has of two men - technically foreign - who exchange murders for each other and then commit two perfect and unsolvable crimes instead of arming them. The boy listens to the idea and agrees that it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination, and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He simply does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath, and believes that Guy has just consented to kill each other's enemies! <br /> <br /> It is actually a wonderfully simple storyline. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but fully expects Guy to respect the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified and, worse, discovers he is the number one suspect in the police department. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, says that he has the lighter of the latter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site, Guy is in deeper trouble - how to avoid the police and how to check (if possible) the crazy Bruno? <br /> <br /> Hitch has always carefully planned the shots of his film, so that from the beginning both of our "heroes" head for their fateful train ride with one another . In the film there are constant cross contacts to show how the two men are attracted to their respective orbits. It is as if fate drew them together. Yet both have their own personalities - and Hitch, with a typical turn, makes Bruno crazy actually more of an attractive figure. His plan could be vicious (he will kill two people if he is successful, and he will make sure Guy lives up to the agreement, no matter what) but has a taste for life. It is suspected that even Guy once had one, but the failure of his marriage, together with his dating of a woman of social importance, made him more circumspect and boring than he was. <br /> <br /> The cast is also good. Probably Robert Walker had his best role in this film (only a year before his death). He was very different from the guy next door from SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. Even his supple figure seemed very elegant in the stories in different scenes. As Guy Farley Granger behaves like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious of the authorities (since his previous role made his nervousness increasingly suspicious of Jimmy Stewart ). As for women, Kasie Rogers is just as cute as Miriam - allowing the public to prepare for her disappearance (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her glasses) so that they are actually encouraging Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as Anne's younger sister (Ruth Roman), who bears a close resemblance to Miriam, and accidentally starts Bruno on a social occasion. You interpret this rare role well. Ruth Roman is a valid supporter of Granger, but her role is limiting because she is established in her background, and somehow low key. Other supporting artists, Leo G. Caroll in the role of senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's eightieth mother, and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of Walker's violence are all shown to the best - all at the hands of a master.
