THE ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> An absolutely unique interpretation of silent cinema in this fairy tale by Esteban Sapir, beautifully crafted in black and white and practically without dialogue, "La Antena" is a feast for the eyes and a must for the lovers of German expressionist cinema, with most references to the works of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. <br /> <br /> 'The City without a Voice', 'La Ciudad sin Voz', is governed by Mr. TV. He has taken the voices of the inhabitants and has total control of all the words and images spoken, forcing everyone to eat their own TV food brand. Mr TV is not only a monopolist, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears as a symbol a number of times. He works secretly on a hypnotic device to control all the minds of citizens through his television broadcasts. To this end, he kidnaps the only one left with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but a television technician is witness to the kidnapping and flees to an old TV antenna in the mountains to stop Mr. TV's evil plans. <br /> <br /> The design of the production is stunning with beautiful sets and images. Although shot mainly with the basic language of silent cinema, Esteban Sapir also adds a series of new techniques, such as a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone talks to each other through text balloons (usually they float near their mouths), the louder they talk, the bigger the characters are. The texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed. In the opening sequence, we see a book, entitled "La Antena", which opens and a paper city rises from the pages. There are almost no references in Argentina. It is constantly snowing, which gives the film a very Argentine atmosphere, while the surreal setting suggests a great city in the northern hemisphere, with only some of the songs revealing the Argentine background of the film. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast and there is so much success on the screen, it is difficult to keep track of the film's surreal narrative. In addition to being incredibly beautiful to look at, we have also received some messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are breezily packaged. One of the most original films I've seen in years. A delight. <br /> <br /> The film was presented as an opening film at IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
