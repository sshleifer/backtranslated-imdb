If Family Guy offends you or just doesn't give you humor, unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the masses of excessively religious, boring and politically correct people in America. So put your morality aside and have fun with this show. FG is an exhilarating open mind on the reality of today's society. Who said this show is for an immature young audience, is very wrong. With all the references to old movies and politics from 10-80 years ago, I couldn't imagine any immature young boy finding it so funny. Family Guy is certainly for a mature and open public that is not afraid to criticize American society. An affectionate greeting to Seth and the entire crew who managed to make this show.
