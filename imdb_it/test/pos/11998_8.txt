This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite Columbo episodes of all time. The acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is brilliant and the direction is fabulous. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who plays brilliantly in every episode of Columbo, performs particularly well in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also, great performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. <br /> <br /> The ending is absolutely brilliant and I love the way Columbo describes it. > <br /> This is a Columbo film that WILL NOT GO, it's not good.
