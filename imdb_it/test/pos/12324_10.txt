The entire film, an artistic adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dubliners" stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters) and their niece), where a group of high-class Dubliners meets for an evening of music, recitations and dinner. Although there is a very small plot itself, the interaction and conversation between the groups reveals many things about Dublin in the early 20th century, when the stimuli for independence were just beginning. The cast, all talented Irish theater actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and one actually feels like a guest at the gathering itself. The poignant final scene, between Ms. Huston and the extraordinary Donal McCann, reveals much of the marriage of the characters. There is an intensity mixed with humor and intuition, and for those who like quiet and careful films, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we do a ritual of watching this wonderful film every January 6th. After many visions he never ceases to move me, and every time I collect something I missed before.
