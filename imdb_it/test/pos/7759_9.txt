Good animation, nice character design and a light story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, I thought this anime was pretty good, but it was much better for a second watch. <br /> <br /> This is because it is done in chronological order, and once you look at it in the correct order you notice connections that you didn't see before. (Or maybe you see a second meaning for some events you haven't noticed before). You might want to read Tanigawa Nagaru's original novels (not manga) before / after seeing this. The anime is very good at displaying every detail in the stories it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are some stories taken from the book that are not animated, but referred to. in episode 14) Overall, this anime is actually very good once after a brief plot analysis (reading the book also improves on it). It's a nice break from the anime shounen-jump that seem to take over.
