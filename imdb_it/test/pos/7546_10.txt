This classic comic of the antics of English girls is and has been one of the great classics of the art house. Then the art house disappeared with the arrival of the videos. And so is the audience for this film. The loss is not for art houses or for this great film. The loss is for those who will never have a real opportunity to see this memorable film masterpiece full of laughter. But I'm preaching to converts, it's not me. Who else would look for this movie?
