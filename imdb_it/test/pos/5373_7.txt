A family travels through the western half. There is widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and the small daughter of Ben K.T. (Geri Reischl). So hit a city called Hillsboro where everyone is acting strangely. Their car breaks down and they are forced to stay. They will soon discover that a witch coven has a spell over the city and is doing incredible harm. <br /> <br /> The story is not good. People understand things from nothing and it only happens to find out where the witches are at the end. Furthermore, there are many loopholes in the end. Even the acting is rather poor. Bateman and Capri are insignificant and all the others are more or less the same. Only the old professionals Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones gives good performances. This film still works. Give up blood and blood (there are some but this is PG) and work to work with some disturbing images and atmospheres. Acting hinders it a lot but still works. Martin in particular chews the scenario in his role. I can't explain exactly why I like this movie, but it worked for me. It is a kind of silent horror that is no longer realized. Hardly a masterpiece but this deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
