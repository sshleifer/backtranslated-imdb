I just saw this again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. This is why these kinds of films are made, to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and for everyone I showed to do it. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that runs into a group of escaped prisoners who have taken over an old farm. When a scarecrow (which in reality is a demon that I think) is disturbed, it takes life and revives dead bodies from local cemeteries. This leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two mad assassins who are torturing some people in a small town gastronomy. Soon it is a showdown with the humans fighting the zombies. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! From its different formats (black and white films, videos and digital cameras) at a very fast pace and great music, there was always something to do and NEVER bore you! Sure, it's cheap, but you can say that a lot of care and hard work has been put into this film. I have read other reviews and all I can say is that these people missed the point. If you want a Full Moon 35mm lint or if you like modern things like Urban Legend, then I tell you to broadcast it. If you like low budget things like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy it now. <br /> <br /> Makeup and blood are very good, the acting is sometimes irregular, but overall it is quite good and the editing is very impressive. There is enough to do in this to fill two more movies! It's actually one of the best b-movies I've seen in a long time.
