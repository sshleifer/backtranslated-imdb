Lead actor Yuko Tanaka fulfills so much of the extraordinarily meditative "The Milkwoman", a quiet search for missed opportunities in the life of a 50-year-old woman, who probes her routine with genuinely moving motivations. Performed in the picturesque and tranquil town of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is a less direct melodrama than a deliberate introspection of her characters' lives in their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not request. <br /> <br /> Perfectly embodying the necessary weariness of the world subject to a spiritless routine, Tanaka plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her shift in a supermarket, takes over the delivery of bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses that passes constantly to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee who takes care of his terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were in love with high school who, by courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, have since separated their streets. <br /> <br /> Opening his film with the presumptuous narration of a young Minako swearing never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does as such with the narration, patiently with Minako while he, ably helped by the discreet but very effective performance of Tanako follows her - whether she's talking to her aunt (Misako Watanabe) about being single, or jogging up and down the innumerable footprints of their hill town to distribute milk - while she and Kaita gradually overcome the obstacles that they kept them apart for years. This unhurried development cannot satisfy viewers who are weaned on fast-paced narratives, but otherwise, it is a heartfelt introspection that strikes in a powerful and emphatic way.
