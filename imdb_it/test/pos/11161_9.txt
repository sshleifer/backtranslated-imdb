In complete contrast to the previous correspondent, I thought that Shoppen Munich (as it was announced when it was presented with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was a lot of fun, very well acted and very well written. > <br /> It is rather bold to design a 100-minute film that consists exclusively and inexorably of talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff has succeeded with wit and momentum. No standard film device of, for example, following the pronunciation of a character that excludes the soul with a meditative music of minor-seventh string and long-turned natural cutaways. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - well, we were pushed by the timer man for another superficial presentation. Which is, of course, the point: the unbridled superficiality of thirty-two cities, where everything is down for a quick question and answer. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most films are so clich√© and stupid that we Brits are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and uncontrolled cinema, but I can promise you that tonight's screening (Curzon Cinema, Sunday 25 November 2007) the audience resonated for most of the public. So I wasn't the only one laughing! <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (who speaks German and lived in Munich) thought it was hilarious. I (who don't speak German and haven't been to Munich, I think) thought it was hilarious. I would recommend Shoppen (Monaco) to anyone (especially couples ...) looking for an intelligent, witty, original and wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of the generation that feels that they have lost happiness before then. <br /> <br /> NB In the English subtitles shown in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely below the slightly reduced image, not inside it. I thought it was a good thing.
