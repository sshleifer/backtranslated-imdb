Warning: if the Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in the film, neglect this review and move on. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed the "one-line summary" from the book on President Ronald Reagan, but, among other virtues, this film emphasizes the role the character plays in the life of honorable human beings . This film is full of honest and honest people and they have integrity to sell. In a word, they have "character". <br /> <br /> A small whinny: unless you know the history of the Second World War, you probably don't know, since Captain Correlli arrived on the island at the fall of Mussolini, 3 and a half years have passed . The average spectator might think that the love story was of the "vortex" variety. It is not so. Romanticism develops slowly, which gives dignity and meaning. The deliberate pace of the film could be the way the director marked time. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have criticized Cage's Italian accent. The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good. <br /> <br /> History has been right. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who for the most part were reluctant allies from the beginning. If you find it shocking, keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940, immediately after the capitulation of France, for fear that it would fall into the hands of the Vichy government, or worse, the Nazis. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to a cultured and cultured civilization. <br /> <br /> This film was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical. The script was not inspiring, nor was it intelligent, but here was a situation where confusion and intelligence were not necessary, nor would they have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> The story is tender and the message is uplifting. The characters are honest, courageous, sincere, understanding and sympathetic. It's a nice little movie. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
