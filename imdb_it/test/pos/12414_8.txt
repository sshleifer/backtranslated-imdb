This is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like laughter with your horror, this is the movie for you. The fabric of a true cult classic. It has everything you want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, A hero, The fool, A TRUCK MOSTRO and, of course, a family of mutated satanic assassins. This is full of blood, guts and blood. I highly recommend watching it early in the morning and being attentive to those who see you enjoying the sounds of monster trucks, Bad {But Funny} One liners and our hero eating stew with his eyes. Not as good as the Evil Dead but a close second. Remember only ATTENTION ... DO NOT EAT BEFORE YOU VIEW THIS FILM ...
