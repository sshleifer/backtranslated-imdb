Buster Keaton was undoubtedly the most pleasant when he shot short 20-minute films, and they didn't come more rib-tickling than this gem. The cartoon of the dead pan is involved in a photographic mix with a wanted criminal. This leads to his elaborate evasion of numerous street policemen and other passengers who recognize his face with the "Wanted" signs. The Capra is a real blater with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene to the bread's tail, to the wonderful pursuit of the elevator at the end. A Keaton film never feels like it's missing its silence, because the sound is never something you needed with him. His films are explained through the wonderful (but incredibly dangerous) things he did to himself. It is not difficult to understand how influential he was in reality - man is just as amazing today as he was in 1921.
