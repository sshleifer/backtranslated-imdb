I could never imagine that I would start to love movies like this. After seeing Yimou Zhang's hero, I decided to check out his other films, perhaps looking for something similar. Yimou Zhang's second film I saw was "No One Less", after which I realized what kind of cinema I am now. No wonder why I immediately kept "Keep Cool". It's a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, I respect the director. <br /> <br /> This film shows that it is not the amount of money that makes the film good. It is about what the director wants to show and how good he is at doing it. The plot is very simple, a typical extract of a typical daily life, moreover, shown in a very simple way, the camera movements also strengthen the impression and the sensation of the film. I give this film a high rating and look forward to seeing more Yimou Zhang films.
