I'm a happily married 49-year-old woman who just loved LOVING this movie to death. <br /> <br /> The character of Geena Davis is strong, intelligent and excited ........... .... I thought she had done an excellent job (this is a euphemism) in this film . <br /> <br /> I'm not very important in action movies, but I thought it was so sexy and fun. /> <br /> You are my alter ego ............. when you start putting that assault rifle in the old hotel room .......... .. ......... I had chills ............... he did it as if he knew what he was doing ............ this is one of my MANY favorite parts in that movie ........ <br /> <br /> I think he deserved an Oscar for his acting and physical roles ........ <br / > <br /> I will have "CHARLY" tattooed on my back .............. I am one of those girls who WILL NEVER BE A VICTIM ....... ..... .......... I am like her ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly ........ and isn't that oh so sexy?)
