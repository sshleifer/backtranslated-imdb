Rabbit seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in a war of words and intelligence about whether it is rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy mix up "the problem of the pronoun" with Daffy always victim of Elmer's rifle, with its beak that is always dismembered. Then there is the rabbit's disguise that always gets Elmer in his love mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always my favorites in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious cartoons from the hunting trilogy I've laughed at since I was a child. And at least two of them end with the exclamation of Daffy to Bugs: "You are despicable!" I can't improve this!
