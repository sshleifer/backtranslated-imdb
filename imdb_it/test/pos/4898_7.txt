There are two ways to turn a TV series into a movie. <br /> <br /> The first, the most common and the least successful, is to make a feature-length television episode, see the disasters of Steptoe & Son film. The second is to do something else, something very different, at Monty Python. Fortunately, the creators of the cult TV series went for the second option, and they came up with something unique, smart and fun - it couldn't seem like a TV episode. <br /> <br /> Try to understand it: the writers, playing themselves, are confronted with their alter-ego by Royston Vasey, played, of course, by them, and said to continue writing the series, otherwise the apocalypse will come to the village. <br /> <br /> High concept, invented and easy to ruin? Yes, but somehow they managed to do it. Not to everyone's taste, perhaps, and the ending drags on, but the fans will be delighted, and could even win over the uninitiated.
