I read most of the comments here, everyone saw only the flaws in the movie. I agree, the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not Oscar winners, but he has something that everyone could identify with. I don't want to spoil but to tell more about the plot - the end of school and the journey to a big party, or if you like to see beyond the metaphor, it's choosing the path through life. Do you remember those days of youth? the days when you or our friend acted like characters? Or do you think you should act like one of them and now you regret not doing it? if you can go back at that moment and if you can ask any of these questions, maybe the movie wasn't so bad.
