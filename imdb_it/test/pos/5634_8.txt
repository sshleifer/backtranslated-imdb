What gives this film its personality is knowledge, in the end, that is all true. While it is a compelling and humorous documentary that borders on mockumentary in some parts (are they staged or is it really happening humorously?), It seems to be a bit long towards the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun in the places it has to be, and it runs relatively well. Remember Christopher Guest's movies, if you like them or adapt then I suggest you take a look at it. <br /> <br /> B +
