Little Gus is a ten-year-old criminal. Run away from his parents and decide to take a trip. Reaching the petal is quite difficult for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a deceptive lottery card game called Motorama. He must find all eight letters to write M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. A dark laugh follows that turns into a journey from hell. He comes across some deranged characters like Lynch. The most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in the hope that God sees it. Later Gus gets a tattoo and an eye patch for his injured eye. Become one of the 10 most rebellious and evil years you could ever see on the screen. This is not a children's movie! Look for the cameos of Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be careful, even if Drew is in the front row, he only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple of seconds. Even the film gets confused towards the end of David Lynch's territory, you might want to see it a couple of times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his scripts for "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss". Enjoy this surreal journey depraved of fun!
