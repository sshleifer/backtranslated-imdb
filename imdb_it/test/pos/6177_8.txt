I am Czech and soldiers (not just pilots) who fled Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me. This film by Oscar-winning director "Kolya" (1996) is a tribute to these men. It is the first large-screen film on Czechoslovak soldiers of the Second World War from "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music etc. The film is half in English and some actors are British. But the best thing about this film is that it is pure existence. It is a great opportunity to show people all over the world (and also to many people in the Czech Republic ...) that the Czechoslovak role in World War II was not only an occupied country but an active member of the Allied campaign. <br /> <br /> The main characters are Frantisek and the younger Karel, older and wiser. They have fled together from Czechoslovakia, are flying in the same squadron and fell in love with the same woman ... Perhaps it is a clich√©, but fortunately this plot is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including great fights). I don't want to compare "Dark Blue World" with "Pearl Harbor", someone will like PH more and someone will want DBW. But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. So, I think it's a great movie for everyone who likes this kind of story and a very nice movie that wants to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history. <br /> <br /> BTW, main theme "Dark Blue World" is by the Czech composer from the 30s and 40s Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this subject when he lost his eyes ...
