Wow. When I went to this film at the Toronto Film Festival I had no idea what I expected. This film takes you on an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the word. Sigourney Weaver was better than what I've seen from her in years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how this will not be every person's cup of tea, since sometimes these are pretty hard things that can happen to a family. Don't get me wrong - it's also very funny - the audience burst into applause after I laughed again and again. I just think that if you are open to examining your life, Imaginary Heroes will touch you sincerely. I can't wait for it to come out in theaters.
