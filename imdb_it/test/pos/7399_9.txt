Where to start, I like the scary snow monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought it would come back and it was. Changing the venue in a tropical resort works. See old friends and meet new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost, you can tell when an actor enjoys playing a villain, you can see it or, in this case, listen to it in the show. Yup, Jack Frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better than the first. I have a complaint, the little Jacks or Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the CGI was good and, overall, it's worth watching over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. No question or debate, 9 BIG STARS.
