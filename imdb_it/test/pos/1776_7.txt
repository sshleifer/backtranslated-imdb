Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, Out of the Past) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green was My Valley), Anne of the Indies is a very interesting pirate adventure film. Captain Anne Providence's main character is based on a true pirate-woman Anne Boney who lived and sailed in the 18th century Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the naval battle where Anne's (Jean Peters) pirate ship attacks a commercial ship that was coming to Europe from South America. As a result, a treasure of great value is captured along with a fine French officer, Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who is taken prisoner. Anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently his feelings are reciprocated, but it is only until she frees him when he discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly (Debra Paget) with whom he is very much in love. Anne starts planning revenge on both, but in an unexpected turn of events she ends up making a big sacrifice to save them. Even the cliché figure of the pirated "Black Beard" movie makes its appearance here, this time played by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Anne of the Indies seems to be neither more nor less than a revisitation of the pirate cliché film, it still has its classic moments in stunning images and sequences of naval battles filmed in Technicolor and some aspects of history and especially in personal touches directed by Jacques Tourneur. 7/10
