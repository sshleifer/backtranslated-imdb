This splicing of THE SEARCHERS is one of the strangest films I've ever seen, shot by an Englishman in an unknown and unknown Mexico. It is often said that the best films about America are made by foreigners, who can approach the family with the eyes of a stranger. But this crazy movie is something else. Although apparently in post-Civil War America, this is not an America recognizable by myth, cinema, TV, etc. The film has an air of timeless fable, dealing specifically with Western mythology. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses the horse of the title as a central point to interconnect stories, all about the traditional Western clash between primitive and civilization. The first seems to have the upper hand. The vast scrub and desert of the film's landscape are intact, ripe for the allegories of the mind. The only short sites of civilization are a diligence of missionaries and landowners, and their hacienda, from which both derive anything but civilized behavior. <br /> <br /> The basic story relates three stories. In one, a aimless deserter, Pike, having lost his business partner, steals a miraculous horse, the Eagle's Wing, named for his grace and speed. In the second, an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse, leaves a boat and abducts one of his female occupants. In the third, the Spaniards sent to find her ignoring this quest in favor of a murderous and merciless revelry. <br /> <br /> Although he is a Western revisionist, the treatment of Indians is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character is never explained, forever inscrutable, denied a voice, except for a heartbreaking seizure of songs. When he is not a strange Other, he is a symbol, whose role is not completely resolved - at one point a savage brute, in another he embodies nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But at the beginning Pike notices that the film will be present at the time of primitivism before civilization. In many respects the film resembles 2001 - A ODYSSEY OF THE SPACE, in particular its opening sequence. Part of the film's power lies in the connections between the three disparate characters, forcing us to see the mythical struggles and searches in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are linked by superstition, ritual, greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musicians and alcoholics. The White Bull is demonized by both Pike and the abdomen as a "bastard", involuntarily revealing the tactic of illegitimacy used by colonizing whites who made the natives childlike, becoming themselves "necessary" fathers. <br /> <br /> Unlike a traditional Westerner, worried about making history, civilization and progress, this film is a double detective storyline, which interrogates the past, the tracks, the remains. <br /> <br /> I think that what gives this film its extraordinary uniqueness is, despite Maltin's racism, its Britishness. The climate stall is more like an Arthurian carousel. The film itself bravely avoids dialogue for the most part, creating the kind of visual and sound tapestry that Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE, and something that few Hollywood directors would have dared. The existential doubling and the reasons for research are more a European myth than an American one (similar to another British film Harvey Keitel, THE DUELLISTS). <br /> <br /> The most surprising is the use of nature. Most Westerners use the landscape as a scenario that inspires fear: there is little sense of actually living in the West. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING is like a film by Powell and Pressberger, with nature a powerful and pantheistic character in its own right: alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is a sublime scene that reminds A CANTERBURY TALE, when the jewels trapped by White Bull among the trees are suddenly pushed by the wind: there is a disturbing, tingling, magical, electrifying effect that is more reminiscent of the Arabian Nights that a horse lyric music. Heartstopping.
