That's sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the Gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira who loves the dark. Another small tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her faith was Roy Munsin's hostess in King Pin. This is the most glorious story ever told. He should sell more copies of the Bible. My parents played a role in suggesting the release of this film in a local cinema. The film lasted a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. The lady who kicked off (friend of the family) was left to go to the theater. I was 3 years old. I burned 4 copies on VHS and finally converted it to DVD. It's beautiful.
