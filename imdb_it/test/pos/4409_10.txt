Just to correct something in a previous review here, I don't think this film is only for people who know London, it's a case of a very specific situation used to make universal comments. Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that they were characters who, by going through this exhausting test of knowledge, gain a little knowledge of themselves. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the most perfectly written dramas I've seen: technically it's extremely adept at transmitting fairly complex details but it's also joyful in the way it involves you. At first you don't know about this London Knowledge test of the main characters, but you are collected until it is of vital importance to you. You become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed for those who do not. Above all one whose ruin, without giving anything, will make your hands fly in your face. <br /> <br /> Even as a de facto character, the character of Nigel Hawthorne, Mr Burgess, is called the Vampire, not Dracula. You don't need to know, I'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of drama: once you've seen it, you'd like everyone to do it and you will evangelize on every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you can see it. <br /> <br /> William
