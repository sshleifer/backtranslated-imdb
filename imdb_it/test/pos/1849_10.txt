I LOVE THIS FILM !!! <br /> <br /> This beautiful and fascinating love story immediately attracted me with its lovely characters and its heart-warming love story. I became so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt like I knew them personally. The plot is very fascinating and led me to cry at different moving moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very nice and chaste relationship that you can't help but be involved. It's worth looking at it more than once and showing it to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't it a big hit? <br /> <br /> I gave this 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And this comes from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 films are not even worth watching).
