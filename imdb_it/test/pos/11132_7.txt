A recent survey of children in the UK reinforced the notion proposed by this film 27 years ago. Being more than anything else, young people want to grow to become famous. They were doctors and firefighters that the children wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is the story of a group of boys accepted in the High School for Performing Arts in New York City. We saw them for the first time, then we take lessons and learn life for the next four years. The film has many beautiful qualities, but in the end it leaves you a little dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits the story quite well. The film has been classified as a musical, but more than anything it is a drama. The musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realism as they could really be filmed. Acting is for the most part top-drawers, with few exceptions. The pace is a bit off, especially towards the end of the film, but at that point, the story has already made some wrong turns. <br /> <br /> First of all, the auditions at the beginning of the film should have eliminated a couple of main characters. It seems unlikely that someone will come and audition for a department, then stumble between admissions and the other. Some of these people simply don't seem so talented or interested in the beginning. Once the first year of lessons begins, the film turns into a beautiful groove. The interaction between students and teachers is very well managed and leaves you wanting more. The film begins to get lost later, when we see more and more students' lives outside of school. Some of these people do not deserve to be taken into consideration. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of the film is to make the character of Ralph Garcy so important. This guy is an ugly one; self-centered jerk. A "professional hole" as he proudly declares on stage during his plays. The public should feel somehow for this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I just hoped they would get his ass out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you care about when this movie is finished. As for me, I still can't develop abs like Gene Anthony Ray in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is good. It's memorable, interesting and full of bold scenes and shows. It works maybe a little too long, and maybe some of the wrong characters develop completely while others move in the background. The musical numbers are fantastic, and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered when the film is finished. Although not perfect, Fame will be a film that lives in one way or another for many years to come. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
