"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film. In addition to Peter O'Toole's wonderfully controlled and understood performance as a pedant of the school that finds love and has changed, the film contains hundreds of extraordinary visual effects, from the Greek ruins to the side streets of London to an extensive campaign montage. Leslie Bricusse's music and lyrics have been criticized as boring or not up to musicals, but they are used to improve the story rather than tell. Many songs are used to underline montages or scenes; the few that are not relegated to "show biz" numbers. In this way, the songs do not intrude on this delicate story but intensify what the characters are thinking or feeling. "Where did my childhood go?", "Walk Through the World With Me" and "You and I" are particularly effective. An engaging, brilliantly acted, directed and written film.
