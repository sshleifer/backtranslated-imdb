Um, hello .. Rainbow Brite .. the name alone is hard to take seriously, as Strawberry Shortcake's cousin might be ... but when you're a child, this is definitely serious stuff. <br /> <br /> So, there is this vile, snotty and spoiled girl and she wants the Rainbow Brites belt, among other things, namely the light of the entire universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop it. As a souvenir, Murky and Lurky played a secondary role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money? <br /> <br /> So anyway, brat, wicked girl has a powerful jewel and she channels her power to take the Rainbow belt .. imagine? But somehow, Rainbow retrieves the belt and re-energizes it with "sprinkle of stars" and kicks the ass of bad girls with the help of Cris and her prismatic bracelet, and also saves the entire universe in the process . <br /> <br /> So the triumph over evil is good, kindness triumphs over rudeness and Rainbow Brite and Color Kids are once again sure of spreading color and joy for all of humanity.
