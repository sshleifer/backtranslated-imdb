forget the over-rated "Batman Begins, THIS is the last Batman movie you won't want to miss. This movie has it all, and totally surpasses the first mega hit of 1989. It may not have done as well the first at the box office, but this is definitely a much better film, the images are fantastic, Burton works his magic like he always does in his films. Gotham city, Batman's hunting ground, is an incredible sight to see, the story itself is pretty good and the 2 bad in this are VERY interesting, much more interesting in fact then there are comics counterparts: Tim Burton and writer Daniel Walters take a step forward to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters the Penguin, played to perfection by Danny Devito, is a kind of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge for the world that denied him, very disgusting to look at sometimes, but it has some more classic lines that a villain could ever pronounce in a single movie. the other bad one is Catwoman, played in an absolutely brilliant way by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and who gives a WOW representation, and totally steals the show until that moment. she too has a tragic background. her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very put-on mousy secretary, for a shrewd businessman named Max Shreck, who later kills her by pushing her out a window. somehow, it survives and is "woken up" by the cats, and decides immediately and there to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, obviously, the extraordinary sequence in which she leaves completely free and destroys her entire apartment in one of the most worthy Oscar performance of anger and rage I've ever seen in an actress. Michael Keaton once again wears the cloak and hood as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS time is much darker. there's not much more to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever. he oozes cold, and has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and it's very dark. he doesn't talk much, and when he does, it sounds very good and doesn't sound his whole foolish voice and pretend IE bales "batman" voice in batman starts. he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he is psychologically disturbed, and you know it. on this trip he makes fun of two of the most famous villains to embellish the world of Batman comics. <br /> <br /> I have to say though, despite the beauty of the action scenes, like the coolest Batmobile scenes EVER running down the street slamming the thugs on the ground and the batman slipping on Gotham, it's the romantic corner between Pfieffer and Keaton which makes this classic of the film the best choice for anyone who wants to see the real Batman in action, I consider it a 10, I would give it more if I could.
