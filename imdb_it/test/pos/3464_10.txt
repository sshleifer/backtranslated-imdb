If you want a film with all the range of emotions, look no further; dramatic and fun, and excruciating emotion scenes; I can safely guarantee that VERY will be able to see this hot and VERY human film without shedding tears from time to time. The acting of the two protagonists is hard to believe; you would swear that the two young people really suffer from Muscular Dystrophy (Rory) and Cerebral Paralysis (Michael); simply, two of the most beautiful performances I've ever seen; these too are two believable characters, and one never feels that things have been "thrown" for dramatic purposes or to arouse sympathy. In the DVD version as "extra" they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternate ending) and an "extended party sequence"; the reason why these clips were not included in the final film is difficult to understand, since they fit perfectly with the rest of the film and are absolutely not superfluous. But without reservations I can strongly recommend this film to anyone; one of the best I've ever seen.
