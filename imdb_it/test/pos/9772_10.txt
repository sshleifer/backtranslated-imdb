I never sat down for six hours watching a miniseries, but Changi changed it. I'm not going to lie, I know some Australian movies can be pathetic and boring (actually, I quite like Australian movies but maybe I'm biased) but Changi is on a completely different lane. Although not historically accurate, as we are constantly reminded, the show combines superb acting, an excellent script and the addition of humor to provide us with a fun and emotional perception of life in a WWII prison camp. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the show was not meant to be a documentary, so don't let the errors actually disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series features this kind of creative writing by John Doyle (aka Roy Slaven) who is known more for his comedy than anything else, and an excellent director and actors move this creativity perfectly. If you want to see how much hard work has been done in this series, visit the official website, it's very interesting and you'll learn a lot about the real changi accounts. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Changi yet, make sure you don't do anything for a whole day because you'll want to watch the series in its entirety.
