After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is another great Aparna sen film (mainly in English). In the previous film he treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled members of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel subtitle it treats a philosophical concept of "reality". It is a film that leads to thinking after seeing the film. <br /> <br /> Mithee, the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen), suffers from Schizophrenia which is treated by her older sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). Mithee after his marriage with Jojo and the separation from him believes he is still with JOJO and his five children on 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta (there is no similar address in Kolkotta - it seems there is one in New York) and she is intense in her belief It is almost like an intense religious belief. Ultimately, what is reality? In one scene he tells Anjali "if I tell you that you are not a professor but just imagine that you are a professor". The open ending reflects this reality. In an alleged search for her home in the park alley, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is Mithee who watches a group of five children playing and she looks at them with joy to return to her family and then she is lost. About this concept of reality, another movie from the Fifties called HARRY with James Stewart comes to mind. The protagonist believes that a big rabbit (?), Called Harry, is always with him and is always conversing with him. In the end, even the doctor believes that maybe it's Harry. What is the reality, is what the protagonist believes or what else he believes that Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with his exceptional interpretation of the older sister with a background of frustration. Also Konkana Sen Sharma offers equally schizophrenic performances. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not as tight as Mrs and Mr. Iyer. There seem to be some outstanding points. And maybe there are too many characters. Those who want a closed end may not appreciate the ending open here. But the ending fits the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Yet another fine Aparana film.
