Not a box office success; nobody really knows why. He may have failed simply because of his title. You seem to need a two-word title to attract a sufficient percentage of the idiot crowd: "Die Hard", "Lethal Weapon", "Hard Weapon", "Die Lethal", etc. - talking about "the long goodnight kiss" will not get you anywhere. But for once, Renny Harlin made a GOOD action movie. Much of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, soon gains our affection and interest. As he turns Charly again, we are torn: we certainly want Charly to wave the bad guys, and everything else; but we don't want you to lose contact with Samantha to do it, even though we also like Charly. Geena Davis gives all her considerable charm to both halves of the central character. Samuel L. Jackson plays the second violin for a change. It turns out he is good at it. It was a compliment. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, far superior to anything in the series "Die Hard" - if I were more cynical, I would add, "not surprising that it didn't work well", but I don't really feel that way; It is surprising that it did not work well.
