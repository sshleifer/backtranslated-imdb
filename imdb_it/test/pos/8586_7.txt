It is always nice to see a film that teaches us history in Africa because they are far too few. However, the film portrays Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist ..., it seemed difficult to sympathize with this kind of leadership, yet the film is a bit like a tribute to the man. There was too little content, which explained how the man got up in the first place and the whole context of Belgium "letting them go". So it's definitely worth seeing how the acting and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu himself. I would have liked a better political analysis.
