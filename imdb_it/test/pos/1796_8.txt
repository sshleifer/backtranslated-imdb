The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about the lack of love. The film begins with the main character; Hans Epp, returning from a spell in the foreign legion. He returns to his mother, so as not to hear how much he loves him, or how much he has missed him; but to be told that it is useless and, worse still, that he would have preferred that the man he went with had returned. It is the character's relationship with women that makes this film so hateful; the fact that his wife is taller than him is a symbol of his relationship with the other gender; he is constantly humiliated by them, and it is through his relationships with them that his life is not as great as it could have been. This is also clearly demonstrated by the way he treats his wife after a drink. He lost his job as a policeman through the lust of a woman and even his wife; a woman who should love him never shows any affection for him. Even at the end, his wife is more worried about what her daughter and she will do than her husband's status. <br /> <br /> The merchant of the four seasons is a really unpleasant film. There is no scene in the film where someone is happy, and not just that; but the film seems deliriously happy to bask in the misery of its central characters. The film is certainly not recommended to anyone who is going through a difficult time, that's for sure. Despite all the suffering, the film never exceeds the limits of reality; every event in this film can - and most likely has happened - and only serves to make the film more shocking. The film is, of course, directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the cult German director who committed suicide in 1982. This is just my second taste of man's work, but through just two films, it's easy to get an idea of ​​the kind of art he creates. Both films are trampled and gritty - but realistic pieces of art. Its characterization in this film is subtle; we only know the characters through their difficult situation and not through their character. This is a very smart way of showing the public that it is the environment that defines the people in the film, not the people themselves - and almost everyone who sees the film knows what it is like to live in an urban society, it won't be difficult for most people to relate to. <br /> <br /> The merchant of the four seasons is not a film that is easily forgotten; the film is rich in substance and low in style, and this makes the image truly memorable, an experience that all those who consider themselves fans of the cinema should try. It is with this in my mind that I give this film my highest advice; it is not sweet and it is not pleasant, but you will not see a more realistic portrait of depression, and this is certainly a film that will remain with you.
