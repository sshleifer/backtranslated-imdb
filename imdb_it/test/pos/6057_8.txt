I was a marine at Camp Pendleton when the D.I. released (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember being in line with a group of other Marines to watch the movie at the "Star" theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We didn't even expect the film to describe everything we had experienced in the training camp but we were pleasantly surprised at how well the film was made. The idea of ​​using real marines in the film was a great idea (I think they were all true masters of training). As an actor like Jack Webb, he could not "call the cadence" as a true marine drilling instructor. <br /> <br /> We all laughed when the mother of the "problematic" recruit came to the training camp to speak to the Captain. It would never have happened in a million years, but it's Hollywood, and we didn't let that episode stop us from enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> I went through the MCRD training camp in San Diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there were virtually no limits to what the DIs could do for you. The "Ribbon Creek" event in Parris Island had not yet touched the boot camp, at least not at the MCRD - San Diego. I agree with what many of the other reviewers have commented about the sergeant. Moore's "rigidity" around his girlfriend. I think this was just Webb's acting style, and even though they could have deleted this part of the film, it didn't hurt production much. <br /> <br /> A minor note, the (unaccredited) character of "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, the sergeant. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill used to tell us that one day he wanted to be an actor. We secretly laughed at this, but it surprised us all. He was a great drilling instructor and I thought he did well in his part. He also really enjoyed throwing knives. He often demonstrated his skill with us that summer in the training camp. I have often wondered if he is still alive.
