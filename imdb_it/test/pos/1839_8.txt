This film has no pretense of being a great art, which is good. But it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it I could do without the drama surrounding his wife, but he wasn't distracted enough to downplay the main story about the character of Minnie Driver. Too often Hollywood often abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try to inject more visual dramas when, with an adult-themed film like this, the kind of emotional drama is all that is really necessary - and probably even more credible. Overall, it's a very well made offer and worth seeing.
