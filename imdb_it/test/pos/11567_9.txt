Being a 90 year old girl, I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it a lot and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I don't know why; the first cartoons of the 90s had something special; I don't know if it was the atmosphere of uncertainty, a generational change, whatever. But "Tiny Toons" has maintained the atmosphere of the 90s and produced one of the most popular, fun and undervalued cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> Memories are obscure but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show. Easily, no other cartoon made me laugh tenderly (before entering dark teen oriented sitcoms). <br /> <br /> The characters were all fun and had the distinction of not having a real protagonist. Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a protagonist.
