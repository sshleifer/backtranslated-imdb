David Cronenberg's films are easily identifiable, or at least elements of the film stand out as his brands. Fetishism, the blur between organic and inorganic, soft and pulsating things that should not be soft and palpitating. "eXistenZ" is the classic Cronenberg. In short, it is a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, the images are provided by your mind. The game fits directly into a "bio door" at the base of the spine and while the game is running, the player cannot tell the reality from the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game's developer, leading a novice writer, Jude Law, through the game's lines. During the game they discover strange things and possible crimes. But are they real, or is it the game? Not even the author of the game knows it. <br /> <br /> The film is a real show, keeping the viewer busy, but in the dark until the last minute. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it doesn't rely heavily on special effects, it's the story itself that drives the film. Recommended for Saturday nights when science fiction is required.
