In seeing this film, I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the writing was rough, since some dialogues seemed elaborate and invented, the script had shining moments. (My favorite sentence, "Life is like a rich meringue, and I'm diabetic, so I can't enjoy it ..."). The plot was new and refreshing compared to some of the more recent "main-stream" horror that most of us (unfortunately) are getting used to. I think some scenes could (should) be longer (and maybe even shorter). The superfluous use of blood was camped, but in the end it seemed to make sense ... Ah, the end. The end would have been a little better if they had explained why what happened happened. (I don't want to ruin it). You might even have added to the time of the film, which is in the area of ​​"it's only an hour, how good could it be?" Answer: pretty good.
