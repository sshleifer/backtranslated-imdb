I think this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I've seen most of her films. I saw it for the first time on television when I was about fourteen, and I was so scared. I watch this film every once in a while, and I still like it a lot. I know this film probably won't scare people too much these days. This shows that the public of cinema and television has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so. I love movies that don't show graphic details, let your imagination do the work for you. The cast of this film is top notch. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story, was very good, even though her part was rather small. He also starred in a television thriller set in the same period, called You'll Never See Me Again with David Hartman. I got the biggest success of Eileen Heckart's performance as a housekeeper. Eileen was as good as a lady with a bad disposition. George Maharis, who played the husband, was quite effective. This story obviously had many mistakes in the plot, but I love the movie. I highly recommend this film to those who love a good thriller without graphic violence. I gave this film a vote of seven.
