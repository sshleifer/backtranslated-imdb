By now, the game has expired, right? <br /> <br /> The jokes have been made. It's all over. The creative genius who led this game for the first two games was gone after all. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> The game is still intact, the lines are here, folks. Of course, they are all rehash, but so was Monkey Island 2. And 1, for that matter. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is well positioned, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously difficult 2. The ship the combat sub-game is badly inadequate, in the tradition of sub-games. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When you are asked for a membership card on an exclusive beach, always select "I don't need to see my identification". It is worth the price of the game alone.
