One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that although it dates back quite firmly to the second post-war period, the issues of which you speak are as real today as they were in the VE or VJ of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate the war veterans of return is as old as the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And even if we don't often learn from history, we can be grateful that for once the United States of America has to learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous world war. The Charter of Rights of the GIs is cited in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was probably the largest social law of the last century. So many veterans have taken advantage of it as well as veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell you see here. <br /> <br /> All three of these actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the world the United States could identify with. They all meet on a military transport plane that flies into their hometown, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March, Andrews, Russell's greatest football buddy would probably never have met in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they meet and the war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken. <br /> <br /> March is the oldest, a man with two children and the perfect Hollywood wife, Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and in the best. He has wonderful scenes, he gets drunk drunk on his return and later with a little liquor in him, he tells the bank officials at a bland banquet. <br /> <br /> I also like his scene in which another return veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his piece of land. Watch March's expressions as he hears the tone of the man's money. You can hear him read the soul of man. That's what got him his second Oscar for best actor for this film. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a true veteran who lost both hands during his service in the Pacific. He received a special Oscar recognition for his performance. For this reason it was probably unfair to name him in the supporting actor category which he also won. His performance, particularly his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his love that loves him with or without hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, an Army Air Corps bomber. Of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed. He also comes from the poorer background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly assignment checks are what led Virginia Mayo to be interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he is much less in his civilian eyes. <br /> <br /> While Mayo is out and about with Steve Cochran, Andrews is fortunate to have March's daughter Teresa Wright, who is interested in him. They are the main story of the film, Andrews adapts to civilian life and adapts to the fact that he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran problems have been solved with GI Bill. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy gets a little recognition for the best years of our lives. My hypothesis is that it is because his wife role was too similar to the stereotypical roles of the wife who had patented at MGM. Still as March's wife and Wright's mother, it's really the glue that holds that family together. <br /> <br /> The best years of our lives won as best films for Sam Goldwyn, the best director of William Wyler and some others in addition to the two Oscar awards he received. It was a critical and popular success, perhaps the best film ever produced by Sam Goldwyn. It remains a captivating and lasting classic to this day and will remain so for centuries. It's almost three hours, but your interest will never diminish. <br /> <br /> The best tribute from this film came from Frank Capra who made his film at that year's Oscars in different categories. In his memoirs he said he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created a masterpiece that deserved every prize he could get for it. <br /> <br /> By the way, the film in which Capra had hoped was It's A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives cannot get better praise than that.
