I can't understand why so many people didn't like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his game, offering his lines with this aplomb, one must believe that this is his daily demeanor. Of course, the film seemed to take many buddy-movie conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it's obvious that this movie was really funny. From the police dog, to the fact that Eddie Murphy didn't bother me, this movie is a real goalkeeper. Rene Russo also perfectly matched the rest of the cast, establishing his role so as not to interfere with the nascent relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
