Easily the most respected film by Lucio Fulci, "Do not Torture a Duckling" is very famous for its angular themes, gruesome images and strong plot. The terror falls on a small Italian village when young boys begin to be murdered, overwhelming the confused authorities and determining more a detective dedicated in the mystery. Was he the scary hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the prostitutes? The rich girl? Somebody else? Contrary to the frequent representation of most fans on the violent content of the film - I consider it much more guided by the plot; with only a real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards). In no way does this diminish the positive attributes that this film offers. Fulci proves to be fully capable of bringing out a hell of a dark and disquieting mystery with child killing, black magic and, of course, a nice complete set of clapper ... Although I am particularly fond of "Lizard in a Woman" by Fulci "and" New York Ripper "," Do not Torture an Duckling "dominates the yellow genre as a mysterious mysterious murder!
