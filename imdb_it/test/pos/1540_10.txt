"Closet Land" was sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political implications, but there is much more to this story so rich in emotions ... <br /> <br /> It is not just about the political tension of Alla late 80s - this is the personal persecution that a woman suffers as a child who has been molested by a family friend. We see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest governmental / corporate structure and the culture of sexual predation in which one in four children is harassed and one in three women has suffered some form of rape. <br /> <br /> me, raises a chilling question of chicken and eggs: the attitude of our sexual repression that leads to predation creates the political environment of fear and censorship, or socio-political dysfunction feeds a culture of sexual predation? The psychological implications of even asking this question force us to a place where we are led to develop our answers. <br /> <br /> In the end, our writer (Stowe) has a similar time to Hensen's "End of the Labyrinth" - she realizes in a brilliant and brilliant moment that the idea of ​​having her steal the power from the secret police (Rickman) is an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can only make you give up on you, and then you have the right to take it back at any time. <br /> <br /> It is not a film to be inserted lightly, and certainly you do ENTER. The minimalist aspects associated with infant animation arouse the deepest parts of the psyche and leave the viewer unchanged.
