This is without doubt the most incredible and amazing documentary I've ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and breathtaking. Furthermore, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this grabs you and doesn't give up until the end. You will be so attracted and enchanted by what you are watching that you will forget about watching TV at home! This series is available for purchase on DVD and I highly recommend you pick this up! With all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series provides us with proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving.
