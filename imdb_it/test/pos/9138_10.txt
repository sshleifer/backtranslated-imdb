THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> It could be the most beautiful film ever made, in the most literal sense of the word. Men here never lose control and never - not once - show their emotions. No dramatic explosion in this film. All are fantastic all the time. It is an abstract dream world, in which men live according to their code, a gangster code with the values ​​of the absent external world. In this masterfully filmed robbery saga, Melville faces the American thriller in his clearly dark and desolate style, but done in style with a heavy budget of ten million dollars and with four of the greatest French stars of the time. Alain Delon as the professional thief, Yves Montand in the role of a former alcoholic policeman, the Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as an escaped criminal and André Bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical police chief. <br /> <br /> Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE is his penultimate film and he is truly a masterfully stylized character. He also claimed that he wanted to make a color noir film and in many ways he succeeded. The two main influences for this film were the John Huston's 1950 film THE HATFALT JUNGLE and Jules Dassin's REFIFI (1955). But unlike these films, where we learn a lot in the background of individual gang members, with all their petty needs and concerns that motivate them, make it clear that these are not just ruthless criminals, but ordinary individuals engaged in a world of worries everyday and human strain, Melville, however, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in prison? Why was your partner Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested in the first place? Or because the former Jansen police shooter (Yves Montand) left the force, was his alcoholism? We never learn the motivations behind their actions and we never find out what drives these men. Women are even more absent than in his previous films, with "emotional" ties exclusively between men. They don't even seem to have a personal life. A sort of emotional twilight zone and although the setting is not abstract as in his previous LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still traces a very disturbing world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost surpasses himself in coldness, if imaginable. <br /> <br /> Deliberately rhythmic and with a duration of over 140 minutes, Melville takes his time to tell the story, but it is slow the rhythm and length seem a perfect way to show the desolate world in which these live men. Nothing is ever out of place in Melville's films and it's no different here, every little detail seems to be of fundamental importance to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI remains my favorite Melville film, even up there with the best films ever made, this one is also among the best. <br /> <br /> Darkroom --- 10/10
