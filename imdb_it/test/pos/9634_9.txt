Many people are having fun with the acting skills of Steven Seagals. And I really see why if I remember Fire Down Below. Well ... okay, his other films are acceptable (about his acting!). <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews on The Patriot, I didn't expect anything from this movie. I just went through Fire Down Below and read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised by this. I think it's one of his best films. If he had more action sequences and a couple of fight scenes it would be the best. I liked the story of the director and the actors. Cammilla Belle was simply incredible. He will have a great film career in the future. The few action scenes were done very well. And Steven Seagal was very credible in his unusual role.
