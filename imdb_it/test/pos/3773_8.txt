So it's a little dated now, it's almost 30 years old. Surprisingly I have this on BETA tape and it still sounds good. If it's a DVD, shoot in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> The mood of the drug is not as appreciated today as it was then. So it wasn't so 'harmful'. Very similar to driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I remember my father was crying that he was laughing so much looking at this. I had colleagues in the 90s who saw it and I could make them burst by entering the intercom and saying "Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". <br /> <br /> Big lines, great parody of the original, and still fun for me even three decades later!
