Someone I know said there was a movie called flatliners that was probably on my way. I was told about this movie after seeing the final destination 2 and seeing the extra function regarding the deth experience. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD of flatliner at the modest price of 5 pounds. I came home and looked at him. And I couldn't help but smile and feel good about wondering why this movie had never been in my life. The film is about a group of medical students trying to see what it is like after a near death experience. But then the sins return to reality and can physically damage them. <br /> <br /> Acting by Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is as fantastic as you'd expect from the couple. And Joel Schmacheur has made this a fantastic film like he did with lost boys. <br /> <br /> This is an edgy and elegant thriller designed to satisfy all types of cinema fans.
