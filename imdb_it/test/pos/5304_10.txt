The magic of Hayao Miyazaki continues with this absolute pleasure of the Ponyo crowd on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which lights up the usual sweetness to enchant your socks. I thought the trailer included his silently hypnotic song, and I didn't have to wait for an invitation to make sure I got my ticket for the preview of the movie, which is scheduled to open here next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli movies, you probably know what you are in, as Miyazaki still has another winner in his filmography, which will win new fans. I am embarrassed to say that so far I have only seen My Neighbor Totoro (the eyes that accumulate Ghibli's DVDs) and I love it in pieces, but I imagine that this will serve as a final push to keep on missing what would probably be an animated film that I would like. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magical goldfish that wants to know what life is over the sea, with its constant forays into a bubble to the surface of the water to peek. Nevertheless, these ambitions do not bode well with his humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who has a certain hatred for the human race for pollution, and briefly touches on an environmental protection / revenge sub-plot of Mother Nature. An accident one day sees Ponyo washed ashore, and collected by the five-year-old Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives in a cliff house with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while father Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly in sea ​​since he is a sailor. And you can expect some moments back to the past like The Little Mermaid, or Splash made for kids. To say something more would ruin the fun. <br /> <br /> The artwork here is still simply stunning even though it is in 2D glory, knowing that every cell is worked diligently. There are so many things at the same time in the same frame, that you'll probably be playing for repeated views just to find them all. Surely beats every animated production in 3D or CG on any day given its beauty resulting from its simplicity, and not only from the art department, but also from its history, despite the complaints arrived that took a leaf from the classic by Hans Christian Andersen. While there are ways to make this film extremely obscure, it only suggested some obscure themes, but instead opted for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> At its center of love, that between the members of the Koichi family, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. Also, it's about the love between the boy and his new domestic fish that he named Ponyo, and I tell you that Ponyo herself has enough beauty in her to beat Bolt, WallE and Eve hands down. The characterization here is top notch, and it is difficult not to fall in love with Ponyo, in any form adopted, especially when it is such a playful being that does not hide its emotions - if it is angry with you, or moves away or you can expect a jet stream comes out of his mouth in the face! <br /> <br /> Ponyo on the sea cliff is a definite shoo-in for my best films this year without hesitation. And the next time I'm in Tokyo, I'm sure I'll go to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought by Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended movie, so don't miss this on the big screen!
