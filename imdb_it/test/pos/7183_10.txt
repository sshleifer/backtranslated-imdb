Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois. <br /> <br /> Very funny and very funny movie. A good command of the French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) is recommended. I don't think this movie really works in any other language. The film is incredibly much better than the previous one (In search of ...). Apart from the great actors and the easy handling of the camera, it is the wit and firework of allusions, word games, etc. That make a movie really fantastic. The vorlage of cartoons is recognizable, but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is put to good use. In fact, all the special effects adapt "naturally" to the film, you never feel choked by them. <br /> <br /> Bref, oui, les 2CVs, ça traîne un peu à la part cela, Imhotep! <Br /> <br /> - A neighbor on the other side of the Rhine
