The game was released in 1996, but it is still good today. the graphics are not so appealing and the actors are not worthy of note, but the plot is twisted, diabolical and very pleasant. The dark story is compelling from the first film and continues throughout the game. We played several people together for several reasons: 1) to use all our minds together. 2) don't be so scary. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you won't regret it, just don't try to find an earthquake engine.
