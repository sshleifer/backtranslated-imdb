I found this epic of a surprising, surprising and even heartbreaking beauty. A sort of monumentality in beauty and decorative richness, a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism. The choreography here is extremely fun, the actors are extremely funny. I was a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER ?? well, but this was even better. They have Kitano's ingenuity in dabbling in what is pleasant. This beauty that affirms adventure cinema is an act of courage. When was the suspension so exquisite and genuine? And the art of showing large crowds, gigantic armies ?? The film has something deeply satisfying and a constant good taste. Is there a huge pleasure in making a show so deliberately impressive and clean ??. It is beautiful beyond words. Few, few adventure films, not to mention epics, have given me uninterrupted pleasure. <br /> <br /> The fan can be monumental. it is not monumental art, but monumental fun, like Leone's films, like some epic films of the 1960s; also like the hobbit trilogy. It's a big fun.
