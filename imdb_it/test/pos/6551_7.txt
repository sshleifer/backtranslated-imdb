To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was completely wrong. This film is based on the famous Japanese novel of the same name. It tells the story of a cursed city by Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. Gradually city dwellers slowly start to become dangerously and violently obsessed with anything having to do with spirals and some of the residents start turning into living things, actually have a kind of spiral inside them like a snail . <br /> <br /> The film was a gigantic, casual, twisted acid journey of romance and drama. A bit like a distorted drama. What makes this film disturbing is the way some people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example: one of the dads has a garage full of items to keep at home with spirals embedded in them, a girl took her extremely long hair and made fun of an incredibly huge spiral style, a child slowly turned into a snail human, a man could twist his body into a spiral shape, a woman tried to cut off her ear to get the cochlea inside and a teenager ran over himself so that he could be twisted around a gum and child stuck into a washing machine so it could become a spiral. <br /> <br /> Another very disturbing aspect of this very well synchronized is the atmospheric tone and style with which this film was shot. The camera angles add to the psychotic plot and, in other words, a good cinematographic photography. The overall coloring of this image creates a slightly demented story. The coloring is a mixture of lime green, yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the spirals are exceptional. <br /> <br /> However, like many Japanese films, this one has a tone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. However, with all the spirals and strange happenings in the city, it is difficult to keep up with the two teenagers. But, somehow it is very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the true story of the spiraling city. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves very different and bizarre foreign films. It has just enough madness and madness, it touched me.
