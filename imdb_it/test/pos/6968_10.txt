Okay, I have to admit that I like Peter Liapis a little and I admit this is not the best Ghoulies sequel. I mean, yes, it had its flaws, like NO GHOULIES themselves. But the two Ghoulies that came to earth were really fun, I guess they were called Dark and Lite. I liked the plot of the movie. And even at the end of the film both Ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel. I'm still waiting for lol. Peter Liapis has resumed his role as Jonathan Graves, this time playing a detective, how nice! Ghoulies IV can't be scary or full of suspense, but it's definitely fun. I thought about commenting on this film and simply saying: it's not so bad. It is worth looking at even if the Ghoulies are not there.
