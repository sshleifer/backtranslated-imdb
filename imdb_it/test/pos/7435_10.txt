I love this movie !!! I didn't play Final Fantasy VII, but I've always loved the movie, it's really fun and I love the work done by the actors off the screen. The images are so fantastic and all the lines are so well made. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have a good imagination so I was able to fill most of the gaps in the film presented, and I suggest you look at it twice because many things "suddenly" make sense. <br /> <br /> Also, (this is pretty funny) you should watch it with subtitles because what they say and what they say the subtitles are sometimes completely different. It's usually pretty fun but sometimes it helps you understand what they say best. <br /> <br /> Watch it !!! loves Marnie
