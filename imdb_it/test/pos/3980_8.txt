This is what films should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without every cast girl showing her tits, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I have seen Justin Long appear in many films over the last few years, I understood with the right role that could have broken out. (The commercials for Mac are not resistant.) This film could simply put him on the right track for list A. Even the rest of the cast has done its job perfectly, this is an excellent little movie with a nice message. (But you don't need to buy the message to have fun.) Lewis Black is, as usual, exhilarating, and Blake Lively is a fresh beauty. <br /> <br /> Take a couple of hours and you'll see this movie, it won't have been wasted.
