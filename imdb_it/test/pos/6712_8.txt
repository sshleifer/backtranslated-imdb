For the guy who came up with the idea for Lifeforce I have one thing to say: thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines the sci-fi splendor of Star Trek: The Motion Picture with Phantasm's cheap horror thrillers and completes it all with t-ts-- and some big fleshy hooks for that. And above all, it's actually a good movie! It surprises me that someone actually justified a mainstream film that is a vehicle for a sexy girl to appear naked on the screen for an hour and a half to the producers. God bless you, all of you who have been involved. <br /> <br /> Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays Colonel Carlson, the American commander of an international space mission sent to investigate Halley's comet. Carlson's crew finds an alien ship inside the comet and inside it they find three naked people in suspended animation - two boys and a great heat (Mathilda May). Well, long story short, they are "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires". They transgress the crew except for Col. Blueballs who decided to leave the chick out of his sleek display case because the part of his brain that controls his nut fluids told him it was the right thing to do. The Col. puts our big blue ball back into play in a rescue capsule. Meanwhile, another space shuttle crew discovered his dead floating ship in space and brought back the three coffins of the Living Dead Martians to London. And that's when people start turning into pork rinds and in general start to work their way up too fast. <br /> <br /> Carlson teamed up with the imperturbable Col. Caine (Peter Firth) of British SAS to track down our naked cutie - who is having a lot of time sucking the boys right and left. Carlson has discovered he has a mental connection with Vampira that allows them to track her down, with the ultimate goal of blowing her ass and destroying her and her friends' big space umbrella that sucks the energy of the people the vampires attack. Will they succeed in time? MINOR SPECTATOR: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say, but "Wow"? This damn movie really works. I can't believe they got British actors like Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or a title like that) to appear in this movie. All the actors are good. The direction is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic devastation of London. Even the special effects are not delicate. For 1985, this film must have been the most suitable for the film. All the effects are quite impressive and there is a wide range of talents on display here in animotronic, makeup effects, light shows and very nice space scenes with some good old-fashioned modeling and matte painting - very well done. There are also some guttural and bloody shots for all the horror fans out there. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for all those who are longing for when the big-size popular movies have been made with 100% love from the beginning to the end. The creators of the movie really made sure that all the bases were covered and the end result is an incredibly fun affair that doesn't let you distract because the proceedings are too good. Real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
