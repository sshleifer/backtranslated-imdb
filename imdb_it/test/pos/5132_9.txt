Hoot was fantastic. The owls are adorable and the film highlights an interesting environmental problem that I didn't know existed. Florida is full of so many funny characters and the film does a great job of bringing it to the screen. My children particularly liked all the different animals, from snakes to owls to alligators. It's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. When children are young it is when they really develop their sense of values, and yes one of these must take care of our environment and all the creatures that inhabit it. I think it was great that the movie even turned on a conversation with them on the journey home on animals and how to help them. It was really sweet and lasting to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the birds. However, overall it was a really great moment and I would recommend the film to anyone looking for something fun and meaningful.
