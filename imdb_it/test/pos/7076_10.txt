After renting One True Thing the other night, I learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted. I've never seen a real portrait of a cancer victim on the screen like Meryl delivered. It deserves an Oscar nomination, but has some tough competitors in the running. All I can say is Beautiful film, great acting by Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep has revealed her true skill in this excellent film!
