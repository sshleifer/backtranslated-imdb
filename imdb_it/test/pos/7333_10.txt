This is one of the very few films with terrific acting, wonderful plot and worth seeing. It's about changes in life. It's about how happiness can be found when you are true to yourself. It is about accepting oneself and others. It's about life's challenges. It's about coming to an end with reality. It's about courage. It's about love. Both actresses are very faithful to their role. The actresses had a great feeling between them in the film. This is the key to the film that made the film. It is rare to see an independent film like this. You could say the hard work that the film crew had to do during the production of this film. I would like to see more films from this producer / writer. Watch the movie, you'll love it.
