I saw this movie through one of the actors' agents, and it certainly fits a lot with what comes out of Sth. Australia regarding the general tone *, which is rightly dark and moody. <br /> <br /> I thought the child in the movie was excellent. Primarily the child actors are * hammered * and embarrassing but not in this case. He was really very good. In terms of * surrealism * thing mentioned by jingo, well, I think this film is simply 'weird'. It's a real strange film, with strange settings, plot, strange things that go on all the time. But 'good' strange instead of 'bad'. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to think of other films like this, but it is not at all like CARS ATE Paris, perhaps more like a REPULSION, but in reality I think more like a Hammer movie from the 1960s. He certainly has an interesting mind working behind it. <br /> <br /> JINGO, My question also concerns the title. Why modern love ?? Anyone? Also, jingo, what did you mean by "abandoned god" when you were talking about Australia, hmmm? Just curious
