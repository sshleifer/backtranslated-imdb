Being an Israeli Jew of a naturally sarcastic nature and a lover of different and independent cinema, it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a look at the holocaust which is sensitive and respectful while being original and unusual. While I didn't read the book ?? or, after all, heard of its existence before watching the film ?? and therefore, like some other reviewers, cannot comment on how they stack up in comparison, Everything Is Illuminated gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on this. <br /> <br /> Labeling Everything Is Illuminated a film about the Holocaust It would be a great injustice, even if it is undeniably on the Holocaust. So labeling it as a comedy or a travel movie, even if it's a journey and it's exceptionally fun as it is in motion. Everything Is Illuminated is about Jonathan Safran Foer ?? played for the minimalist perfection of Elijah Wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance in which I've ever seen it, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals everything ?? a young American Jew, an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travels to Ukraine on a journey in search of the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. It's also about Alex, his tour guide in Ukraine and Alex's grandfather. The fascinating thing about these characters is that at the beginning of the film they look like a comic relief to balance the melancholy nature of Wood's character; but both Alex and his grandfather undergo fascinating changes during the film, and are at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin is the blind and self-declared grandfather, proving to be the best dramatic performance of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, what made it all lit up is an exciting experience for me was the fact that from Alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original point of view on this painful topic; many excellent films, such as The Gray Zone and Downfall, have already given us the perspective of low-ranking Nazis who are presented as human beings who are not necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions, but are caught in the reality of war . Everything Is Illuminated presents a viewpoint rarely dealt with previously: Alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees him as something more than a cold historical fact, which is found in having to face the horrors of his own people ?? and maybe even his own family ?? were they capable of changing in Alex's attitude ?? and his grandfather ?? towards Jonathan, towards the Holocaust, and towards the Jewish people in general, makes the film a fascinating and original study in the development of the character. <br /> <br /> Everything Is Illuminated is a fantastic directorial debut for actor Liev Schreiber and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. It is a highly recommended viewing experience, in particular or anyone interested in the Holocaust and the Second World War.
