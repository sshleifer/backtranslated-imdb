I also saw this movie when it came out. At the time I was a teenager and I saw him with my girlfriend who would later become my wife. I remember that the film made me feel that it was possible to beat the odds. The photograph was very well done if the memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little too much, but the girl's character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and could have been the introduction to my girlfriend for the first time. Since then I no longer see the film and I wander around because it ended up on the side of the road. I'd like to watch it again to see if it was as good as I remember. Elton John's soundtrack was excellent.
