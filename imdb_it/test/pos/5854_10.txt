This is an excellent film, full of suspense and mystery of the murder. Not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue, but you can see the beautiful Ryan Gosling for a couple of hours, what not to love! Also, Sandra Bullock is good at this film - I've always been a fan of her, (I just wish she hadn't decided to be in "The Lake House" which was horrible, but that's another story). Obviously since there are thousands of other murder / horror movies out there, there are necessarily similarities between them, there is no need to beat this movie to have some similarities to at least some that have already been made. Anyway, this is a great movie for those of you who actually enjoy "scary" movies, it's a bit dark and twisted but overall a great movie !!!
