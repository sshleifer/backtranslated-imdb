I love this movie, it's excellent and so funny, Ben is FIT and I wouldn't mind meeting him on vacation !! I consider this film a 10 because it is gr8 and I hope they will never make it because it would never be the same again. The funny thing is that Andre looks at the moon, and he yells at Nicole to "go out and look at the moon" which always makes me laugh and never gets old. Another thing is that Nicole looks much older than fourteen ... but she is a gr8 actress. But I need help with something. N and 1 no the name of the song played at the end when Nicole and Andre are dancing ??? It disturbs me a lot because I want 2 no, because it's a good song !!
