I think all the reviewers captured this movie really well. I've seen it many, many times, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth just like I did the first time. My emotional response to this film never seems to vanish. The final scene certainly brings me to tears, but also the scene between Perks and The Children on his birthday. And as for the Gentleman. Something else is happening with that character. The generous supplier and problem solver. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. A perfect father to run and make us feel safe. I don't know how the film does it, but it touches something very English deep down, which has long since passed from our daily experience, but we all recognize it and we want it instantly.
