I saw Teen Devian in 1993 in Doordarshan on Friday night and I couldn't believe that such a remarkable film had ever been made in Bollywood. Was it amazing ?? a film with a "modern" storyline, superb music, three lovely women and my favorite superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual plot, does Dev fall in love with three women ?? the simple Nanda, the delicious Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They too are in love with him and want to marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the plot) - who to marry? Consult a hypnotist who asks Dev to look into a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (most likely by the same Dev saheb and not by Amarjeet, the official director), the classic B & W has an evergreen music ?? some of the best compositions by SD Burman (generously helped by RD Burman). "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the hottest song ever composed in Hindi movies. Majrooh Sultanpuri should also be given credit for writing memorable texts. Teen Devian is an airy musical that fits Dev Anand's style perfectly and has done justice to the role. Unfortunately Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity it fully deserves. <br /> <br /> A must see for any fan of Hindi films, I will evaluate the eternal favorite of 9.5 out of 10.
