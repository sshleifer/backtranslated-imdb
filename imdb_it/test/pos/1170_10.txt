This film is well launched, often stupid and always fun. Lemmon and Matthau work perfectly with their tag team. Brent Spiner is just a revolt like the selfish tyrant of a cruise director. From the first "hare krishna" to the last "you should give him fifty dollars to call you two stallions", I thought it was a totally funny funny comedy
