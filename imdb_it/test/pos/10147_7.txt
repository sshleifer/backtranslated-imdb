Nice little thriller by Hitchcock, with many beautiful imitations surrounding a killed spy, a kidnapped child, a bad church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists. Jimmy Stewart is always a great hero for Hitchcock, the story reaches its peak in an embassy function, but it doesn't have the threatening threat of Hitchcock, the low-budget black and white original. However still another wonderful film from the stable of the great master.
