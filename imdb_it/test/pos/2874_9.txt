See No Evil is the first film of WWE movies. Yes WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, pro wrestling. Obviously, being a WWE movie, a wrestler has to act, the wrestler is Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. Which is not very important as if I didn't know Kane or what WWE meant, you would never know that it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, because the film has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is a horror movie, it has some moments when some people might jump but for the most part it's just saying, hey look how much we can get! Not that there's anything wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is a sort of Jason type character, his mother tortured him as a child with rigid (understatement) Christian beliefs and deformed his mind. Now it's a scary sharp killing machine. 90% of the film takes place in an abandoned hotel where Jacob chases six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. I could explain why I'm in an old creepy hotel but eh, who cares? Despite the lack of originality, See No Evil is well done, for what it should be. Kane plays a fantastic killer and needs some makeup to be scary. A flaw in the film is the most annoying possibility that people survive, I really can't wait to make them die horribly, but unfortunately it doesn't happen. I wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although as I said the film has nothing to do with wrestling, people are still closed enough not to want to see it because, of course, if I'm a wrestling he hates. Then again the film could also make money because Wrestling fans will want to see it. However, See No Evil has first-rate effects and a small CGI, and like I said, it's pretty brutal, so I say it's good stuff ... if you like that kind of thing.
