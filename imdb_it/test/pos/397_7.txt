One of the most obscure among Anthony Mann's westerns, The Last Frontier was also his only western cavalry (apart from a brief episode in Winchester '73), but naturally focuses on outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a Fordian celebration of camaraderie and shared ideals. Set not in its beloved high country but in the hills and forests, it is a much more cynical view of frontier life, in many ways its Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is made up of misfits, failures, cowards and the odd competent official ignored by his superiors, poorly guided while the civil war has priority and all the best the army has to offer. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free hunters who find civilization creeping over them when they are lifted from their skins and from the pack horses of a local tribe grieved by the Cavalry incursion into their territory. Rather than blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is the army's fault to build the fort and decide to seek compensation from them, instead ending up joining their ranks as explorers. But despite the best efforts of Guy Madison's amiable and competent commander to bring Maturo in the nineteenth century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of the humiliated colonel of Robert Preston eager to take revenge on the tribe that kicked him out of his same outpost ?? and Maturo's clumsy infatuation with Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too much of an empty board here to do much with the role of a woman who is tired of being rescued by men who think they know what's best for her) ?? soon drag things into a much darker territory. It doesn't take long before some soldiers are planning to kill each other, both sides try to spur their subordinates to do the deed for them: no wonder that at one point Maturi throws away the blue coat that he long coveted with disgust, shouting "I would have died for this, but it is nothing but a dirty dirty rag!" The Stallone of his time, Maturo, was one of those actors who could surprise you with the strange excellent performances here and there when they matched the right side and the right director. Isn't this one of his best days despite having his most complex part, quite perversely as a simple man ?? well thought out but drunk, violent, ignorant and with an insignificant, almost childlike, desire for life, the part seems designed with Burt Lancaster in mind, with some surprising similarities with his character in The Kentuckian. But the colonel similar to Robert Preston's Achab is clearly the best role, determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a disastrous civil war suicide, launching another useless suicide campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and away from the mind of the promotion committee. In his obsession with redeeming his career, he turns away from any hope of moral redemption, driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he considers his inferiors. Is it beyond salvation, but there is still a human being recognizable in there and one not entirely lacking in a sense of integrity? Does he genuinely admire Madison's courage in making a futile attempt to cancel Preston's orders from their superiors? fatally distorted though. <br /> <br /> Like his hero, the film is a bit rough (and boasts one of the most surreal and cheeky songs of any western), but that tends to do only is more interesting, and there are a lot of Mann's typically elegant moves and perspective games, while the frontier setting is convincing and primitive. Unfortunately the shortcomings of the first objectives of CinemaScope are very evident on the Columbia DVD, with the often dark image (2.55: 1 CinemaScope required a huge amount of additional lighting and the first Scope films show a lot of trial and error) and grainy .
