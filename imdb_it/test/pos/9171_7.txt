In the last century, there has been much progress in gender equality, but not so much in the world of cinema. I'm not talking about what happens behind the camera, I mean the tastes of the public. The idea of ​​a "chick flick" is alive and well today, while there are still many action and horror films that mainly attract males. Of course, there are men and women who love movies that fall outside of their typical demography, but there aren't many films that have appeals across the board. Hitch, Will Smith's latest vehicle attempts to change that tendency by being a chick chick who throws a dose of male perspective. <br /> <br /> Smith plays Hitch as a title character, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a "medical appointment" that trains men on how to face a woman and have a successful date. Hitch enjoys his work and loves to see men successfully achieve their goals of dating the woman of their dreams, but due to a bad experience at college, Hitch himself is a bit spotted with the idea of ​​love. As the story unfolds, the film introduces two lines of seemingly separate stories. The last case of Hitch is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has his doubts about Albert's chances, but if his customers' wishes seem sincere, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hitch meets gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is immediately attracted to this strong woman. However, the doctor of the date does not seem to follow his own advice in pursuing Sara. Things get even more complicated when Sara's work leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress. Will Hitch be able to balance his private life and his work? And more importantly, can Hitch believe in love again? If you are a true cinema fan, then there was at least once in your life when you complained about the redundancy of the Hollywood factory and shouted for something new and original. Well, Hitch is not that movie. But most fans of the film will also admit that occasionally a formidable movie can only work at the entertainment level. Hitch qualifies as that movie.
