I loved that the atmosphere was light and airy. I loved the fact that the protagonist needed guarantees about his future and that his roommate made him "straight" of all people. I loved that they dealt with the dynamics of how members of the male group exchanged relationships, considering that this was directed by a lesbian, the whole theme of masculinity was put out there, ridiculed, dissected and questioned. What makes a man? What makes a person heterosexual, gay or bisexual? You're not really sure that our protagonist has decided who he really wants; is living in the moment and has thrown caution to the wind. These and other reasons make me love this movie.
