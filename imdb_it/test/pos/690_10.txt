I saw this I expected to see the usual English upper lip stereotypes and I was surprised to find the extraordinarily natural and black-humored dialogue. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve. The scenes during the approach and attack are extraordinarily realistic in the depiction of a combat ship and in business and jokes between the ship companies (at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the disposable lines are very funny ("I don't join the Band of Hope just to please a fatty fish fryer!). My only complaint is that they didn't show what happened to the Irish coxswain and his bride, or the tattooed PO and his "I Love Arabella" tattoo!
