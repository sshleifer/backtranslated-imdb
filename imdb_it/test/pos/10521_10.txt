Another that has slipped from the radar of almost everyone. This little gem produced by B is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive, that a terrible feeling of the lack of cojones in today's cinema slowly exceeds your body. The final set is so innovative in its style and style that it foreshadows everyone from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think "the dying lines" are all clich√©s, wait for the FF dying line. A piece of dialogue that could have gotten you out of laughter will take your heart. A true pleasure Look for it and look at it. You will not regret.
