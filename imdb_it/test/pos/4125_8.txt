I saw this (video 2000) years ago and I'd like to see it on DVD. A good movie, but I would have liked it even more if it included the legacy of The Beatles and The Hollies, etc. <br /> <br /> I also don't know exactly how true the story is - were there any changes made to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 years old when Buddy crashed and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70s. Much later, I discovered that our family moved into our new home - yes, February 3rd 1959. <br /> <br /> Well, ehelhell, little things you say and do ... His songs will always be remember - always ...
