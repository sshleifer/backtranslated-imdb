I had never heard of this movie until it appeared on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena surpasses Arnold as an action hero in this movie! Geena is a former CIA assassin who is brainwashed and identified as a teacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and a daughter. The clues begin to come from her that it may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that his former employers have discovered that he never died and wants to make sure he does. He hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they form a couple that is as fun as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory, she undergoes a transformation in the killing machine that was once with the song "She's Not There" in the background. What follows is that Geena and Samuel must chase the bad guys and hopefully survive. Throughout the rest of the film, Geena has to decide who she really is. The insensitive machine that kills? The mother / teacher with quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Above all, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that are classified in all the films of Die Hard!
