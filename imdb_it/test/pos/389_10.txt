One would have expected Hitchcock's return to the most important studio cinema to make a mistake on the side of cautious caution. Surely few expected his wildest and wildest film, a joyous melange of evil black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation and fancy fantasy flights. But that's exactly what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. <br /> <br /> What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of film. Much has been made of the main cross-cut motif, but its immediate effect is to completely hinder the line of progress that Guy is making of his life, and therefore the company he represents or is eager to join. Guy is the archetype of the American, the working class boy behaved well, moved into influential environments, athletic, successful, handsome. Bruno is his opposite destructive, gay, decadent, "European" (he lives with his father, in a big house, and limits himself to dreaming of a murder). Bruno's life is one of repetition, of circularity, while Guy proceeds straight ahead. It is Bruno's undertaking to move Guy into his kingdom (represented by the joust) and force him to transgress (break the law, hope for the murder (of Bruno)). <br /> <br /> Bruno is literally fighting patriarchy. All the authoritative figures in the film are criticized: Bruno's father, a man whose brutality can be glimpsed, but the real horror he is constantly mentioned in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings) that incredibly intense negative energy must come somewhere); Anna is incredibly Machiavellian, a selfish father; the insensitive judge who does not think of having lunch after an execution; the tennis commentator whose complacent and authoritative comments are always wrong. Far from being the mother-hater of the legend, Hitch, as Robin Wood perceived, is profoundly hostile to fathers and patriarchy. <br /> <br /> Bruno's transgression transforms the world upside down. This is Hitch's most surreal movie. Whenever Guy is in his storyline, he is shot straight, with conventionally romantic music. But every time Bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnival, bizarre, much more fun. This is the first real American film by Hitch, who enjoys the primitive debris of Americana. The grown men puncture the balloons of kids or try to knock them out of the rides. Distinguished mathematics professors sing about goats on trains. The matrons of the old society are strangled in elegant evenings. Washington is filmed as a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a disturbing painting by Dali. There is one of the greatest and most amusing scenes in the whole cinema when we see a Bruno smiling and motionless in a sea of ​​heads turned to a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte. Watch all the scenes with Bruno and watch him derail in the bizarre. <br /> <br /> The bankrupt abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check out all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in the more serious surroundings: Washington will never look the same again. STRANGERS is also, in spite of VERTIGO, Hitch's most overtly sexual film - as well as fouls, there is sustained homoeroticism, remarkable play with "ride-on" horses; the stupid joke fellatio when Hitch's daughter pours dust on the cop. <br /> <br /> Yet Hitch does not consume the good old suspense. In an excellent attempt to show what was a great artist, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch plays a devastating chaos on identifying the public, wanting Bruno into murder. There is a hilarious and painful sequence in which Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy in a sewer. The jolts of tension and sighs of relief from the audience I was part of in support of a mad killer are inherently funny, slightly disturbing and highly revealing of our true reactions to compliance and success. And Hitch licks him with insensitive joy - listen to the mocking music and exaggerated compositions, and kick yourself to take everything so seriously. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS is one of Hitch's five best films, and therefore one of the greatest things in film. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp, who stands for her cheeky father while she insults Guy. The end of the fair is an extraordinary, dizzying fusion of exciting and tense sets, black comedies and symbolic sites. If Bruno's last words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts that Hitch should embody: confronting a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to Guy's disused service.
