Chris Penn is as exhilarating as Jeff Spicoli's stoner brother of all time. This film is fantastic because it was much more real and fun than the fast times at ridgemont high. The casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van halen who became songs on ou812 and illicit carnal knowledge. This film is one of the great heroes of the stoner movie with Cheech and Chong. Fast times were more depressing than amusing. Abortions, friends who betray friends, masturbate in the bathrooms, do bad jobs and fail school. Someone must hate the eighties to appreciate wild life more. The film also had great cameos as the creator of the city's limits, Michelle schocked in the liquor store or Ben Stein in his first role in the surplus store of the sun.
