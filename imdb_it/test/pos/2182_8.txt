I saw it last night on Turner Classic Movies (TCM). I had never heard of it before, and was quite surprised to find it so compelling. <br /> <br /> Bogart plays a star like a cynical editor of the city who, reluctantly, accompanies his greedy radio network leader in this incisive "B" programmer. About 12 years before he played a cynicism similar to the city to perfection in such films as Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Beadfoot Contessa and The Harder They Fall, Bogie already had the starring qualities. <br /> <br /> In order to improve the classifications and bring their programming a bit more acute to a more popular level, WUBC, "The Voice of America", is pushing a radio miniseries about a woman who has been acquitted 20 years ago from a request for self-defense for the killing of her husband. Not wanting to be discreet to save the reputation of the woman and her husband, the station uses devious methods to reveal everything to all listeners, and most likely as possible. <br /> <br /> As a time capsule, I also found it very enlightening about male-female costumes in the workplace in the mid-1930s. Although beyond Henry O'Neill, I don't know the supporting cast, the players were uniformly excellent and the direction was tense. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of film (for example, A Face In The Crowd, An Inspector Calls, etc.), don't miss the chance to see it. <br /> <br />
