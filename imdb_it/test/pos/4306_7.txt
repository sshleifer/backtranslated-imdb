This Columbo is unique in the sense that we do not know the exact result until the end. Our favorite dark horse detective suspects that a pair of identical twin brothers kill their rich uncle; everyone points their finger at his brother. In a mysterious series where crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this turn could reasonably be used only once or twice, and this was Columbo's time. In addition to the wrinkle, this episode fits well with the others in the series. It has a lighter tone than some, with a very enjoyable performance by Jeanette Nolan as the demanding and faithful governess who immediately takes dislike for Columbo.
