To say that I didn't expect much sitting to watch "The Couch Trip" is an understatement. I had no idea what it was - I thought it would be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase play a condom and the film's title implies the word "travel on the couch", * wink, wink. * Then I realized that it had something to do with a psychiatric institution and a patient who ran away. My expectations fell even further. <br /> <br /> I was literally expecting a sneer movie - the kind you smile at once and come out feeling a little fooled. And in a sense, this is an economic comedy, it doesn't have the biggest gags, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big stupid smile on my face for as long as I was watching. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient in a psychiatric hospital who may or may not actually be mental. Give psychiatrist Lawrence Baird (David Clennon) a lot of pain and suffering, which leads us to believe that he is a sane person after all. <br /> <br /> Following some turmoil in the mental coffee shop, Burns is waiting for a language joke by Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns takes it, pretends to be Baird, and discovers the interlocutor on the other line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to come and compile a radio shrink called George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who is taking a vacation with his wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants so much that Baird even booked him a plane ticket. <br /> <br /> Burns runs away from the institute with the help of a receptionist and guide to O'Hare. He gets Dr. Baird's ticket, gets on the plane and finally lands in the air like Dr. Baird. His show is phenomenal success. "People love it!" one man says, and the other replies: "Because he really cares about them". <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (the great Walter Matthau) is a former patient who recognizes the clothes of Burns to be trousers and shirts confined. To keep him quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is kept closed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife fight. He flies home to finish his short vacation and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, Dr. Baird after all, but nobody believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately he lost his ID, so the police take them crazy and don't listen to their story. <br /> <br /> Let me quote just a few of the holes in the plot noticed while watching this movie: Burns behaves like Dr. Baird, but his ID is never requested, even when he claimed his plane ticket (it was he was robbed, he says, but they would have made sure he was Baird anyway. If Burns becomes so famous, why did the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never hear people talk about him? The word travels. And finally, why would the police ever arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird, that is) without following their stories? <br /> <br /> To be honest, I couldn't care less. I went to this film with a closed mind and I was surprised: I really liked it. He entertained me. His ideas are essentially ridiculous and not entirely realistic, but Dan Aykroyd offers a very lively performance like a half-a-loon that makes "The Couch Trip" a journey not to be missed. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
