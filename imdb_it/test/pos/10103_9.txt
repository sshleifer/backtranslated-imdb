Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them but the way of Su-mi is bitter for her. Su-hate Eun-joo because her father lets her act like the wife of the house after the death of the mother of the sisters. Seeing his attitude, Eun-joo takes care of the sisters coldly and an atmosphere of tension grows between them. <br /> <br /> As if it were called from the atmosphere, series of mysterious things occur at home. When Su-mi hangs her dress in her wardrobe, many dresses with the same design have already been hung. When he put his diary in a drawer, he finds another diary of the same type there. When she sleeps in her bed with frightened Su-yeon, a nightmare wakes her up and finds a woman standing over her - and a hand dangles out of the woman's skirt! <br /> <br /> Mysterious things happen to other people too. On the evening of the next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and his wife visit the family and have dinner together. Eun-joo cheerfully talks about a madman he met when he was a child, but nobody is interested in his speech. He says the madman annoyed his brother, but says he knows nothing about the man. <br /> <br /> Listening to their speeches, his brother's wife has a panic. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters becomes worse. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into a closet and closes it inside. Su-mi saves her weeping sister and complains to her father about what Eun-joo did to her daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Give me a break." he says angrily, "Su-mi, please, don't make me more tired." <br /> <br /> And the following words out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they saw at home. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I hate horror movies. Although I sat in a theater because my intuition told me that the film was something different, I was regretting how much my curiosity made me act when he started showing. The regret, however, had turned to joy for waiting ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> This film is a tragic mystery rather than a horror - painful rather than horrible; beautiful more than sensational. This could be a disappointing horror fan, but for a mysterious fan like me, this movie is a must see. (9 out of 10)
