I was glad that this film did without the alleged depth of all too many pseudo-serious interracial films. race was a problem, yes, but so was the class ... and loyalty ... and honesty, etc. <br /> <br /> I also liked the idea that the love story had not only formed in aspects of the appearance of both characters. it is not our divorce courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, I suppose!) now filled with sufficient numbers of couples who thought they looked good. together.' is all it takes to make a solid marriage? in any case, the tenderness and sensuality of both characters were thick enough to create love scenes that would bring a rainbow on every sad day! in other words, a carefree movie that is not at all light!
