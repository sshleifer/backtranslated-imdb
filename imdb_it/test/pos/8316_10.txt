NOTICE SPOILER <br /> <br /> I got this dino-documentary on DVD at Christmas 2004. I had so much wanted to see it and I wasn't disappointed at all. The score is memorable (my favorite <br /> <br /> was the theme song "Sauropod" and the song "Winters Coming"). The effects were dazzling, one could almost believe they were there. In reality you also learn something; Stegosaurs may have been able to pump their plates with blood. Female T-rexes have committed a murderous madness before spawning. I know there are many people who think this is based too much on speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess. And there is also a hard and undeniable FACT. We know that some dinosaurs have traveled in packs, we KNOW that Diplodocus has swallowed stones to grind vegetation in the stomach. Despite this "speculation" the series did very well. So good that it actually generated a sequel, a prequel and several special offers. If you are a dino-fan, then this is for you. Makes Jurassic Park look small and grassy.
