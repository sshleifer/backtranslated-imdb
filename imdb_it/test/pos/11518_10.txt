LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first "all-taking" feature, which arrived in a lively 57 minutes and was directed by Bryan Foy (of the famous vaudeville family). <br /> <br /> The story has two aftershaves (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) longs for an opportunity for "great city life" and to get involved with gangsters and alcohol. One of the boys is set up for the murder of a policeman but is saved at the last minute by a moll of the gun (Gladys Brockwell). <br /> <br /> Much of the story takes place in a night club called The Night Hawk, which is run by a scammer named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) who has his eyes on a beautiful singer (Helene Costello) who is the girl friend of Landis. Costello makes a short dance, and we listen to Harry Downing (made up as Ted Lewis) who sings "At Dawning" in his best Al Jolson style. <br /> <br /> Acting ranges from the good (Palette and Brockwell) to the horrible (Oakman). A couple of actors silence their lines but then continue to keep up with the scene. As noted elsewhere, this was destined to be a brief 2-reeler and was accomplished on a shoestring budget. surprisingly good, the voices are all clearly recorded, and there is a cinematic touch in the death of the silhouette. <br /> <br /> The film was a box office success although it was shown as a silent film in which theaters were not wired for new sound technology, no one expected this little movie to have grossed an incredible $ 1.3 million, but in a short time he made the stars of Costello and Landis and certainly launched Palette in his long career as a leading actor. <br /> <br /> Among the protagonists there are Mary Carr as mother, Robert Elliott as detective, Eddie Kane as the street policeman and Tom Dugan as a criminal.
