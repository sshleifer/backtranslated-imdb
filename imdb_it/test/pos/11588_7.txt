THE SEA INSIDE a movie by Alejandro Amenabar. <br /> <br /> Almodovar has always beaten the flag of Spanish cinema for years, Amenabar has come from nothing to reinvent genres and inject a little blood for the otherwise malfunctioning Spanish industry, now in a big bet goes from psychological terror to social drama, well, big ones would be, the public is ready to embrace the swing and more importantly can you hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor who at the age of twenty was paralyzed from the neck down in a sea accident and his struggle with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has traces of an afternoon made for television melodrama and the only way this will work is through honest words and performances and both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar are co-writers in a way that the public does not want to be blind to death but they are encouraged to take their minds in the process and this is a brilliant blow, it is not a pro death movie but a movie in favor of the supreme illusions of our time LIBERTY. There are a few laughs that save a lot of time, such as when the church returns home in a wheelchair to deconstruct Sampedro's beliefs, but it is above all a valley of tears, punches coming from all sides even when you think you are at sure from his father at that point it made no sense to find the most moving line of the entire movie. Is it a harrowing experience especially when Sampedro seems more full of life than most of the people who go around the streets and all those around it try to convince him of the wonders of life even those that are helping him die? but when a man of his dreams is undressed ?? The film is almost exclusively built on close-ups, bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with Sampedro. This is a great challenge for the actors who have to build their performances with their eyes and their eyes don't lie. Bardem was not given his second Oscar nomination, probably in favor of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have cast a shadow over Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in which the acting seemed effortless and I believe that Bardem has reached that state where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely confused. I have never been passionate about his early work, but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH is at its debut, LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and the Oscar nominated BEFORE THE NIGHT FALLS have made him an international star and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar the background is fascinating to see how they have traveled the different paths and how Bardem has become a real reference for Spanish cinema all over the world. A golden globe, 14 Goyas, jury prize in Venice and probably an Oscar with the permission of THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-writes, edits and puts the music into a high-level drama, pulled it out ?? What about a science fiction now? Whose life is it anyway? ****.
