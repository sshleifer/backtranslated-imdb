How often do you see a movie of any genre that has a talent show with refreshments? Waldo's latest stand is a refreshment. Here Waldo sells lemonade but does not earn money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey Mouse and buckwheat come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 Men In A Tub and Came The Brawn where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo for Darla's affection. Back to the story: The Gang tastes the lemonade to see if Waldo has done well. A funny moment is when the alfalfa gets a glass cup for the lemonade and Waldo fills it and gives it to Darla and the alfalfa has an angry expression on her face. Spanky proposes a stage show to go with the lemonade and also Mickey agrees always so cute. When the show starts, there is no one in the barn but then a customer arrives (Froggy). Spanky asks if he wants lemonade, but all he does is nod no. Spanky asks him a lot of time soon and whenever Froggy nods, no Spanky shows many expressions on his face that is funny. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. One way is when, after Mickey always said so "Those crackers are salty and made me thirsty". There is also some musical entertainment which is short. The opening number is by Darla who dances and sings. The second includes the alfalfa that sings in an off-key key (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky and Buckwheat on "How Dry I am!" (I think they sing to make Froggy thirsty and also to make me laugh). The closing number includes boys and girls all dressed in an old-fashioned way. This was Waldo's last short Our Gang. A great musical short film that is a pure 10 out of 10.
