Three children are born during a solar eclipse and are transformed into vile tiny murders that are above suspicion except Joyce (Lori Lethin) and younger brother Timmy. This is the story in a nutshell. Acting in this is tolerable for the most part. Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the 'Downtown' one) which shows some skin, and a very early part (albiet piccola) for Michael Dudikoff. It is not a great film anywhere in the imagination, but in the subgenre "killer kids" it is a somewhat guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T & A (the only film so far to claim that honor); Sylvia Wright gets topless <br /> <br /> DVD Extras (R1): 16-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg (in which he insults the director AND Canada, great things); Biography of Ed Hunt; and trailer for "Kiss of the Taratula", "Do not open the Door", and a red-band for "Homework" (presenting nudity) <br /> <br /> My Grade: B-
