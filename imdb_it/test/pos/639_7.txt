I went to this movie expecting a slasher, and while Mute Witness has the influence of that movie style, this is much more than your average hit. There are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (Blind Terror, Wait Until Dark, Cat or Nine Tails to name a handful), but the implications of having a silent protagonist in a thriller like this they are well depicted, and in reality they are an integral part of the plot, since the fact that the protagonist cannot speak is often the reason why he finds himself in dangerous situations that would be easy to exclude for anyone else. Our silent witness is Billy Hughes, a makeup artist who works on a horror film production in a studio in Moscow. He finds himself stranded after hours and hours a night, and after trying to call his sister for help, he runs into what at first sight appears to be the creation of an illicit sex movie, but soon turns out to be a movie snuff! He tries to convince the authorities of what he has seen, but discovers that nobody believes his story ... <br /> <br /> The hostel recently became the main title to show films coming out in a foreign country, but this film did it before and actually does a better job. Maybe it's not as bad as Eli Roth's work, but blood is more effective, and since director Anthony Waller (who directed one of my favorite modern thrillers with "The Guilty") implements a good sense of humor in the proceedings, Mute Witness is both sufficiently bloody and fun to watch. The director certainly has a talent for creating suspense and thrill, because this never stops. The plot is put in place quickly, and Waller constantly introduces twists that give a great hand to the overall entertainment value of the film. The acting is not bad for a B-movie, with young performers Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards offering good performances. The atmosphere is gritty and the Russian locations are adequately hostile, which helps the film maintain an atmosphere of foreboding. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better film than one might expect. The plot runs well, and the atmosphere and tension are exact.
