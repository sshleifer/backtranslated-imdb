"Showtime" is an entertaining film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: at the beginning of the film, detective Mitch (Robert De Niro) and another detective enter a television shop trying to kill some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray (Eddie Murphy), a policeman, tries to arrest Mitch without knowing he's a cop. During this scene a lot of fun things happen that catch the attention of the television producer Chase Ritz. He is so excited about their adventures together, he decides to do a TV show called "Showtime" with Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But this is just the fun part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who sells and produces extremely dangerous weapons. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have a real adventure in this story. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give him a seven or an eight.
