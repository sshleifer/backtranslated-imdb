This film is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it's a beautiful image of what Christmas really is. Today I live in a big city that I hate, I love watching movies about the life I've always dreamed of having. The city where this film is set is my dream come true for the life I have always wanted and the true feeling of community that has been lost in today's society. I really don't feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore, but watching this movie helps me find that feeling again. My family recorded this movie a long time before TV and now our copy has been consumed, so I would really like to buy some DVD copies for my family and me if someone can tell me where I can buy copies, please just post the information here and I will continue to check. Thank you.
