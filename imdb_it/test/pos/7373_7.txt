I decided to watch this on FearNet on demand for free because I understood correctly, nothing else looks nice. And it turned out to be a nice horror surprise! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the perspective of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. After deciding to build a bonfire in the woods, they begin to tell their ghostly stories and cinematic transitions to the events in the stories. <br /> <br /> The honeymoon - a newlywed couple traveling in an RV for Las Vegas is terrified when they park in a wooded area by evil beings who hunt the full moon. (I don't want to ruin it for you!) The Hook-Amy Smart and James Marsden, (probably the most famous people in the film besides the beautiful Christine Taylor) play the young couple who comes face to face with the maniac who has a hook for a hand in this most recognizable short. <br /> <br /> People can Lick To - this is probably the scariest and darkest of stories. A girl chats with another girl on the Internet, but it turns out that in reality she is a man obsessed with her and who comes into the house when she is alone. This was really chilling. <br /> <br /> The Locket- This is also a great story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett, who play a motorcyclist and a beautiful dumb girl who are terrified of the ghosts of a previous century in a mysterious farm. This was good but it was the weakest of voices. <br /> <br /> The group around the campfire slowly develops its terrifying experience in their segments between stories, and the end of this film is amazing and truly fantastic! Overall this is not scary for the bones but it is certainly a great guilty pleasure that horror fans would surely appreciate!
