This film is based on the true story of the Iowa housewife Lucille Fray, who had breast cancer after the birth of her tenth child. Realizing that the state would take the children away from his inefficient alcoholic husband, he spent the last year of his life traveling the state to find new homes for each of the children. A formidable script, which still holds 20 years after it was first created. The grown children, many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 1950s, were reunited in "That's Incredible", before the film was aired in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for best actress in a TV movie or mini-series, but during his acceptance speech, he made his way to Ann-Margret singles for his moving performance.
