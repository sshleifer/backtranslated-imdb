Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would have tackled this daring subject - a comedy about Hitler. All the great satire is based on going to the limit. Moreover, all the great comedies concern the other side - pathos. This film seems to be flying over both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator treats history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to see the world in a new light. Another film that comes to mind is Emir Kusturica, Underground, and Fando And Lis. So let me see the movie first.
