The sweet and rich girl of the valley turns into a crush on a punk in the alley and when her snobbish friends disapprove of her, she is forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very funny romantic comedy blends into elements of black comedy and 80s cheese that make it even more fun to watch. The film does not only follow the life of the girl from the valley and her punk; but also her friends shopping, partying, going around and going to the mall. If dialogue does not make you laugh without pause for a week, music will do it. Songs like "Johnny, Are You Queer?" found in everything Moreover, Elizabeth Daily is a fun, existential character and the speech of the King and Queen Prom at the end is hilarious!
