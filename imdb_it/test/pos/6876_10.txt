when I know that Walter will never reach another set. I was about 30 years old when I first saw this sweet, catchy and unabashedly romantic film. I loved it from the first scene to the end. Art Carney was his usual daft self; Glenda matched Walter step by step in the jokes, and Richard Benjamin provided the sarcastic voice of reason that did it so well. Apart from the way there were many actors that we all recognize, doing their usual genius. There are a couple of lines in the film that my SO and I have used over the years, but I won't say anything about them here. I'm pretty sure you'll know which two I'm talking about. Take this movie. Make some popcorn, grab your grip (if it's as corny as mine, for which I'm grateful), and enjoy this extraordinary romantic comedy of the 70s. You will not be disappointed. However, I have the feeling that I am preaching to the choir here because everyone who loves Walter will already have it. I am very happy that it was released on DVD now, finally.
