The main reason for controlling this is to look at Laura Gemser in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This is reason enough for me. <br /> <br /> He heads to Africa as a guest of another rich boy seems to be all about these films. Large villa near the jungle. Hunters who hang around for the holidays when they are not out hunting for zebras. And the holidays turned into drunken orgies. <br /> <br /> All the high society types in Emanuelle's films seem to have uncontrolled fetishes. And Emanuelle hosts most of them. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato did NOT direct this. He just ripped it and used the same cast. And has anyone noticed the "subliminal" sexual images at the gas station? And why are most men dressed during sex scenes? <br /> <br /> Consistency? Almost no one. BUT GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL.
