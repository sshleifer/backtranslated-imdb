This film is fantastic because it showed how good cartoons were in the 1980s, the animators weren't as lazy as they are today, the comic had so many details with very few resources they have with them compared to what we have today If more people asked that these cartoons were retransmitted then perhaps all the other cartoons of the 80s would again be shown on television, so to finish my sentence I would just like to say that this was a cartoon I grew up with I wish it was on TV again.
