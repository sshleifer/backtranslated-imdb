This film is about the aging of Geisha in post-war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other ex Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and resent the way she is somewhat smug. Tamae has a son, Otomi, a daughter, who during the film announces that they are leaving them while Okin, never a mother, receives visits from two men in his past who, apparently, only want money from her. It is a compelling story of what are the choices you make, what you do to overcome life and who you are responsible for and to whom you are grateful. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest actresses of characters in every country and plays the role of Okin, mostly irreducible and compassionate, with an air of superiority that you don't like, but at the same time I almost envy her . At a time when great films were made by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, among others, Mr. Naruse is right there with him. If you have a free DVD player by region, you should try to find the two sets of Naruse boxes published in England. I think this film was a great study on the characters of women who risk being irrelevant. Which actually does not make this film a true masterpiece.
