This little John Ford western with no "stars" but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It looks like a documentary as it tracks the journey to the west of a Mormon party and could be the most authentic aspect of all of Ford's films, (it's on par with "The Sun Shines Bright" he did a couple of years later ). <br /> <br /> There is a plot of sorts (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at some point), but the dramatic lights of the film are almost random. The splendid performances of the Ford company, (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr, Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) add considerably to the authenticity of the film, while the closest film to a full-bodied performance is Joanne Dru's Denver . Dru was a much more refined actress than she had ever believed, as were Bond and Johnson, who eventually received an Oscar recognition for her work on "The Last Picture Show". As he said himself, "It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy." Add the superb position photograph of Bert Glennon and you have a piece of genuine Americana that could have none from anyone but Ford. This is a film that truly honors American pioneers and is full of feelings and feelings.
