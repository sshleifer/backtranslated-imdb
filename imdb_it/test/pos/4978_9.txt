I really enjoyed this movie. I have a real sense of justice and "an eye for an eye", and this film proves it with a great deal of punches. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the great breeder of the valley; then one of his ranch hands was beaten and shot 'to help him make a sale decision'. When the ranch's hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford initially seems reluctant to do anything, warning his men not to take things into their hands. But that's just what he's going to do. I knew this movie was about to catch fire when he walked into the saloon and confronted the boy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my favorite bad actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after a delicate exchange of dialogue with him, Glenn Ford slaps his face and kills him. A little bit cleaner than justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cow. In a short time we are treated by Ford to burn his ranch, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew of the other ranch; then Ford and his men flee all the horses and cattle of the ranch of the great bad boy; then the dependencies and the large luxury home on the ground appear and burn. Let's talk about becoming big. Lots of action in this movie. There's more to the story than this, but I recommend you just watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who repeatedly showed what can happen when you misjudge someone, and I really enjoyed seeing him get old-fashioned justice.
