Ronald Coleman has been a screen star for several years when the talkies have arrived, and what a boost he has been to his career. His Oxford English accent is so engaging that I could hear him recite the peasant's almanac and not bore him. <br /> <br /> Coleman plays Willie Hale, a thirty-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time making women and gambling. Still, he is a nice thief - not only sympathetic from the public's point of view, but also from family and friends. He has once again failed because of his constant gambling and sells his possessions to a foreign place to pay off his debts and provide a ride home to England. When he arrives there, he is first met by a father who insists that he will throw him out - he had it with Willie and his escape routes. However, five minutes alone in a room with Willie and his charm, and Willie is not only forgiven by Dad, Dad gave him a hundred pounds to start. <br /> <br /> Willie then goes for a day of leisure with his sister and her friend, Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy is destined to be engaged to Grand Duke Paul that very night, mainly because her father wants real family, and there is no other special in her life. This changes after his day with Willie, and soon a scandal breaks out while Dorothy refuses to complete the marriage as planned. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman is always a pleasure to watch in these first talking films he made for Sam Goldwyn where he plays the trusted adventurer or cad or both. He behaves similarly to Errol Flynn, but is unable to show Flynn's physical agility due to a disabling injury he received during the First World War. However, what Coleman misses in physical agility has always recovered in the agility of the soul. Loretta Young, only 17 years old when this photo was taken, shows the beginning of her sweet brand girl who can explode into a fireball when the occasion calls for it. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girlfriend from the past - Mary Crayle - a showgirl. Here Myrna still plays a similar part to the exotic parts of the vamp with which she was so often linked to Warner Brothers when she was a contract player from 1926 until just before this film was produced in 1930. <br /> <br /> This is practically a light and airy romantic comedy from beginning to end. If you're in the mood for the kind of escape entertainment that has lightened the hearts of the public during the Great Depression, this little movie fits perfectly.
