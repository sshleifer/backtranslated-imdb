Some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one to eat, one to breathe and the other to s ** ting ... This is not a movie for them ... <br /> <br /> But for who likes to use the brain ... the whole film is a metaphor, everything is there for a purpose, every single detail, the cup of coffee, the red sofa, everything ... is an undervalued masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> It's fun, it's raw and totally realistic, that's how we really interact ... it's a real comedy ... total causality ... <br /> <br /> Wait, don 'Leave that the first scene upset you ..... wait ... and enjoy the show ....
