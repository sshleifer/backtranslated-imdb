I saw this movie in a Singapore theater yesterday (February 4, 2006) and I came up with a better understanding of what patients of schizophrenia and their loved ones go through. <br /> <br /> Ms. Aparna Sen must be congratulated not only to tackle a difficult subject, but also to treat mental patients with a deep understanding of their situation which is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and storm of turbulence raging in their minds. <br /> <br /> We had Hollywood movies on this theme like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" where Jack Nicholson took the honors away. Since then the research has helped to provide more information on the problem and to clarify some misconceptions about the treatment. In "... the cuckoo's nest", for example, shock therapy has been described as barbaric, but in "15 ..." it has been stated that it is not as bad as it has been shown. <Br /> <br /> The other misconception is that child abuse is a cause for schizophrenia. But scholars like Dr. E. Fuller Torrey have pointed out that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have genetic roots. <br /> <br /> It is now established that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical disorder and its progress can be controlled if detected early. Even in fairly advanced stages, regular medication and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same understanding shown by Ms Sen is evident in the way actors play their parts. In line with the gravity of the theme, the acting is controlled in everything with the evocative silences of Mrs. Konkana Sen-Sharma and the eyes that reflect the confused confusion of a disturbed mind that speaks louder than some of the lyrics we are used to in most part of the films that included mentally challenged characters. <br /> <br /> Like me, most of the theater audience appeared confused at the sudden end. Leave many questions suspended in terms of plot. <br /> <br /> Is the search for Meethi finished? Why was it not found in issue 15? Were the kids really playing when Meethi passed the gates with sparkling eyes of recognition? Can anyone solve this puzzle?
