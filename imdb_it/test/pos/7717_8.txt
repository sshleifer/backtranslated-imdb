Exactly how do gay Asians do in a culture that generally refuses to recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of Hindu and Muslim gays there seems to be little hope of leading a life that is accepted and supported by their otherwise very close families. This is the main point explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - presumably from the name of the spicy western dish that involves tender pieces of young chicken meat! Jimmy is a typical young Asian raised in Britain by traditional parents with common, limited and selfish opinions about marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others, he is led into an arranged marriage that seems inevitable even though he is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. He knows that the truth must be told but fears for the consequences of this in particular as his father seems to be terminally ill. And so it becomes entangled in a network of deceptions that becomes ever wider as the plot develops. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and not at all critical or patronizing for any portrait group. Acting is generally excellent, although it may seem a little amateur in some places, as the director tends to look for humor rather than make it blossom naturally. There are no prizes for photography or script, but the film is made complete by the wonderful feeling expressed at the end - a feeling that all fathers around the world would do well to learn from.
