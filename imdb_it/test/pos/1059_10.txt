Barbara Stanwyck is a true delight for this wartime comedy about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with the family of a popular magazine writer on his Connecticut farm. The problem is that he has no husband, child or farm, as he writes in his column, and he doesn't even know how to cook; her wonderful recipes were provided by her good friend "Uncle" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York. <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when his strict head editor invites himself to Christmas. A scheme is hastily planned, with her sleeping boyfriend providing a real Connecticut farm, the neighbors who provide a loaned child and a planned quick marriage when the publisher is not watching. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications arise, as the apparently married author falls like a ton of bricks for the sympathetic Navy man and vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a fascinating, hot film that cleverly balances humor with feeling and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to show her remarkable comic talent, aided by wonderful actors like Sydney Greenstreet, Una O 'Connor, SZSakall and many others. A Christmas dance in the town hall is a joy for the tapping to see, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen her primarily as robust and shrewd women in female roles. Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time.
