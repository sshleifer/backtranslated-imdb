I couldn't wait to see this movie since I picked up the trailer for the first time, and I'm so happy now that I've done it. It's really a wonderful movie. The actors are superb, the script is fresh and real, the whole thing has been apt. I love James McAvoy in this, and I'm looking forward to seeing him in the movie "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" this December. Romola Garai is also wonderful. Be sure to check it out in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby", two of my favorite movies. Overall, I think I liked this movie because it didn't work. It's a difficult subject to tell a story, as it is very likely that you offend a lot of people or ruin yourself and turn into a sweet-sentimental-sugary love party. But they avoided doing it completely, and instead they made a real, honest and touching film, yes, but never exaggerated. Very well done. Incredibly well done. Go out and look at it, and you'll know exactly what I mean.
