Unfortunately, due to a slow start, I can't say that this is one of Hitch's best films. It is still excellent. The film features Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who are involved in a plot for political murder and must try to get their kidnapped son back. Both offer excellent performance, not surprisingly, of course. In reality, however, I was very impressed with Hitchcocks' incredible use of music. The climax at the Opera House was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius. An absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. Furthermore, the use of the song Doris Day "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when it is transposed into scenes at the end of the film. So this film for me becomes Hitchcocks the best use of the music I've seen to date. Unfortunately he had a slow start, or I could have recommended this film a little higher. Even then, it's still worth a look. 8 out of 10.
