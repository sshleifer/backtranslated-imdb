Although it is not "perfect", it is close. I love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman police chief), the housekeeper, the restaurant waiter Felix, and the judge ... I can go on forever. This film has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a kid, and my kids grew up too! "The little girl swallowed the clock" has always been my son's favorite line. <br /> <br /> The sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and dresses stole the show along with the friendly S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some great songs. I strongly recommend this film and suggest skipping the remake (blah).
