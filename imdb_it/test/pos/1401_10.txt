Of course, most people will designate "Fishermen's Island" as a silly and trashy hokum, but you can honestly name another film that carries THESE many hilarious themes? This Italian gem is synonymous with pure entertainment and contains stuff similar to voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish creatures, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, treasure hunt, a remote island full of deadly traps and completely crazy scientists! All this and more in a simple movie? Yes thanks! Opponents of Italian horror films can easily label this film as an economic version of "The Island of Dr. Moreau", but the truth is that this is much more! "Island of the Fishmen" offers excitement and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and an extraordinarily elegant camera. The story promises to open with a small group of prisoners who survived a shipwreck washing a tropical island on the shore. They meet the sadistic Edmond Rackham who rules a native tribe and a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the marshes of the island. There are so many twists and extra secondary storylines in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but, believe me, this gem is worth a try. Sergio Martino demonstrates once again that he is a brilliant filmmaker who has the talent to be creative and commercial at the same time. It makes great use of the island's beautiful location and even the interior sets look very impressive. The impressive underwater shots and the imaginative scenery really raise this film beyond the normal exploitation standards of the late 1970s. I don't understand why Roger Corman has reworked the original so much and published it on the American market with a different title ("Screamers"), because there are very few elements that can be improved. The cast members are all regular customers of Sergio Martino (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is an orderly support rule) and offer great shows. In the event that you manage to get your hands on the recently restored German version, you are treated to fifteen full minutes of extra action. Watch it!
