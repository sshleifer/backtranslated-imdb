I think a person would be well advised to read or see (I prefer to read) "Twelfth Night" before seeing, or reviewing "She's The Man". The film is beautiful on its own, but comparing the two, and looking for in-game jokes makes it a lot more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he would give nothing. <br /> <br /> Harld Bloom said in "Shakespeare, The Invention of Humans" that most people in "Twelfth Night" must be locked up. Malvolio, the person on whom Malcolm is based, is - for no good reason. The people in "She's The Man" make sense to the contrary. For example, Duke Orsino is much more astute than the Duke of Orsino. It also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. Show a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> It's a teenage (clean) comedy, so it doesn't have the dark edges of the game. For example, Olivia mourns the death of her brother in the drama. In the film, it was downloaded. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the show, they don't have the same attention in the film. <br /> <br /> in-jokes are quite often fast. The surname of the hairdresser Pauls is given once. It's Antonio. A lot of people who have read the drama say that Antonio has more love for a man than just friendship. Deep love between men was noticed in those days. Some see a sexual side - homosexuality was illegal. <br /> <br /> The only joke of the drama that I captured is where the Duke Orsino cites the coach by size during the soccer game. In the drama, it is said by Malvolio, quoting Maria).
