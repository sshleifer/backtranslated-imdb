Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody and a tribute to the programs it represented. <br /> <br /> It was a real mock up of the classic 70s classic, "The Sonny & Cher Show", with Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney playing a divorced couple who had somehow been forced to host this program together, the female of the couple that dominates the male, and the constant gust of "insult humor", the couple threw each other, as well as sketches of comedies and performances from those that are more kindly described as acts of "specialty"! <br /> <br /> The "hybrid" was the mix of reality and fantasy. Of course, there was no "Mr and Mrs Laupin" and even the announcer of the program, Johnny Bluejeans, was equally fictitious. But all the acts that they performed were certainly real, and some were even funny! But there were also some acts that would have been clearly more suitable for the old "Gong Show" by Chuck Barris. <br /> <br /> The show itself was really more like an extended sketch of "SCTV" (it was born of the MTV series, "The State", after all), and some would suggest that it would be better as a five minute bits in a program mix like that, rather than an independent series. But "Viva Variety" certainly should get a high score for the original concepts, and although it was often more strange than funny, it was certainly worth it, especially when the road stumbled in Las Vegas and also led to glitzier performances. It is unlikely that we will see something similar again on television.
