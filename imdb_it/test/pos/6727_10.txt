I saw this movie early one morning in the early 90s when I was about 12 years old. I tried to find what it was and finally I did today! I remember having fun and being a little crazy when he showed the tombstone of the young boy and his ghostly face! Please can someone leave me if I can get a copy of this as I'd like to see it again. I remember that the child got stuck in a tin mine and then made friends with a boy. I don't remember that the children were stuck there with the miners, but it must have been. The boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who died while working there I think.
