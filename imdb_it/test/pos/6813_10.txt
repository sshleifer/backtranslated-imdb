What a show! Lorenzo Lamas once again demonstrates his talent as a policeman who committed the worst crime a good policeman can commit, being a good policeman. Then again, it shows how sensitive a policeman can be, showing a range of emotions like no other actor can, if not, perhaps, himself in the justice of the Terminal. <br /> <br /> ENJOYMENT ENJOYMENT!
