While dangerously zigzagging on a lonely road in the night, the teen Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) has a car accident with his friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson ). While they spend the cold night stuck in the woods around a campfire, they kill time by telling ghost stories. In "The Honeymoon", the couple Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travel in their motorhome in Las Vegas on their honeymoon. Rick takes a shortcut to visit the Clayton Caverns during the night, but the unknown Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave the place since dangerous creatures attack people in the full moon. In "People Can Lick Too", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her internet friend Jessica that she is alone at home. However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket", biker Scott (Glenn Quinn) is crossing the country on his motorcycle. When he has a problem with his bicycle, he finds an isolated house where the stupid Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with her father. When the man returns to his herd, Scott discovers the truth about Heather. <br /> <br /> "Campfire Tales" presents three horror stories, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising twist in the end. The weakest segment is "The Hook", with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are fantastic. The plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above-average horror movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazul): "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("Midnight Tales")
