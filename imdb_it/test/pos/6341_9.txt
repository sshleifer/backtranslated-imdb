I just saw "back from a lonely dove" and it was very nice! I've seen many negative comments and I don't think viewers are real about it! In the television / cinema sector it is difficult to bring all the actors back for a second sequel or a third part. WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE ANOTHER MINISTRY THAT LAWS IN LONE D. FAITHFUL !! This production was of the highest level with the original soundtrack, and the actors put their heart into it (you can tell). If you want to look at yourself d. with Robert Duvall and Tommy L. J. then look at the original. Return to L.D. he did not have much spirit and took on a more serious tone, but it is absolutely captivating. From the moving moments to the bad guys, this is a winner! "Wonderful !!!"
