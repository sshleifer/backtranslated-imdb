This is a fun and entertaining movie. Highly entertaining at all angles. It presents an extravagant series of memorable, psychotic but lovable dice. We have; the judge, the Sargent, the child, the creepy old lady, the whore, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a big house that has no locks and is understaffed. So for our fun we can see them running, playing and being dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way ... never give your patient ax! <br /> <br /> This was before Cukkos Nest, AND surpasses it. At least on the fun level. It also has its sweet moments. "Love is pure, love is grace, love is strength, you love me, your love is pure, you will always love me". Now who could resist him? Dice are also human. Only a few threads scattered. Be a little careful, or you'll get an ax in the back! Children at play Hehe. <br /> <br /> The telephone repair guy was really funny and his reactions to the crazy boss and asshole were really genuine. All the characters in this film are tremendously well played. And I really found them fun. No, HILARIOUS! They might even give you dirty thoughts about how you can take advantage of it. Or how they can benefit from you. <br /> <br /> This is actually a very smart movie. There is a brilliant ending. I have to say that I expected it to be good but I never expected THIS. It's horrible. "The court has made its decision. You no longer have control!" I love it. The ending is so, SO perfect ... you'll make me a tear. <br /> <br /> I'm so excited after seeing a movie like this. I will never forget it now. It's not just a cult ... it's a CLASSIC cult. Whatever you do ... Don't look in the basement !!!
