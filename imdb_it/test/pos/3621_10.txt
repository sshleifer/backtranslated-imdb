Incredibly hilarious Italian Rootsploitation mid-70s with lots of non-consenting S & Ms, lesbian sex, free racial cruelty etc ... Few cinematic qualities that they redeem, with the exception of pretty cool theme music with African drums and flutes of dubby. Brilliant example of dialogue: <br /> <br /> Owner of White Slave (a White Plantation Manager): "You are so stupid, I bet you forgot to question that midwife of n **** r!" <Br /> <br /> White Plantation Manager: "Not only did I question her, I did it so well that she died before I could get any response from her!" <br /> <br /> All black actors are from the 70s, and say "yes, mass" in a high-pitched voice. The female protagonist has sex with everyone on the plantation. 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze.
