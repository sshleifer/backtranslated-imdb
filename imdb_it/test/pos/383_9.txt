This is a film so revered and studied, a classic among many by Hitchcock, it doesn't take any joke to want to watch it again. Yet do you think: can it hold up even when the enormous (and intelligent and surprising) plot trick is not a surprise? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> And for beginners there is the beginning, a deeply beautiful and lucid tale of the whole story, of its meaning. Two taxis, two men with shoes, each walking on the train, sitting facing each other, and, oops, a mistake, a small shove, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and suspense films - cheerful and light. We know that in the film, however, it will not be so, so we are already worried. What, after all, is going to go wrong? <br /> <br /> Very. In the true fashion of Hitchcock, he is a purely innocent man (almost always a man) who faces injustice, which is trapped by circumstances threatening what is most precious to him. The innocent in this case, the tennis player Guy Haynes, is interpreted with an innocence that is credible - his collegial courtesy in that first scene, for example, when he realizes that the other man is a small cuckoo, it is really what you or I could do. The not-so-innocent man is the spoiled, self-absorbed and frighteningly intelligent child, Bruno Anthony, played with extreme brilliance by Robert Walker. (This disturbing performance is equivalent to that of another Hackcock wacko, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from the first scene, on the train (and on the train, really amazing!), We have the two protagonists and we have the mind-explosive plot and absolutely simple and ultimately devastating, from Patricia Highsmith's first novel, which also wrote the books behind Mr. Ripley's two films. And it doesn't hurt that the script was written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economics and intelligent dialogue. And crime. <br /> <br /> And of course there is much more than the first scene. What to note? Well, that cunning of a senator's daughter (I thought it was terrifying) is the daughter of Hitchcock, Patricia, who is still with us (since 2009, she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic reference point for a key scene in the film: the tennis courts in the Hamptons, known as the U.S. site Open. The fantastic last scene complete with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves in a sort of slow and constant editing, increasing the suspense making it surreal. Fear grows positively on laughing children and the old man who crawls under everything. And when it collapses in an accident - all this is backproject on a set, one of the most naturalistic uses of a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections. <br /> <br /> Photography is perfect Hollywood astounds without becoming so stylized (as in some film noir) that it is an object in its own right. Watch the first scene again, or the filming (and editing) of Haynes coming into the house for what the audience thinks is a murder. This is a sophisticated construction. When we're not completely surprised that Bruno is in bed, this only shows that the director keeps us on his toes. There is always something unexpected. <br /> <br /> Are there any defects? Who knows? It depends on the kind of falsehood that you can accept (or embrace) as a beautiful style. The scene in which Bruno is suffocating the old woman at a party is at the same time brilliant (the woman, played by Norma Varden, is a caricature so believable to take your breath away) and marred by her looking at the senator's daughter and being triggered in a deadly trance death from his glasses, and his resemblance to his previous victim. This is a psychology idea from the mid-20th century that intrudes on many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The end of Psycho, for beginners.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article on the film intelligently emphasizes the substantial doubling of things in the film, from the main characters to the murder victim and the daughter of Senator. This echoes in many ways: two men accompany him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on. There may be too much of it, but it provides aesthetic coherence above and below our consciousness. Don't forget, there are two murders: it is the lack of the second murder, the inability to create a doubling in that case, which makes Bruno unravel. <br /> <br /> Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this film was shot, and shortly thereafter died of a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts. Although he has appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de-force. Farley Granger has had a long career that has never seen him become a real celebrity, although his style can have a strange nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. <br /> <br /> And if you look at this for the first or third time, look for the chilling and funny scene of the tennis game where the heads of the crowd move back and forth in unison, except for those of Bruno. He is looking out without moving his head towards us. As the movie trailer says, after this movie you will not talk about "strangers on a train".
