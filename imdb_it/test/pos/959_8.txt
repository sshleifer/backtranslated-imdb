Well, it could be a children's movie ... maybe, but I won't let my 9-year-olds watch! So who says it's a children's film hmm?!, It's a movie for teenagers I agree .., so but back to the film it is a guy who can lie very well .., so beautiful that in the end nobody can tell the truth or the lie. In any case it is a good movie to see a good game on the screen and vote for a script 8 and a story ... I think the writers make a small lesson with this ... "the truth is never exaggerated"
