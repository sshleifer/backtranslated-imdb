I watched this movie every time it was wired and never got old. Who can forget some of the best lines in the history of cinema? --- THE VILLAGES OF THE CHILD OF JOHNNY'S WEDDING !! JOHNNY'S FAT BOY BURGERS !! and LOOK BETWEEN GIANT MELONS! I always wanted to run around the city in such a fun treasure hunt. It's a fairy tale of all time and I'm happy to know it's out of video! I'm sure this is where MTV got the original premise for the Road Rules series.
