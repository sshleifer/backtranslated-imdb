As this film unfolds, you begin to feel the enigma of human existence. If you bring questions, inner wars, unresolved puzzles about the meaning of life with you, then you will hear this movie with every morsel of your body. Charles Darwin begins a war with an absolutely predictable ending. War with God His theories resemble the fact that God has nothing to do with humanity, he has nothing to do with the fantastic world we live in. Wild, hard, ironic and chaotic, these words surround the mind of the character thrown into a universe of material truth, which slowly pushes hope for God, out of his mind. However, the film like Charles Darwin still sees wonder and beauty beyond God in the universe of infinite evolution.
