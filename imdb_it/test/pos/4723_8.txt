This film was working on two goals: making a political point and telling a story of a scary adventure. It is often difficult to make a political point and tell a good story (consider Ellen's highly political but rarely entertaining end season). Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling. I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and she knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the film's political message was mainly a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the film did a good job telling about Aung San Suu Kyi and the mostly faceless dictators who tried to silence her for years. The device of presenting an unfamiliar environment through the eyes of a character with which viewers can identify is quite common, but it is quite well done in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the true measure of the film was its entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant and unknown place to shake her from her depression over the violent death of her husband and son. She is convincingly detached and depressed. Her condition of mourning gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings in the thick of a dangerous situation that she does not understand, something that would otherwise be too intelligent to run into. <br /> <br /> Once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of pain, she is trapped, without an easy escape. This puts her on an adventure path where she needs her intelligence to survive. Writers deserve a lot of credit for making it intelligent and resourceful to deal with many dangerous situations, while finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble from the start. Even the direction is strong, maintaining the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This film had an additional impact on me and my wife due to other events of the same period. We were preparing for a trip to India and we heard about Western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is a completely different matter from avoiding an oppressive dictatorship. But the film and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unknown country. That common characteristic has given the film a meaning that goes beyond the strength of its skillful narration. The film illustrates the worst nightmare of the international tourist.
