This film is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock will always remain above every director of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are Sheer Simplicity & Gripping Drama. The other best thing about Hitchcock's movies is Definite & Gripping End. <br /> <br /> Anything called "The man who knew too much" is less. Cinematography, Acting, Dialogues and Photographic Works are magnificent in this film. The song "Que Sera Sera" will eventually remain in our memories for life. The film is so pleasant from beginning to end that we never know when it ends. Rarely did Hitchcock include humor in his films, this film has comic scenes that fit the film. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely brilliant and as good as Vertigo.
