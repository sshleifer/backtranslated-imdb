Let me tell you from the beginning that I'm not a particular fan of this kind of film, but Nightbreed has a certain charm for me with a message on perspective. <br /> <br /> In the old days, the people who lived in Midian would be called Zombi, the undead. And based on what Clive Barker gave us some members of mankind, in this Craig Sheffer they were born with the potential to become part of that world. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first seems the gentle educated professional has taken on a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Marriage. Deceive the police to kill Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a cemetery called Midian Cemetery where the Nightbreed get together and live underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer also left a girl, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he was killed and is now one of the undead. Search in its small way to be a bridge for humanity. <br /> <br /> The creatures of Clive Barker are very beautiful and are not particularly fond of humans. But it is clear that if humans leave them alone, the Nightbreed in turn don't care about them. <br /> <br /> Your sympathies are definitely with the Nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and the redneck police chief Charles Haid in action. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker has been a gay out for a while and some have suggested to me that Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. I can see how to get in, especially because there are a lot of people who don't even think about gays as something human because they are taught that way. <br /> <br /> Granted Nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence, but it also makes one think and I like the way Clive Barker turns traditional theology on his head and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for Nightbreed creatures .
