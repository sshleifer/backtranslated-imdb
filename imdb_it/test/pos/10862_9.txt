This wonderful 3-part BBC production is one of the sweetest love stories I've seen in a while. The actresses show a very high talent, particularly Rachael Stirling as Nan Astley. She is fun, seductive and pretty. Love scenes and close kisses are very erotic regardless of sexual preference. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very credible. I imagine this is a by-product of a good adaptation from a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable drama that quickly picks up speed after a couple of boring (but necessary) scenes in the beginning. <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
