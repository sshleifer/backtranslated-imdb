I saw this film for the first time in the mid-1960s when I was a teenager, and it moved me so much, in fact the final scene where Han Suyin feels Mark's death, and then rushes in disbelief to the hill, where then you hear Mark's voice saying "Give me your hand", and then the image of him disappears, the butterfly with its superstitious meaning, the music, the broken emotions of Love of Han Suyin, has just let me sobbing my heart. I was crying externally bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked by my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Fortunately I don't react like this anymore, BUT I always cry at the end. I love everything about the film, mainly the music, the costumes of Han Suyin and the position. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the beautiful William Holden were both at their best. I have the VHS and the DVD of this wonderful film. I also have two versions of Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin. I recommend this film 100%
