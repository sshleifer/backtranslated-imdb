Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film in which the awards go to the supporting actor, John Malkovich. His criminal attempt to assassinate the President was first-rate and credible. <br /> <br /> It is not to diminish the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, or even of Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays a true asshole of a White Chief of staff. Eastwood was fantastic, and I love every movie in which you play Russo. <br /> <br /> The film features original music by the five-time Oscar winner (Mal√®na, Bugsy, The Untouchables, The Mission, The Days of Paradise) Ennio Morricone. This alone is worth your time.
