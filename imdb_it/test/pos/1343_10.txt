One of the best memories of my childhood. It should be on DVD. He captured everything we grew up with in the seventies: peace, softness, flower power and great acoustic music. The two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the definitive hippies peacenik, with long hair, peasant blouses and flared trousers (they looked like Katherine Ross (wing "The Graduate") and Ali McGraw (wing "Love Story" ), respectively.) <br /> <br /> They made us happy with the chucklepatch daisy jokes, gave us lessons on how to be kind through conversations with the crotchedy garden squirrel and entertained us with the music of the their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "Grease" (cool). <br /> <br /> This show should be in a time capsule of the era that would also include, "The Yellow Submarine", "Arrow to the Sun" and Marlo Thomas ", Free to Be ... You & Me . ", Also" Sunshine "and" The Point ". <br /> <br /> last, but not least, that acronym: "See you, see you, I hope you had a good, good time, ha ha, glad to tell you good morning, I hope we'll see you again , See ya, see you, happy to be able to stay a while, ha ha, I hope we will see you again, see you, see you.
