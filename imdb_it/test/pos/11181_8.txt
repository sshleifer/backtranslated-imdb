Due to the fact that unfortunately I couldn't find them anywhere, I didn't try any of the other items in the series, although I certainly wouldn't mind and, believe me, I looked. For those who don't know, this is a point-and-click adventure title. This means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything you can do with it, although in this case there is a particular case where this is inaccurate. I won't ruin it here, for anyone who hasn't tried it yet. However, regardless of how little experience you have with computers, you can sit back and try it. There aren't even many where you need to be quick or have quick reflexes. Heck, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have subtitles) and, therefore, talk about it, and it's not hugely embarrassing or forced when it's slow. Access to your inventory is easy, as is the combination or use of items. By clicking and holding the button on anything you can influence, you can choose between three options on what to use it (whether it is a person, a specific part of the environment or an object): Hand (press, collect, open , etc.), eyes (examine, look through, etc.) and mouth (eat, talk, etc.). All this adds up to a welcoming and friendly environment, in which it is possible to approach the numerous puzzles (the amount of them is varied, based on which of the two difficulty settings you try on this) at your own pace, and explore and take in dozens of characters and custom areas and creatively created this way for the contents of your heart. The duration of this will be determined by the time it takes you to do it (you will not feel any blame from me, it will be worth it) and your ability to understand the solutions. There are some points in this where you can decide if you want the most difficult way to complete it or not. This can be appreciated by anyone, from any age. There is no material that is not acceptable to children. This is one of the products that helps to demonstrate that precisely this fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for the older public. Animation is a work of quality, easy, everything moves as it should, and the third dimension honestly is not so painfully missed when trying this. The story is well done and you're never clear about what's going on. There are numerous well-directed cutting scenes, held in the same colorful 2D world, mostly brilliant, like the rest, with a well-done camera movement. "Cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe this, and not just the visual style. It can be applied to all this. The whole world of this is very similar to, but not exactly the same as ours, with a mix of past and present, inhabited by people and full of things that we can recognize or understand at least in part, but the absurdity makes them fun. This should be one of the biggest strengths of this, right there: it's fun. Much of this comes from the pronounced jokes (as it is said and how it is), and those who dig British efforts by focusing on verbal language, those like "Allo" Allo or the BlackAdder franchise will want to check this out of their minds. However, there are different types of jokes, including, but not limited to the following: Satire, intelligence, darkness, parody, irony, coarse comedy (not exactly my favorite aspect of this) and more. There is self-awareness, with the guide that directs you, personally, and, for example, which explains why he has no intention of doing what you just asked him. There are references to pop culture through a couple of decades. Almost everything works, almost no gag collapses, and if you are not at points during this, my best guess about the reason would be that it simply is not compatible with your sense of humor ... a situation that does not deserve judgment, and if yes suspect that might be the case, and want to find out, I suggest the demo version, where you, for free, can see if you are interested in the game brand and / or laughter. The plot is well written (almost all of this is, really), it develops well in everything and keeps your interest well. The sound is all excellent, clear and well done. The sound effects are clear. The music is well composed without exception. Voice acting is flawless, with a celebrity or two. Armato is as fantastic as Guybrush Threepwood (you have to love that name), which you control. Boen is incredible as LeChuck, the deceased (and still threatening) evil zombie. The designs are immensely well made, highly imaginative and all in shape. Despite the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate actions, we get to engage in some. Drive a ship, embark on that of others and combine the blades in a rather unique and wonderfully thought out way. Reproducibility is found mainly in choices, during dialogue, etc. This is straightforward, with a certain freedom with regards to order, so the buccaneer who sits with it, at least for the second time, doesn't have that big amount of possibilities as far as the challenge is that unless he or she forgot what to do in the meantime. Ah, nothing is perfect. Anyone would like to immerse themselves in a very well done and fascinating imaginary universe, and collide countless times should achieve a real success. The good kind, not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises. Don't forget, children, don't * eat * books ... it's just asking for a cut paper. I would bet that those who appreciate others would also appreciate this. And they are not the only ones who can get into this. I recommend this, apart from the members of the aforementioned group, to all fans of this VG genre, as well as anyone interested in this review. 8/10
