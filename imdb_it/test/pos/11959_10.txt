What can I say about this film, except that it is very funny! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a recent graduate who has two choices, learns to take care of the family business to wipe out or spend summer in Nantucket with his friend George Calamari (hilariously played by Joel Murray ) and his crazy friends. <br /> <br /> When I say zany, believe me, he cannot become much more zanier than the Stork brothers, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Throw a little girl named Squid and her weird asshole and a great performance of Demi Moore and you have the stuff to share your parts laughing, movie. <br /> <br /> Laughter flows freely in this film and in the story line, even if the typical good against the bad and the good conqueror, it is fantastic with the twist of a race like the showdown. <br /> <br /> I will recommend this movie for anyone who loves a lot of laughs and a good time. If you like * having fun * in your movies, then you can't miss One Crazy Summer!
