From the beginning of "The Edge Of Love", the viewer is transported to the amazing world of the Second World War. We follow the lives of four people who may have been created precisely for this film, an exploration of female friendship and the tensions caused by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is called Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him weren't just selfish, but sometimes truly regrettable. <br /> <br /> This film is based on Thomas's writings on love and romance. These were adapted with a clear script by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). The director, John Maybury, states that the other three main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> All four are performed very strongly. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first part of the film takes place in London during Nazi air raids, with Vera persecuted by Willaim, a soldier awaiting deployment. For a chance encounter, Dylan meets his first love, Vera. From there Vera meets Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three drink, William successfully breaks Vera's guard. <br /> <br /> The film follows their lives as Vera and William are married and sent to war. Vera became pregnant and returned to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a gritty existence, with Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. Through these times, the friendship between Vera and Caitlin grows. So Dylan's infatuation with Vera. She gives up. This creates the first test for the two women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from the war, he barely recognizes his wife and has no connection with his eldest son. Things get worse, as Dylan idly watches his friend struggle with the weariness of the battlefield (post-traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken rage he shoots at Dylan's house. <br /> <br /> "Edge Of Love" begins as an elegant love story in the war torn in London and ends in the tough and gritty life of motherhood, infidelity and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to an American public. One day (see the end). <br /> <br /> Each star has a great time. Miller when she is pulling out the points in her head in response to her abortion of another man's son. Knightley and Murpy when he finally binds to his son. Oh hell, almost all of their scenes are fantastic. And Rhys when he purifies himself on the counter to send Vera's husband to jail. <br /> <br /> However, the real star of the film is the cinematography of Jonathan Freeman and directed by John Maybury. They seem to understand that no matter how beautiful the story is or how historic Thomas is, this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they love their scenes with stunning shots. Although this is not the best artwork, it is a very nice film (much more engaging than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of Thomas's poetry. Furthermore, this is clearly the second best performance of his career, and perhaps Miller's best. <br /> <br /> I've always had a soft spot for the struggling artist, whether it's Mozart by Hulce, or Capote by Hoffman. But I was stunned by how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism between William and Caitlin to take his first love, Vera makes him out .... a bad man. <br /> <br /> So this Oscar award is worthy? Clearly not. At least, not this year. He will be released from the state in March 2009, making it inadmissible for the Academies. This is 9 months after he was released in Britain. Between Atonement, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, the United States filled up with pieces from the British period of World War II. Sin. This film is better than the others, except Atonement. But in this, the Knightley soldier returned, but like a shell of the man who left her.
