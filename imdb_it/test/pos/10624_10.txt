If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin that contains everything in the different expression of its opposites, then the cinematographic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality. Professor Kohut treats his piano students with a sort of fascist sadism, wishing the same for himself. His outward expression projects his desire. That's why it can hurt without guilt or remorse. <br /> <br /> Together comes the young, charming, charming Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her by his passion and intensity. He wants to be his student so he can be close to her. She rejects him by hand, but because of her talent the Vienna Conservatory votes it. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but does not accept the no for an answer, and then begins her descent towards depravity and the loss of self-respect. <br /> <br /> The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? In truth, who is the sadist and who is the masochist? It's hard to say. It is the person who has suffered great abuse both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying hurt on the floor in grotesque triumphant and contentment, or is the person who is running out the door, satisfied, giving the order that nobody is to know what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic maniac. She is an extreme sex maniac. He wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. In reality it is not even true. He says he doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they come in and find her bleeding on the floor because she's in love. Love, you call him. Because his sex and his love are the same thing. <br /> <br /> At one point, Walter tells her that love is not everything. How ironic is such superfluity for her. The comment is free. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who shoots the story with an expert photographic work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not only clear but exemplified (like in the bathroom when Walter pushes himself high over the top of the stable to find Erika inside). It also employs precise positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well-synchronized cuts from corner to corner. This is particularly important in the scene where Erika, like a corpse drained of blood in a black and white light, lies beneath her lover, stiff as a stone. Here, for the most part, we see only his face and the bare shape of his neck with his pulsating artery. We don't need to see anything else. <br /> <br /> The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. I saw her in a number of films and the one who does better than almost anyone has become the body and soul character. Like the woman who plays in this film, she is not afraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to you is performance and challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too depraved. It is as if Huppert wanted to experience all humanity and wants us to look at it as she does. It is always fascinating and almost impeccable. It is not just one of the main lights of French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an extraordinarily diverse body of work. <br /> <br /> I think it's highly educational and offers us a wonderful and surprising contrast to compare his performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) from 1977 when he was 22 years old. There was a sweet apple in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian hairdresser. His character was shy about sex and modest - just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. Here is a self-destructive witch, embittered with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved. <br /> <br /> Huppert is fortunate to be an actress in France where there are parties like this for women beyond the age of stars. (Hollywood could never make a film like this.) In American cinema, only a handful of the best and toughest actresses can hope to have a career after thirty. Huppert greatly increases his exposure because of his abilities and his range, but also because he is willing to play indifferent roles, here and also in La Cérémonie (1995) in which he plays a vile and spiteful killer. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabelle Huppert. You will not forget her or the character she gave to life.
