I thought this movie was excellent. Jon Foster is one of my best favorite actors, he was perfect as Michael Skakel. I found all that is fantastic, acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, screenplay and music, etc. <br /> <br /> Spoilers on the way! You have been warned! <br /> <br /> Martha Moxley, who had told the story of the film, was shot dead by her violent neighbor disturbed Michael Skakel. Michael did it out of jealousy of his brother Tommy when Martha pushed him away and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, they captured him years later and were sentenced to 20 years in prison for life. Although, I think he should have been sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of conditional freedom. Congratulations to the cast, crew and directors. Two thumbs up.
