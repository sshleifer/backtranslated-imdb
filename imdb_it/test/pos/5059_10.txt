We begin all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen almost 100 films a year over the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored to receive lifetime movie passes in any movie at any time at no cost! So we can see everything we want when we want. The point is that CRITICS counts for ZERO. Your local critics or national criticisms like Ebert are not at all different from you or me. The only difference is that they can write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they like it or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money for two hours of fun it is good enough for us! We NEVER listen to or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know like us. Pretty good at this. <br /> <br /> When Meryl Streep, head of the NSC in the film, says "The United States doesn't torture", he got a big laugh in this movie. It is obviously a lie that the Bush administration has denied over and over again. It's a very beautiful film and it's scary in what they can do for us when we lose all our civil rights. They can simply "tear" you anywhere and tell you they did it. In this case, they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on September 11th. Of course it's like you or me. And so they take him to a secret location outside the United States to torture him and waterboard. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well played by Jake and Reese and by the whole cast.
