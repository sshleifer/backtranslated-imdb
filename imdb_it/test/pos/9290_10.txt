This show is not to stop the hilarity. the first joke will make your pants wet. And this is probably the weakest joke of them all. I started watching it when the airing of the second half of season 2 started and I immediately got passionate just 2 weeks after starting watching. I downloaded episodes and bought the DVDs. Recurring clips like "Ad Road Test" and "current events" are silent. Then there is the announcement that "Use Emo. Use your tears for more effective use" take off. Even fun in the political side of things. There is nothing wrong with them doing this. It is funny. Any Australian who can't find this fun. Don't complain and don't watch it ALL Australian TUNE ON Wednesday at 9am on ABC
