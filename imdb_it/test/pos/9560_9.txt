This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. I watched for about 20 minutes, a little perplexed by what was happening. Then I started laughing and didn't stop long after the film ended. This impassive satire is indeed rare. Christopher Guest has a real eye for the humor of those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual males to begin with). As in "Waiting for Guffman", the guest incites the idiotic idiot of Middle America on the wall. I look forward to your next movie.
