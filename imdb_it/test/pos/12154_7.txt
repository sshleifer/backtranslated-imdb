I would be interested to hear from the director, Barbet Schroeder, why he decided to make More his first film, and in particular his interest in the hippies - or rather this form of the euro-hippie paradise - and their disappearance . The film is, at least, true enough to keep one interested, but in its kind of truth it is strange, biased. It's a given heroine (aka, "Horse") it's horrible, rotten stuff, the conclusion for many addicts who see it as being all-in-bottom, because basically it is: after everything else stops, it becomes life, and it is or a continuous race for more of it or of death. More it starts as something about a love story between a New York girl and a German man, but it becomes something else, for better or for worse (sometimes both in the same scene). <br /> <br /> It is basically two "young people", Estelle and Stefan, who meet in a city where Stefan came as a sort of tramp away from his home country. She is also wandering, and is perhaps too friendly with a pusher named big Wolf. They end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and, after a somewhat daring hold on an Estelle "horse," they also find a block in the shape of an apparently more remote house along the seashore. Schroeder's commentary on youth, sex and drugs is not too simplistic, which makes the film actually polished and intelligent years later. It is both direct and subtle, more on the characters and then on the fact that what he is painting could in other hands be just a hippie propaganda exploit film. Perhaps the most pleasant thing, and this is only a hypothesis, Schroeder uses as a inspiration the genre of long sequence of Bergman's Summer with Monika: two children in an inexorable connection, some good some decidedly not so good, set against (too much?) Landscapes perfectly taken up. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I should mention that there are problems, some big ones indeed. The performances are not very convincing in everything; some scenes strike a bit of power or have the actors in a good relationship with each other, but Klaus Grumberg plays down even if it is German in nature (in this case I would have preferred Klaus Kinski in the part to make him more crazy but deep enough for the topic) as Farmer does at his own level. And there are gaps in ingenuity in the script that prevent you from being as profound as they really think it is. On the other hand, there are two great things to do: Nestor Almendros, the great director of photography (ie Days of Heaven) is the PS and is a big boost for a director like Schroeder. Almost every image is seen with a fantastic purpose or art, whether it's a cliff on the sea or a sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room. <br /> <br /> The other thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason why I and many others have heard about the film in the first place (years before I really knew who Schroeder was I saw the soundtrack "More "every time I searched for Pink Floyd albums). It is great music in everything, occasionally the amazing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. This is also a bit boring, even if it is a film about free love and many drugs and sometimes both at the same time. I would never classify it near a Meddle or an Animal, certainly not on the Dark Side, but this also helps to elevate the object of another notch, particularly when it is less expected or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings like Stefan or other walks in the streets. It is an atmosphere almost better than the one the film itself deserves, but on the whole More is still worth looking at as a vintage piece, but powerful, like a less ambitious but more consistent Zabriskie Point.
