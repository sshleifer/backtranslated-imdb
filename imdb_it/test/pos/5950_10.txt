This is the last entry in the long series of films with the French agent, O.S.S. 117 (the French response to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s and generated at least eight films (none of which were ever released in the United States). 'O.S.S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies' is a small airy comedy that should not ... repeat NOT, be taken too seriously. Our protagonist is in the midst of a pursuit of spies in Egypt (with Morroco entering Egypt) to discover a long-lost friend. What follows is the style of James Bond / Inspector Cloussou. Although our man is something of an obvious xenophobic, sexist, homophobic, he is treated as pure farce (as I said, don't take it too seriously). Although there is a bit of rough language and violence on the comics, it is basically ok for older children (ages 12 and up). As previously stated in the subject line, just sit down, pass the popcorn and just enjoy it.
