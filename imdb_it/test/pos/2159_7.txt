Night hunter is a B-style action movie sold. Take a life and grow people. Don "the Dragon" Wilson is a kick boxer, (hall of fame) and not an actor. If you're looking for an Oscar, it's not brother here. Looking for a "kick ass" action movie with lower and lower budgets, that's it. The plot may have been a bit thin, but what the movie B is not. I understand that everyone is critical and that a man's garbage is another man's treasure. You get real people, judging each film as if it were an Oscar candidate, just silly. Fantastic fighting scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. Watch it if you are a fan, rent something else if you are an enemy.
