Logan Lerman and Dean Collins III of Jack & Bobby Fame offer a touch of familiarity as friends in this although not as close as they could be on Jack & Bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this film.Logan Lerman can apparently be typed into roles of being "different" as seen from here as seen in this as in Jack and Bobby. The film also opens with a very nice melody coined as lost 45 "And I wonder where the lions are?" A song that I always heard on the speaker @ my old ChristmasTreeShops work and I played it on my local Lost45s radio show hosted by Barry Scott but the last time I suggested this film with his dedication, but the dedication has been left out. The environmental demonstration is also well expressed in this film for the protection of earth owls as seen in this film. That too is a movie. Hoot, Sogive a cry in the tradition of the Wo Advertising of the odsey owl also in the 70s. Sincerely, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer a.k.a. "Ste".
