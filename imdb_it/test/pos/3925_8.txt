My university theater has just had a special screening last night of this film. I must say that I think everyone was impressed by the goodness of the film. However, my roommate didn't care, but he's not in the horror movies and goes to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of his fans, but I have to be honest and say that she was good and that she has the best scene of death. Overall, all the actors were very good. I won't go into the details of the plot since I'm sure you know it. Surprisingly, the characters are quite engaging and you actually care about them, especially the characters of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We meet them as rival brothers and end up having to work together. Another advantage is that it does not have the elegant appearance of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it almost looks like a documentary rather than a music video (don't get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and I enjoyed Amityville). <br /> <br /> Now for the scenes of death. In most slasher movies, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately moves to another scene, but not this one. When a character is about to die, he dies quite creepy. But filmmakers don't stop there and add something extra to every victim. I won't say anything about the scenes of death and I'll let you see them for yourself. <br /> <br /> Although these are great slasher films, it has the flaws of almost all slasher movies (which explore a creepy house when you shouldn't be, take a ride with a suspicious character, split up and scream so that the killer can hear you). Also, there's a kind of stupid twist that wasn't necessary and didn't add anything to the movie. You could say that it was just added at the last moment and if you removed it, it wouldn't affect the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you're a fan of horror movies, watch this movie. You will not be disappointed. It has everything you need to make it a great slasher movie, perhaps the best of the year even if it's a little early. The suspense is felt and is sometimes a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, chances are you like this and if you're divided, I encourage you to try it.
