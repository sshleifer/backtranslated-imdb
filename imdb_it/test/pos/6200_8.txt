Sleeper Cell is what should have been 24. 24 is a cartoon. (I see 24 years, but I feel betrayed by every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far.) Who can track while they're all the same. Jack gets into trouble, Jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in trouble and then ...) Sleeper Cell is really well done and is far superior. Unfortunately they blew it up with the end of the second season. I can think of half a dozen better endings on top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and would not have been so invented. Shame on writers for demolishing what had happened up until that final, a really good series.
