This is a very sweet, very funny training film, and Russell Crowe is amazing! Those who know him only from the Gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his acting skills. Arthur Baskin (his character) is one of the best virgins on the screen I've ever seen1 Watch this movie - how can we do it re-released in NTSC format? <br /> <br />
