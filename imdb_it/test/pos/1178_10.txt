Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau must be one of the best friends ever to work together. They've made a lot of movies together, I think they're both great when they work together in a movie. Out to sea is a fantastic comedy film that I think I see. I give the movie 10 out of 10. Jack lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the films they made together will be on TV. Unfortunately they will be missed. God bless you both.
