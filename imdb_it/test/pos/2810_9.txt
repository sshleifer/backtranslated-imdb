Surprisingly good done for T.V. Thriller. I didn't expect too much from this, but I'm happy to say that this is one of the best of its kind. It has a fast pace and presents a solid acting and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story involves you from the beginning and with many successes, you can't help but find the movie very interesting. <br /> <br /> The background story of the character of Thiessen is tough but it becomes a nightmare when her husband is something far worse than her childhood friend's stepfather. <br /> <br /> The concept of "foreigner" and his actions are disturbing considering that it is a common disease in society. A serial rapist does not respect the company or even his own family and this film shows the disease and crime perfectly. <br /> <br /> My beef with the film was the senseless situation when the character of Thiessen returns home with her deranged husband after being released on bail. At that moment he knew what he had done to his young relative (played by the friendly Allyson Hannigan). But this is just the typical Hollywood scene that causes the most problems. <br /> <br /> The climax scene shows Thiessen following her husband when he is about to commit another rape, then calls the cops who arrive in time just to catch him. The ending tells us that her husband was convicted for 99 years in prison in real life. <br /> <br /> Acting is also quite good, and Tiffany is fantastic and wonderful as always. The management is also very good.
