I was rather shocked to see the low rating this film received here, personally considering the fun family rates. It's about a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, who is sent by his mother to Coral Key to spend the summer with his uncle Porter. While there he befriends a dolphin named Flipper. There are a lot of adventures among the predictable bond between grandson and uncle and a bit of romance for Sandy with a local girl. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Crocodile Dundee, so I am absolutely in love with Paul Hogan in his role as Uncle Porter crisp and comical. For beginners, keep an endless supply of Spaghetti-O in your home to serve as your usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! Elija Wood, Frodo of The Lord of the Rings, appeared quite competent interpreting the young Sandy, a boy who at first did not like his club of forced summer holidays too much. <br /> <br /> Obviously the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. Set in the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This adaptation of Flipper makes family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental and fun movie that is infinitely superior to many of the film offerings for young people today.
