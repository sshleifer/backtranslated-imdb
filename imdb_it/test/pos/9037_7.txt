Check out those faces next to the prison entrance. They are not the faces of Hollywood extras. Someone in production was really good at filming in Oxford, Mississippi, because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot. Discover the dusty narrow streets, the icy ground below, and the barely hanging skeletal trees. No wonder those faces look hard and ruthless; they are only reflecting the ground from which they start. The old Lucas (Hernandez) has a better fear for his life, but then he comes from that same hard earth. <br /> <br /> The film works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimental and even has some suspense. Old Lucas is not very nice. He is a victim and we sympathize, but he is also haughty and hostile. Wisely, the script refuses to soften it. In this way we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice even against the less sympathetic. The script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism as it tends to become a preacher and less effective. Instead, we are shown how easily prejudice can condemn an ​​innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. Thus, it is through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed, a much more effective path. It also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable because otherwise they are part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Note how the film does not attack segregation. It is unlikely that the old Lucas would still want to mix with the whites and there is no indication that even the lawyer Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the color line except to see justice done. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the child (Jarman) whose head is not yet full of "notions". He is not exactly a friend of Lucas, but has glimpsed the common humanity of having become friends after falling into the frozen stream. The last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his most hidden parents (the dining table scene is important and easily overlooked). The lawyer may not join a future civil rights march, but the child could. This is the realistically hopeful side of the film. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of racially themed films during this short period of 3 years, 1949-51, (The Well, No Way Out, The Brave House, Lost Borders). Even the famous detached MGM entered the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, McCarthy's epilogue in Hollywood put an end to "problematic" films that may not serve the purpose of the Cold War. Even so, each of these points is worth remedying, not only because they are good films, but because even with the passage of 60 years and Jim Crow, they are still relevant.
