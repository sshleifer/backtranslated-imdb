This is one of those films that are very undervalued. I am again voting for an undervalued film. This film has a good plot, perhaps a bit far-fetched, but it could happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) shows us a good performance again. The boy does a great job in acting but is never recognized for his roles. He did well after the madmen. Not just him but Louis Gosset JR. does a good job. I thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters, but who cares about money anyway. All around this is a good movie that will have you sitting on the edge of the seat sometimes and the plot will keep the movie moving. I liked this movie and I hope that the rest of you will do it too.
