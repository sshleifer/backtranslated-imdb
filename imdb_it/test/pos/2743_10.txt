This is a witty and delightful adaptation of Dr. Seuss's book, brilliantly animated by the most beautiful and deserving Academy Award. Special mention should be given to the superb soundtrack and sound effects, which are a fundamental element in helping to make this cartoon so memorable and fun. Subsequent episodes of the series (of which there were four in total) were not actually based on Dr. Seuss' original material, although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyme style. The three sequels were: Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony (1953); How Now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing On Planet Moo (1956) - although he appeared in a later episode of Magoo.
