I saw this television version of a mysterious story by Christie when it was shown on Channel 5 in New York in 1980. At the time I was surprised that it wasn't shown on Channel 13, the public television station that showed most of the Masterpiece Theater. programs, but (apart from some stores of Dorothy Sayers "Lord Peter Wimsey" and THE MOONSTONE) BBC productions rarely had anything to do with British detective stories. Another series, THE RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, had dealt with stories set in the Victorian and Edwardian period, so a period charm was involved in bringing those stories to Channel 13. <br /> <br /> The WHY plot DIDN'T YOU REQUEST EVANI? dealt with a young couple stumbled upon a dying man who is only the last word is the question of the title of the story (the novel was originally called WHY WOULD NOT ASKED TO ASK FOR EVANS ?, but was later renamed THE BOOMERANG CLUE). The young couple begins to investigate the murder and trace the crime to a group of people surrounding a questionable doctor (Eric Porter). Despite the warnings of the hero's father (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) pursue their investigations - even if they become more obscure and dangerous. The death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent danger as the murderer begins to try to silence the two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> It is not a bad movie, although I agree that it was a little too long for one night of entertainment (if it had been done later as episodes of Miss Marple with Joan Hickson, or the episodes of Hercule Poirot, in two parts would have been better). But it has its strengths. One is the correct use of Porter as the main suspect, and a clever scene later in the film in which he seems to be spying on the young couple investigating the mystery. If you stick to the film, you'll be in for a surprise later. <br /> <br /> But he failed. When it comes to a Christie novel, the figures of the story must be in a rigid program of movements so that the reader can understand what the secret of the plot is. I'll just add that if you hear the dialogue in one place and how a little boy was almost killed (but he wasn't), then you'll find all the parts of the story that come together and what the villains are motivating. <Apart from that and the time it takes for the show to tell its story, it's a pretty good film and worthy as one of the best programs based on a story by Christie in the period when theirs was suddenly reborn in movies based on his novels.
