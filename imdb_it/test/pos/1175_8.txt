8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, shortly after watching this film, I took a critical view, feeling that Lemmon and Matthau had practically "phoned" their performances, which matched them in a way they had done several times before. br /> <br /> But after seeing it again, it seemed different, especially given the fact that none of the two main mega-stars lived much longer after its release. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Spiner, all eight major artists are highly experienced artists, and also inevitably very "longer" than we have seen in many of their other films and TV work. But isn't it almost all? <br /> <br /> Seeing it again, although it certainly won't be considered a "class" in any of their careers, it's a fun movie, with lots of interesting scenarios from my point of view, it reminds me that many movies , plays, etc., can often be looked at from a very critical point of view, or by looking instead at the lighter side, without expecting a film to be another "Citizen Kane", "Casablance" or (in terms of two leads ), another original "Strange couple". It will also provide a continuous piece of nostalgia for Lemmon and Matthau, as well as others in the cast.
