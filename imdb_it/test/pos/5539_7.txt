If you are looking for a film for the mafia that is not too serious, with a female as the protagonist, you are in the right place. Pfieffer did much better than this. You can see that it has matured beyond this image. <br /> <br /> When I took this film for the first time, I expected Pfeiffer to be a bit uncomfortable, however, she plays the role of his mob wife to the hilt. Not even a negative performance by Baldwin. <br /> <br /> If you don't pay attention to your hair, you could enjoy this movie. But don't take it too seriously ...
