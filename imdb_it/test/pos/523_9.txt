During the making of this film, I once heard a statement on television about it. Something like: "Killingg√§nget is now taking off Nazism?" <br /> <br /> So, my understanding of this film was from the beginning to have a notion of Nazism. When I recently saw this film in the TV version I had this filter in front of me and it was not difficult to see it. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I have not encountered this way of interpreting the film since I first heard it. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four shades of brown". In all four stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster: <br /> <br /> 1. The crematorium shows no realistic empathy for dead animals or for those who have had to greet them. In the crematorium room in dealing with death and fire is almost like a cheerful game for him. The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boyfriend consequently, in ignorance he pushes a button that leads to the disaster that seriously injures his father. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: the importance of showing young people adequate emotions. When they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good. <br /> <br /> 2. The magician maneuver his wife like an invisible puppeteer. Just when he thinks he has begun to cut the strings to the masters' hand, reaching his personality, integrity and joy, he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and "good" taste in opposition to the "bad" taste of his parents. The real problem he is bringing in is far from understandable to him: the behavior of his fathers passes when he suffocates his wife in his immaculate environment. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: Oppression generates slavery. <br /> <br /> 3. The father who was abused as a child transmits sadism to his children when he betrays them on their inheritance. It robs them of their childhood and even their inheritance. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: When no love has been given to you, you cannot give any. <br /> <br /> 4. The abuse of her fathers' daughter creates in her a ruthless avenger with a sadistic aggression. Here the cold Nazi fascism becomes very evident in physical violence. It gives a possible background and some kind of plausible explanation for the behavior of the behavior of young "scin-heads" when they oppress others. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson? : Can Nazism be born in a perverted house? <br /> <br /> Can the hateful consequence of ignoring empathy in family life, in the long run, if that room is given to sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very rarely does a film contain so much. It reveals little by little as I meditate on it. I consider it brilliantly "painted" and the actors are superb. Especially the good looks of Ulf Brunnberg who turns out to be the worst of all ..
