I have just seen the finale of season 2 of Doctor Who and, apart from a couple of boring episodes, this show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> It is a sad loss for which we salute a main character once again in the final season but the show continues. <br /> <br /> The BBC needs to increase the budget on the show, there are just so many things that can happen in London and surrounding areas. Even some of the special effects are all very good, on some occasions they have to be a little more shiny. <br /> <br /> It was a big bet for the BBC to bring back a show that lost a long time ago and must congratulate themselves for doing so. <br /> <br /> Switch to the 2006 Christmas special, the 2005 Christmas special was by far the best thing on television.
