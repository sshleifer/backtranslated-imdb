This is the episode that probably most closely refers to his partner right, "Thou Shalt Not Kill," as it brings up the always controversial topic directly, "Because we kill people who kill people to prove that killing is mistaken?" This issue is presented in two parts within the episode: before the murder, when the film shows the dichotomy between the emerging idealist lawyer and the street hooligan so caught up in his ways that his life is simply a representation of what is supposed to do, followed by the period after the trial and before the execution, when both are made to suffer for the deaths they feel responsible for and then share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about the way these episodes work is both small and large, in which the story is fully developed, so that we understand both the motivations and the stories of characters with which we can only spend less than an hour with. Despite all his criminal intentions and insult, the killer is still very understanding, turning the most important part of his actions around a story of accidental death. His way of killing is more the desire to control death than any desire to destroy. Similarly, the lawyer's idealistic ingenuity shows a reluctant to allow death to occur in a world where he cannot control it. Their meeting is, in fact, important; both must yield to it while they do not propagate it. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, it is interesting to note how much this episode influences Rouge's vision, Kieslowski's next completion of the Trois Colors trilogy. One of Kieslowski's major influences seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and considering that the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents Divine Justice, this seems almost the most conscious. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
