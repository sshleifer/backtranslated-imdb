I say sadly because if you see this movie now, you realize how much our media has sunk - all the warning signs are in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, I think James Brooks' last great movie but others might disagree. He has rich characters (who are credible as well), great acting, great writing, and even though the music has become a bit rough, I also liked it. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is amazing. And Albert Brooks leaves with all the scenes he finds himself in - this triangle of people is magnificently drawn and compelling and makes the whole movie go above its vital and important topic of the news, and how it is slowly being compromised in our nation. <br /> <br /> Watch this with NETWORK for a really fun and terrific evening.
