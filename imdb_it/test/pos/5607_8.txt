One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if there could be a "bad" one.) Although this may be a little more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect. Nevertheless, he still maintains that inclination of Hartley to which we are all used. <br /> <br /> First Image Jesus and Satan discuss their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the imminent end of civilization. Now imagine the whole conversation taking place on some drinks in your neighborhood bar. And as a further conversational distraction (not to mention visual), we launch PJ Harvey as the sultry companion (called Magdelena) to Mr. Chist. Then, just for the smiles, in the background, always present the Salvation Army Band (played by Yo La Tengo) as an additional diversion. The road to moral justification has never been so pleasant. <br /> <br /> Most likely more questions than answers, but here is the fun. And Mr. Donovan is a brilliant submissive, as always.
