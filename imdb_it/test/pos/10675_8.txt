'Doppleganger', (or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known) was written (with the intervention of the late Donald James) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, better known for their television ' Supermarionation 'shows as "Thunderbirds". <br /> <br /> The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and proposes to send a manned flight. The committee hesitates for the exorbitant cost and puts aside the project. But when a security flaw is discovered in the agency, fearing that the Russians might arrive sooner, the project gets the green light. <br /> <br /> The American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) is in collaboration with the British scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry). After weeks of grueling training, the Phoenix explodes, heading for the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, their ship crashes into what looks like a gloomy and mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is seriously injured. You see a light moving towards them ... <br /> <br /> I will leave the synopsis here. Up to this point, the film has been compelling, with excellent special effects (by Derek Meddings) and music by Anderson resident composer Barry Gray (because it was not published on C.D. it's a mystery). But when Ross and Kane crash, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it's a duplicate of ours, everyone on it is the same, the only main difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting and ends up with an anti - upsetting climate. I think cinema was the wrong place to make this idea, in fact Gerry and Sylvia later did something similar in their show 'Space: 1999'. Ross risks (and eventually loses) his life trying to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar that it might not even be bothered. <br /> <br /> Roy Thinnes has recently made the television series "The Invaders", and offers a competent performance (too bad that there were no more scenes like the one where he is playing with his wife). Ian Hendry is as good as "Kane", but he fades from history too soon. Several actors have appeared in the "U.F.O." by Andersons. like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you'll miss Nicholas Courtney ('The Brigadier' ​​from 'Dr. Who' in a tiny role). But the honors of the actor go to Patrick Wymark as "Jason Webb", head of Eurosec. The character is not very far from "Sir John Wilder", the one he played in "The Power Game" by A.T.V. Webb is such a sneaky character that it's wonderful to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution (as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye) equals little more than a cameo. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are wonderful, as are the sets. So it's worth watching the movie, but don't expect it to happen much once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another "Planet Of The Apes" or - dare I say - 2001: A Space Odyssey. <br /> <br /> In Anderson's productions, he made the future look like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had brilliant cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no idea that something was really wrong in the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every other night. What a disappointment. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, hopefully it's a better place than this. If all the women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'll be on the next flight!
