Even if you move away from the book a little, you can't help but love music and atmospheric settings. <br /> <br /> Bath scenes are just as they should be. Even though you looked at it every time I noticed that the people in the background are the same in every scene, but other than that, I like the scene they are in Hot Bath, but men and women really do wash together like that? You could see all the men perched around watching women. It seemed strange that they all had their hats on their heads, but perhaps this was the style at that time. The ballroom scenes were beautiful, the dances and clothes looked beautiful. I particularly liked Catherine's dress in the first dance scene. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey seemed appropriately impressive, but I really enjoyed the Bath scenes. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger offers a good but not exceptional performance like Catherine Morland. Googie Withers offers the best performance as Ms. Allen I. <br /> <br /> Ugh Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he talks about a lot of trash, and he is not a cleric like he should be, it's hard to think about being in love of Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression. <br /> <br /> General Tilney is played quite well by Hardy, and Stuart also offers a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not perform as well as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, he gives the impression of a squalid and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I really like it. <br /> <br /> I can handle scenes cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added, it usually annoys me. The marquise! I hate her. She's not part of Northanger's story and neither is her cartwheel boy. <br /> <br /> part of the script is peculiar. When Catherine asks Elinor Tilney about her mother's death, she asks "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a stupid thing to say! Elinor's calm response is also stupid. <br /> <br /> however, tell me if you agree or disagree with me
