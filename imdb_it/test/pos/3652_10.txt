I just saw him at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most beautiful film, the best I've seen in a while. Isa's seductive character is an open character, explorer and (as noted in the film) full of love - played without any doubt by the beautiful Camille Natta. The accompanying music is relaxing and transportable, a balm for the soul. <br /> <br /> Each character seems to be somewhat in conflict - and their interactions (with conflicts) create a great story. The story told by A.K. The Hangal as the Old Man was magically done - I wanted it to go on and on. <br /> <br /> That Hari seemed to remember his "place" throughout history added power to the story - a refreshing change in the headline bubble of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent film. Go look.
