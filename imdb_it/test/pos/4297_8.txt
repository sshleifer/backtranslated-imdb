I wish there were more films about middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the turns of the moral road of life make the vision interesting. There seems to be a different standard of judgment on women who have extra marriage relationships than men. Amy Watson's painful and humiliating behavior towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reversing roles and expecting a torrent of condemnation towards man. If he had found the husband boring and judicious, he could have told her, he left and he certainly waited for a big financial deal after the divorce. The country and London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the autumn climate superbly adds to the melancholy background. The finish is perfect, so in tune with real adult life.
