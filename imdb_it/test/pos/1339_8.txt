This is a difficult film to examine, as several factors must be taken into account. We filter the most judicious. Ok, are you interested in the facts about Jeffrey Dahmer's serial killer? Can you stand a low budget independent film? Are you objective enough NOT to love a movie just for its lack of stars or professional look? Well, if you said yes, you should have a mind open enough to handle this. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent spree of murder, and is designed as an autobiography. It is not an unreal and unrealistic story that unfortunately was the theatrical film "Dahmer" (2001). The film begins with Dahmer, played quite convincingly by Carl Crew, sitting in the police car while they rake up his apartment. His thoughts on what brought him there are presented in a past-tense narrative style that carefully explains many of Dahmer's psychoses and motivations that led him to commit a murder almost 20 times. We will know the character, both the sneaky side and the moderately close side to normal life. It is nobody's fault, but Dahmer is that 17 people died, but being a student of criminal psychology, I was pleased with not only his animalistic part represented, frankly, in this film. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother and also trying to find company, but of course we are witnesses of the side of him that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little violence on the actual screen, with much of what is suggestive of gunshots such as splashes of blood or a body being struck through a blurred tent. You see two deaths that I remember, one is a nice cut of the throat without bloodshed and the other is a man pushed alive in a barrel of acid. While you see nothing graphic, this cruelty and the convincing acting of Crew and his victim make this scene disturbing. And while the mutilation on the real screen is kept low, you will see the results. There is a hand and a head or two, but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and does not seem to be exploitative. Furthermore, these fake anatomical pieces are where budget constraints are visible. Although acceptable, they seem fake enough not to disturb too much. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, due to the fact that he was released a year or two earlier. This is the only big difference compared to real history, and the information that remains is, as I have said, very faithful to the facts. The quality of the film could be better, the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet, and the acting of several characters is a bit friend, but it is not exaggerated. In my opinion, this is an imperfect aspect but ultimately honest and serious in one of the most remembered American serial killers. I think it's safe to say that the film is also memorable, and I respect it to overcome its limitations in delivering the story in a believable way, helped by an excellent Carl Crew as Dahmer.
