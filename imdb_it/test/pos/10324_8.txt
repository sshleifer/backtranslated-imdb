Clyde Bruckman borrows the premise of this short of "Seven Chances" by Buster Keaton, recently rebuilt in a lukewarm way as "The Bachelor". In the original, Buster has 24 hours to marry in order to inherit a large sum of money. In this version, the music teacher Prof. Shemp has only 7 hours (after all, it's a short one!). This is one of Stooges' best short films due to the plot and wonderful routines (including the phone booth scene with Moe & Shemp, reminiscent of "Berth Marks" by Laurel & Hardy and the famous Marx Brothers booth in "Night At The Opera - here the boys keep their place in their variation of this routine.) I am not a big Stooges fan, but this should be noticed by every comedy student as one of the best after the 1930s short films.
