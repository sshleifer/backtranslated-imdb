Incredible, one of my favorite films to the end. I think I can be proud of not appreciating what "ordinary people" tend to do. Jackie Mason is hilarious in this film, and also Randy Quaid. I can never get enough of his "strong arm" tactics, just like in Moving. It was also noteworthy in the Christmas holidays of National Lampoon. I love that boy.
