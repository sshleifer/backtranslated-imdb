As a non-theist, I am not going to comment on the theory of the great man who changed the world 150 years ago. Sure to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. The film was produced by the BBC and, to tell the truth, could have been easily broadcast on television. While the acting is superb, the film itself is not really worthy of a real cinematic release. That said, if it reaches a wider audience in this way, then so be it. But I saw a lot of vintage drama on BBC TV and they were fine with this final standard. Don't expect too much of a great thrill ride when you go see it. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I found the movie almost out to apologize to religious fundamentalists. While achieving a good sense of tension all the way, I couldn't help but want it to get to the release of The Origin Of Species much more quickly than it actually did (you'll wait until the end for that). And he seemed to dwell much more than I ever was aware of Darwin's struggle with himself and his wife Emma, ​​who portrayed him almost as a sort of crazy fool sometimes - which is not true at all. There are many other mistakes and facts that are missing in relation to the true history of the lead up until the publication of Origin, but the entire premise of the film focuses almost entirely on the difficulty that Darwin faced nationally with the book, and a small part on the death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene, where Annie dies as she asks one last time to hear Darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan who died of pneumonia. However, you will probably feel a greater bond with the primate in that scene than with Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> With the first controversy that apparently surrounds the film in the US, it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will be able to see it. But to be honest, there is actually very little that obscures any mythical divinity. His unimportant news on a theory that was about 150 years after all. But as fundamental Christians (and many other religions of which we are all well aware), such as waving a cartel or two when possible, I imagine that this film is the best excuse of all. Personally, I can't understand what it is. But maybe they're just making monkeys around ...
