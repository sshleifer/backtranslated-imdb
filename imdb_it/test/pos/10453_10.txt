Spoilers in this review! Despite some highly unlikely scenes, including the PE boys who measure their penises in a competition and the few mandatory cartoons, trying to get the cartoons, this film captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teenage films ever have done. He joins him not only by showing the trio of friends, Gary, Dave, Rick, who smoke, drink, always looking for prey, but also dwell on the nature of friendship itself, as these three friends have tested their loyalty . This film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. For the shy romantic Gary, when he sees the beautiful Karen for the first time he falls in love instantly. The excitement of awakening in Gary is written big on the screen, and shows his love for her by bringing her home when she is kidnapped by her lover. This love for Karen marks the end of Gary's innocence, as the ties with his two best friends will be tested and interrupted throughout history. The confident gentleman, Rick, is the person in high school who we all secretly hope to be beautiful, beautiful and always has incredibly beautiful girls in a swoon. Rick turns out to be a cad, but you must keep in mind that his character is only 17 years old. He starts to panic and makes a wrong decision. From Rick's point of view, the story also talks about finding the only girl of his dreams, a bad breakup, and then eventually reconciling. The look on Rick's face as Gary enters and sees Karen kissing Rick, shows he finally understands that he is his best friend and loves the same woman. As in real life, you don't give up because your friend has unrequited love. This is the tragedy of the film. Rick is not a villain, and constantly through the film reminds Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. The profound quality of Gary's performance, however, is the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place and he is consumed with love for Karen. However, Karen is ultimately not touched by Gary's devotion and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who welcome without giving back, who live in the emptiness of their ego and never cease to realize the emotional damage and the trauma they inflict on others. This film is brutal in his statements about love and friendship, but that's what makes him unique among teenagers. It ceases to be a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film, although condemned to a tragic conclusion. Anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and has not won, will understand. The harrowing high school melodies are just as real as the emotional tensions of adulthood, and this film will remind you of this in bold. Gary's final reversal, as he walks away with the inscribed medallion, is the most touching moment of any other in the cinema. He feels, after seeing this, that he is really made of two films. The first part is a stupid sexploitation film for teenagers, and once the story begins, it's a drama that has a strong impact. A fantastic film. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars including The Police, The Cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, The Plimsouls, The Waitresses, Gleaming Spiers and Phil Seymour.
