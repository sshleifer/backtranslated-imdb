Ok, I love this movie !!!!! I looked at him again and again. It's so hard to say who the aggressor is. You keep thinking that it is one person, then another, then the first person again, then another person. It is so full of suspense that you want to quickly advance your TV to the end to see who it is. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at home. He is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. She goes from her meeting with her steady boyfriend, to her teacher who she really likes, to her ex-boyfriend, to all the different stories, to all the suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love acting, they have a lot of great talents here. The suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb. If it comes on TV watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
