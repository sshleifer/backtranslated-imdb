This small, quiet and harmonious film becomes a masterpiece of human dignity. It is intelligently structured, full of small significant details and important plots. It tells the story of a man of great humanity without positioning himself politically, but promoting life as a precious right (not an obligation) and emphasizing the right of choice of the individual. It enjoys the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages ​​(important details). Exceptional acting of each of the actors, especially the incredible Javier Bardem. His presence on the screen has such a force that he forgets that this is fiction. The film has a wonderful rhythm, is beautifully shot and extraordinarily direct. It takes real talent to make a film on such a difficult subject with understanding, humor and heart. Six stars out of five.
