Brilliant Biographic FILM ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well, this is definitely one of my favorites. Biographical film This film was a total surprise for me. I've been avoiding this movie for a long time. This is because I am not a Jamie Foxx fan. I'm still not a big fan of him, but I'm sure I'm a fan now. <br /> <br /> Well, he deserved every BIT of that Oscar. His performance is one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. It's really sensational! <br /> <br /> Well, storytelling, or the flow of history, is brilliant for a biographical film. I'm a fan of DRAMA so I didn't get bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was so surprised that I liked the movie so much I didn't see any flaws in the movie. I think there are no flaws in the film. Maybe some event errors But hey Who Cares? <br /> <br /> Even the performance of the woman who plays Ray's mother was really GOOD. And good Kerry Washington ?? she has so much potential ... if she has the right role, she could just be the next Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> Well, the story of their movie was so EMOTIONAL so TOUCHING .. I cried ?? I cried very badly ???? <br /> <br /> I don't care if things went wrong or why this movie made me cry ?? And that's a lot for me! <br /> <br /> All in all a superb film ????. One of the best of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
