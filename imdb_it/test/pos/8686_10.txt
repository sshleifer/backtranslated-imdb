I saw the Nile Princess for the first time when I was about 10 years old. Now I'm 63 and I've never forgotten the movie. Nor have I overcome my fascination with Egypt. I searched the Internet trying to buy the movie, but I was unable to locate it. I wonder if this is one of Hollywood's lost films. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such a charisma together. If I had to ask anything about the movie, I couldn't tell you who was in it. I vaguely remember a scene from the Nile with Debra Padget a group of other women. I always wanted to see it again. I never thought of it as an escape movie, but now I can see where the case occurred. I hope they put it on DVD and I can see it again before I die. It was a wonderful film.
