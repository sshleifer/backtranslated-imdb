I saw this movie during a special preview in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Michael and Rory, have become friends when Rory was introduced to the nursing home that Michael already resides. Michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand it, because until now his palesano has made people think that he could not communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he is losing. Rory is an exuberant character who does not let his condition (Muscular Dystrophy) reach him. <br /> <br /> They tie and apply to live independently, and find an adorable apartment and assistant and have all the fun they could ever dream of. <br /> <br /> Don't go see this movie if you are looking for some "Entertainment". Go see this movie if you're willing to see something different. <br /> <br /> The plot is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes from the film, the mood is uplifting. <Br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. Even if you are like me and prone to crying, take handkerchiefs, as you will need them!
