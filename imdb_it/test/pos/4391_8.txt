I saw it originally several years ago while sitting on the couch and was stuck watching it on HBO. With the remote control out of my reach I decided to go with it and was waiting for a miserable film I had been avoiding for a year. So it started and I wasn't very optimistic, but after about ten minutes I found myself laughing. The exact opposite as I expected. The play was smart, the acting pretty good considering that the cast worked very well together and the story (even if a bit clumsy and fake) was actually quite funny. <br /> <br /> Three condemned brothers manage to escape from their sentence in the end will go in search of their fortune. The film is set in the 1930s. So along the way, they encounter a series of fun and interesting characters. Everyone has a different story or result they are struggling for. In fact, most of the film may seem random. Some might say it was useless and boring, but if you're looking for the clever (and sometimes stupid) comedy that is integrated into the film, I'm sure you'll like it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed performances by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Everyone did very well in their roles, they worked great together. But to finish it, "Brother, where are you?" it's an intelligent, fun and cinematic adventure that I wouldn't let go.
