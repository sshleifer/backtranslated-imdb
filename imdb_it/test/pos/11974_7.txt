I would consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz; having read a number of his novels and enjoyed them all, but unfortunately I've never been able to read Watchers so I have no choice but to rate this film on its merits rather than compare it to the book I didn't read. I expected something terrible, and while I didn't exactly have a brilliant horror movie; I am led to believe that it is the fans of the book who consider it negative because, as a film in its own right, Watchers is a little horror movie that is funny and quite original. The plot obviously has some influence on Predator's part and starts with an explosion in a research laboratory. It is not long before a farmer is killed by a strange beast and the boyfriend of the deceased's daughter has caught an out-of-control intelligent dog. A secret government agency is soon on the case, while the murders continue. The boy continues to be fascinated by the dog's intelligence, but somehow he ties himself with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail. <br /> <br /> The screenplay for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later denied it. I do not know why ?? the writing here is not at all ridiculous like its 2004 success Crash! However, the main reason why this movie works is undoubtedly the dog, which besides being pretty cute, is also the best actor in the film. Corey Haim, who enjoyed the success of The Lost Boys, is the human protagonist and actually has a pretty good chemistry with the dog, although it's a bit ridiculous to see him talk about it for most of the movie. The plot is rather complicated and as such the film is more than a little messy; but the ridiculousness of it all pulls him through during the most embarrassing moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as the "bad cop" of government agents. The monster is, of course, one of the most interesting things in the film and the way it goes about killing people is always fun and bloody; although unfortunately we don't see much of it and when we finally do it it's rather disappointing - obviously the filmmakers saw Bigfoot and the Hendersons! Still, this is the kind of film that can be easily appreciated despite the many problems and I would recommend it to any non-interested horror viewer of the eighties.
