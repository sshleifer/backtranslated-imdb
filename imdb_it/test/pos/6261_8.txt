This is a beautiful, funny, vivid film. It is even better than "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which is in parallel but not replicated. The story completes a complete circle and the theater lit up as the titles rolled. One hundred years after this story takes place, we are equally intrigued by the flickering images in a dark theater.
