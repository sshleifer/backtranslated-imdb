I saw this film for the first time years ago, when it was still new and I was satisfied. It's a great Hollywood fantasy story for teenagers. However, it is not realistic. As much as you want to believe it, these stories never happen. That's why it is irritating to watch such films. They play with the minds of adolescents, imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and were disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. The director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about the actors. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea is not worth 10. There are many films about teenagers. So why don't we make a better one?
