The title of my summary pretty much covers my review. <br /> <br /> This is for me what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was for someone 5 years older. While I missed that little wave of pop culture, I embraced the toy line and t.v. series that was Mighty Max with both arms. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know how I was? I went as Mighty Max for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the internet. Thanks to Demonoid, last week I was able to see this great spectacle of my childhood for the first time in over a decade. <br /> <br /> I'm watching this moment, having just been swept away by recognizing Rob Paulson of Animaniacs and will also love the celebrity humor in "Tar Wars". 4 minutes in, and have already mentioned, for NAME: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne, and Ace Ventura. Hells yes. <br /> <br /> Damn it, it's only after writing this that I realize there is NO HELL, I can give this series something less than a perfect score. Any imperfection has been lost in the fog of time. <br /> <br /> This Is My Childhood. This is Awesomeness. This is the powerful.
