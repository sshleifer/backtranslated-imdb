He is very good at this role of dissatisfied and bored husband, a decorated aeronautical officer, who gets bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change. <br /> <br /> One evening he meets Karen Sillas, an attractive woman younger than his current wife. A relationship develops, and Cole decides to take it to the next level. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have a relationship, he pretends his death to escape his family obligations. The lies become more and more of a model as he starts robbing the banks to keep his new wife (Sillas) happy, and to project the image that is a success. A fictional illusion, apparently. <br /> <br /> This was also based on a true story that makes it even more intriguing. Cole is credible and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10.
