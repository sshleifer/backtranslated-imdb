WORTH FOR: If not for the work of Mick Molloy, then for Judith Lucy. He brings his usual classy style of unbridled slander to the role, and steals the show in parts. <br /> <br /> IMHO: I'm not a great autograph hunter, but I've collected 3. The first is Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin makes only one cameo, Molloy is not just a star, but he co-wrote and co-produced this film. I have been a fan of them for years (apparently I was the only one laughing during the urination on the set in the first episode of the short The Mick Molloy Show), so I went to this with high expectations. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of work on this thing, there are many of his usual brands. Phrases like "blow up your ass" and "these bowls are their home" are everywhere, as well as a lot of Winnie Blues being sucked. It's also the kind of stupid and original story you'd expect from someone like him. It's like one of those cut-out American sporting comedies, where they get a baseball team out of prisoners or something. But rather than trying to make a boring American sport such as baseball or a grill interesting, this film focuses on a sport usually left to the gray army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this and other types of sports comedies is that this is very, very funny. What is even better is that, even if the subject of this film is a young man who joins an old game, it is never offensive to the elderly, and never becomes sloppy or anything. It's just a good laugh at authentic 1972 prices. Mick is exceptional in the first real acting role I've ever seen in him, as well as Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but then many of them did a lot of practice ... This it's the best Australian comedy I've seen in a long time. Go see it and learn the joys of Lawn Bowls! <br /> <br /> YOU LIKE: Major League? <br /> <br /> SCORE: 8/10
