Eric Bogosian offers an exceptional performance like you will never see in an Oliver Stone movie. His character Barry is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he blows away anyone, inside or outside the air, who offends him. Adapted from Bogosian's theatrical performance, "Talk Radio" is a vicious and scary ride that won't let you out until it's too late. At that point, you are familiar with the fringe of racists, rapists, paranoids, murderers and simple pranksters who listen, talk and hide in the darkness of Dallas nights. <br /> <br /> Stone behaves, even if it is possible, letting Bogosian dominate every scene, from Barry's humble origins to the point of realization or rupture when his radio program can reach national syndication. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent as the lovers and / or collaborators that all have been used and set aside by Barry in common. <br /> <br /> The only thing I would change is the recurring theme music, "Bad To The Bone". I would have used "Not Fragile" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive. A better song, one I've never heard in a film so far and an irresistible melody, whose eerie riff is like the real soundtrack of Barry's life. <br /> <br /> Listen if you dare!
