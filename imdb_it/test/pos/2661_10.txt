The awakening of the human race is the theme of "2001: A Space Odyssey", a process that develops along a space-time continuum. We "see" our primordial past and "inflate" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our continuous collective journey. <br /> <br /> From this transcendental perspective, a conventional and egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenetic conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. It is therefore not surprising that some of us suffocate the slowness of the film and its minimal history. For perceptive spectators, remuneration is an inspiring sense of wonder and wonder. <br /> <br /> In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think that the elegant black monolith is a probe by Von Neumann. Could be. Undoubtedly, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. The mystery is deeper than the explanation. <br /> <br /> "2001 ..." is unique among films in content and scope. Cinematography is out of the world, special and visual effects are breathtaking and classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a film. But "2001: A Space Odyssey" by Stanley Kubrick is art in the highest sense, like "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo da Vinci or "The Starry Night" by Vincent Van Gogh.
