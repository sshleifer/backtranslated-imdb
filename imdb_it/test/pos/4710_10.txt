Luxuriantly written and modified cinematography, Beyond Rangoon by John Boorman is a must for anyone interested in world politics and personal transformation. It weaves a personal and political story that continues to haunt me, popping up frequently in my mind. The plot is compelling, and the inner and outer paths are parallel with attention and delicacy, both cinematically and in the plot. I've seen this film at least six times, and it's actually a real ballot. It is particularly relevant today, given the world events. Take a look, you won't regret it! BTW, NetFlix hasn't brought it yet, but you can request it.
