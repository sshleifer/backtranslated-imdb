Christopher Nolan's first film is a black and white "no budget" film about an unemployed writer who begins to follow strangers, which in turn leads to robberies and even violence. It's very beautiful. <br /> <br /> As in his next film "Memento", he does not present the story in a linear fashion. Instead it jumps a bit so as to end up really sucked in trying to put it together and at first, seemingly random, the shots take on importance while the film progresses. This style also means that the twists are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you have the chance (especially if you like his later work and / or Film Noir)
