Alex North (John Cassavetes) has problems with his father and flees home to join the army, from where he soon gives up and comes to New York with the intention of starting a new life, using as an advantage the fact that no one knows of his past. Find a job at the Waterfront, where he meets Tommy Tyler (Sydney Poitier), a lively young man, happily married and in contrast to the sad and unhappy character of Cassavetes. Very soon they become good friends and Tommy does his best to help his friend. The only problem is that their superior at work, a hard worker, Charles Malik (Jack Warden) is a bit envious of their friendship, as well as Tommy's steady disposition and happy success in his personal life. He really manages to make life difficult when he gets to know the truth about Alex's past. <br /> <br /> A good drama skillfully directed by Oscar-nominated director and producer Martin Ritt (The Hud) and with wonderful performances by Sydney Poitier and Jack Warden. 7/10
