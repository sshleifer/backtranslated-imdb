I've always been fascinated by silent films. There is something about seeing 100-year-old actors and actresses perform. Stunned by today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to watch a particular movie at the time of its original release. Helps to appreciate the harshness of ancient cinema. <br /> <br /> "The life and passion of Jesus Christ" is a very fascinating production of Pathe, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and finally published in 1905. Imagine a series of famous religious paintings that come to life, separated by titles, and you'll have a good idea of ​​what this movie is like. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest while escaping to Egypt is almost identical to the 1879 painting by Luc Olivier Merson "Rest on the Flight into Egypt", up to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx. While some may find these "living paintings" an imaginative cop-out, I found them very fascinating and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Sets and costumes seem to have just emerged from a theatrical production of the life of Christ. Possibly from and elaborate the game of the passion of the day. The cast make-up is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of Jesus is almost comical. Once again, where others might be bothered by their rudeness, I was quite fascinated. <br /> <br /> After being filmed for a period of 3 years, continuity is not so bad. The biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over time. The 12-year-old characters of John the Apostle and Jesus change at mid-stage, to the public's surprise! <br /> <br /> The best unintended humor in the film is in the scene of Birth of Jesus. The child appears LITERALLY, as if by magic, in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was just my mood when I saw it, but I laughed loudly! If only the birth of a child was so easy !!!! To top it off, the actress who plays Mary looks bored across the whole scene (actually, through the whole movie), as if this kind of thing happened every day! My, how the times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simplistic as this film, compared to today, it really is a wonderful window into the past. I recommend it! <br /> <br />
