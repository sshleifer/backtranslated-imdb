Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time and this film is about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and above all what he was, is moving and emotional. <br /> <br /> This film captures the spirit of what architecture really is, what good design is and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the soundtrack. If you see the movie and then listen to the soundtrack, you can revisit the movie simply by listening. As a practicing architect for over 30 years, my heart has suffered and I have been happy about the film and it is very simple, although honestly emotional and sincere. <br /> <br /> I had the honor of seeing this film premiered in Chicago at the National Convention of the American Institute of Architects. The film was presented by Daniel, and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session later. During the entire presentation of the film, not a sound, not a cough, no distraction occurred. The entire audience sat mesmerized, and the real surprise was that Daniel's mother was present during the screening of the film. <br /> <br /> I will always remember the film, and I will repeat it constantly in my mind every time I listen to the soundtrack ...
