This is a real sci-fi movie gem! Peter Cushing adds a great personality to this classic of mid-century cinema. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the sound design. The strange rippling voices of the creatures and the creatures of the rhinoceros provide a bizarre background (of course the little-dressed child does not hurt either!) <br /> <br />
