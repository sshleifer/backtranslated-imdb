I have to admit I loved this movie. Sure, I'm sure you know that the "Malcolm in the Middle" star Frankie Muniz, and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes "The Amanda Show" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure we can all to. The film is about a boy Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda) starting an adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> At the beginning Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who lies around his everyday life problems. One day Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf (the great bad director). Jason's English card is stolen by Wolf and the adventure begins with Kaylee to earn his father's trust. They go to Hollywood looking for Wolf to bring him back. Frankie and Amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to bring back Wolf, and all he has to do is call Jason's father and tell him that he stole his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, being good trials and victories. <br /> <br /> The story is nice and fifth grade, but what do you expect to be classified as a PG. I truly believe this is one of the best family comedies of the years. Not only do children act exceptionally, an exceptional cast, well written, but it's fun and clean. It made me laugh and fall in love with his innocent message. I highly recommend it and would like to disagree with someone who gave him zero out of ten. The unemployed critic is not unemployed at all. I give it (well I voted ten out of ten) a perfect one.
