This is an exceptional criminal thriller and also with an exceptional cast. The best and most popular actors of Spanish cinema of the last two decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, come together in one of the best Spanish-language thrillers of 2004-5. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the focus on thirty Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and astute thief who learned from his childhood friend Gitano, and more recently from Manco, an old swindler expert . Manco presents Ernesto to Federico (Federico Luppi), a methodical thief who is also elegant but more astute and experienced - the best in his class. <br /> <br /> Federico's only weak point is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former lover and partner. He suddenly appears and proposes a fabulous review scheme for his former lover, a large-scale crime, which will eventually require the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gitano, among others. <br /> <br /> The script is full of twists and surprising inversions, especially towards the end of the film. A criticism of the film I heard a lot is that there are too many twists towards the end, but I disagree. The film fascinates the public so much that all unexpected events are not too much to follow. In reality, these are what make the film exceptional. I highly recommend it.
