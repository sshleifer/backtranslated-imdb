This is a gem. As a production of the film Four, the anticipated quality was actually delivered. Shot with great style that reminded me of some Errol Morris films, well arranged and simply compelling. It's long but horrible to the point that it's heartbreaking. We know that something bad has happened (you can guess from the lack of participation of a person in the interviews) but we are forced to see it, a bit like a car accident in slow motion. The story embraces the most imaginable aspects and, unlike some documentaries, does not try to refrain from showing the darker sides of the stories, like also facing the guilt of the people that Don left behind, wondering why they didn't stop in time. It took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that fascinated me after seeing this very well done documentary.
