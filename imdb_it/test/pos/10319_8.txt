For the record, I'm a fan of Curly for everything. But I have to say that in reality, Shemp was not so bad. Yes, maybe he missed the same kind of joke that Curly had, but in his way it was hilarious. At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> In BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a music professor (Stooge? A professor? Yes right), who recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle and Moe and Larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that evening, or without money. <br /> <br /> This was one of the first Stooges skits with Shemp, before they started recycling their Material. Perhaps it is not surprising that Shemp was part of the Stooges before Curly entered the scene, so it seemed natural to this. The slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone booth. Essential Stooge to tell the truth.
