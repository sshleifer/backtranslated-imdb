Helges best film by far. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel made a film starring Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown, it would be like this. <br /> <br /> Brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other Schneider films, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as 00Schneider's shoulder. (Andreas Kunze, who once again plays his wife in this case, is a bit annoying). And of course Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S: if this movie had a good merchandising I'd really like to buy a replica of that "Holz ist" painting.
