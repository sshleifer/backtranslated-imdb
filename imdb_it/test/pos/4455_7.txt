Set near a poor popular town in the mountains of rural Italy, it is a story of madness. The landscape can be quite picturesque, but here there is madness, hidden behind the mask of a person who looks outwardly normal. This person kills small children. <br /> <br /> In style and tone, this film resembles Dario Argento's famous Italian giallos, those fascinating cinematic horror films, except that the Silver films are much more beautiful. However, Fulci's images of "Do not Torture A Duckling" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lights. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night increase the suspense in a sequence in which one of the "ducklings" is vulnerable only. <br /> <br /> In a sequence the blood is a bit exaggerated. But this is not a film slasher. A legitimate theme contains history. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious disappointments of people practicing voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> A lot of false bows make solving the puzzle difficult if the viewer does not take an agenda from the director. Don't fire someone who may not seem suspicious. The twist near the end provides a good wrong direction. However, in a scene halfway, a line of dialogue may have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. The ending of the film takes place on a beautiful mountain peak with the wind whistling in the background. We see the flashbacks on the clues and we get an idea of ​​the murderer's mentality. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the widescreen projection of the film. But the background music is effective, ranging from a disturbing thrill at the beginning to low-key jazz, up to the indigenous Italian songs. Acting is generally average, although in a couple of cases, it is a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although not as visually bright as the silver yellow, "Do not Torture A Duckling" is still a good film, one that contains a thematic and puzzling enough plot to interest most of the spectators who love yellows and yellows.
