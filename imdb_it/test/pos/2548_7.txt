I cannot say that this was not done well. At a recent film festival the director admitted that some scenes required 30 shots. And there is not the slightest indication that he didn't get exactly what he wanted. But this is a strangely non-Hispanic film in the same way that West Side Story was many years ago. Both protagonists, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The setting, a sort of underground car repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the admission price alone. But there is something unsatisfactory about the key problem of the film, or what the sister feels she has to do to get by. I can understand his brother's reaction, but it seems a little too easy for me. The film seems to suggest that people like these do not need our help, that they will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I would not encourage anyone to believe it. There would be much more resistance to the choices made here than represented. In addition to this, entertainment works well. As an accurate representation of a culture, not so well, I think.
