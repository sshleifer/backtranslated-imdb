I saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 for the first time in the 1990s when I was at art college living and moving between artists and musicians, hoping for future success. So "The Second Home" - of friendships made after leaving the family home, of fighting for professional excellence - was strongly resonating with my living reality. I was fascinated by the characters, the narration, the lyrical camera and above all the music. In it I could share the beginnings of German electronic music, from the 50s Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, Faust from the 70s, the sound experiments of John Cage, Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelia of The White Noise. The composer of the soundtrack Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff of Carmina Burana-fame so I found her contemporary tastes in the world of Electronic Pop / Sound Effects. <br /> <br /> I had not seen Heimat or Heimat 3 so I looked at it as a whole in itself without sooner or later. As someone else has commented, it is both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments include the wonderful voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), the Bach marimba by Daniel Smith (Juan), the piano by Henry Arnold (Hermann) and the cello by Salome Kammer (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more but it has already been said here. Why can't British or American TV PRODUCE THESE MASTERPIECES? The Wire had realism and politics and the epic sweep of a city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter also had imaginative trophies for their serialized TV work, but this is home of art and soap in its most cinematic and narrative sublime. It is never included in the choices of the Best Films critics, but it should be. Still poetic and powerful like when I first saw it more than 17 years ago. I look at the 3 caskets every fall for their 'fruitful sweetness'. Inspired and stimulating.
