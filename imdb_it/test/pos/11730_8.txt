That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which seems to be the best ever. He plays Tom Sharky, a deputy investigator on the trail of an international gangster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man who is financing to become the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the William Diehl novel, the story is more complex because the boy is a presidential candidate. This is a very long film that seems more than three hours instead of two. Filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel create the right atmosphere for the story. Reynolds does not laugh much in this respect to his comedy films. He is very serious here, especially at the beginning of the film, because he is demoted for a drug bust that goes wrong. Sometimes though, the film looks more like a voyeuristic drama than a detective film with Burt trying to get close to the gangster woman. Only towards the end of the film does violence rise and lead to the bang bang climax. Just like the great DIRTY HARRY jazz soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco, Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps manages the score with magic. This film has become one of the best detective films of all time. Check. <br /> <br /> Score, 8 out of 10 stars
