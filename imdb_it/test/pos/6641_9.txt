Apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live on a small farm on a remote island to escape a civil war on the continent. They supply the lingenberry to a couple of customers to collect money and buy some supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty and wants to have a child, but reluctant Jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, doesn't want to have children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and calm lives turn into hell, and find themselves in the midst of accusations by both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) chases Eve, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other turn into hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is an anti-war film by the master Ingmar Bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of artists who are apolitical and don't listen to the news, but when the war arrives in their lands, they have their love, friendship and affection destroyed by senseless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have top notch performances as usual and I don't remember seeing Liv Ullmann's breasts in any other film. The process of brutalization of the peaceful and sensitive Jan Rosenberg by the war is impressive and the bleak conclusion is pessimistic and adequate to the dramatic story. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("Shame")
