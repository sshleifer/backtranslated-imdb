A girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by everything that looks like a spiral. Soon, charm turns into obsession and things get deadly. While I won't say that "Uzumaki" was an excellent film, I will say that it is different from everything I've seen before. During my vision, I felt like I was watching a cartoon. There are fun successes between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later, I discovered that the film is an adaptation of a manga comic, so this makes sense. However, just when you think you are watching something that could be a children's movie, you are bombarded with bad and bloody images! History is often late and the ending is rather abrupt and at the time seemed anti-climatic, but in retrospect I appreciate it more for its originality. My vote: 7/10.
