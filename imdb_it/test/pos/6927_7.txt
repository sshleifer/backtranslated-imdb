A penniless ham actor. Who better than Michael Caine plays a character like that? It's totally and utterly hilarious but, like most Caine interpretations, it really does. The film appears to be a showcase of Dylan Moran and is a splendor in its double act with Caine. This, however, is where the script falters. Moran imitations should have been incorporated in a more organic way. They are too much of an act on their own and make the potential plausibility of the plot fly out the window. It does not matter. Download it if you can find it. There is enough to make it a pleasant journey.
