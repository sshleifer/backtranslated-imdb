This film is the traumatizing and painful horror film I've ever seen in my life. Knowing that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer (Carl Crew) brutally killing his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eyes. I admit it was a low-budget film with the best dialogues, but it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psychotic maniac. Since he was so selfishly selfish / emotional, his emotions and selfishness had gone so deep into his brain that he became a killer. Every person he drew to his apartment was attracted and tried for his feelings, and the reasons he killed them was not just the thrill of killing them, but because he couldn't bear the fact that they left him. In the scene where he killed his first victim by hitting an object behind the boys' head from what I noticed was not because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated by the idea that the boy abandoned him. From that moment on he got used to the murderous behavior and killed his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> The scene when he talked while crying on the phone with his mother and told her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to leave his house showed that he had a love in his heart. A scene that I found rather spooky and strange was when a priest heard Jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy to his apartment and then phoned Jeffrey in a phone booth inside the pub so the boy could lose patience and change your mind at home with Jeffrey. When the boy left the pub, the priest hung up the phone and was laughing at Jeffrey. I also found out that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting role as Jeffrey Dahmer. His bad and cold facial expressions in blood before slaughtering his victims were so real that I was shaking in my place. His facial expressions reminded me of how Vincent D'onofrio (Private Pyle / Leonard) appeared in the movie "Full Metal Jacket" shortly before he shot the General in the toilet barracks. <br /> <br /> If your emotional person would not recommend you to watch this movie but if you don't, go ahead and watch it.
