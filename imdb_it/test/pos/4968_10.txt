The film Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is the film noir magnificence. This is a mostly unknown film that all fans of film noir should see. Jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that period, which made the film surreal quality sometimes. I like movies in black and white and black noir. The color noir film is not good. The cast and script are excellent. The rather creepy music is fun to listen to. Ida Lupino is one of the best and talented actresses of all time. on the screen. I've never seen a production that I didn't like. She was not just an extraordinary beauty, she was a good actress. The first film I remember seeing Ida Lupino was Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde. I never forgot the movie, or her. I saw his latest films like Food Of The Gods and Women In Chains, and although the movies weren't the usual stuff, it was still delicious in them as an actress. Howard Duff is always great to watch. I highly recommend this all masterpiece. I have this movie on VHS tape.
