Peter O'Toole is Arthur Chipping a Latin teacher with strict adherence to detail and accuracy in helping young minds grasp the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is seen as cold and unjust and not in touch with the times. But meeting the theater actress Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark) not only in a late dinner after a London performance is London, but in an amphitheater in Greece her closed-minded world starts to open up. <br /> <br /> Goodbye Mr. Chips is a MGM musical remake of the 1939 film also by MGM. During this time the musicals were out and the Hollywood studio system was in total chaos. When it was presented for the first time in New York, Los Angeles and London, the musical numbers remained intact, but when it arrived in the theaters of the main local streets around the world it was without songs, thus making the film shorter and wide open at most. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA Home Video by Ted Turner in the late 80s, in the early 90s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main home video formats, musical numbers came restored and the gaps closed. Laserdisc was the only format chosen to display Goodbye Mr. Chips in Letterbox Widescreen format. <br /> <br /> For some time the Original Motion Picture soundtrack was only available on original vinyl and cassette tape and can still be found on Ebay today. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the wonderful people of Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was digitally remastered and remixed in a set of 3 CDs with the score completely rebuilt, the original 1969 the overall score of the release album and the narrated sequences are a source of inspiration for music and interviews. You also have 1 unused song that is a real lost gem, "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark that would have been chosen instead of "You and I" first hand. <br /> <br /> This film is both a classic musical and a true tribute to educators around the world. I would certainly buy this film if Warner Bros. MGM and Sony would put their money where their mouths are and they will restore this film from all the master sources and put it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles put back in position with all the extras you find and insert them in a version.
