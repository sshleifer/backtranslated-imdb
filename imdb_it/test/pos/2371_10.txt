If you love the 1993 cyborg movie (erotic, science fiction) "Nemesis", then you'll love this. I loved it when Elvis Pompadoured's hero draws a samurai sword during a shootout. As "Nemesis", it takes place in a post-apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers where the well-armed hero must hire well-armed rebels to resolve a conspiracy by the powers that oppose the unwashed masses. but this is where the similarities end. The ambiguous mayor alive or dead tries to keep the masses sedated by the drugs he sells. The rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to curb his suffocating grip on his subjects. After several failed attempts to stop the rebels, he sends his best policeman to assassinate the rebels. This film follows the trail of most action adventures, but is not afraid to color over the line.
