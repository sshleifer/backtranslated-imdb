A fun first draft of "North By Northwest", "Saboteur" has some wonderful Hitchcockian moments (one of the best occurs at a table, when the hero is asked by a woman who has not yet seen her wearing handcuffs, to give a dish, trying to do it, it also drops a knife on the floor, exposing itself even more!) but suffers from a faintly chosen flick (who is making patriotic speeches, making fun of Priscilla Lane, joking or trying to seem worried, Robert Cummings it's wood), and a lack of really distinct villains (oh, there are bad guys, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough time for the screen).
