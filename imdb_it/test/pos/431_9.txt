I made a promise that if I ever posted a comment that was not complementary, then I felt different, I came back and made my change of heart known. So far, this is the first time this has happened. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to have fun with Hack. Something has clearly changed. The plots seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a bit surreal, but the characters have developed in a much deeper way that a surreal storyline can be forgiven. I attribute this to acting. <br /> <br /> Not all shows can be loaded from the starting gate. Some need time to increase speed. I'm glad I kept watching this program, and I really hope it lasts.
