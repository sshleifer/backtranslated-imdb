Well ..... I wouldn't want to give lessons to anyone, but I feel the urge to say some things that I consider important on this beautiful film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then again the following year. It was like this. The rest was the pink LP of the soundtrack of Elton John that brought music and history deeper into my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a copy of the VHS. (No DVDs yet). Boy .... I was surprised !! Poets have always supported those profound childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty, love, God, idealistic interests, being with you forever. Since they occur mainly at the level of the heart (not yet intellect!), They define the contours of your soul as a sculptor with a stone would do. If at times we do not tend to forget how right they are, perhaps we would do better to understand the meaning of every minute, of every decision, of every turning point in our lives. <br /> <br /> So, I confess to feeling nostalgia. But the fascinating part of this is to watch the film again, and through this journey back in time, enriching that understanding of why we, people of the 60s, grew up like we did. The spirit of those times is all here: a Genesis created far from the official world of consumption and economic success, making love not war, the beautiful pop ballads, the poetry of the lyrics, a totally romantic vision of adolescent rebellion with awakening of sexuality wrapped in a tender and chaste love, these two solitary spirits still full of infantile innocence grow together as they learn about each other's commitment and become "adults". <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of school youths and they abounded with simplistic and cynical comments about it as naive and foolish. Boys, be serious !! Cinema is an art and as an art it reflects not only human emotions but also historical moments. And this is exactly what "Friends" does masterfully. It reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and new beginning that we all dreamed of when we were 15 years old. Now I'm a musician and I feel that some of us, artists of the rest, still dream of it !! How else could we live? This is "Friends", ie "Brother Sun Sister Moon", meaning "Hair". Those were the times, still alien to AIDS, foreign to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs without melody, to pornography presented as "sexuality", to this new barbaric "world order" that grew after September 11th. <br /> <br /> What an experience of warming the heart to see Paul and Michelle again, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a journey to the heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at its best, to that urban setting surrounded by 2 Citroën CVs and VW Beetles. What fresh air from the quiet Camargue cottage, surrounded by fish ponds and wild horses. They made us what we are, as well as Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the first Bee Gees, the Spirituals of Belafonte, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis. <br /> <br /> People still hope: get this photo. Start with innocence and grow from there. You will find out what it is. And from there you will have a solid and more truthful basis; some ideals to look for in life, a way to manage personal and global affairs. We need it so much today! Give yourself the chance and maybe one day the cynics time will end. (I have an extra VHS copy) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogotá, Colombia.
