One of my favorite westerns and one of the best of John Ford in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in almost everything that appears, and here he gets a rare advantage as a title character. The pairing with him is Ward Bond as the cruel Mormon elder who leads his people to the west. The escort of John Ford's character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provides ample support, as does mysteriously silent James Arness, a member of the Clegg clan who joins the train wagons. The Mormon Trail in Utah was one of the most arduous and demanding undertakings ever undertaken. We cannot really have the perception, but we see ordeals that must be overcome by the pioneers on the west path; river crossings, long stretches of dry and waterless desert, encounters with Indians and the like, all handed down in a glorious song of the Pioneer Children. Mormons have actually excavated sections of the path with picks and shovels, as shown in the film. My main regret is that it was not done in color, but I think there is a colored version. By the way, those steep rocks in various scenes are called Fisher Towers, located near Moab. Highly recommended vision.
