I have to make up for all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the film and the soundtrack. I watch it every time I need a retreat. Sure, it's not like the sound of music, but it's just as fun if choosing movies isn't your thing. I loved the late (and big) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta always has and always will be a favorite. I saw it when it first came out in theaters. I'm a big music fan and this is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It is a modern musical and should not be judged by everything that has happened before. It's only the best for dreamers like me, who want to be able to find this place: no sickness, no war, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is nothing but a good movie. This is what all films should be concerned with. The title song Shaun Phillips is superb and explains the whole feeling of the film. If acting is not the greatest, who cares. I love the idea of ​​the film. Peter Finch, a very stiff actor, Liv Ullmann, magnificent as always, Sally Kellerman, a surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, stupendous, convinced me they were a normal run of the mill people. None of them acted like an actor in a movie. They acted like real people, just as I would have done if I found this place. Torn between going home and staying there, amazed at everything. Yes, there are flaws in this film, but going beyond them is not Citizen Kane, it's a good musical!
