Hoppity is a fascinating animation film, even if slightly fatiguing, which, considering that it was made in 1941, has overcome the test of time incredibly well. Now I have to admit that I have a weakness for "HoppityGoes To Town" (as it is called in the UK) after seeing a VHS version recorded by TV from our parents many times with my brothers. Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning right in time to see it on Channel Four (at 0615 never less!) The film was just as delicious as I remembered with the animation standing up to the test of time and a nice moral story that should interest parents and children alike. Maybe one day I will have to share this forgotten classic with my children. With a nice running time for children (88 Min's) and a simple but engaging storyline, there is really something for everyone in this story of the little one that is behaving well. I could really see this being successfully redone in CGI. Take note of Pixar.
