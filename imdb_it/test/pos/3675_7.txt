This is one of the strangest films I've seen in a long time. Usually, if they are so strange, I go out early and rarely regret it. Fortunately, I resisted this. Although I can't say this is a great movie (it isn't), I can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip - only a few really terrible moments and the rest full of "did I really see that?" wonder. Lots of laughs at noisy moments. A great cast of characters with Meredith Eaton as exceptional as the dwarf daughter-in-law with an attitude. Keep an open mind.
