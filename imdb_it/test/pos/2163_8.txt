I've just seen this movie and it's not bad; there are some moments of tension and not a lot of long strings of dialogue. It comes out as pretty smart; FastPaced almost like 'documentary style'. This film will evoke a bit of nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars, street scenes and life in the 1950s. The acting is quite solid and, at 85 minutes of execution, it goes on at a good pace. A fan of the film of the atomic age should not miss this.
