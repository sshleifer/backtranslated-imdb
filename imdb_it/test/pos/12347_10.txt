Meg Tilly, well-mannered and well-mannered, must spend the night in a creepy mausoleum as an initiation in a high school club. The problem is a powerful psychic named Raymar who was just buried there that day, but he's not entirely dead and needs the life force of humans for his powers. <br /> <br /> The dark horror movie offers a lot of chills and shivers, an attractive and nice cast, and far superior special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is voted for violence and for adults.
