I was about 13 years old, in fact, near the McCloud river, near Shasta, when this film was shot. My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed Vincent floating along the river. A little curiosity ... the scene where they pulled it off was actually where it started to float down the river. And if the stuntman missed the net, there was a 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile away. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... I looked at it at that moment, and I didn't understand it. It wasn't until years later when I saw the film and I understood its meaning. It's a pretty powerful film and certainly a good job for Jan at such a young age. His film career never took off as expected, but obviously he later found success on TV. I would like this film to be available, because I would like to see it again.
