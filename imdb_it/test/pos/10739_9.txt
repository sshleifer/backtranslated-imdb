Kramer vs. Kramer is a film to watch and not forget. It is not one of the most popular films ever made and it is certainly one of the weakest picture films, but it does not mean that it is still not important. I thought the film was well done and made you want to see more and more of it. The shows were the best positives for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles I've ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son while his wife separates from him. Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played another great performance with Meryl Streep, playing Billy's depressed mother. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but he manages to make the film worthy of being seen and worthy of attention. Certainly, one of the best Hoffman films I've ever made. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedeen Outlook: 9/10 *** + A-
