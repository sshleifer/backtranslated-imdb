Another popular projection for a British image at Coalville's Century Theater. A solid and well-built drama with an evolving storyline and ongoing "twists in the game" ... like the accumulated lies! An acting masterclass of an impeccable cast, well orchestrated by debut director Julian Fellowes. An exceptional show, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson, but the good turns of all the interested parties, including the supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience has been absorbed by this film, which includes a couple of shock episodes that really make you "jump". A good production limited to around 80 minutes, probably produced with a very limited budget, but a success, which should see Fellowes direct for the big screen again. Some commercials for the film seemed to suggest that it was set in the 1950s (as in Nigel Balchin's novel) but obviously this is not the case. Recommended view
