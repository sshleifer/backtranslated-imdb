This film was certainly written specifically for FF VII fans. I'm a person who never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a fan of the series. From a visual and technical point of view, this film is as good as "The Spirits Within", if not better, but from the point of view of history, I was rather lost. One of the main weaknesses of the plot that struck me was the scene in which "all" the children who die of geostigma were taken to the "meeting" of healing by the three Jenovites. All in all there were about 15 children in all ... Hmmmm ... I thought this Geostigma was a disease of pandemic proportions ... I understand why they did it that way (time, budget, CPU), but it seemed right after all the explanations about how the bad guys had to collect all those who had Jenova cells so that Jenova could be reincarnated. The version of the subtitles we had (some internet subtitle fans) was a rather straightforward translation and therefore probably added to my confusion. <br /> <br /> It stung my interest in FF VII, however, and I spent a few hours on the FF VII wiki reading the main characters and the plot. Once you read the Advent Children wiki, things make a lot more sense. If you are a fan of video games or science fiction, this film is a very good film, but as a previous reviewer said it was a 90 minute fight scene. You never really met any of the characters, and the story seems to jump from one scene to another without much explanation, although some explanation may be needed. Thank God for Wikpedia.
