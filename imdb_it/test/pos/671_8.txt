Attention, My Lovely appeared on TV on BBC2 recently during the first few hours, so I set the video to record it and I was glad I did. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman so he escapes, so don't take the blame for his murder and get a job as a handyman in a widow's house, but she doesn't know what he's taking here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and a possible murderer. He begins to torment her and closes her in the cellar. Then cut the phone line so that it cannot receive outside help. A kid who regularly buys something for her notes is not good when it comes to shopping. In the end, the man leaves, behaving as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I can understand why Attention, My Lovely received an X certificate when it came out in theaters. Some scenes are rather unpleasant this time. I also thought the man would do something to the boy too. <br /> <br /> The cast presents an excellent performance by Robert Ryan as the psychopath, Ida Lupino as the widow and are joined by Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as the boy. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the most chilling performance of Robert Ryan I've seen. A must see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
