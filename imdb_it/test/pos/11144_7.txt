A particularly pleasant film for those of us who have seen it as a young man because, after all, it was meant for young people to watch - when you look at them again as adults it is better that pink glasses can give football. It was the first of the 16 films by Jungle Jim and then the big chitky TV series Johnny Weismuller continued to do for Columbia (in the last 3 films he had to use his name even if they had lost the rights) after getting the bag from the role of Tarzan for Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also gave up playing Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films. <br /> <br /> Jim and the group go on a dangerous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of Zimbalu, run by a dark tribe of medical devils that seem to have the secret of a poison that could also be a cure for polio. Probably Edgar Rice Burroughs has been approved. After 16 years speaking monosyllabically, Weismuller seemed to be embarrassing sentences together, not important. In the fast march we meet many of the interesting but generally playful inhabitants of the jungle, except for the sinister crocodile that goes to eat the protagonist with her leg under a twig and the surreal escape of elephants (archival material crushed in a corner of the frame). Skipper the dog and Caw-Caw the crow has had many adventures, none of which proved essential to the plot in case you were concentrating! The biggest problem with the film is the farcical culmination, which can be exciting but unfortunately it also reminds us of the end of a serial part ?? and the excellent original serial was created 12 years earlier. Even if personally I wouldn't have worried that this would last another couple of hours! <br /> <br /> The only heavy thing about this was Weismuller; in many ways a fun children's movie from the old days - not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
