"Everything is Illuminated" is like seeing a beautiful piece of museum quality artwork. Absolutely absorbs emotions through a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played with candor by Elijah Wood. He is looking for his paternal legacy in Ukraine. His travels brought him into contact with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most exciting bond with this film and is interpreted appropriately by Boris Leskin. If you find little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then just turn to Mikke, a real dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. by Alex and his grandfather. They also call it "eye bitch that sees". Cinematography is spectacular. Colors are a very important part of the film's patchwork. It is a film that is worth the time and emotional investment.
