Once a wise Indian man once said: "First they laugh at us, then they will hate us and then they will fear us". Know that yes, the budget of this film was a bit poor, but even so, with its history, it still takes away our interest many years later, regardless of how it may seem. But know soon, in due course "Masten Thrust" will rise once again on the big screen. Then he and the new redesigned T-Rex will amaze you more. It will scare many in the centuries to come !! This film is in the pre-production stage and will not look like anything you've ever seen before! <br /> <br /> This will be beyond the THX format ..... directly in the 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Be afraid, be VERY scared!"
