It is the best film released in Bollywood to date. The best comedy, the best acting and the best direction so far! Rajkumar Santoshi's writing and direction have shown that he is one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was absolutely incredible, Salman Khan looked good in the way he played. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep acted as usual! This comedy is still copied by people and no other writer and director has been able to do this again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi was unable to make this cult classic again! This film was a flop when it came out, but it has been a cult classic since its release and loved by all types of people. <br /> <br /> STAR. <br /> <br /> ACTING 10/10. <br /> DIALOGUES 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY 10/10. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LYRICS 9/10. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is strongly recommended. If you haven't looked at it so far, you've missed something big! It's a riot of laughter and the best comedy I've ever seen so far! Classic films like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro aren't half the fun either. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE, HATS OFF !!!!
