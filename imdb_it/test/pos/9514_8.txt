Actually, I got a commercial for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year, and I wondered what the hell it was until I saw the movie trailer. It was then that I remembered seeing the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu's novel a few years earlier. I understood it, and it was pretty good, as well as incredibly realistic. It is enough to make the reader fear of having news about earthquakes in Japan. <br /> <br /> Now I read the book and saw this version of the 2006 film (the first film was released in 1973). And you know what? I thought the film was pretty good, even though there are great changes from novel to film (but it's understandable). The plot is simple: an important tectonic shift will plunge Japan within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are driving the country crazy while frantic efforts are being made to evacuate as many people as possible. Does a scientist have a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what remains of the land mass, but can be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon 2007, and although there were a couple of problems I had to deal with - it's a little too long, and a couple of moments of the character were a bit too corny - I stayed anyway without words. The pure concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made terrifying, and the effects were among the best I'd ever seen, rivaling anything that Hollywood had done. The film does not even play in the main characters, with some not reaching the credits. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film. Difference of opinions, I imagine. Personally, I liked it. And I read the original book.
