The film is really well done, which is fantastic, fascinating and direct. You can say that every shot is designed and executed to perfection. For movie lovers this is above all a great watch and above all they should be able to appreciate the beauty and passion for cinema that is inserted. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to place this film under a label. It's not really a drama, it's not a thriller and it's not really a comedy. Instead it is more a film with its style, which does things its own way. It does not necessarily follow the rules of cinema and presents many different elements of different genres combined. <br /> <br /> But just like the movie, its main character, the film becomes a bit slow and boring in some parts. The artistic style of the director tries to hide the fact that the story is actually quite simple and it is more as if the film was based exclusively on his style and the general atmosphere created by the film. It doesn't make the movie horrible or anything, but it simply prevents it from being a real absolute to see. In some parts of the film it also seems that he is trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for himself. It seems a bit exaggerated in some parts, although for most of the film it still works beautifully. <br /> <br /> It has an excellent photographic work and a unique storytelling, which makes this original as well as a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
