The film is about a girl who isn't going to a bonfire just because she's babysitting that night. Nothing strange, right? Until ... The phone rings. Until ... The phone rings again. And yet ... And yet. Those are not stupid talk. This is real. If you want to see how the girl reacts, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere full of scary sounds. Very well executed by the young Camilla Belle who got the main role. I see in her a great potential to become a good actress. This is more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it is so undervalued. However, in my opinion this film deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of all voters voted the film with 1. Be serious, people. You couldn't get a better thriller for a title like this.
