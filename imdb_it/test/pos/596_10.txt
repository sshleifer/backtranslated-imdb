I haven't seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the street muppets of Sesame and later I realized how much effort and time were needed to give life to these characters. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I saw this movie the other day I wanted to go back in time when I was younger and things seemed much simpler. For this time travel I consider this film a 10. <br /> <br /> The plot explains how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. Laughter and gags are classic muppetism. I'm glad these films are still around for the next generation. I hope I can never grow the magic of the muppets.
