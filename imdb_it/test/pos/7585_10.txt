Horses on Mars is a wonderful journey undertaken by very small creatures. He doesn't have to work hard to get your attention and the characters are truly memorable. Most of the credit goes to Eric Anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story, but Anuj Majumdar also deserves credit for the narrative and the wonderful soundtrack. These choices were obviously not an accident. If possible, see it in the 35mm range for maximum impact. It's a pretty good movie!
