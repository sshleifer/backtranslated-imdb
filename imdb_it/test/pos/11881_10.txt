Critters 4: This film was continued after the films of 3 critters. This was released in the same years that Critters 3 was released in 1991. Critters 4 takes you into space as they search for humans in a spaceship. I doubt that there will be a Critters 5, because the final for the 4th was a nice ending, which eventually brought the critters because there was nothing left. I give this film 10 out of 10.
