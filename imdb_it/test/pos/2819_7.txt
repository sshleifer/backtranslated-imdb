------ Spoilers ----- Spoiler ----- Spoiler -------- only some small <br /> <br /> Seen this on the Satilite channel, lost the first 30 Min of the film, will keep this brief and informative comment. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about 5 characters, The acting is bad for some characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl abducts 3 different people but turns against and 3 abducts 2. This is one of those types of films in which writers try to be stimulating or philosophical, mysterious and ... gets point; but to them, personal, he fails to think that they fall terribly short. As one of the prisoners that should be a kind of psychological nerd - it seems the part but his language can't talk about it. Writers think that if the nerd uses many 8-letter words in an amateur way - unknowingly, I believe - that viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I wish I could give an example, but I can't remember any - exactly as was said. The finish was bad too. But the only female prisoner played the role of an elderly and relatively wise lady, although she, like the others, had many clich√©s. <br /> <br /> So why should I give this film a 7-star rating? if I thought all of the above? Simple, I give LISA KELLER the seven whole stars: a sexy one at $$ momma. SHE is FINE lol. I'm a fan of beauty, and that's exactly how it is. But don't get me confused because I'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porn in any way. their is something about her that I can't explain, but I like it. I remember the scene in which a prisoner freed himself and, while looking for a way out, he met Keller. Try to make your way but have no chance. He kicks her down, kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down, without panties;). Now, although I have an INCREDIBLE ass - and this shot leaves little to the imagination for a good 30 seconds I think - it was his facial expression that convinced me. she wanted it, and that look made me think I was behind it. I would have torn that booty! After that expression, I could no longer look at it objectively, I AM LOVED. lol. I'm glad I saw this movie but if Lisa Keller didn't play the lead role, I would have changed the channel ... well ... after seeing the scene I mentioned above. I'm a fan of LISA KELLER, but it doesn't seem to be a consistent actor, seeing this 2003 movie is her last. But I look forward to another movie with her.
