This film is one of the classics of film history. It was not done to please the modern public, so some people today may think it is creaky or pungent. I found it absorbing everywhere. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play Alexander Nevskyi, just as he did when Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the Terrible) played several years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was the poor soundtrack which was quite confusing. Even if I only know a little Russian, it would have been nice to be able to choose more words rather than having to use almost 100% of subtitles. I was looking at this on an old videotape from the library, though. Perhaps there is now a DVD version on which the sound has been improved. I would like to know if the actors used the Russian archaic or even the ancient ecclesiastical Slavic when they were talking. The subtitles were strangely formulated, and it is difficult for me to say if this should reflect an older way of talking, or if the subtitles were just a little badly done.
