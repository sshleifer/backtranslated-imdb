Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta is what Burt called this fantastic first-class crime thriller that borrows part of the plot from the venerable Dana Andrews movie "Laura". Burt Reynolds is not the only protagonist of this superb saga, but he is also the one to steer him and does not make a single mistake nor staging the action nor with his cast of characters. It's not a bad performance in the film and Reynolds does an exceptional job of directing the film. Henry Silva is really cold as a hit man. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is in a narcotics case in the Atlanta subway when everything goes wrong. One ends up chasing a suspect and shooting with the gunman on a bus. An innocent spectator dies during the melee. "The Killer" by John Woo replicates this scene. However, the Atlanta Police Department leads Burt to Vice and takes orders from a new boss, Frisco (Charles Durning of "Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?") In the basement. Sharky ends up in a real cesspit of crime. Sharky and his fellow investigators Arch (Bernie Casey) and Pope (Brian Keith) set up surveillance on a girl named Dominoe (Rachel Ward of "After Dark, My Sweet") who has a luxury apartment she shares with another girl . <br /> <br /> Dominoe is seeing a local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman of "Police Woman") on the side that is conducting a campaign for governor but the evil leader, Victor (Vittorio Gassman of "The Dirty Game") wants he to end the relationship. Hotchkins is reluctant to accept Victor, so Victor sniffed the cocaine Billy Score (Henry Silva from "Wipeout") and ends Dominoe. Billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve-inch pizza in the door of Dominoe's apartment and kills her. <br /> <br /> Sharky did the unthinkable. During surveillance, he became fond of Dominoe to the point that he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her. Sharky's mission in life now is to destroy Victor, but he learns that Victor has an informant inside the Atlanta Police Department. The plot really warms up when Sharky later finds out that Billy shot the wrong girl and that Dominoe is still alive! Sharky takes her into protective custody and things get even more complicated. He assembles his "Machine" of the title to take care of Victor and his hoods. <br /> <br /> The goal of William Fraker's action is immaculate. Unfortunately, this very underrated classic is only available as a full-frame movie. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the image, especially during the scene of the mutilation on the boat when the wicked man has cut one of Sharky's fingers. This is a rather gruesome scene. <br /> <br /> Burt has never made a film that has surpassed "Sharky's Machine".
