I have often heard people express the disappointment that Mazursky's "Tempest" has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion, it is true and false, but above all it is a bad starting point to offer criticism. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is not, but for what it is. The film "Tempest" does not resemble a faithful representation of the drama, but in my opinion it is faithful to Shakespeare's work in spirit. That "Tempest" is, therefore, perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimental as in the hand-held video camera and mumbling dialogues, but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without excessive regard for the box office earnings. Mazursky's Tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyful, full of life, but above all it's imaginative. Philip / Prospero's portrait of Cassandra in itself deserves a 10/10 rating, and when you add Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a wonderfully deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, exquisitely suggestive dialogues, music and tableaux scattered around image ... I have nothing to add. One of the best films of the 80s. Not to be missed.
