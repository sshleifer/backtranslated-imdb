Without a doubt, this is the great mother of all music videos !!! Unlike most music videos that are poorly planed and / or badly broken music videos, they have been done well. Jackson was a co-author and with evidence of VH1 he heavily choreographed and directed this masterpiece. Actually it could be said that Thriller is scarier than most horror films with that last second sparkling wine. For me this music video is what you judge all other music videos. You can easily see the threatening influence that M.J. had during the first break dance with the zombie march number. Because of the dance, the comedy, the plot, and yes of horror. I give him a 5 out of 5.
