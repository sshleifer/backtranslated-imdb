... the world may never know. (The film that won the "best animated short film" of that year, "Anna and Bella", is very good, but it is not "Big Snit". Both are available in the "Animation largest in the world" compilation Expanded Entertainment, in case you 'I would like to compare.) <br /> <br /> "Snit" and its director, Richard Condie, have attracted so much attention that there is little to add for me. I'd like to note, however, that the film contains one of my favorite single "shots" in an animated short, one in which the man opens the door to let the cat out. I don't want to give away the real events represented here, but the first time I saw the shot I was moved from one mood to another, then a few seconds later I did another one. That blow has never failed to influence me that way since then. For this shot, and for the way Condie builds that set of moments, "The Big Snit" deserves the "masterpiece" label.
