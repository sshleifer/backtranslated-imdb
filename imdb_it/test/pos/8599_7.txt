Nothing is worse than the genocides in the history of our world. This film attempts to describe the horror of a particular family - a common narrative device - in the world of Hiroshima atom bombs. The most memorable parts are the graphic and sad images that the people of Hiroshima face after the war. The story, however, becomes more concerned about the effect on a specific group of people and how they deal with their lives; in other words, if you don't really care about them, the film becomes boring. It is difficult not to worry, however, when the home of a family is wrecked. I am not sure to recommend this film, because it says little politically and, frankly, it has not kept my interest in family problems.
