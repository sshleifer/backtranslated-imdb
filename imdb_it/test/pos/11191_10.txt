The first time I saw this was in a friend's house. He ended up in the hands of his parents by a stroke of luck; some videostore / bicycle repair shop !! went bankrupt and treats like he's up for grabs. We saw it twice in a row and almost as wet are the pants as we laughed. <br /> <br /> I have seen historical documents such as Ninja Mission and Plan 9 of Outer Space, and still remain good runners-up compared to this. <br /> <br /> Nearly 15 years after the first contact, it is now considered the best cult film of all time (in my circles); I showed it to all my friends ... Now we have a tradition of searching for films in the same category: the one that cannot be evaluated. <br /> <br /> It cannot be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene, every take, every move, contains at least one error concerning editing, dialouge, directing etc. <br /> <br /> For every fan of cult movies this is the ultimate prize, the gem of all gems. <br /> <br /> Raiting: As for crafts, it cannot be evaluated, because it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> For fun, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen; more fun than any comedy ever made in the past or present. Anything less than 10/10 should be considered an insult to the common sense of the murmur.
