Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon to present Mickey Mouse. The first film in which the American friend took part was "Plane Crazy". "Plane Crazy" was released May 15, 1928 in Hollywood, California, in the silent film format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a SOUND film (it was also published July 29, 1928 as a silent film). Doing so "Steamboat .." is Mickey's first SOUND movie but NOT the first movie for the little American Mouse. While many games used the question: "What was Mickey Mouse's first appearance?" The real answer is "Plane Crazy", not "Steamboat Willy". These dates can be checked on IMDb under "release dates".
