I saw the film in the cinema at its release, then I saw the VHS tape over the years, and while walking through Target I saw this DVD bundled with "Pushing Tin" for the exorbitant sum of $ 5.50. <br /> <br /> There is something about this comedy that really struck me - like Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his things", he is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel submarine and a ball crew of lives and misfits. He fights against the best of the Navy - a Los Angeles nuclear class submarine - and his old captain (Wm Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern plays the villain, Rip Torn the admiral who performs the exercise - If you don't laugh hysterically during the "run silent" segment with the cook, well, you have a different kind of humor from my part. <br /> <br /> Towards the end the engineer says "DBF" without any explanation - it is apparently an internal knowledge obtained from an old submariner consultant - thanks to Google I learned that with the advent of nuclear submarines the old salts they would wear "DBF" pins - Diesel Boats Forever. <br /> <br /> A friend of the Navy said that many of the technical aspects are not correct, but who cares: it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I don't think he wants a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise!
