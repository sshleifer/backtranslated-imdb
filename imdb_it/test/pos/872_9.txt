(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> People who post Lonely Heart ads in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put in a nutshell everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope ... Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is thus influenced by the letters of Julie Roussell who proposes them. But not the beautiful brunette expected comes from the "Mississippi" council, but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the beginning that you are a wedding imposter and that a crime took place. He shows no interest in "Julie's" wardrobe (he doesn't even have his trunk open) and neglects his canary until he dies. But the basic tricks of seduction (an open hinge) are enough to transform Louis into a flexible little dog. First: a joint bank account. And then, when Julie's sister draws attention to herself, the flight. With 27,850 million Louis '28 million - he would have needed his signature for the full sum. <br /> <br /> Louis's sister and Julie hires a private investigator (Michel Bouquet). Louis tries to trace Marion (Deneuve's real name) to Antibes, where he works as a taxi girl - his gangster lover left her penniless, or rather without a penny. Louis finds himself unable to kill her. She tells her story: Orphan. Early. Lesbian experiences Many sugardaddies. Prison - and soon she brings him back to the nose. The detective turns out to be clever like a fox and tenacious like a blood hound; Louis and Marion bury his body in the cellar. They flee to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has an expensive taste. She loves money as a god. He sells his company at a fraction of its value. But when the detective's body is discovered (a flood) they have to flee again, without the money. Life in a mountain shelter, along with a losing yelp - Marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendix ... <br /> <br /> A highlight in the careers of all the people involved. Belmondo's self-deception makes it almost appealing. Deneuve is beautiful in her wardrobe of Yves St. Laurent, and her performance is delightful: at first she pretends to be fragile, too shy to ask for money from her husband, which is why the common bank account is needed, but after having been exposed, it sounds like Katharine Hepburn in the prison scene of BRINGING THE CHILD. The scenery is spectacular: the tropics, the riviera, Paris. Truffaut directs himself with ease: the sixties were the only decade in which European films were far superior to American productions. After this film Truffaut was able to face his idol, Alfred Hichcock.
