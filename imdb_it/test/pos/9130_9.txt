Commissioner Mattei (André Bourvil) is a single with a small gun that loves cats and his boss at the Paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police become guilty sooner or later. This is what the film is about. And a robbery of jewels in the Vendome place. <br /> <br /> Corey (Delon) brings the piano from prison, Vogel (Volonté) joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who chase him, because he took the mafia Ricos (Andre Eycan) money, while Rico has already taken Coreys' girlfriend and left him very alone for five years in prison. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting hand-made ammunition into a hole. A perfect plan and collaboration, but they must sell the loot and there's Mattei in the role of a disguised buyer. The circle closes. Running to help each other they are killed by the cat that loves Mattei and his little gun. <br /> <br /> Melville took 20 years to make a robbery film after he failed to get a RIFFIFI contract. Melville wrote the screenplay and shot it in the south of France and in Paris in the past. The great Henri Decae is the lighting cameraman as usual. It is the last image of Melvilles that died after another film with Delon in 1972. <br /> <br /> Melville really wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he didn't like that Italian at all, but Volonté-Vogel is a excellent fugitive and gives Bourvil the most convincing performance. But beware: Melville notes that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tired and absolutely impossible on a French set. He didn't like Melville at all and didn't want to work with him anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Volonté gives the most lively character in the nothingness of not many interesting characters. You can see what he feels being pursued by Mattei and his small dangerous pistol and by all the dogs of France in winter 70. A savage actor. <br /> <br /> Also André Bourvil, who died near the time of shooting. He wasn't the first choice either, but certainly a great replacement. He carries the instinct of a solitary hunter throughout the film and finally gets his chance to become guilty. <br /> <br /> Jansen entered the jewelry shop at night with a rifle and a tripod, but eventually he risks a successful shot freehand. When he meets Delon the first time we already know that the elegant Jansen has a serious alcohol problem. After the robbery, Montand renounces to take his share of the loot and mentions to Delon, who looks at him, who has entered the red circle, because he wanted revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon doesn't understand what he means. The public remembers seeing Montand in a big scene in his haunted house, fighting defenseless nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him. At that time a very rare scene, we remember a long time later. I bet it was always so difficult to organize and direct that stuff in a moment that no one imagined in the coming days of making a digital movie. Great works of art when art was made by hand. <br /> <br /> We will surely remember a troupe like the actors, however it seems that even after 33 years this is the least popular among Melville's six thrillers. What's wrong? I am afraid there is little interest in those three actors (who show three criminals) and their police hunter. We learn too little about Corey and his fatal 5 years after his beautiful girlfriend (Anna Douking). Montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinker with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon acts as if he were in a previous adventure with the samourai, Volonté is the man in the trunk of Delons' American car and superbly moving and Mattei turns to look, a great actor on the edge of his life. But how could anyone ever doubt that everyone is guilty? <br /> <br /> In an interview Melville states that there is no woman in the film. Not in the very red circle, but I remember well that the beautiful woman Anna Douking (with no future career). We are in the 70s. In fact, a woman gets up from the bed of an old mafioso without anything and walks slowly towards the door to listen to the voice of her old lover Delon. Bardot did something like this 10 years ago. This time Melville was heading. Well done. <br /> <br /> The CERCELLO ROSSO has certainly added some but not many sparkling gems to the history of cinema. The robbery at Place Vendome and Montands miraculously projected the inhabitants of the wardrobe and Volonté fleeing from Bouvil in white underwear and carefully taking his trousers along a stream. This is too little for a big gangster and robbery movie. But the 110 minutes never bore you and it's a high level game. And there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the movie over and over again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and even the late Francois Perier is present. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
