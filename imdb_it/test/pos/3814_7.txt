I saw this before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantasy film festival in Montreal. all that concerns is the possibility of toppling the hat (or tearing it completely) to Tim Burton. I liked it anyway, even though it is extremely derivative. what struck me most was the quality of the images given the obvious budget expectations. the set and props were original and original, even if the script was not.
