This is another one of my favorite Columbos. He has a first-rate cast, including John Cassavetes, who has never been prettier or sexier, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now there's something I've always wondered: Was Gwenyth Paltrow born when this episode was shot, or was she pregnant with Danner at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer: she was five months pregnant. Now I can really feel old. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes has a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner should have used his mother's social connections (Loy). He has a lover on the side, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but announces that she wants more. She's tired of going back to the street. The night of their concert, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. Columbo immediately collects some problems. One thing he notes: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body and a career." Where is the man? "It's wonderful to see Falk and good friend Cassavetes together. There is a very funny episode with the vet with Columbo's Bassett. Everyone in the cast is fantastic. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes that made Columbo the series classic that has become.
