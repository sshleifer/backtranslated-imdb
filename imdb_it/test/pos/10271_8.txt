A lucid production that reserves the interest from the first scene in which Max chooses a ring in a jewelry store. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "midsummer night's dream" in which Demetrio and Lisandro fall in love with each other's friends. Here Max and Lucien, both prone to love at first sight, mix with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. In addition to cheerfulness, Max is inclined to get involved in accidents that bring back memories of two years ago. And since Max has many of these dream episodes, we are subjected to one flashback after another, too many in my opinion because at the first viewing of the film, I wasn't sure enough to be in the present or in the past. much running around corridors, stairs, doors, elevators, etc. I accept this in a fast-paced film, but do we have so many people clashing? After four fights it ceases to have an impact, if you want to excuse the pun. Maximum rating for artistic design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but I wonder how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Saving a person who wants to commit suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and is also in this movie when Max leaves almost at the same time. However a kiss or two make him feel better. If you can find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister gives him a very affectionate kiss. It can be said that it is she who resolves the complications of love, like Puck in a "midsummer night's dream".
