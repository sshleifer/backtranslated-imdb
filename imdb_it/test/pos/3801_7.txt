(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits here poorly. To quote the Encyclopaedia Britannica, surreal means: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or incongruous images": there is no need to explain to the less imaginative how many ways an unfortunate ten-year-old boy in general and in search of fortune in the driving seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious could read James Kincaid; but if I asked a boy how inconsistent he was at the wheel of a sports car, he would certainly protest: "NO way!" What fantasies and incongruities offered by the film appear mostly within the first fifteen minutes. Subsequently we get more iterations of the same, in an increasingly raw and bleak progression that, far from the incongruity, soon proves to be predictable. Not that it was, on the other hand, literally credible - but it was unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this defect, any plausible suspension of disbelief that had fallen precipitously on the scale of values ​​typical of the filmmaker and viewer since then "Raiders" of the Lost Ark "has become a blockbuster. <br /> <br />" Hallucinatory ": how do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? Anyway, some people they know that they have fun with "hallucinogenic drugs" - but if Motorama means the result of doing it, then I don't know why someone would take them more than once. There is, of course, the occasional bad journey. The film must be one of those , the pun and everything else. <br /> <br /> "Juxtaposition of surprising words": how many times a ten-year-old kid scares you by saying "Oh, my God!" when he likes something, or "Damn!" When he doesn't? two interjections are on par for the course with this script. Sadly, any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal, in direct proportion, the naivety towards the linguistic patterns of the nascent American generation. <br /> <br /> "A world completely defined and meticulously painted but which makes no rational sense:" The world of Motorama does not actually make sense, but is completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper. The numerous guest stars of the cast have even less intelligent cameos than our little hero who exclaims "Damn!" in the blink of an eye, but it takes several seconds to invent the smallest lie. And even his * character, despite being present in almost all the scenes, has no significant developments. Here is little reward for every spectator who sympathizes, as I should, enough to want to know him better and understand "where he comes from". There is a vaguely perceived story and a much better protagonist struggling to get out. <br /> <br /> "The fully recognizable and realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and recomposed into an ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking picture." No, we see a succession of stereotyped and increasingly dilapidated billboards, gas stations, restaurants with a tablespoon of fat, cheap hotels and their skilled low-street goers, exactly where they belong to stereotypes. <br /> <br /> "Mostly responsible for perpetuating ... the traditional emphasis on content." There is little content, moment by moment, in Motorama. <br /> <br /> To summarize: Imagine British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the road to an elegant costume party, sitting serene and silent as cautious drivers of their Rolls-Royce as fragile boats in a rough sea of ​​desperate humanity , the Chinese who implore them through the windows and dirty the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines similar to the ones above rusty and white pianos tinkling with ghosts. In this detritus an exhausted boy and a sick woman roam about, to which he clings like a mother figure who becomes a friend, who falls asleep side by side. It is awakened - on the Feast of the Transfiguration, "white and glacial" day 1945 - from a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. Discovering that his consort has become a corpse, he first believes that he has witnessed his soul rise to the sky. Later he explains just a little less innocently: "Today I learned a new word: atomic bomb. It's like taking a picture of God." Now, * there * are just two examples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose ironies are propagated far enough to invade the very title of the film: Empire of the Sun. If you look surreal, * please * don't miss it. Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tries to accelerate his car through the desert, no scene so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle or splendid awaits poor little Gus of Motorama in his quest. <br /> <br /> None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs down on this film. Although a little disappointed, I cannot reject it, given the respectability of another genre that exemplifies - one influenced, surely, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, by Franz Kafka's existentialism and pessimism amid power structures almighty. Let's try by size: Theater of the Absurd. <br /> <br /> As for the EB article on this style, I am amazed at how, in so far as Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style, the objections over Motorama vanish like a cloud of smoke . I am tempted to cite the entire text as an aid to identification. <br /> <br /> Theater of the Absurd attempts to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, meaningless ... humanity is left without hope, bewildered and anxious". Having instantly reached his goal of moving away from a depressing domestic life among quarrelsome parents, Gus finds himself aimless until he passes a glittering billboard that reads "Motorama" and decides to win the lottery he promises. As others have already revealed, this ambition is illusory: although the game "never expires", the sponsoring company has no intention that anyone should ever win, and has ways to deceive, confuse and ridicule any reward aspirant. He, like the others, is finally disappointed by his dream. <br /> <br /> "The absurd playwrights, therefore, have eliminated most of the logical structure of traditional theater: there is little dramatic action as conventionally understood, but frantically the characters perform, their industriousness serves to underline the fact that nothing happens that changes their existence ... a circular and timeless quality emerges. "" The language in a theatrical nonsense is full of ... repetitions ... repeating the obvious until it seems like a 'absurdity." Under a "sometimes dazzling comic surface", we find "a basic message of metaphysical anxiety". Gus's obsession with a silly game, his anthem language, the plot device in which he guesses a gloomy future and / or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still gloomy turn - so much suitable now. While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films, however, than Spielberg, Motorama's admirers should really find traveling companions - not instead of additions - in the works of Beckett, Ionesco and Genet. br /> <br /> But you can't stop there. After his disillusion with the game, Gus returns to "Phil" (ie, Love), the first assistant he had met and the only person who had treated him with decorum, even though he had even scolded him ... at a station advertising service "Be full-filled!". Under the tutelage of Phil, he learns a life of waiting for cars. We could note here that the absurd playwright Beckett had entitled his most famous work "Waiting for Godot", and that for Godot we should read "God". God is also one of Phil's concerns. Furthermore, as an indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, Phil is beaten and runs in a cast with his arms straight horizontally. In the last scene, Gus, now protected by Phil, says he wants to listen to music. We hear no one, but we see Phil waving his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm, motioning for Gus to come closer, and Gus answers. The End. <br /> <br /> Finally, about an author I was currently reading, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel-advocate is not recognized as an architect or sub-chief of Liberation Theology, which is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, perhaps he should be. The brutality of the police and the greed of the multinationals are a cliché in the cinema and in literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive mandates of writings, traditions and reason. <br /> <br /> His most significant work is an exhibition of the earthly activities of those fallen angels to whom the Bible refers as principalities and powers. Principati, wrote Stringfellow, are the basis of all our popular three I's: Images, Institutions and Ideologies. All of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises. The more deeply he is involved in an image, in an institution or in an ideology, any person becomes, the more his personality becomes "impoverished" and becomes a slave to them. Promising power, control and immortality, they inexorably provide impotence, chaos and death. Having essentially fallen, the defeated powers can do nothing else. Yet they deceive humans with that "dominion over the earth" promised by God in the book of Genesis, while in reality none of us controls an image, an institution or an ideology inevitably bent to its own hegemony and self-preservation. They take on a life of their own. "Domain" seems to be a wrong translation: a more accurate rendering of Hebrew would be "administration". But this is a quibble apart from a more fundamental problem: many of us neglect to note that God has delegated this power to Adam * before * the fall. We have no reason to suppose that we, his descendants, are still exercising it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that the demonic forces have stolen us from us. <br /> <br /> Two comments by CS Lewis could be added: First, that "man's conquest of nature" is a mere illusion, and a ploy to cover up the fact that you are really talking of the conquest of some men by other men with nature as an instrument; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan is not a kind of good time Charlie. At first he can swing pleasures, but he is very miserly with them and will withdraw them from every human being firmly in his slavery, perhaps leaving his prey seated before the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment. > <br /> Now, applying these insights to Motorama, we seem to be reflected considerably in the experience of Gus. It is, if not beautiful, at least a handsome boy before he falls victim to the Motorama game. The first signs that advertise it glisten with glamor. The longer it continues, however, and the deeper it goes towards the headquarters of the sponsoring company, the more it becomes run down. He is alone, he meets no one else who plays. The stations that distribute the cards have fallen into disrepair or are equipped with zombies. The people you meet along the way are increasingly ugly, deceitful and hostile. (The fact that the principalities respond to a common dictator does not mean that they can keep each other). Gus's humanity is swept away by him as he becomes not only totally self-centered and unaware of the needs of others, but partially blinded ... disfigured ... prematurely aged while childish in the literal sense of linguistically challenged. Eventually even his precious Mustang is taken by him in an accident, and he must continue in the sinking of a dead man. Yet in the end, having done everything he thought was expected, he presents himself to the principality in his proud tower to receive his prize. Using the biblical power of confusion exercised by those who built these monuments for their own vanity, his agents escape him, disappoint him, insult him and finally throw him from the top floor. He fell long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. In other words, in classical symbolism, it dies. He met the inevitable bad end of anyone who put his trust in such a deceiver. <br /> <br /> But this destiny proves to be just a look of alarm in a changing future. He repents and returns to Phil, and after seeing him performs the first generous and selfless act we saw from him for almost an hour and a half: observing that Phil is now handicapped and can hardly insert a tube into a gas tank, he asks , "Can I help you with that?" Then, seeing the "help wanted" sign, he decides to apply for the job, explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitchhiking that he thinks he will come out here, because it doesn't look too ugly <br /> <br /> This interpretation it is conjectural, of course, and it can surprise or even scorn the cult classic fans who see quite different points in it. <br /> <br /> If Motorama is not really my cup of tea, I am at least convinced now that it is not the worst film ever made.
