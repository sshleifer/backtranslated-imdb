The Dekalog 5 can be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment "Do not kill": it is not by chance that it puts the concept of a State fully compliant with the provisions of an unjust law on the same level as the figure of a murderess. "But the law might not imitate nature, it could correct it," says Piotr, the defender of the defense, a true catalyst character, "punishment is a form of revenge that aims to restore evil to evil without preventing crime. In name of whom does the law avenge itself? Really in the name of the innocent? " The horrific and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man condemned to death give value to the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty with the aim of intimidating all potential criminals. "Desperate despair does not require desperate remedies," says Kieslowski in his message, teaching us how unjust the act of disobedience to a commandment of God can be that judges punishment in the same way that crime is judged. There are three different moral attitudes here: the innate sense of rebellion of the murderer who aims to arouse the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference of the VICTIM inclined to laugh at the needs of others; the deserving behavior of the COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE is always ready to fight against adversity, in favor of human life. The struggle for life has been ruthlessly dissected all the time; the characters are immersed in scenes of distress and anguish, in an urban landscape accentuated by greenish tones and seen in its reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in "Dekalog 5" conveys a terrible sense of estrangement and isolation: descriptions of an undergrowth waste of violence and madness, scenes of precarious working conditions, sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous halo of desolation, wanderings aimlessly through disenchanted environments . Jazek, the main character, is forced to fight with an opponent stronger than himself: a city completely wrapped in a profound indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his silent calls for help, while a faded photo of a little girl in a dress of the first communion continues to gnaw his soul. He is irremediably directing his steps towards a disconnected path towards damnation seen through the 18 mm deformations. wide-angle lens that aims to distort every detail, altering reality, making it vanish into remote and alien echoes. Kieslowski brings no extenuating circumstances seasoned with melodramatic and melodious tones in favor of the defendant, unlike some Hollywood stereotypes such as "I want to live" (by Robert Wise). It does not slip on the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes to extend the guilt of Jazek and to mitigate the brutality of the crime, not interested at all in immediate psychological motivations to justify any manifestation of extreme or violent behavior and to refuse to include any useless judicial judgment proceedings. In other words, in Kieslowsky's opinion "a crime is always a crime": according to the "par condicio" principle it puts the prosecutor on the same level as the condemned, using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the light more left. And we cannot remain indifferent: even if we do not agree with him, Jazek's screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same way that Terri Schiavo's entreaty eyes do.
