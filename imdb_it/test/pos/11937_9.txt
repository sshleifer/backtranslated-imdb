I think Toy Soldiers is an excellent film. It is one of the few films that, apart from some well-known actors, has an unknown cast that can actually act. In my opinion, the plot is appealing. Keep your attention without having an outrageous story that could not happen in real life. I think everyone would like this movie. Sean Astin always seems to choose the perfect films to be his talent in that showcase. He is very undervalued and does not get the recognition he deserves. Other films that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this film and Rudy really show it because he is the main character in both. I hope that one day he will receive the awards he deserves for his acting. If you want to see a fantastic movie you have to check this and if you are a fan of Sean Astin you will surely like this movie.
