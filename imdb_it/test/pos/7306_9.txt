I think many others have already commented on this film, but I liked it so much that I just wanted to say how good this movie is. I gave a rating of 9 out of 10. He didn't get a 10 because he is very slow starting. I almost resigned, but I'm glad I didn't. Wait there, it's worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a film about relationships: deception, trust and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards all get busy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Set in the Midwest Farm Country, the character of Jason Robards is a farmer whose grandfather took office for the first time. Jason's character is aging and decides to create a trust that divides the thousand hectares of agricultural land between his three adult daughters. That's when the plot of this movie really starts to cook. <br /> <br /> The sisters oppose one another because of misunderstanding rather than greed on earth. They also make some discoveries about the childhood of others, and their current marriages, including an adulterous relationship, while the father becomes increasingly violent, demanding and paranoid - until the terrible truth about all finally comes out. <br /> <br /> This film really got me emotionally, I got angry with some characters and sad with them. I could feel their pain because of the excellent performance that was given. <br /> <br /> The ending was a surprise for me, but in line with the growth of the characters. <br /> <br />
