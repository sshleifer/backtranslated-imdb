After being thrown out of their last job and having found scant employment in the UK, the six members of the Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, see an advertisement for use in the golden city of Red Gulch in the Yukon Territory . It is from a newspaper clipping and on the back there is a story about Chamberlain that says the country will be better prepared for war. Outside they go to the Yukon and Frozen Limits. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's a case of badly placed Chamberlain. The crop is forty years old and refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer war rather than to Neville in the current crisis. But this is typical of how things are for this crew. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. <br /> <br /> Obviously when they arrive it is a ghost town inhabited only by the young Jean Kent and his grandfather Moore Marriott. It has been going on for years and is a little touched in the head. Marriott has a gold mine that is out of place in some place where it falls asleep, that is, when it sleeps. The Gang will help him discover that my or beautiful Ms. Kent will not marry the powerful hunter Anthony Hulme, but rather the saloon owner Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> This was my first exposure to the Crazy Gang and I can see both because they were so acclaimed in the UK and because they never had any impact on the pond. The jokes come fast and furious and then they were a series of things that the Code in the United States would not have allowed. The jokes are also strictly British for current events and many things could not be achieved here. <br /> <br /> Visual gags are universal, the final scene of the chase is worthy of all that the Marx brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you watch The Frozen Limits, tie it if you're familiar with English history and do it two or three times just to make sure you collect everything. It will be worth it.
