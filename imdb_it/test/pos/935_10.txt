See Three colors: blue and three colors: white. They are both wonderful films and will give an additional dimension to the final Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic film. It can be enjoyed in a single vision, and indeed, the climax of the film is very powerful in that first vision. But, look again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this film, you will see new things at every view. With the first vision you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind. With each additional observation, you find yourself discovering that it is, in effect, a brilliant work. Red is intended to symbolize fraternity in the French flag. History transforms the theme of fraternity around to be seen at angles that would never have been suspected. The facets of the fraternity shared by the different characters are as profound as one cares to scrutinize. If you're used to the obvious "symbolism" in most mass movies, you might find Red a bit slow. You might find yourself looking at a screen full of intensity that you can't imagine ... and yawning, ask yourself what it is all about excitement. This is not a senseless and perverse experience. Everything has not been explained to you. You have to think while you look. You have to see ... not just look. Wonderful movie ... one designed to be enjoyed by a wonderful spectator.
