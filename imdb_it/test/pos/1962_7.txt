Less Than Zero could have been the film of the 80s that reveals adolescent apathy in its most extreme form if they had remained faithful to that damn book. But, where they didn't have, this film presents the work, and leaves you with the most disturbing feeling when it's all over in ways not done until the late 1990s with the films of Larry Clark "Kids" and "Bully". <br /> <br /> Teenage outcasts of society face a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much as one) when their stranger friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts of killing a teenager near the edge of the river in their suburban city. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilian in the group, the only one willing to show any kind of conscience, however, while the others do nothing for the girl's death or want to help their friend hide the body. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is sickest in this film - Crispin Glover - who becomes almost obsessed and rather fatherly in trying to protect his friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of state. Dennis Hopper, a drug dealer (who clings to a female doll) who makes friends with the boys (as a merchant, of course) and suddenly gets caught up in the events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother, Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until his emotional breakup at the end. Obviously it is certainly not the price for teenagers of the 1980s. And certainly it makes clear the point about the serious detachment that these guys face (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many great executions in all (even Reeves has shown some acting skills). <br /> <br /> Help yourself to a comedy to recover if it hits you too hard.
