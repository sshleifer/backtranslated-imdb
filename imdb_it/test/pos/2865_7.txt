I didn't know much about this movie, but I found out that Kane was a wrestler, which didn't exactly excite me but hey, I liked "Santa's Slay" and he had a wrestler, so hell. The story begins in a very strange and promising way, but after a while it doesn't become much more than the typical terror movie for teenagers, even if the settings have helped some. A group of young criminals is arrested and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump to clean it up and prepare it as a shelter for the homeless. The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, being a veteran of the opening scene of this film in which he meets this great galoot who had just killed his companion and blinded another woman. Teenagers, being all furious punks, are obviously opposed to having to do a real job, but they are part of a co-exclusive work program, yes, that's a good idea, of course. Not everyone suspects that there is someone lurking in the hotel that in its small way will save the tax payers of that state. Sure, he's the guy who likes to collect his eyes, and he has a collection going on. There won't be much here that horror fans have never seen before, but there are some brutal and gore scenes sufficient to satisfy the most ardent fans. The setting of the old hotel is also perfect for the slasher, and there are small secondary stories, like the search for a supposed safe full of money and the search for girls, since this work group is evenly aligned. Even most teenagers are deservedly killable, so it works well. Not great but far better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger, and perhaps better than some other crap I wouldn't bother to see. 7 out of 10.
