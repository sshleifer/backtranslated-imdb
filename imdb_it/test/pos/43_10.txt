One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great cast, great music, this is one of those films that is so beautiful that when it's over you'd like to go on for another 90 minutes, I'll watch it many times. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that capture you from the beginning and twist them emotionally for the duration of the function. The cast is extraordinary without the slightest indication of someone who does not feel comfortable in his role. You have the feeling that you are really there to take all this. Great attention was given to the sets, costumes and music of the period. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated while the film goes on, but Ms. Merkerson's constant performance is so powerful that the film ends before we have had the full of the wonderful misfits. Identifying someone other than "Nanny" is an injustice because we have excellent performances by great veteran actors including: Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it's Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Ms. Merkerson who make this a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> The film moves quickly and is short by today's standards, but it is without doubt one of the best films you've ever seen. we will see this year. If you like beautiful vintage pieces that will emotionally challenge you, shake your heart, lift you with joy and make your feet beat at the same time, then this is the movie for you. I showed it to many friends and everyone wants my copy, that says it all, the movie is so beautiful. Take a look at yourself. <br /> <br /> danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
