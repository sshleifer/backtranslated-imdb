There is not much plot for this film. There is a rich owner of a baseball team who dies and whose wife intends to sue the hospital for negligence. Not much more than this, but .... DON'T THINK! <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter because you have some real actors that give life to their dialogue, and because of the cast you are a bit hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not fooling around laughing, you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Charley, whose wife has recently passed away, and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital. He is happy to taste everything on the menu at his disposal. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson) who is initially a hospitalized patient (their first scene together is a lot of fun) and then they meet again on a TV show, where they disagree on almost every topic which is discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley begins to love Anne, and vice versa, except that he is very big with the monogamy in the men of his life (her husband was a cheat) and they decide to give him a shot - two weeks of loyalty. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. He is usually not the first person anyone could think of for a middle-aged romantic comedy, but his touch with comedy is very light and pleasant. It is combined with every step of the way by Matthau, who is more fascinating than ever. He doesn't have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is a revolt all by itself as a practically senile doctor. The scene where the ashes of the baseball team owner are buried at home base is priceless. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard doesn't have much to do in this film and most of the time he's just Carney and Matthau's normal man; the role does not tolerate his remarkable talents, but he had to have fun doing this comedy. <br /> <br /> Very recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. Sincerely - Matthau presented Jackson with his first Best Actress Oscar, and Jackson presented the best actor to Art Carney for his role in 'Harry & Tonto'.
