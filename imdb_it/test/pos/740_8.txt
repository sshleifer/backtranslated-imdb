A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Dr. Stephens. She is angry to know that the doctor died, leaving her assistant Dr. Masters in charge. He is unnerved by the inmates including a mad judge, a Vietnamese veteran upset, a catatonic and disturbing nymphomaniac, but he quickly became friends with a Sam: he needs all the friends he can get while people are dying around her . "Do not Look in the Basement" is my first SF Brownrigg horror film. Despite his low budget, he manages to deliver some genuine thrills plus a nice amount of cold blood, including a particularly unpleasant scene with a desk spindle through an eyeball. The climax of the prisoners who take control of the asylum is an intense melange of wild photo-work, screams of blood and penetrating. .
