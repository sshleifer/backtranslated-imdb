Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all time (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The biggest discussion was about Spielberg and if he is or is not a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a technical master, most of his films lack depth. Saving Ryan is really exceptional from a technical point of view, but his message is boring and while it's very funny, it doesn't make you think of anything. AN is the best film I've ever seen because it combines great shots with a profound philosophical perspective on so many things, starting with the war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of the soldier in war (a soldier is a hero or a murderer ? Brando says it is neither one nor the other, the French lady says she is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to discuss whether these points are true or false. But a great film, and in general a great work of art should trigger discussions, not solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he is not, nobody has the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its external beauty, incredible scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be completely satisfied. But what really makes this film a masterpiece is its inner quality. One cannot help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. Copolla and Moore face similar problems, but while Copolla presents issues from an external, objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises a whole documentary ... It's really a pity that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 has won a prestigious recognition as Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start to understand some of the Vietnam war, the war in Iraq, the Second World War and any war in general, you should definitely watch this movie, and not the other ...
