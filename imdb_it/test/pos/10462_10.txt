this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen ... the stark scenario ... isolation ... bigoted ignorant people hiding behind their religion ... a background for a bit of wordliness and sophistication ... the acting is completely natural ... but for me as a "gourmet" the best thing is the choice and the actual preparation of the party .. I spent time in Paris and I know the kitchen well ... even if the cafe 'anglais really exists I know, but I know similar establishments and the menu of babette and the choice of wines are authentic ... and of course the end, where oneself, the perfect meal welcomes them back to friendship is the only ending that there may be ... this is 10 out of 10 movies and should be seen by anyone with enough brains and taste to understand it
