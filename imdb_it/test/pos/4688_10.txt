Hi, I have to say that you have some wrong information about the series here. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later there were other authors but they did only a few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director who made most of the series (I think the complete series 1) was Ian Sharp who created the distinguished appearance of Robin of Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Clannad actually saw some of the material and read the scripts. I know this for sure because Richard Carpenter told it about a Con in England last year. I think this is a Television-Entertainment masterpiece, because it has great characters and casts, beautiful costumes and great story Lines. For me it's still one of the best TV series ever!
