First of all, this film has no history. It is obvious that there have been many rewrites during production - sometimes the characters refer to a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the chronology of the entire story was never known by anyone on the set. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is a bit brilliant. Pfeiffer is incredible - and I mean fantastic, like Catwoman; she nails the intrinsic sexy darkness of the character and the good / bad tendencies. Walken is Walken - but even uglier than usual. Devito is not faithful to the comic when it comes to Penguin, but it is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underestimated as Batman. <br /> <br /> And the music and style are pure cinematic thrill. True, the 3rd act does not work. But the last 2 scenes are knockout, and it's clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that was derailed by the extravagant darkness of this film. Too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and if they acted in a third installment, Joel knows who wouldn't have had the chance to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
