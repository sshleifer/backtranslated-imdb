About 12 minutes into the song, in the scene where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr are approaching for the first time, there is a really nice song that plays ... what song is that ?! And from whom is it sung? It is a song that sounds very romantic and is a singer, a piano that plays, etc. I've tried all over the world to look for music on Google and iTunes, etc., but it doesn't show up, not even on song websites. So, if you listen to it, surely I'd like to know enough about it so that I can try taking the CD with that song or finding it in iTunes. I don't know if my e-mail will be rubbish, I'm new to this ... but I'll come back to look here.
