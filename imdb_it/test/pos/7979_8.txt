For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman movies. He had the best cinematography and an angular appearance with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last vision, he eventually slipped into my ratings and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - However, this is still the most intriguing of the five Batman films of the last days. The elegant cinematography here is the best of all Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films that feature extraordinary visual effects, as this is a prime example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Among the bad guys, I preferred Catwomen, finding it the most fun to watch before and after the change. Violence is not exaggerated here as in many other Batman stories, but one is never bored watching this. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a great job playing Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - For a film based on a comic book that mostly children read, I still think of these first two films. Batman's films, both made by Burton, were too obscure and the words weren't absolutely appropriate. Although, unlike the first film, there was no use of the Lord's name in vain here, there were still bad words and both criminals made too many sexual remarks. It would have been ok if they hadn't marketed this film for children and adults. The "penguin" of Danny DeVito is decidedly macroscopic. "Grottesco" I can manage, but who wants "gross". Few boys, meanwhile, have complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Catwoman. Generally too much obscurity and some cheap shots on Christian-bashing made me also think about my previous evaluation of this film. <br /> <br /> OVERALL - Fabulous visual effects and memorable characters make this the most interesting in Batman series, but a side too obscure, a prejudice too coarse and too anti-religious, in the end they completely abandoned me after a half dozen looks on this movie. Sorry, but I prefer a gentler and kinder Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was glad to see the series lighten up after this.
