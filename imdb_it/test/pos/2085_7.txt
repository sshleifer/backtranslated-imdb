Zachary Scott does what he does best, that is, a worm, in "Danger Signal", a 1945 B movie with Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after getting their money. Fleeing from his last murder, he rents a room in the house owned by the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and his mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself against Emerson, and is dazzled. Mid-romance, younger sister Anne (Freeman) returns home from medical treatment. When he states that he was Uncle Wade's favorite and left her $ 25,000 (big by 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and makes a comedy for Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking with Scott - during the night, she's 10 years old and becomes decidedly bad with her sister. Finally receiving the message that his tenant is not good, Hilda calls a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) to psychoanalyze and advise him. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were all the rage during and after the Second World War, and Scott does a great job as a sociopath without problems. This was his forte - like a willful sheriff in "Flamingo Road", he didn't exhibit any real presence. As for the times, we saw him do it in "Mildred Pierce", where he proved particularly good at it. Emerson is a stenographer of books with hair pushed out of her face and big glasses, but after hours, she is adorable and gives a strong interpretation. DeCamp has always been an underestimated actress - here, she sports a soft German accent and is delicious. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie, even if a very routine story. The acting really elevates him.
