River's Edge is more than the story of a murder. It is an accusation of the wave of apathy that has plagued the pockets of youth for decades. Our main characters are a group of those that my school would have called "stoner". One of them decided to strangle his girlfriend because apparently he had the courage to "talk to him". This dangerous young man played by Daniel Roebuck has an intensity that will surprise you. Bring out the other kids in the group to show them the body of his girlfriend, and strangely, nobody really looks scared about it. The balance of the film underlines the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how the sense of guilt can eventually lead the way even to these apathetic children. <br /> <br /> River's Edge does not condone or support its characters' behavior We see clearly the dangers of such uncontrolled apathy and only have the desire to get drunk or grow tall. We are shown the dysfunctional domestic lives of these children, and perhaps this is intended to explain their horrible behavior. But could they be just unstable homes that lead to this kind of destructive life? Crispin Glover is the usual solitary. Driving in the city in a state of complete paranoia after the murder. Try to understand why his friend committed the crime, but he clearly doesn't understand what he could have done to the young man. Dennis Hopper plays an older man with whom these children take their drugs. Although he is certainly a rebellious figure, he cannot refer to the apathy and anger of the younger generation. Witness his confused reaction as Roebuck describes how the killing of his girlfriend made him feel. As wild as Hopper's character is, he also knows that this young man should not walk on the face of the earth. <br /> <br /> What will you think of these children? Well, there's really no way to appreciate their characters. Some are less contemptible than others, but you can't help hating or displeasing them. Twenty years later, there is still a lively and vigorous apathy in many young people out there. When are these guys lost? What makes so many of them want to act anti-social? This movie and the questions it poses about teenagers will stay with you for a while. This is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
