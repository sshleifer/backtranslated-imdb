This film is about a young Indian boy who comes home one day and finds himself engaged to a woman. The problem is that he is gay. To stop the marriage without telling his parents that he is gay, a lie leads to another until he gets out of control. <br /> <br /> This film is hilarious and makes me laugh many times. The acting of Sally Bankes is superb and plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is exceptional as well. I find the plot very realistic, and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend Jack receives much less attention in the film. I wish they were given more jokes in the film and had more character development. However, since I imagine the director wants to make this film more mainstream, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film. <br /> <br /> It's nice to watch an affirmative gay movie. Furthermore, this film preaches us to accept the difference of others, whether it is sexuality, culture or lifestyle. This film makes the viewers reflect. <br /> <br /> We need films like this to give us a boost. Thanks for making this movie!
