The net is an excellent film! This is Angela Bennett (in a great performance by Sandra Bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the Compagnia della Cattedrale, who cleans viruses and tests games for clients. Angela is a typical nullity who has no friends outside of cyberspace, almost takes no holidays and leaves and remains almost always connected. One day her friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him, sending Angela a disc with a strange program that contains a lot of confidential information. The same night, when Dale would meet her, he was suddenly killed in a plane crash. Going to Mexico during her vacation, Angela meets a beautiful boy named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who proves to be a cold bloodthirsty bastard and one of the boys behind all the secret of the disk. <br /> <br /> His life turns into a nightmare: all his records are erased and the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police, is given. <br /> <br /> This film is fantastic because it shows how we humans depend on many computers and machines (sometimes more than we should) and how vulnerable we are if someone decides to check and modify our personal files, without leave us the opportunity to prove the error.
