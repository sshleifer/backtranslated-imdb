Do not Change Your Husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of light double comedies by Cecil B. DeMille. On the other hand, it's her first image to play in Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actress of the silent era, and it's the film that made her a star. <br /> <br /> Although DeMille's old formula was beginning to change, and his films were becoming more verbose and less purely visual, with an artist as expressive as Swanson we can regain much of that silent narrative style . Your character does very little, but does he transmit volumes through subtle gestures and facial expressions ?? with a special talent for looks of disdain. In real life, Swanson was coming towards the end of his disastrous marriage to Wallace Beery, and it is possible that this fact has fueled his convincing performance. <br /> <br /> As to best integrate the talents of its protagonist, the use of framing and close-ups DeMille is particularly strong here. Do you use cinematographic technique to show acting? often holding Swanson in long close-ups at key moments ?? and also to clarify the story visually. For example, when the character of Toodles is presented to us, it is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror. His character disappears from history, only to become important towards the end. That first photo that caught our attention helps us remember who it was. Later, at the anniversary dinner, Swanson and future husband number two Lew Cody are framed together in one fell swoop, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his frame. Also ?? and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general ?? is there much use of reaction shots ?? for example, the disapproving look of the bishop when Cody recites his intentions with the dolls of the wedding figures. <br /> <br /> In contrast to DeMille's visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screenplay of her collaborator, Jeanie Macpherson. As I noted in many other comments, Macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story, but as DeMille tended to state his themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. And so we take these very long almost philosophical papers on the pitfalls of married life which, if they improve the story, is only because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could invent a phrase like "Destiny sometimes lurks in Christmas shopping". Fortunately, in this image these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than breaking them. <br /> <br /> Although the images he made at this time tended to be small, it was at this point that DeMille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular. You can see it start to slip into excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like Swanson's little fantasy scenes flooded with "Pleasure, Wealth and Love". It would not have been until the early twenties, after the unofficial embargo on historical images was lifted that he would have had the chance to do the whole thing with the great show. <br /> <br /> All in all, not changing your husband is a discreet image of silent DeMille, although to tell the truth it is only the presence of Gloria Swanson that lifts her above the average. It is curious, however, that this is a comedy, and Swanson was chosen, at least in part, for his background at Mack Sennett's slapstick factory. He hated comic acting, and here he gives a dramatic rather than comic performance. It makes sense then that the only direct drama he did with DeMille, Male and Female, was by far the strongest of their collaborations.
