This film is a wonderful example of the quality films that Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. Ted Danson offers a powerful interpretation of a man tormented by memories that nobody accepts and a company that believes to be crazy. It's a remarkable performance by a man best known for his role in Cheers, a comedy television comedy. The supporting cast is all very well chosen, including Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who plays the part of Gulliver's wife in the film. But above all it is the seamless and very delicate changes between our world and Gulliver's world to make this film. The difference in perspective between giants and midget, all interpreted by real actors, is magnificently captured. A rare surprise in cinematography and direction.
