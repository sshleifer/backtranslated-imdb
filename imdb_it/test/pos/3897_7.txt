Just as in "Columbo" we see that fatality occurs right at the beginning. What follows is a growing network of lies, sex, blackmail and murder. The investigator, Adam Arkin, is also a bit of a smoker, not unlike "Columbo". He is William H. Macy, as suspected by the film critic who leads the film. Turning and turning continuously, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime". Fans of William H. Macy will appreciate "A Light Case Of Murder", as well as those who love capers criminals with all kinds of delicious possibilities. Add some well timed comedy, and this is very similar to a nice "Columbo" episode. Highly recommended. - MERK
