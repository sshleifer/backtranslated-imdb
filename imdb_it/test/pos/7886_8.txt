I remember so many things about seeing this film during its release in the original rooms - the posthumous afterglow of peace and love, along with the pre-Watergate tension of fear and paranoia. It's hard to believe that thirty-seven years later, and I can still remember the thoughts that run through my head as I watched the movie with my best friend. Astounded by Peter Boyle's characterization of the definitive redneck, he certainly typed it for the rest of his career (Oh, how wrong!), And how the counterculture shook the sensitivity of most of the country. To date, my friend and I still use Joe Curran's phrase from my summary above when he is faced with a dilemma; curious to know how such a simple line can stay with you for decades. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read comments on others' films on this forum, especially those that claim that the film has a dated quality and how the characters were at the top. Yet, if you were around at that time, the image provides a fairly accurate picture of the polar opposites that existed then, practically side by side as events in history reveal. If you really want to go out, when was the last time you heard the words of Macy and Gimbel in the same sentence, or a phrase like Joe's - "Come on, take with the Pepsi generation". For a historical perspective, you have that big Nixon poster that lingers in one of the background scenes: "Would you buy a used car from this man?" With minor plots like these, director John Avildsen captures many of the hints, but never present, of how life had been four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's vision was only the second time I saw the film, and I must admit that I don't remember Susan Sarandon in one of the main roles, but then again, this was her first image. Nude and free love scenes were something really new and daring at the time, shocking indeed, when filmmakers began experimenting with their ability to push the envelope of convenience and convention. "Joe" has taken a big step forward in this regard, especially since it was a "mainstream" photo. <br /> <br /> Over time, the thing that struck me most about Peter Boyle was how he overcame the Joe Curran stereotype to appear or act in some of my favorite works. I mean, how do you go from "Joe" to that hilarious interpretation of "Puttin 'on the Ritz" in "Young Frankenstein"? And my absolute favorite episode of 'X-Files' is Boyle as Clyde Bruckman, in a tender and tragic, funny and serious portrait that turns tables on Scully and Mulder more than once. And as a career leader, Frank Barone must be one of the most entertaining characters in television history. Even repeated episodes in syndication are fun like him ... every time Major Baron lets go of one of his observations. He is an actor that this spectator has already deeply lost.
