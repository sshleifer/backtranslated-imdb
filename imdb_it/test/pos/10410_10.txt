I remember a show in which this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that allowed her to talk to her. Needless to say, he couldn't eat his friends so he died of hunger. Another incident had an accountant visiting an underground sewer and a subway security branch. The accountant wanted to close the funding for the project. Apparently, the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibal creatures that lived in darkness. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
