This is one of the best films of the French Revolution ever produced. Being a very experienced person at the time, I was amazed by the level of detail. The costumes are correct. Even small detailed articles, such as ink wells, serving dishes, etc. They are all perfect. As an American living in France, who has access to the film's sites through his membership in various historical associations such as the Napoleonic Alliance, I cannot say how impressed I was with the visual accuracy of the film. <br /> <br /> The dialogue where known is the virtual citations and the unregistered where is in the character. I was extremely satisfied with this film and I am disappointed that it has not yet been released on DVD. This is how historical drama should be done. You must see....
