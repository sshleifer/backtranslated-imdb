I recommend to the viewers of the film whether in the New York City area go to the Intrepid museum and get an idea of ​​how closed and cramped it was to live for the crews of the vintage WWII submarines. Especially since it must have been for the sailors during the First World War. It must have been really hell below. <br /> <br /> Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery direct the cast of Hell Below, Huston as the book captain and Montgomery as his number two. Both are quite credible as Navy officers and the rest of the cast as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc. They fill their roles fairly well. <br /> <br /> Silent service became more popular during the Second World War and after. It's amazing, but I could mention a large number of underwater images like Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Hellcats of the Navy, Run Silent, Run Deep and many others and you will see the same plot situations in all of them. I imagine that there is indeed a limit also for situations. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante's performances are interesting. It's pretty funny and his kangaroo scene while on vacation is really fun. But I should say that a character like him in those cramped spaces is probably very necessary for morale. If you don't have someone like this to break the voltage on a submarine, you should transfer it immediately to your ship. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me is still the scene of the death of Sterling Holloway. Very similar to Sean McClory on Island in the Sky. It will haunt you a lot after seeing this movie.
