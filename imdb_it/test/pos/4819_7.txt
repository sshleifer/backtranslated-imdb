What often threatens to turn into a faded and soft-headed drama about a misunderstood middle-class youth ends up with a surprisingly shady and submissive film by John Frankenheimer (his first, though he started out on television, directing an earlier version of this script). <br /> <br /> We are still in those semi-mythical 50s when teenagers drove jalopias and jeans were still dungarees. James MacArthur (adopted son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and later entering pop culture as Hawaii Damage 5-0) is involved in a minor incident in a movie theater that escalates to punch the manager (Whit Bissell) and be booked at the police station. His father (James Daly), a great film producer, receives the call, doesn't listen to his son's version of the story, and pulls the strings to get him out. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur continues to carry a chip on his shoulder, which even his nice mom (Kim Hunter) can't get away from. Things get worse on the Coldwater Canyon farm until MacArthur, seeking revenge, stages a revival of the original incident .... <br /> <br /> Does the film not entirely avoid attitudes ?? and clich√©s ?? of his time, but presents them with considerable nuance: each character gets an honorable audition; every point of view has its merits (and reactions to the film will depend on what the viewers bring to it). There are flaws (the word "shoddy", a standard rebellious euphemism of the time, is used about thirty times too often) but they are overcome by strengths. The film benefits from a strong cast (the most notable of which is the excellent character actor James Gregory, as a police detective) and a resolutely non-exploitative way of telling his story. From a vantage point in the new millennium, the warm water in which Mac Arthur finds himself may seem a little warm, but The Young Stranger remains honest and honorable. <br /> <br />
