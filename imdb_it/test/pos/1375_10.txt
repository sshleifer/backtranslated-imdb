I loved this movie! Yes, it's quite cheap and I'm sure many reviews will be haughty about it. But my God, how much they packed for cash. I remembered the early works of Sam Raimi. Yes, it's rough, but it has good energy and lots of fun. The acting ranges from the excellent of Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not so good in some of the smaller parts. Is it a cult film? Well, he grew up on me. I liked the first time, but I liked the third vision. The film is probably a 7 out of 10, but I'm giving it 8 out of pure boldness. Anyone who can make it for 8 grand is worth watching. It almost makes me want to visit Scotland!
