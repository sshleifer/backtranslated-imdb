Night Of The Demons is undoubtedly one of the most famous doons horror movies of the 80s, in the same style as the Evil Dead and Demons movies. This film combines teenagers and sexually active demons in a fun movie. A welcome addition since the 1980s has been invaded by slasher films, it was good to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers who meet for a Halloween party at the home of the hull that was funeral, hosted by Angela. About 40 minutes of drunkenness and sodomy eventually lead to a demon or demons who find their way out of the furnace and possess each of the teenagers. Add some flashy make-up effects, lots of cool and cool-looking demons and you've got yourself a sweet 80s party that will rank as one of the best demon-related movies on many horror fan lists. <br /> <br /> First of all I loved the setting of this movie, "Hull House" is really creepy and disturbing and the perfect setting for a horror movie and more when Demons emerge, it's when the action takes really the way and it becomes a night of terror and fear. This film gave birth to 2 sequels, the first in 1994, but it was nothing like this and the third entitled Demon House was absolutely horrendous. This is one of those horrors that has surely stood the test of time and remains a real gem for many years to come. <br /> <br /> All in all a fun film of cheese with Demons that is definitely worth a look.
