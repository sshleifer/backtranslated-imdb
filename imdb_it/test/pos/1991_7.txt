"We are both stumbled into this unformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or even non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces we do not understand." So says Ted Pikul in the film. Which for some people sums up life and 'eXistenZ' is probably a film about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how the difference is said. Or not. The last line of the film is superb ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a fucking dog story (in fact it has a real tousled dog) but it takes you on an interesting tour, full of provocations Tocco di Cronenberg that will make you watch amphibians, the shells games, fish, thorns and bones in a new light. Some bits are pretty icky. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called 'GAS STATION' and a Chinese restaurant is called 'CHINESE RESTAURANT.' The film has a compelling storyline that is far from your usual big-budget sci-fi movie. You can read a lot of things in the film and repay by watching more than once. <br /> <br /> The main actors are Jude Law who is OK and Jennifer Jason Leigh who is great. Some roles do not fit this very talented actor, but when he has a good role like this it is unparalleled. Its unconventional beauty and its charming voice fit the part of Allegra. (He looks fantastic even in a short black skirt.) There are other familiar actors but he isn't given much to do. It looks good, sounds good and a Howard Shore score completes the movie very well. Cronenberg is perhaps the Alfred Hitchcock of the sci-fi / horror genre. No matter what movie you do, it's always worth watching.
