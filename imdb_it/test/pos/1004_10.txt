Can you capture the moment? When do you feel the rain on a roof? Some things go beyond the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. The things that matter. <br /> <br /> The poet Dylan Thomas has captured the seemingly inexpressible "A good poem helps to ... extend everyone's knowledge of himself and the world around him". (Bob Dylan called himself after him). So why did it take so long to make a film about the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopic may have missed the point. The writer Sharman Macdonald has taken a different and better approach. <br /> <br /> In The Edge of Love, he creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so that we can swim in them. The lives of four friends. Dylan, who wants and loves to the fullest. Wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller), her gritty support. War hero William (Cillian Murphy), who saves him from a street brawl. And then there's his childhood love. Vera. Cara Vera. Take your breath away. She is Caitlin's best friend. William's wife And, like a muse, the "star" in Dylan's dark sky. <br /> <br /> It all began in 1940, London Blitz, with bomb shelters in the underground. Enter Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) in the improvised stage spotlight. Meet Dylan for the first time in years, his heart is flushed. Their eyes shine through the smoke of the room. The purity of their past passion. Dylan (native Welsh native speaker, Matthew Rhys) is not a sanctified and sanitized poet. Master of his vices, he must fully experience them all. He introduces his beloved wife and continues to woo Vera. <br /> <br /> The Edge of Love is a visual pleasure. The soundtrack lets you want more. The performances are probably the best from these actors in their career. As a lush love story it is quite good. Like Dylan Thomas's intuition and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not bad at all. And as a tribute to a great man, a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> The production is committed to projecting the spirit of Dylan Thomas without compromising too much historical accuracy. Dramatic tension implies a push between artistic freedom and conventional morality. The public in search of an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. And it will play less well with the public whose boundaries are those of Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman Macdonald seemed aware of the stubborn nature of artistic freedom and its limits when he spoke with producer Rebekah Gilbertson (nephew of the real William and Vera). "Think of all the things you don't want me to write," he said, "because I have to have white paper." For Macdonald, the limits were if she were to offend Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the limits are those that wife and family could establish about them. A woman has no intention of letting high ideals interfere with practical common sense problems, and will also put her children's interests before her (this happens occasionally the opposite, as when the imposing genius Virginia Woolf refused to let Leonard love take it to earth - in The Hours). <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become close friends. It is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film tell a story in themselves. In a gray Britain, Great Britain, Caitlin and Vera are bright lights in an ocean of gray. Shortly after meeting the enlightened character of Vera, illuminated by flashing lights, we meet Caitlin through her burning blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railway car. His dramatic red coat cuts through the streets of a colorless homogeneity, triumphing on a beautiful staircase as he rejoins Dylan. But the brightness of Vera's red lipstick is less durable. For her, marriage is the second place, even when she became the master of true love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Exceptional cinematography extends to the use of montage to juxtapose images, in a way similar to the juxtaposition of unrelated word poems to create further meaning. Horrible scenes of war in Thessaly are interconnected with Vera's screams during pregnancy. Give birth or is it abortion? We are not told immediately. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place in our day. <br /> <br /> The constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film take us beyond terrestrial opposites. It reminds me of Marlon Brando reading TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. A different way of seeing things. "I take you back to a time when no bomb has fallen from the sky and no one has ever died," Dylan tells Vera as they walk along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin remembers her childhood with Vera: "We're still innocent of Dylan," he says. <br /> <br /> There is time to leave your underwear at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, perhaps.) A time to be inspired. Enjoy what is perhaps the best British film of the year.
