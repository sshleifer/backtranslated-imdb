When Patricia Newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder, Detective Carrella searches for her killer in the city. Identifying the murderer after an intense manhunt, Patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country. For Carrella the case is closed ... or is "Blood Relatives" is a neglected masterpiece. Donald Sutherland plays a policeman and it's nice to see Donald Pleasance in a small role as a child molester. The conclusion is rather disturbing. "Blood Relatives" is more of a mystery than a horror movie, so blood fans will be disappointed. A must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies.9 out of 10.
