With all the shooting, bloody horror films that have come to our attention in recent times "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills have eyes" Yes, they have their place, don't get me wrong! I went to see "When a stranger calls" with my friend the other night! Why? Because it's a remake of the classic of 1979, which at the time was excellent and scared, you know what's between everyone! I didn't know what to expect. However I was pleasantly surprised! It was a film made of atmosphere, atmosphere, suspense! Because you remember people, what you can't see, what you think you see, what you can't feel or what you think you feel, is much scarier than what you do! If you love movies with mood, creepiness, suspense and atmosphere !! You will like it! He brought it back to the roots of the original Halloween. Congratulations, a solid 8.5 out of 10 Remember people, it's well done! not perfect! It's spooky, not bloody, it's disturbing, not bloody! It was good to see a movie coming so long. Our minds have been conditioned and deformed by the magnificence and shock value of today's horror films, let us forget, what is really scary.
