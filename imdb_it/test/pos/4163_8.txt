I never thought of saying this on a biographical film, but there is an almost overabundance of characterization (especially about Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little about the literal events of his life - in the end, I'm not sure if he dies do it), or if his sister eventually dies (should), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (it's an internal joke, in case you missed it - Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad). However, this look in the mind of a writer who "sketched poems and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, fun and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that all are animated as animals (as in many of Miyazawa's stories). <br /> <br /> Some of the images are really stunning, especially considering that it was made for a TV movie. Seriously, some of them (like the sequence with the birds that drag the blue light) are rivals of Fantasia. However, I still can't stand computer animation when mixed with cel animation. CGI trains are horribly obvious - even more so than the Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
