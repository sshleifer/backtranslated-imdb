It's hard to know what to do with this strange little Australian criminal film - on the one hand, it's a little funny movie with a great sense of humor; but on the other it simply lacks a certain something that ensures that the film never exceeds its limit which keeps it trapped in the merely "interesting" territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well-traced film that fits excellently into different stories at the same time, which allows for several little highlights in the film, and which in turn helps prevent the film from becoming boring. The absurdity of what happens, the big Australian accents and the bizarre character set help to make the movie even fun. The plot follows the story of a young goalkeeper who thinks about moving on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local boss. Not him; work gets him into trouble only when he prefers a swim and stupidly leaves ten greats on the beach, which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their life on a wild shopping spree. However, all is not rosy for our hero; who has to find the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a cast of strangers; at least, it was in 1999, as today Heath Ledger is a name. It doesn't impress too much here, however, as his performance is mostly one-note variety and does not represent a very compelling advantage. It adapts to the film in the sense that it is Australian and seems naive; but beyond that, he's not the best character I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here. He may not have much time on the screen, but he steals every scene he finds himself in and it is he who gives the film a lot of humor. It has nothing to do with the best sequence, which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever seen in the film. Overall, I can recommend this film to people who love bizarre criminal films; since strangeness is abundant and the way events take a turn for the bizarre is pleasant; but if you're not a fan of this kind of film, I can't really say that Two Hands floats your boat. It is absolutely not to be seen, but if it is your passion and you have the chance to see it ... you will probably not regret it completely.
