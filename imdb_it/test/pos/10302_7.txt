This film is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players who took the championship 20 years ago against all odds. They all met for a meeting. Terry Kinney plays James, a Junior High dean, and he'll soon get you upset with all his complaints and feel sorry for my role. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays a hateful businessman with the right amount of "disdain" for money. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city, and appears to be on the verge of some kind of failure. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer, become an alcoholic and, in my opinion, is excellent in the role. While everyone supposes celebrating their league, conflicts, jealousy and struggle abound. While men come to terms with what it was, and now is, they are forced to look at their lives in an unpleasant way. It is rare for a group of men to chat and cry over what could have been, and I found it interesting to see them relate to each other. It's not the best film I've ever seen, but it's certainly good enough for a vision.
