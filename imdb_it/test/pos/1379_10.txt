I was trying to figure out why I liked this movie ?? It is not because the money spent on this is safe !! Did I see a water gun painted in there? Maybe they don't have the same kind of special effects houses in Scotland? Or maybe they didn't have money? The realization of clearly shows a band of very brave boys who make a film against the odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White interpret the main parts as 2 normal boys. No Hollywood histrionics here. <br /> <br /> OK, so the effects don't work very well. The spaceships don't look as good as they should in today's FX world and I've seen much better free stuff on YouTube. But the film holds up very well once we arrive on the planet. Was it shot in Scotland or only by a Scottish crew? Or do only better effects work? Have they changed the water? In the end I loved this movie and was disappointed when they all died.
