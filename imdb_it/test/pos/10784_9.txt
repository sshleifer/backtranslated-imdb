WOW, a masterpiece of a film not to be missed. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what this movie was when I started watching it late at night. I didn't find out it was a Stone movie until after the movie when I went to IMDb. Looking at him, I was hypnotized. The cast, in particular Eric Bogosian, is simply superb. One of the best screenplays and photographic works ever ... The film attracted me and kept me in ecstasy until the end ... I didn't dare to blink for fear of losing something ... Incredible as a low-cost movie being so addictive and well done while high-budget movies featuring tons of computer-generated action and special effects can be so incredibly boring. Don't miss this movie ...
