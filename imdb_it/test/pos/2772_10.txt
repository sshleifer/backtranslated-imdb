i love this movie. is it on the air anymore? what can I do to get it back on because I miss this movie when this movie is back on the air? I love this movie so much does anyone know how long it has been since last time at Disney? It's been a very long time and I'm so tired of waiting! I want to see Susie Q again. I swear, they take all the good movies on the air and play new stupid gays who are fake and retarded. I miss this movie, I want on a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil and another group. where did all the good movies go? I want them back. I miss all the good films and they don't have them anymore. if anyone finds out if Susie Q or some good old Disney movie comes out, please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no space) 148. thanks and I hope you too want this movie. I wish you a good day
