This is the central cartoon of the three (between Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) And he is the weakest of the three, despite being quite funny. It simply depends on a gag for too much action. Still a good cartoon. I feel a certain compassion for Daffy in this, which is rare for me. Daffy is so clearly overwhelmed that sometimes it becomes almost painful to watch. Good cartoon in an excellent series. Recommended.
