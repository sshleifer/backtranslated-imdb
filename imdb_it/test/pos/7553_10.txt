I met Arthur Penn's "Four Friends" for the first time one night on HBO. I had never heard of it, I expected very little, but I watched because I was interested in seeing how it would be a creation of a Penn team and screenwriter Steve Tesich. For the next two hours or so, I sat down hypnotized, watching this incredible teaming of talents and the story they woven. A semi-autobiographical story of a young immigrant in America who grew up among the turbulence of the 1960s, "Four Friends" follows the story of Danilo, an Eastern European immigrant (the brilliant Craig Wasson), since his arrival in the United States through a decade that changed the American landscape. Accompanying Danilo on his journey are his friends Georgia (the bright Jodi Thelan, in a role he unfortunately never had the opportunity to match), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four Friends" covers too many areas for me to try to explain it here, but if you haven't seen this movie, I urge you to find a copy (it's just been released on DVD) and look at it. You will not be disappointed. Tesich's script is wonderfully touching ?? sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always charming and honest. Penn manages with a sure hand, and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we are following. The cast is uniformly superb. This film was supposed to become a great protagonist of Wasson who is really one of the most wasted talents in this country. Jodi Thelan, not your Hollywood brainless sexpot, warms the screen in a performance that makes her character's audience fall in love with the ease with which they play the characters in the movie. The subtle performances of Metzler and Huddleston could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also excellent are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I haven't been without a copy of "Four Friends" since the day after I saw it for the first time on HBO many years ago. It has been and remains one of my favorite movies of all time for over 20 years. I can't recommend it enough and feel, if you give it an opportunity, you will feel the same way.
