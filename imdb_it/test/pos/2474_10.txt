The most incredible film I've ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I stumbled across the movie. I thought it was a real documentary and I felt bad for what I saw. I just found out it was a movie after it was finished and I looked on the web for more information on "punishment park" in the United States. I felt incredibly real and it's easy to believe that this really happened in the United States, if you're from Europe. I must admit that I really felt anti-American after watching the film and before discovering that it wasn't really like that.
