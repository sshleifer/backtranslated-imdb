When I tuned into my local PBS station last night to see "The War That Made America". I was expecting a boring documentary, instead I had a very good and credible reconstruction of the main events of the time. Now I see the reasons for the American revolution and the part of the Indian wars. Larry Nehring is George Washington, and he's perfect for that part. Even the camera narrative works fantastically. I look forward to coming next week to see the rest. It's nice to see PBS that really uses the HD format to bring the 1700 directly into our living room. I hope that Larry Nehring is seen more in the future, since he is such a talented actor.
