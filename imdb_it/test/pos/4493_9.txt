For the curious, this episode is based on the theme of Pirandello's play, "Six Characters in Search of an Author" and the work of Jean-Paul Sartre, "No Exit" (as indicated more clearly by the title), but obviously with a sterling turn. <br /> <br /> Five very different individuals find themselves in a round room without having any idea who they are beyond the indication of their clothing. It intermittently plays a bell (maybe even an allusion by Hemmingway?), Increasing the agony of their incarceration. The newcomer in the group, a major, is determined to escape, while the others are resigned to their fate. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters don't even have a story. They have nothing but the experience of the room in their conscience and no one who can write their non-existent story, so their position is even more desperate than Pirandello's characters. Unlike Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them, although the issue of personal responsibility against apathy is prominent in this story. <br /> <br /> Although this diverges significantly from the plot of the authors referred to in the title, the themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other twentieth-century authors) arrive with absolute clarity. This is obviously a piece that addresses the postmodernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also an emphasis on issues of personal insignificance. <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the best episodes I've seen, and still exceptionally relevant to the current experience (as are Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing in a classic.
