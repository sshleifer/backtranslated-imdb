The eXistenZ film is about a futuristic video game on a "pod" system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when a murder attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and the 38 million dollars spent on development will all be wasted. The only way to repair the game, however, is to actually enter the game with the only person he feels able to trust (Jude Law). This film was pretty good, but it doesn't really go on until very late in the movie. The best thing about this film was the twists and turns towards the end. Definitely worth seeing. 7/10
