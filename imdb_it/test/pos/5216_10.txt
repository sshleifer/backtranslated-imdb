I thought it was an excellent film. Gary Cole played the role of a soldier who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife pretending to be a fabulous death! Overall, I thought the film was fantastic, definitely not a boring storyline! It is sad to say, but I think many men might feel this way. I think he should have divorced and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he had gone to, but he felt that there was no other way out, so he simulated his death. I thought it was nice that Cole's wife in real life played the wife he was unhappy in the film. I think what the boy did was a bit extreme, but the film was still great! I highly recommend it!
