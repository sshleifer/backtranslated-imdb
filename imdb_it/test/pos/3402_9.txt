I saw this series on TV in 1990 and I loved it (I was nine). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and got the second one a couple of days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Damn ... It was hard to sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what would have happened to Madeline and George, etc. The slave issues and the civil war have always fascinated me (a 25-year-old Finnish). read Slaves in the family of Edward Ball for those who want to take a peek into the past and try to understand what really happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I want to see heaven and hell after so many people have said here that it wasn't that good.
