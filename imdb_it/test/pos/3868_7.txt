The Simpsons started with the Christmas special "Simpson's Roasting on an open fire" which had basic drawings and didn't laugh out loud, but this episode probably has the first loud laugh and from here the show gets better and better. This episode focuses on Bart, who in this episode exchanges a test with Martin and enrolls in a school for the most gifted, which led Bart to keep his friendship with his father and to lose all his companions. The episode is very funny and shows what would become the biggest show ever released. Fans of the show will love this episode as it presents the character's characteristics exactly as they became 20 years later. So watch this episode in a Season 1 package and have fun with the first Simpsons doing what it was intended to, Make people laugh. I consider this episode to be 73%.
