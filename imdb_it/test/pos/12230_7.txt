"A Fare to Remember" is a totally derivative film, almost ridiculous, but it has a warmth that makes it a very effective and optimistic holiday film. It is the protagonist of a newcomer, Challen Kates, as a high-powered advertising manager who, shortly before his marriage, has to run to L.A. in Seattle to keep a client who refused any other presentation. He has transport difficulties from the beginning and apparently without money. This is the first stupid thing - were there no ATMs anywhere? You must make a fortune. However, he meets a taxi driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless person, and guides him to his presentation and when he emerges with a huge box of dried meat (the customer's product), he is there to take her to the airport. All flights are canceled, so to get to L.A. for his marriage, he hires him to bring her there. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they bind and learn from each other. It's a very sweet film even if there's absolutely nothing new in it - it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and some other films. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are nice and the acting is good. Look for Jerry Springer as head of the jerky beef company and a Karl Malden cameo. <br /> <br /> This is a great film to tell during the Christmas holidays. It's about life.
