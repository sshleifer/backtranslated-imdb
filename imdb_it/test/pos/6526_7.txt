A $ 3.50 DVD can be a gamble and this was something of a compensation. <br /> <br /> A decent Saturday Night type movie that amuses if you observe the obvious flaws in the plot. The special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition (and why does London always seem to be in the 60s?) <br /> <br /> If you had the budget of, say, Armageddon, I'm sure it would have been better at the Box Office since the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Tycus is delivered to the history of the B movie, but if you see it for Â£ 3.50 then it's worth buying.
