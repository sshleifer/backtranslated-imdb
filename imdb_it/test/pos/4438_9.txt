What a tribute to his father! He began a search to learn more about a man he knew little about and, at the end of the journey, I believe that Nathaniel Kahn is happy with what he has learned and heard personally. The film has 5 years of work and a quarter of a century after his death, Louis I. Kahn's total commitment in his work: a strong constant desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless for the world whole, with intuitions his life is proudly represented by his son Nathaniel in the documentary "My architect: the journey of a child". <br /> <br /> The film is not at all an anthology of Louis's work. There are lots of books and archived materials that showcase the projects and buildings of Louis Kahn. This documentary works as a mystery, writer-director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn was looking for the man he knew for a short time as his father. <br /> <br /> The film is in chapters. In "Heading West" we are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. It is a spectacle that is worth seeing: Kahn's integral concept of construction and environment, the optimization of light for scientists at work is amazing. From a former colleague who worked with "Lou" 35 years ago, we hear about his meticulous attention to detail, even how "turbulent" it can be - he certainly didn't use half-words in his criticism. A memorable scene is when the camera swings open and we see Nathaniel skating around the Salk Institute square area - a tiny figure, like a child happily playing in his father's hands bowl. <br /> <br /> The "Immigrant" segment led us to meet Anne Tyng, the architect who worked in collaboration with "Lou" and who gave him a daughter, Alex. At 80, Tyng's return to Nathaniel's film crew at the Bath House project in Trenton, New Jersey was nostalgic. In "Go to sea", we go to see the Barge for American Wind Symphony Orchestra - all in steel, and meet Robert Boudreau, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him that he is the son of 'Lou's'. Boudreau was touched, he said he saw Nathaniel when he was six, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and he didn't have to tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was an exciting moment of reconciliation. <br /> <br /> Like his father "The Nomad", Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned of the Synagogue project that his father started but was not realized. He visited the wailing wall and, seeing his yarmulke continuing to fall / being "clean-shaven", his head gave me the feeling that it was not necessary to be a "totally" Jew to be his father's son. We continue to sit with his two stepsisters in the "Family Matters" segment. We also hear him conversing with his mother in Maine, and talking to the staff at the previous office in his father's office, we come to know how his father worked intensely and practically lived there, sleeping on a rug on the office floor, in the weekend and everything else. <br /> <br /> "The end of the journey" brought us to Ahmedabad, India, at the Indian Institute of Management building. Speaking with the architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. Eventually, Nathaniel found a very alive Louis Kahn, his father - his spirits live inside him. This documentary is very heartbreaking for me. Most of the time I had tears in my eyes - it was very moving and I admired the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the "whole world", to the work of juggling and to the three families (one could say that he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration in progress). Like Shamsul Wares, the architect of the Bangladesh capital complex (completed 9 years after the death of "Lou's") has thus advocated: Louis Kahn has given a lot to the people of Bangladesh, spending time in Bangladesh, understanding the culture of the place and of the people - besides giving them democracy through what they achieved, and for a man so busy, usually the people close to him often didn't see. It seems that the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of "The Fountainhead" by King Vidor from 1949 (good dramatic story in B / W with the music of Max Steiner), based on the novel by Ayn Rand, with Gary Cooper as an uncompromising architect which stands out from his own ideals, and Patricia Neal as the parallel supporting woman in her life. <br /> <br />
