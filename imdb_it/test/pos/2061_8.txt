"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a fun and fantastic action thriller, and a turning point in Geena Davis' career. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity, but back then. The fighting scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plot is strong enough to keep you busy for the 2 hours. <br /> <br /> It is directed with a sensible sense of style and avoids most of the action clich√©s. Geena Davis is fantastic as a girl in action and overcomes her usual role of "good wife". Samuel L. Jackson is good as a support player as usual. The character in the movie is too mischievous and you can tell what will happen to him. <br /> <br /> It is detached from the usual actors of the caliber of Commando and On Deadly Ground and is certainly one of the best actors for years. Have fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4 / 10.
