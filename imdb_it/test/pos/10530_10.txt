Brilliant work. Wonderful actors dissolve like brave and courageous characters. All the unforgettable parts in an action thriller that is more than intriguing and engaging. The casting is perfect. Both on the side of the stars like: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed by the young actor who plays the boy band member - Mustafa. You trust each of the Turkish gang. Very convincing is Michael Barral and all the followers of white power. I admire the musical rhythm of the main theme of "Children of Wax". This soundtrack is a fascinating blend of Udo Kier's Turkish, hard rock and humming ?? And at the same time Children of Wax "a story focused on racial conflicts. Intolerance and brutality between skinheads and Turks.
