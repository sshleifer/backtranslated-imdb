We have just watched the last series shown on the SBS network and will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I took the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" ended and it seemed like a bad substitute for our favorite TV show. Week by week, however, the show grew on me and, while not as polished as the Swedish show and decidedly more gritty in terms of investigating everyday crimes, it certainly provided a truly satisfying weekly meal. <br /> <br /> Before these 2 shows I had never been a fan of the detective genre and I can't say I am now, but the 2 Scandinavian shows really gave us a vision of life in those northern countries of the Euope through the eyes of their special police unit
