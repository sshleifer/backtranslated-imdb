Rather being a fan of Charlie Chaplin after good vibes after seeing "The Gold Rush" and then "City Lights", I was eager to see "The Great Dictator" as I was told this was probably his best film . I was also intrigued by the fact that it was a talkie; my first, Chaplin-wise. <br /> <br /> The beginning is typical of Chaplin and the clear proof that when we talk about sound, Chaplain can cut it although not based exclusively on music to create mood and to speak; it's fun, well timed and the elements of slapstick like the fall of an anti-aircraft gun are well connected to the jokes. It was nice to attract the viewer with this "classic Chaplin" opening and, at the same time, to start the narration of the characters who know each other. What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is false. Every scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film was fun and even now; makes you think how you know exactly who is spoofing and creates an internal reaction of some kind. The way the English mixed with the fake German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favorite joke was the five-minute speech Hynkel had given, only that the English translator translated it in a few words; making you think back to Hitler's footage you may have seen him give a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Historically, the film was also right. Hynkel is seen taking his picture with the children; something that Hitler did for recognition while manipulating the media but here, Hynkel is seen yawning and behaving bored; stabbing Hitler's sneaky technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, hug and kiss the children. Must be OK!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reintroduced into the ghetto among all the ongoing travesties but with the capture that is oblivious. Films like "The Pianist" and "Come and See" are two good examples of Nazi cruelty against "inferior" people who today, we can all look back and shake our heads as we return to the late 1930s, when it was shot, the fact that it was cruel and exploited makes it even more surprising. Chaplin has succeeded in replacing guns and batons for tomatoes and casseroles and still pulls him out. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about the film, however, was the fact that it turned into a real narrative after the opening. This slowed the film down and this is very evident when the foot has been removed a little from the gas. The film started to suggest stories and sub-stories. Among these were the barber and the neighbor who fell in love and the alleged destruction of Hynkel's palace while none of them was actually developed. The "giving a woman a shave" and "whoever has the coin in their pudding makes the gags" indicated these paths but eventually they materialized in nothing but excuses to pull out, little funny gags that were disappointing. <br /> <br /> During the final straight, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact that the Italian dictator is presented and adds a much needed life and excuse for the comedy to the film. It works as if we see them discuss and more subtle tactics are exploited when Hynkel tries to "overwhelm" his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (even if they are humiliatingly foiled). Despite some weak points in the rhythm during the central segment and the fact that the message was at last a little forced in the throat, The Great Dictator resists the vision of today, but it is only because he has taken the bet to exploit things that nobody else really I knew they were there.
