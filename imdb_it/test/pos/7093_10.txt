Not surprisingly, the majority of the most voted votes were presented by women over the age of 45. This is the time frame in women's lives when they become custodians of elderly and sick parents. I lost my mother, due to the complications of cancer, in June, and I experienced most of the same emotions portrayed by Zellweger in this film. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real and the plot development was extremely accurate. Congratulations to all the cast and crew for a wonderful portrait of life and death and the promises of tomorrow.
