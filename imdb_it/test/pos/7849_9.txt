The Beguiled was one of the few Eastwood movies I hadn't seen until I gave the DVD a tour today. And from the moment he opened the sepia shot to the macabre climax, I was completely fascinated. Too many filmmakers these days replace special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera instead of character-driven stories, but director Don Siegel has been able to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are credible and convincing. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a female fiction school that is on the fringes of various skirmishes during the American civil war. Women who support the south find a seriously wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); bringing him back to health begins to manipulate sexually frustrated women for his purposes. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page is excellent in the role of the principal with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly transmitted. For a film that takes place virtually in a single location, it never loses visual interest. There is also the possibility that the normal status quo, long abandoned when Eastwood's machinations have been discovered, can return; but the lovers and the students descend on a darker street ... <br /> <br /> This is a totally different style from Dirty Harry's own film of the director, made in the same year, yet they are both equally superb. Eastwood is very good at playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, yet there are also some mysterious qualities linked to his character. We never really learned much about him before his imprisonment, and the viewer is free to decide on his well-shaded person. Rogue or Victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I loved it.
