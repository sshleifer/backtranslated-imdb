PLOT IN SWEET: Dave Seville, father and manager of the Chipmunk Alvin brothers, Simon & Theodore, left for Europe for a business trip, leaving the boys at home with Miss Miller as their observer, much to Alvin's displeasure, he wanted to go to Europe. While playing against her female counterpart, Brittany, the leader of the Chipettes, included her younger sisters Jeanette (Simon's female counterpart) and Eleanor (the female counterpart of Theodore) in a fierce arcade game of Around the World in 30 days , attract the attention of two evil foreign brothers who need to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but they need a way to do it that does not attract the attention of their archenemy, Jamal. The two evil brothers, Claudia & Klaus, listen to the lines between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as boys and girls for deliveries for their loot (plus the idea of ​​Claudia that of Klaus, the latter initially becomes I realize that it is too dangerous for children). The 2 brothers make an offer to boys and girls - they travel via 12-point air balloons to leave dolls (which look like children) that contain diamonds and / or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money. But since the two different talking-talking brothers make their rounds, they are persecuted by Jamal's henchmen - but who is Jamal? Is he friend or foe? <br /> <br /> OVERALL: A pleasant and carefree farce based on the TV series from the 80s by Alvin & the Chipmunks. The beautiful animation is a highlight, it lacks the crude humor that continues to creep into today's family movies and engaging songs (the Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll stand out). Eagle-eyed fans will probably notice that Brittany's character design has been optimized from the animated series, giving her a less round face while adding an apparently permanent blush to her cheeks (which also show Jeanette and Eleanor). <br /> <br /> Keep an ear for Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
