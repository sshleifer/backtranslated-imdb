Exciting psychological thriller, evocatively directed and casually photographed, with an exceptional starring interpretation of a gloomy Donald Sutherland and powerful supporting roles by Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material decides to keep it all dark and goes from the investigation period to the victim's background. The rarity, and the rather grumpy nature of the investigation pushed me inside, but when the flashback to the side of the victim showing his last days was not so compelling, and it became a bit boring and something like. Although the screenplay is highly detailed and somewhat complex in getting in line, however the final and surprising revelation should have been more disastrous and was not helped by its sloppy execution. The soundtrack of Howard Blake has an emotional touch to his signals that simply linger, and the skill of the director Claude Chabrol (a good part of most) has a strong and stylistic style that draws the best from the moody positions flexible cast. The young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry do a great job as well.
