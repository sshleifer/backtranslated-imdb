A true masterpiece of Soviet cinema. It is a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova has never been given the opportunity to play in western films - but, again, it probably would never be there. In "Letyat Zhuravli", it is unforgettable. This was one of the few movies where I was crying ... <br /> <br /> In addition to Samojlova, Batalov and Merkurjev, who are the best, it was a brilliant job of the director and the operator who made this film an all-time classic all over the world. Just remember the scenes of piano music and the proposal under heavy German bombardment, or the death of Boris with a swirling sky over his head and his last visions appeared confused in those skies. Very simple means - but the great technique added to the emotional weight ... By the way, 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic", and with a Soviet budget.
