Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it being much less terrible than a horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman evokes a wonderfully evocative and disturbing atmosphere for large stretches of the film, constantly building suspense until I was really sure of what was going to happen, but I tightened like a spring waiting for him. The lack of action in many parts has given him a very mixed liberation from that of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and when the action really takes off, it's really upsetting and dramatic, without even really needing to be bloody. The characters are at par for this type of film, although more likable than some, and the villain memorably. Photography and suspense are the real winners of this film and prevent it from always being boring (as has been suggested). I strongly recommend this to serious horror fans. Don't expect gore, expect a gruesome backwoods story with several fantastic moments and a fantastic dreamlike environment.
