Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinematic experience of all time: 1) It's a visual Odyssey that can only be told on the big screen. The special effects that brought Kubrick his only Oscar are the most surprising effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to provide an accurate (or at least the most accurate) representation of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as an accurate science, but also adds to the atmosphere of the film (to be discussed later with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the lunar scenes before the Apollo landed is a gritty but rewarding move. Many said that at its original release, it was a favorite "journey" movie. I can't think of any other film that has such extraordinary graphics for its time and all time (I'm sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's style of direction is fantastic. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as a means to deepen the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other big ones, like Scorsese, but he sits and watches the narration. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic films, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the faces of the characters to give the audience a psychological point of view. Even he uses the extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red observer to show the coldness and determination of the cyber criminal. I could go on, but in short, Kubrick is at the center of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most evil characters in the history of cinema. I fully agree with the opinion of the late Gene Siskle on HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crew are isolated between the earth and Jupiter, with no place to escape. Combine this mood with the cool and calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the scariest villain imaginable. I still, despite having seen this film several times, I feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) The controversial 2001 final always takes people away from this film. Instead of trying to express my opinion on what it means and what my idea of ​​2001's meaning is in general, I would like to discuss the fact that the ending is used to leave the film indefinitely. Kubrick said he intends to make 2001 open for discussion. He left his meaning in the hands of the spectator. Respecting public intelligence, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on the past, present and future of man. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending does not have to mean anything profound, it can only be a purely plot-based explanation and the whole film can be seen as a fun journey through space. No other film, except the great Citizen Kane, is open to discussion like 2001. It is really meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but also the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.
