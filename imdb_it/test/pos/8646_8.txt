After two brief scenes that at first glance seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired beauty, obviously rich in the back of a limousine. His driver stops in a strange position on Mulholland Drive, a winding and wooded two-lane road full of buildings overlooking Los Angeles. Just as his driver and another man in the passenger seat turn to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction crash into the limousine. Only the dark-haired woman survives. He heads along the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in the apartment of a woman on vacation. Shortly thereafter, Betty (Naomi Watts), the woman's niece on vacation, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark-haired woman, who now has amnesia. Most of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark-haired woman tries to figure out who she is, because people are trying to kill her and because she has thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with strangely surreal discussions about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of thugs and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> The above might seem a bit complicated and disconnected, but it's not the half. The film is constructed so that the meaning is always open to interpretation. It is basically guaranteed that you will not understand this movie and you will not have much confidence that it will come to your interpretation the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience with related films - like Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you might not understand it second view, either. The studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director David Lynch write "10 clues to unlock this thriller" and put it on the back of the chapter with the insert in the DVD. Being Lynch of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a long time to figure out which parts should be "real" and in some sections there is a complex nesting of flashbacks, with only contextual clues that are flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But is the film worth seeing or is it worth a try? It depends on your tastes, of course. On a superficial level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and excessively bumpy to some viewers. But those qualities and many other surrealist aspects of the film are typical of Lynch. A first moment Lynchian is the old couple at the beginning that smiles bizarrely, almost as if they were alien people trying to put a front. If you are familiar with this style and you like it, here you will find much to love, although in many ways Mulholland Drive is quite underrated for Lynch. It is also worth noting, for viewers who are mainly interested in this or having as much fun as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a rather smoky lesbian scene. It is not free, even if I do not have problems of gratuitousness, but it is instead an important hinge in the film. <br /> <br /> Like all Lynch films, it is easy to remain enraptured in its unique approach to every aspect of film art and its attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "armchair students" / "film buffs") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it Lynch leaves nothing to pass without being manipulated. Includes bright color schemes (like the plethora of reds and pinks) with an important symbolism. It makes an unusual use of sound, like the telephone ringing in the section of the score that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in a multitude of bizarre ways, like his characteristic breaks. Let his strange and surprising sense of humor, such as the name "Winkie's" pass, and the "Hot Dogs - made for Pinks" sign which provides a clue to some of the color symbols. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important and subtle clues in the film to help one unlock its meaning. Interestingly, Lynch apparently requires DVD programming to be unusual - there are no chapters on the disc; you need to watch the movie in real time or go back and forth quickly to get back to particular points. <br /> <br /> If surrealism and the veiled meaning of the film are interesting to you, or if you're just fond of "puzzles", then it's worth seeing Mulholland Drive for this. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad and generalized level. I won't tell the standard interpretation here - it's worth researching, but only after seeing the movie a couple of times and reaching your conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written about the film and the interpretations; there are also dedicated websites. <br /> <br /> For my money, however, although I generally love Lynch and find many interesting things about Mulholland Drive, it's not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have a feeling that my score can still increase in subsequent displays). For me, however, the "twist" aspect of the film is definitely better in other works like The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive for its surrealistic surface touches, but the plot doesn't carry them beyond some of Lynch's other films. <br /> <br /> Again, Mulholland Drive is definitely recommended for the right crowd. If you are serious about the film and don't care about having to think about what you look at (as if those two didn't necessarily coincide), you shouldn't miss this.
