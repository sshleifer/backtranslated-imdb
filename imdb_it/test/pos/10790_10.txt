Never having seen an Oliver Stone film before, or a film with Eric Bogosian, I didn't know what to expect from this film. After playing with the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a supplement with a Sunday newspaper and was very impressed. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Barry Champlain, a radio host who can be incredibly rude to his callers, often putting them in their place before they understand what is happening. Although this is what made him a popular radio show host, he also received numerous enemies. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film was really impressive with an actor not dude. Eric Bogosian is as brilliant as Barry Champlain, the condescending radio host with Alec Baldwin who performed in a strong performance as Barry's boss, Dan. He also presents the voice and cameo aspect of Michael Wincott (the reason I want to see him ). <br /> <br /> The story was really well written because, despite his arrogance, you feel for Barry more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone as it is engaging and, above all, real on numerous levels, two of which is that it was inspired by the life of a real radio host and the fact that you actually receive hosts radio and callers, such as those present in the film in reality. <br /> <br /> High recommendation and 10/10. <br /> <br /> Aye yours, Cat Squire
