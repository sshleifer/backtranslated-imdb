Something that I think some people lack for great science fiction is that it predicts part of the future. No other theatrical film that I can remember predicted that when the space shuttle went to study Halley's comet, a disaster would occur! Some differences were: the "Churchill" (the shuttle in the film) actually went to the comet, the "Challenger" was only in low earth orbit; The "Churchill" was simply burned inside, while the "Challenger" exploded - hey the vampires had to return to earth. A great similarity (and this is always a misfortune!) They both have mixed male / female crews - the legend of Halley's comet and the disaster continues! <br /> <br /> In addition to this there is not much more to say about this film that has not been said before. As an outdoor space / science fiction / horror / porn film individually it has not provided anything really new, but like all great dishes it is the combination that counts. And taken together, this was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just hope Mathilda May can drain her victims through another part of the body!
