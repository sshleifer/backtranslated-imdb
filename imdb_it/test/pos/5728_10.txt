I'm a physics student myself, and I have to say that I think this is one of the best "popular" introductions to the string theory that's out there. The Elegant Universe manages to make the whole topic of string theory (even if in reality M) accessible to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Some programs of "popular scientific disclosure" believe that the best approach is only to throw the public in at the end, throwing technical jargon at them without even an explanation, and presenting the theory in a style boring, stale. This program goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the problems that must be solved between the two in order to have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both large and small scale. <br /> <br /> I suppose some might say it's slow and takes too long to get to interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: it's against the point. Explaining string theory from the beginning is almost impossible without at least mentioning the physics behind it, and the way it is explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and fun. <br /> <br /> If you like this program, it depends on whether you are willing to be initially stunned by some of the ideas that Greene presents: extra dimensions and spacetime deformation are not exactly prevalent in everyday life, are they? But, if you continue with some of the more exotic concepts in this program, you will find that it will give you an idea of ​​the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you're studying physics, well, it's great entertainment and you will probably be able to follow it and appreciate it even more!
