There were about 60 different movies and TV shows, in addition to the classic work of this story about a crazy sex girl and her unlucky soldier lover. This story has been made many times, in various ways. <br /> <br /> Vicente Aranda directs the screenplay adaptation of Joaquin Jorda from Prosper Merimee's classic novel and game. <br /> <br /> This is the ONLY story of The work of Bizet Carmen <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and the ability to guide simple men to do terrible things . Leonardo Sbaraglio is the unfortunate soldier who is trapped in Carmen's poisonous net and has led to bad things. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the Prosper author who tells this story. <br /> <br /> There isn't much action, BUT there are some very hot sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Actually this is almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> since I saw this story so often in so many I was not very impressed. <br /> <br /> It is a very well made film and it will be interesting for those who may not know it, <br /> <br /> My not too enthusiastic review could also be that I miss the fantastic Opera soundtrack of Bizet. <br /> <br /> See this how you might like it more than me. <br /> <br /> Classifications *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
