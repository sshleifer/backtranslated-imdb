'Identity?? . . . . They are part of what surrounds me and I have become separated from them and is able to clearly make these differentiations that allow us to have an identity and what is inside our identity is all that has ever happened to us' (Ntozake Shange qtd in "Fires in the Mirror" "). <br /> <br /> Pieces like the Decalogue V used to intimidate me. I felt that if I had accepted them, I would have compromised something. What I thought before is not really worth the trouble come in. I understand what naturalism is trying to say, I have experienced tangible katharsis, and one that has come into fragmented existence, and one that is still alive, with which I still have to deal with. It is still working within me. /> <br /> The film was not funny, per se. It does not need to say that the death penalty is a bad thing. There are certainly evil people: whether or not they should die is for another film. show the Decalogue is that there are good and beautiful people that I kill no other people when their society and their primitive urging raise them. <br /> <br /> The "science" of naturalism is what helped me to appreciate the Decalogue V. It is not worth writing in the space so I wouldn't let myself be done before, but now I see the value in making art in this way you "make" people, or perhaps to make people do something. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's compromise. . . light. Much of this meaning makes sense only a posteriori. This should not be too strange an idea: after all, how much respectable science acquires no meaning in retrospect. I see when I say it, but naturalism seems much more productive and much less nihilistic when I have the power to say to myself: "this ruin, this process, this natural process, makes me want to ruin the system". <br /> <br /> I don't think Naturalism is painting an apocalyptic portrait of humanity, telling us to give up our powdered wigs and go into the woods. Instead, I think it's cataloging tests and experiments, which we are, of course, free to ignore. We can ignore all we want if we want to give naturalists more bodies to bury. <br /> <br /> For sure, despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy for the probable and catastrophic fate of their characters, they are passionate about the reader's inaction and writer snobbery. I see the delicious risk in the hope that the public will understand what needs to be done with what they see. As has been said, there is danger in seeing their destiny immortalized in stone without hope. There is danger in the hope of despising the Natural because it does not correspond to their view of the world. <br /> <br /> And I don't think the "hopeful" should be both rich and lucky. I haven't seen it, but it seems that the American Beauty movie proves the inadequacy of circumstances as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics and wolverines and beggars who wonder where their humanity is, that they complain because they can't find anything that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be portrayed powerfully and beautifully, but in reality the landscapes are not decided. They change, certainly and dramatically, but only from a large set of natural laws that nobody really has power. But it cannot be changed by itself.
