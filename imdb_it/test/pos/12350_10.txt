One Dark Night has a typical teen horror movie with a unique twist. The ultra-meditative soundtrack and the gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere add great importance to this little film it offers. Meg Tilly is excellent as "Julie" and guides us through the maze of the mausoleum, giving a sense of foreboding and solitude. The other boys are equally effective in their roles as Melissa Newman, the definitive heroine of the film. The special effects are excellent, even if dated. This film is very neglected, but could be good in such a way that it is never spoiled by endless sequels. There is a great dark magic that flows through this film; once exploited, you really take it and have a little fun. The double-disc DVD is available, although the original negative could not be found to restore the movie. Perhaps one day he will be found. I guess somehow the specks of carbon in some parts help the film by giving it an old-school respectability and making it more unexpected in the end when suddenly there are many effects. <br /> <br /> The second disc has a raw / alternative version with a temporary version of the film that gives more explanation of the disappearance of two of the girls, very Poe-ish ("The Cask of Amontillado" comes to mind in a new way!) Furthermore, great final tension that enters the dark crypt that opens. I'm not sure that he had the punch for the audience of the main stream, but it certainly worked for me and extremely disturbing ... besides, there's a documentary production that's interesting because it provides information on what was happening at that time with the actors, the crew, the director and the writer; candid material, then current logos, discussions of shots and scenes, tests. Very unique that this stuff exists for a small movie back then.
