I took it a couple of times on TV in the late 1970s. He performed only late at night (past midnight). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a kind and happy man, whose face is disfigured by a fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and full of despair. It turns into a life of crime and eventually becomes a great success. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! He tries to go straight for her ... but he can't escape his criminal life or his hatred of his scarred face. <br /> <br /> A B movie without a budget. Very short (runs just a little over an hour) but well done and superbly performed by Lorre. This has much more depth than you'd expect from a Quickie B photo. In particular, Ankers takes on the role of ungrateful "girl" and makes her character fresh and engaging. This has unfortunately disappeared from the TV and has never been put on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM showed it recently and it was nice to see the movie still locked. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
