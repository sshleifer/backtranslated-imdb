The mere presence of Sam Waterston as an Indian is enough to put this film in the category not to be missed. It is both beautiful and very thin, without lines. He is tender with his kidnapping, yet we can see that he is among the most proud of all the young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a stupid hen who decides to challenge Waterston (White Bull) for a splendid white horse. Other sub-plots are really useless. I don't understand the part played by Caroline Langrishe, like the poor girl that White Bull kidnaps ... I don't know how she keeps her hands away from this beautiful Indian! It's a lot of fun though; especially if you are a fan of Waterston. Friend, this looks good !!! The role of Harvey Keitel is not even worth mentioning, to be honest! But, rent it and have fun! Actually, I think if the soundtrack was better, it would have been a more dramatic film ... the music is so ugly, it's distracting. Still - there's Mr. Waterston!
