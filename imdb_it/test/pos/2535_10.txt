The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about Brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and have to steal and kill to survive. In fact the main character (Pixote) was played by a street boy of only 11 years. What follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and terrifying films I have ever seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "Black Orpheus") and I never forgot it. I don't think I want to see it again, it was too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER NEXT !!!! The scene that will not leave me is when Pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her fetus. You don't see her doing it ... but you have a quick look at what she discovered. Almost 20 years have passed and the memory of that scene upsets me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The film becomes more brutal as it goes on and ends the only way possible. What is all the more heartbreaking is that stories like this really happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and they are STILL happening today. <br /> <br /> A brutal and heartbreaking film ... but it should be seen if you can handle it. I'm surprised this got an R score - I've seen films classified as X that are less graphic. A 10.
