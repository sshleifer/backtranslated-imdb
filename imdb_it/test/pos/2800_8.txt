"L'Auberge Espagnole" gathered the public wherever it was shown. He has collected public awards at many film festivals around the world. And it's not strange. We have the opportunity to see a cheerful and surprising work of art. And it is wise by the way. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is a very funny comedy about youth and growth. But above all it concerns the lights and shadows of living in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is a French student of economics Xavier. For his future carrier he is sent for a year to study in Barcelona. In Spain it turns out that the lessons are taught in the Catalan language. This probably does not help increase knowledge. But it helps to tighten relationships within the group of foreign students. Especially if they rent a large apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, as well as three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Even our French boy will arrive. A year is a very long time. Long enough to get close and make friends. And you know some European stereotypes as you try to break them. <br /> <br /> Klapisch deals with this special case of a process of unification of Europe with humor and without a pungent caption. It comes from the idea that young people are the same everywhere. They like jokes. They like to do irresponsible relationships. But they do not neglect their aspirations. The most interesting is the sum of experience of this small community. They live together in the fire of everyday activities fighting with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans return to their countries to live an adult life alone. It is Europe's hope to combat the many problems of the Union. For example, the terrifying administration system. In the end they show that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences. But now they too like living the fullness of life. And they won't let you take away that full life.
