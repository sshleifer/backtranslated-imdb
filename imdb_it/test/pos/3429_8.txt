... and this film easily exceeded my expectations. The fact that it is written and directed by Peter Dalle led me to believe that it was in style with other films that I'm used to (and bored) to see it. Anyway, I reluctantly went to see this movie and I'm happy for it. This stuff has humor and depth. 9 out of 10. See!
