Miles O'Keeffe once again takes on the role of the powerful Ator in this first sequel to the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - This practically represents B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the script is terrible, the acting is all hammam, the special effects .... well, we don't even go there! - All in all this film is a real treat! <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film include Ator and Thong (his mute companion, not his undergarments) attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (surely saved on the budget fx there!), Ator fighting that which must be the most unconvincing giant snake ever engaged in celluloid and, of course, the infamous hang-gliding scene! <br /> <br /> There is a question I have, however ... at the end of the film we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator presumably destroys the Geometric Core (as the narrator tells us) .... as ... the devil Ator destroyed it and can you get out of it alive ?! Did you model some form of primitive timer / detonator or something? <br /> <br /> Oh well, such an illogical ending does nothing but add to the film's general appeal - it just doesn't make it that way anymore!
