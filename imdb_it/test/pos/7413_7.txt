He didn't have many aspirations for this film, but he was pleasantly surprised. The very well done film, very well cut, does not really reach the height that Human Traffic did, but it is a great effort. Well directed, and I thought the main actor had given a superb performance! In fact the only really bad performance of the film was from Tim Curry, which should be the name. <br /> <br /> Cool Film was surprised that it hadn't done better than it has. I had never heard of it until I saw it at a friend. <br /> <br /> I am not an idiot, but I imagine that people will really like this film.
