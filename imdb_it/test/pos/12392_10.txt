François Truffaut, Young Jerk of the "Cahiers du cinema", the main bastion of the so-called New Wave, made a great show of hating this film and even accused him of dragging French cinema into mediocrity. Translation: Truffaut, who had been repressed sexually repressed, was already jealous of the way Carné could get a huge success out of a story that pushed all the right buttons of his audience and actually involved her in something important with all the traps and the seduction of sensuality. In other words, where the general public and many critics saw a perceptive sociological analysis wrapped in a beautiful film, Truffaut saw "Girls on the Loose". <br /> <br /> Carné, after all, had everything that would have been seriously absent from the New Wave: intelligence, refinement, humor, a great talent as a narrator, a great ear for dialogue, a brilliant technical brilliance, the ability to make his actors do what he wanted them to do, and a good dose of good taste. In comparison, Truffaut is a provincial reamer with nothing to say. <br /> <br /> The tragic 1950s remake of "Pride and Prejudice", the French response to "Rebel Without A Cause", an updated version of "Children of Paradise", "Les Tricheurs" tells a story of disaffected young Parisians who have lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and lack of respect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics have perceived Carné's grip on the subject as the moralizing inclination of an "elderly person", while I think that what happened, on the contrary, is that Carné is gay and knowing a thing or two about repression, he felt an unspeakable sympathy for the young iconoclasts in his history. Furthermore, since it is a French film, it cannot be wrong that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that had yet to be decoded in American films such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One". <br /> <br /> The young people of Carné are all extremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. They drive the latest Vespas and the right cars. The cutting of clothes, clothes and duffle coats was the highest point of the fashions of the last century. Their haircuts are still plastered on the wall of your local hairdresser. Their bodily form, which they have achieved and maintained without effort, is still the modern Western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. Do they know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love ?? even if the pill has not yet been invented. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined and live by the band's code and their heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love. The only thing wrong is that their elders don't talk to them and vice versa. The episodes depicted in this film have made people talk for a long time about many languages ​​wagging their tails in France of the amorality and nihilism of youth, while they continue to make it a huge public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This film is so elegant and Stupendous, I suspect that the older viewers who watched it wished they could be like the people represented in the film and some young directors or aspiring directors like Truffaut developed a bad case of jaundice that reflects why they could never have made a movie so sexy or popular like this, even if it would be very good at aiming at the end for the nihilistic pieces. On the other hand, given a certain cliché aspect of the script (amorous misunderstanding that leads to a medical emergency), one can only marvel at the horribly pious and puritanical mixture that Americans would have drawn from the same basic script if they had dared to face problem. subject. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the film was shot in the same places as the American musical "Funny Face" a year earlier. Where Hollywood has seen the picturesque aspects of the Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné has returned its tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
