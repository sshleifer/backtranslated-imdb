Tromeo and Giulietta is perhaps the best modernization of Shakespeare I've ever seen, not that there is much competition, but still ... <br /> <br /> All in all, Tromeo and Giulietta is certainly one of Troma's best films, one of the little pearls hidden in a pile of dung. It is a funny film, full of action and gory about the greatest love story in the world, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as possible except in this type of film. Well, except for the finale, where Tromeo and Juliet kill Juliet's violent father and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their horrible mutant children. <br /> <br /> THIS is the film school literature courses should show instead of having poor students read hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare scripts. Thumb up!
