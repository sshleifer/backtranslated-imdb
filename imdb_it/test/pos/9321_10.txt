I really enjoyed this movie. I found it very funny for me as I feel that it has captured the romanticism of Irish-American culture of the last century. There are no messages. There is no violence and there is no explicit sex, just a healthy 1947 style entertainment and Dennis Morgan had the chance to sing some really good songs. A really beautiful film.
