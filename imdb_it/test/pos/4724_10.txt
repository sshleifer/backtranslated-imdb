I had never seen such a powerful story film. I discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel prize thanks to this masterpiece of cinema. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything. <br /> <br /> A great lesson of courage, humility and life. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen anything good since. <br /> <br /> TE Saturday 9 January 1999
