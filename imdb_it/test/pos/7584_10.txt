Horses on Mars is a captivating animated short film that takes a sometimes comic look at the evolution process through the eyes of those who have not yet evolved. The story is personal, sometimes sentimental, and is supported by a strong animation and digital storytelling that involves the viewer in this science fiction story. I was lucky enough to see this short in widescreen format at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and I have to assume that once transferred to the small screen, it will lose part of its ability to attract the reader to the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.
