Latter Days was a very moving film for me, it showed how hard and disrespectful the gay community is. The film etherizes true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters, the film has a real depth of compassion for the gay community, because it really speaks for the gay man / woman. Personally, I think the time has come for the homosexual community of all religions to no longer hold their heads in shame, just because they are there in themselves beautiful. The film opened my eyes, unable to believe how anti-homosexual this world is. Even in schools, if a child does not like something, they will call him "gay". I really hope that other films like this are made and that they are not only labeled as a "Gay" movie but as a love story, since I believe that gay directors should make themselves and tell their story through their eyes.
