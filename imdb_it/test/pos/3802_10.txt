This must be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen in a movie. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to be, but that doesn't matter. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. Packaging and marketing make it even more so because you * know * that many times mom has to reprogram her baby to accept our reality after checking that something from the video store expects something completely different. Look at the roadmap first! And where else in America can you see a ten-year-old boy swearing what he does and then have your rival Zed's pervert by Pulp Fiction take his eyes? And that food inspector scene is the best! The amount of well-known actors vaguely recognized in this film is one of the best things about it: soon, much sooner than you realize, you too will find yourself saying, "Is that Meat Loaf? Is Drew Barrymore? The doctor Star Trek: Voyager holideck? Is that Flea? Is the Twin Peaks sawmill owner dumping squirrels with car exhausts? And isn't this guy from Rob Zombie's new movie? He looks very similar to Shrek. "I think my favorite scene is at the end, with Phil in a complete cast. I mean, please, why aren't there more films like this shown on planes? This director hardly has anything else to do with his highest name of Return To Salem's Lot, but in this creation he shows the real man-child genius stumble! If you are an intellectual looking for something to pass the evening, I highly recommend this film for satisfaction. The plot of this film is too ridiculous, but imagine that it is out of context: * an arm wrestle that struggles with a too aggressive Meat Loaf, which seems determined to remove its anger so as not to be accepted in Guns N Roses, look beyond his shoulder and sees Voyager's doctor enters the bar * Can you imagine what any half-brain surfer channel active in the last six years would have thought to see it? Now imagine if you really care about Meat Loaf or Voyager to begin with! Or imagine if you are a fan of fleas. Fans of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this film contains remarkable music, mind you, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does this mean for you? This is the inverted and retarded-sister-mother-puppy Mongolian cousin of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus's sleeve returns to his arm in a masterpiece of special effects quality with wired access? When I saw this film, it was at the suggestion of my cousin who had looked half of it in a half-dead infancy in the first half of the nineties and who has since been obsessed with vague memories of it, I myself had not slept in three days. He made me laugh! Of course, it's also an anxiety movie. The music does not encourage suspense but eventually reaches the point where it was fully established that the American Censorship Committee has obviously lost this film entirely and absolutely nothing can happen in it and it will probably be at any time Gus turns a corner or the view so much how much the camera angle changes. I found myself obsessed with the possibility of those cards flying out the window at any time. Watch this movie Outstanding!
