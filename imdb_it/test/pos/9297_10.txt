The chaser war on everything is a weekly show of the guys who brought you CNNNN and the tracker decides where each week the 5 hunters and Firth break down the problems we didn't know were important. <br /> <br /> This the show goes beyond the simple satire of politics and television not being afraid to take the mickey from anyone, whether it's a counter-girl on the subway or even the prime minister of Australia and although this may be a familiar reason for American television it has never been so well executed. <br /> <br /> Chaser's war on everything is the smartest, funniest and most entertaining show on Australian television and if you haven't seen it you owe it to yourself to give it a watch.
