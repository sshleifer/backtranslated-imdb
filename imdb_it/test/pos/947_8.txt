First of all, you should only watch it if you don't mind the lack of subtitles, pornography, vicious sex and total, horrible and truly shocking depravity. I mentioned vicious sex, but to call sex in the second part of the "extravagant" movie would be an understatement. It's more like a punch in the face if you're not prepared for this kind of illness. That said, I can review this morbid piece of pseudo-snuff genre brought to us by our Japanese comrades. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be fairly simple, almost non-existent: a girl is hired to perform in an amateur porn movie. Don't expect much in the first 30 to 40 minutes. There is a dialogue - if you don't speak Japanese it doesn't mean much to you - it seems to be an occasional chat between the girl and the crew and the performer, then there's porn (straight sex), and after the scene is over, the artists and the crew take a break. And then ... it starts to happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that the girl has started performing in another scene - this time tied to the string. The abuse begins: whipping, slapping, hot wax ... In the end, the girl breaks and cries. They untie it. <br /> <br /> Then we see artists and crew members sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except for the girl. She is visibly shaken and seems to want to leave. He walks to the door, sits on the floor to put on his shoes ... and this is when hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> She is hit in the head with the baseball bat, her wound is treated, she is tied to the bed. What follows can be briefly described (I'm not going to ruin everything for you) as rape during dismemberment. Think of "Flower of flesh and blood", mix it with porn and you'll get the idea. It continues for about 20 minutes. The SFXs are very good, even the trick. Everything is shown, without mercy for the viewer. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Q" was a very sick movie. After seeing "Niku daruma" it seemed like a fairy tale. This film is so sick, so depraved, so twisted, so disgusting that the harsher words pale in comparison to its ending. Too bad it's only released on VHS so there are no subtitles available. But the film still works without them. So, if you're suffering from ulcer, extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre, take a look at this. I hope you won't have nightmares. 8/10.
