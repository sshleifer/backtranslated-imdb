This is not a life-changing film; it's not an epic, or something like that. But it's fun and it's fun. It is a film that the whole family can watch together, and at the moment there are few films suitable for children who do NOT have a love story in them! He tells a good story in a carefree way without trying to impress the audience with exaggerated special effects, like many films of these times. It has a pretty good acting, and all the music that has been used fits quite well with the content of the film. Even the acting is quite good, the actors seem comfortable and credible in their surroundings and, above all, the jokes are actually funny. I would recommend it to people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :)
