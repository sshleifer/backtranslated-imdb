Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, this story has all the suspense of a good book or movie about the cold war while a multinational group of foreigners tries to take Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria. However, three things complete the story, making this film extremely good. <br /> <br /> First, the actors use the real languages ​​of their roles. Russian soldiers only speak Russian; the Hungarians were only Hungarians; the Germans only German, except to the minimum extent to tell the story. Since Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English, and, of course, Yul Brynner and a few other essential elements of history also speak very accented English. As a result, public empathy for travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit frontier when he fails to understand any of the languages ​​spoken around them. Very powerful feelings are aroused in the public, and despite the heavy use of foreign languages, the public is never at a loss to follow the film. No subtitle is needed. <br /> <br /> Second. I was in Hungary in 1995 and, I'm telling you, this film is right. From gypsy music that oppresses dinner to underground caverns in buildings where much of the action takes place in the village scenes, realism is incredible. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie, I ate at his double. I thought that I actually walked along the main street of that village. (Actually, the film was shot in Austria). <br /> <br /> Third, and most importantly, this film brings together Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them while the story takes place is nothing short of qualified Oscar. Of course, Yul had already received an Oscar for playing that report, so Acadamy would not have given him another, but this is the quality of the film. Don't miss this.
