Family Guy has been hilarious for so long, but it seems to me that he lost his sharp and casual humor at the start of the sixth season. Although I liked Blue Harvest, it seemed that the remaining episodes were "enveloping" - episodes in which the producers made a small attempt to satisfy Guy Guy's reputation in American social satire. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the episodes of the seventh season and I was completely surprised and happy that Family Guy has found their true colors. Season 7 offers a lot of fantastic episodes and with many jokes about current situations in America that is exactly what we need right now - more fun. <br /> <br /> I feel that the Simpsons have lost the spark together, this show, however, has made a formidable recovery from going down to show how perfectly satirical they can be. Good job!
