The wind and the lion are a wonderful moving film. It is a monument to what was once cinema, but it is no longer. <br /> <br /> Connery, despite the dense Scottish pattern, plays the Raisulu very well. Inspires the viewer in a way that many main characters cannot. <br /> <br /> Candice Bergen, in one of her first roles, is as wonderful as the kidnapped socialist lady Mr Pedacaris, who shows courage in the face of adversity (and a lot of humor as well). A wonderful film, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.
