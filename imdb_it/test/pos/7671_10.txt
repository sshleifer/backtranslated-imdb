I found this film one of the best for this age and era. The cast was exceptional and a lot of fun for everyone who saw it. I wish my younger generation had seen this movie, but I have not been able to find or see the film in the past. My first vision came back to the early 1960s and I've been looking for it ever since. The film showed me the potential of how far we come to become a talent for a trade where we could only have meaningless roles to act like buffoons and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess showed part of the urban life of my neighborhood as I saw it when I needed good solid male role models. Singing and acting made me jump for days, playing the role of different characters in this excellent film.
