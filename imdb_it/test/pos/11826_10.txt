And I don't understand why the show gets so strong. I think this show is really excellent. Well, the first two episodes were not great, but at the time of the third episode it takes a strong boost. That seems to be typical for a Steve Moffat sitcom. I would rate it among the best sitcoms Britain has ever produced. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best, it is not along the lines of Fawlty Towers, but you can surely classify it as a black Adder, a mate or the young! I'm watching the first season, and all I can say is I'm glad I bought the DVD! <br /> <br /> The problem probably with this show is and why it was hit so hard, according to the Internet, that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers, and everyone was disappointed that it wasn't! Well, even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is clear your mind of any prejudice, give at least one show (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself! <br /> <br /> All I can say is thank you Steve Moffat for writing it and thank you for the whole staff that pulled it off!
