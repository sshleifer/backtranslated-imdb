Because of his predictable second-rate title (at least the one distributed in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this film. I thought it would be another cheap movie about a haunted house ("THE CURSED HOUSE" means "the cursed house"). Well, I had to change my mind immediately after the first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and disturbing atmospheres reminded me a little of The Exorcist and some of his decent Italian scams, but this would have been something completely different ... This is more like Hitchcock meets the Italian thriller! Very well written and direct, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I tried not to spoil the vision of "7 Hyden Park" for you, which I highly recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I wrong, or when Joanna crawls or tries to stand up (she is paralyzed from the waist down) her feet and her legs move a little too much? (... And I'm not talking about the "bad dreams" sequence).
