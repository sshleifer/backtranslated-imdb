The BBC and HBO have collaborated to create "Dirty War", a 90-minute TV movie about a "dirty bomb" terrorist attack in London. The film quickly gets to work as it encompasses both the terrorist and the government's anti-terrorist efforts in the film, leaving little room for subplots of human interest. From the point of view of the terrorists, we follow the bomb of radioactive material smuggling, from assembly to deployment to detonation. From a governmental point of view we see PR exercises and training, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response and follow up. The film also conveys the feeling of how al-Qa'ida-type terrorist cells are organized, the radical Islamic terrorist mentality and terrorist strategies. A sort of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "Dirty War" will answer many questions lurking in the mind of an audience that becomes increasingly aware of this insidious threat. (B)
