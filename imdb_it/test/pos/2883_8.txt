I liked this movie and, once finished, it still makes you think. I think Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role even though his acting of "death" was a bit exaggerated, but like Jeremy Brett I didn't mind. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of drama and you follow the Oscar Wildes novel very closely. If you like this movie, I suggest you also watch "An Ideal Husband" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This film offers a complete view of Oscar Wildes thinking. And as you look at it the viewer is remembered as in a certain sense Dorian Gray is the "bosnia" of Lord Alfred Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde.
