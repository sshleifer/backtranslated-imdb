MICHAEL from 1996 is hot and successful in the fantasy comedy that presents one of my favorite performances from John Travolta's library. Travolta offers one of his most cheerful and cheerful performances like Michael, an archangel whose quiet existence at the home of a lone hotelier named Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is interrupted when Pansy reports Michael's presence in his home to a "National Enquirer "and the publisher (Bob Hoskins) sends journalists (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to take a look. Hurt, McDowell and Pastorelli are quite as good as tired journalists who have difficulty accepting having met an angel, but this is Travolta's show and he rules like the paunchy bun, who eats sugar, smells cookies, Loving, lover of Aretha, pursuer of bulls Michael, an angel who is not what you think of when you think of angels. And you must love the bar scene when he and the ladies dance in "Chain of Fools". I love this movie more and more every time I watch it and it's mainly due to the completely winning performance of John Travolta.
