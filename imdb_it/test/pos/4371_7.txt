George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw so many of his specials and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. He had a certain cynicism that always fascinated me. His last 2 specials (life is really worth losing in particular and complaints and complaints) are devoid of a certain spirit and content. George appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention exiting rehabilitation). "I HAVE NOT SAID TO MENTION"! Anyway. Life is worthy of being lost was particularly tragic because he was overweight, unhappy, out of rehabilitation (here we go again ...) and extremely little fun. If there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without disgusting him from the stage, George reached him with the life that is worth losing. It's like New Millennium and Post 9/11 America were trampling on George's spirit. The bs had become too large to be managed. <br /> <br /> The return is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This special is the transmutation completed. George is no longer trying to rekindle his glory days. He is in full acceptance of his age, is old and takes care of the impending prospects of death. He has agreed to be an old crusty SOB and is enjoying himself. This is better than his special precedents, yet far from Jammin 'in New York. It's a little tragic. His remarks are no longer avant-garde and seem more like Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is no longer George. He is no longer criticizing us but he is the man in the high castle who indicates how things were and how modern life is different. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two specials, but George has not yet recovered his old glory (if ever). It has been reduced from critical political and stinging comments mostly to personal problems. When he goes political, he still has something to say. It is strongly derived (especially if you've seen some of his previous work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to his random talk that lacks some relevance outside the baby boomer generation. The last 25 minutes are the best this special has to offer. <br /> <br /> For now I will worship the Sun and will pray to Joe Pesci that George can recreate himself as a seventy-year-old vanguard. It is a 50/50 possibility. Life seems to have become more boring for George and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials, but he is far from his old self. Where does it go from here? It may never recover, but perhaps it can further metamorphose / perfect this new routine of the old individual. Here is hope for another 7 words that you can't say on TV or at least a windmill that you can handle.
