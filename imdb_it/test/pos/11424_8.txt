Stan Laurel, it was noted, first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of famous films in the 1920s. Surely he proves to be an excellent comedian and performer here in "Mud and Sand" (a parody of "Blood and Sand" by Rudolph Valntino), but I think a film like this really works not because Laurel was a great satirist but because it allows public to enter the comedy already familiar with the situation and the scenes. Laurel can then go wild with her inspired gags without having to create context or do without it. I saw him the day after seeing "Blood and Sand" himself; surely it has improved the experience to know what was parodying and where. <br /> <br /> The scene where the character of Laurel (rhubarb Vaseline if you believe in tags, or Vaselino rhubarb if you believe how her name is written on the blackboard) sends her mother home with the money, with a makeup for two by two, fun on its own because it is a great gag, but it's more fun if the viewer is aware of how he is letting out the air of Valentino's extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother all the luxuries he wants . <br /> <br /> This is Stan Laurel's best solo work I've ever seen. It's simply fun, even more so if you've had the chance to see the original material.
