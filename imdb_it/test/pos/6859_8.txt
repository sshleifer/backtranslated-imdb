I was going to use "The German Scream" as a summary, but this had already been taken into consideration. The anatomy is well summarized. As long as you are no stranger to reading subtitles, Anatomy fits perfectly into the Scream / Urban Legend package. It is a film set by adolescents in a medical school where students are disappearing and then appear as experimental subjects in the dissection laboratory. Guess a brave student who is investigating himself and discovering a giant conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Provided you are watching the original film in German (I cannot comment on the dubbing, not having seen the English edition) Anatomy is abruptly written and skillfully traced so that the tension does not give up never really. Compared to its American counterparts, the mystery is discovered much faster, which means that instead of being a slasher until the final revelation, Anatomy evolves during its execution time from a slasher-like-body horror film to a thriller intelligent and exciting. It's a thrilling ride from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> An affectionate greeting also to the actors involved. Franka Potente proves once again that she is a smart and intelligent actress who can bring any role to life. His central interpretation as Paula is a great basis for the film to build from. Ghostly teachers and their pet teachers are equally good, a truly disturbing presence at all times. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising that the film does not drag much. The pace is fast and punchy, very similar to the previous Urban Legend, which means there's always something to do to keep your attention high. If there is a disadvantage it could be that some will find Anatomy too creepy for them, but if you persevere through the first semester graphic dissection sequences, the second part with its exciting thriller tones will reward you. I recommend Anatomy to anyone who enjoys good teen-horror, but is a little tired of the American approach to the issue.
