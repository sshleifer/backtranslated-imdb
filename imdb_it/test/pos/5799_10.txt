It is difficult, today and in the United States, to understand this film. We really have nothing to compare it with. Here is an attempt at comparison: it is as if during the last years of Saddam's rule, a director in Iraq was somehow able to make a film, which, for the first time, showed life as it was actually lived in that country. The life of the normal girl, with all the terror and full-scale repression. So the film was exhibited freely in Iraq. If you could imagine that unlikely event, then you might have an idea of ​​what happened to this film in the last years of the Soviet Union. Prior to this film, Soviet cinema was highly censored. Soviet films would only show an ideal life in a workers' paradise. Then suddenly this. Alcoholism, random sex, the ugly desolate land that was the Soviet city, suffocating pollution, the victimized proletariat and each other, absolute desperation - it's all there. People were stunned. Soviet women often cried during screenings. Many would say that this is the story of their lives. It was a cultural earthquake like the one the directors dream of realizing. It has undoubtedly accelerated the break-up of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Reading the reviews here, I see that few understand this film. One says it was revolutionary because it contained real sex. For Soviet spectators at the time, sex was a minor event compared to the fact that it represented reality for the first time in Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current films like "As Good as Gets". He could also compare Homer's Illiad to the latest John Grissam novel. Simply don't compare. This is not just a film, this has been a social document and a changing social force. It must be seen this way or you will not understand the film. <br /> <br /> The other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional Russian family. It is even said that it is difficult to feel sorry for Vera because she keeps coming back to her family. The point is that Vera and her family are symbols of all Soviet life. There was nowhere else to go, because the family at the bottom of the block and in the neighboring city were the same. This was life in the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can be seen on several levels: as a drama traces the landscape of despair, as a social document shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and as a moral document it shows the evils of an out-of-control dictatorship and the cruelties that the victims will exert on each other. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly shows the human balance sheet that socialism eventually takes on its victims, despite the good intentions the system could have. In this way he helped to end the Soviet regime thus contributing to one of the main changes in modern history. This film accomplishes what only a few films have ever made. It is not only a splendid representation of history, but also becomes a force in that molded history.
