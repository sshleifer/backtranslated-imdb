I remember seeing it a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no details, so I'm glad I saw it again, from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). Basically the new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) has just won the Oscar for his latest film, where he plays a gay soldier, and makes the usual "thanks", even mentions his English teacher Howard Brackett (Golden Globe nominated ) Kevin Kline), and he excludes him as gay! Howard is determined to erase his name and break out of the media spotlight as a homosexual homosexual, especially when his marriage to Emily Montgomery (nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe Joan Cusack) is coming. So the wedding day comes, and when it comes to Howard saying yes or no, it's when he comes out and admits to himself and to everyone that he's gay. This of course gets him fired as a teacher, but everyone gets their day off to go out alone (in support), and Cameron shows up to clarify things, so that everyone, especially the head of the school Tom Halliwell (Elf's Bob Newhart) know it's okay to be gay. Also starring Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds as Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley as Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara as Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the film must be when Kline can't help but dance Diana I's version of "I Will Survive", which must have been what convinced him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprise Oscar nominee, and all of the supporting cast members also play their part in this very funny comedy. Very good!
