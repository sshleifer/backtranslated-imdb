From the last horrible film by Astérix and the fact that we only got the Swiss German version in the cinemas, here I went to see it with a bit of trepidation ... In the end, how happy I was to discover ^ ____ ^ <br /> < br /> The film is fun and modern, it has nice gags, good animation, fun interaction with the characters, a good vocal cast (Note: I can only speak for the Swiss German!) except for the boss's daughter by the Viking Abba (his name is fantastic, despite the uninspired actress) ... I particularly liked the character Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German. He is the young man who should be put into shape ...) . It is a very funny portrait of a mollycoddled urban teenager; but he is very nice, despite the adolescent mannerisms ... XD The interaction between Astérix and Obélix and their young charge is fantastic and very funny. <br /> <br /> It shouldn't be compared to old movies, since this one is quite different ... Which surprisingly doesn't make it bad. Rather. When they tried to modernize the last film (twelve years ago), they completely destroyed it. This film, however, has shown that it can be done well ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I left the merry theater ... Always a good sign ^ _ ~
