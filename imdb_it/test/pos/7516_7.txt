George Scott gave an entire life interpretation in Paddy Chayefsky's THE HOSPITAL, a very dark drama about a big-city hospital in old age and a middle-aged doctor on the brink of suicide. Diana Rigg arrives as a free spirit determined to save him from himself. Their dialogue crackles, and it is clear that they are made for each other from the beginning. But will she save him? Their unique sex scene is both graphic and memorable for his passion and fury. Meanwhile, the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who don't want it to turn a condemned building into a cancer center. And a serial killer is free in the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. A good part of the film, however, is focused on Scott. How it should be. What difference did a few years make when this film was made. 1962 had given us THE INTERNS, an antiquated revisitation of the DR. KILDARE with a terrible acting and a cardboard script. Long came 1971 and the HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood has done something right for a change. Watching THE HOSPITAL today is a reminder of how many medical shows like ST. ELSEWHERE and SCRUBS owe this lasting classic. And if THE HOSPITAL reminds you of NETWORK, it should. The same scripter.
