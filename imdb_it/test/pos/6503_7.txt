This film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, especially the turntable, as was the case with the director before starting this film. It was nice to have the focus on the bay more than expected, because NY has always had all the credit, but from the bay the worship of Q-Bert is a little out of control. This film did not introduce anything new for me, but it changed my opinion that entering it I was a bit approximate on the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a tool in good faith. This film should convince anyone that is right there with the viola and the clavichord.
