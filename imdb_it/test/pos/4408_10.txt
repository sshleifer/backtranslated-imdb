I must have seen it on television when it was first broadcast some decades ago. I thought it was brilliant then, and if I remember so much now maybe I would have been right. While I live in and around London I can't define myself as a Londoner and I don't know him at all well, who does anything other than taxi drivers? Once the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men who try to learn the seemingly unlearnable and to rise to the status of demigods, so the rest is pure joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally different and so differently influenced by the events of the film. Don't think this is a documentary - it's pure drama and The Knowledge is one of the characters. I've never seen anything like this movie before or after. Watch it!
