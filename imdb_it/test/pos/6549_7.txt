I saw Uzumaki last night and immediately recalled two of Peter Weir's first films from Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. They were movies full of atmosphere, but short of real horror. Uzumaki, for me, seems clearly influenced by these films. It has a number of fairly trivial scenes that become more portentous, the more deeply you are sucked into the film. He also has more scenes of pure horror and although I don't think that the film is actually up to those two films, it's worth the time of the most attentive fans of the unusual (not necessarily the horror). 7 out of 10 seem fair, but I have to say that years after seeing The Last Wave the film stays with me, and it is the unsolved ending of Picnic At Hanging Rock that makes it so disturbing. post scriptum All the people who criticize the acting ... pullleasse ... in this genre?
