This show is perfect for many reasons ... The father and mother can communicate with their children of this age. It's so nice to see a real family instead of an exaggerated family. I saw it once and was hooked. It's so nice to see a black family on TV that is worth watching. This show started too soon, but as it was released it was pregnancy, sex, drugs, bad dates, death, etc. The best thing about the show was that it treated him in a really humorous way. Great show for the family .. I can't tell you how many times I raised my head to watch this show late at night sometimes and laughed out loud. Great show on pg 13. I loved the environment of this show.
