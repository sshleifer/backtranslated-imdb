Ettore Scola's masterful interpretation of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. It is a worthy successor of the Risorgimento classics such as Senso and Il Gattopardo di Vischonti, as well as Vanina, Vanini di Rosselini. The nineteenth century is indeed a fruitful source for Italian filmmakers. Period settings and traps are beautifully crafted here, but the story is timeless and could occur at any time. What is so intriguing in this story is that the hero remains trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself the object of vigorously persecuted desire and is powerless enough to extricate himself from the alarming circumstances. Beautiful and hardened Giorgio (Giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but carefree married lover (Antonelli) and falls victim to the dangerous passion of the fascinated Fosca (D'Obici), the ugly and sickly daughter of his severe commander ( Girotti). The resulting anguish and the consequent tragedy that this unlikely couple suffers make them both understandable, pitiful and immensely supportive of the spectators. The stellar performance of Bernard Giraudeau fascinates and leaves a lasting impression. Not to be missed.
