A wonderful film ahead of its time, <br /> <br /> I think so, in the eighties was it about winning, greed is good? Do you remember that? I have seen this movie more than 20 times, for me this is a real desert island movie, I keep watching because there is always something to learn about these imperfect characters that I love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin, they are simply wonderful, Even Beverly D'angelo, Beau Bridges come in second place, don't get me wrong there are many other great shows in this film, and it's also the way it is written that he did for me, and I hope you, a movie you would like to see more and many times, I think of TV shows like "Northen Exposure", and now "Earl" owes a lot to this film. but remember it's not a Tom Cruise movie.
