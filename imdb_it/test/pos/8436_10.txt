This film is definitely Fonda's best film. The Plot is fantastic, the acting is incredible and the direction is incredible. An all-time classic, this should have won the best non-kramer image. Kramer. Although he was not even named. Even Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are at their best. One of the best endings ever. If you haven't seen this movie run don't walk to rent it. It should have been in the top 100 of afi. Look at it not only for Fonda but for everything. <br /> <br /> **** on **** 4 on 4
