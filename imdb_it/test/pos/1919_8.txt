This is an excellent documentary on a story I had never heard of before. The first regatta of solo races, non stop throughout the world, took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of runners. It's a really fascinating story about man against nature and man against himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure of this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with shots that were taken by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. The story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details of Donald Crowhurst's story. This is one of the best documentaries of recent years. It has a real human emotion as men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world on their own without stopping.
