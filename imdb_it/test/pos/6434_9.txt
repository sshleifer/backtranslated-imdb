Co-directed by and starring Rutger Hauer, this short film is based on a story by Dutch writer Harry Murlisch. <br /> <br /> In the 10 minutes of the film you will see a life like 'Harry' reveals its long-term appeal with a room that passes constantly in youth. Returning to the city many years later he discovered he had rented the same room. <br /> <br /> Using the film in black and white the textures are accentuated in this delicate story of a story. The voice of "Harry" that draws you into his world. <br /> <br /> A subtle and narrow performance by Rutger Hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. Wonderful soundtrack by the Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> It is currently difficult to see this film as it is only available on DVD region 2 "The Infideley" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus track. But it should be on the new DVD of "The Hitcher" - another very tight but very different performance from Hauer! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can!
