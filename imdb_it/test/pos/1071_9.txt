First of all, I loved the documentary. It represents a new school history / theory in which a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical problems. <br /> <br /> First of all I will remove camera and dogs. I hate the Blair Witch quality of the camera, but I also understand the advantage of such a casual approach. In fact, I agree with the other reviewer that gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dogs: Attention, I have a doctorate in literature that does NOT use as a profession, so some of my training courses can filter: dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of great human efforts and our need to find the job to reach them. Dogs may reflect their owners, as suggested by a reviewer. But they also serve as a substitute for the workers we see in the film. While this may suggest the Marxist problem raised by a critic, I think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues. No, Mondov√¨ in Italy may not even translate elsewhere. (Ouch! I am a Marxist in my heart and I hate to hear my cynical resignation take control!) It is a remarkable bait and switch. Dogs are family, workers are familiar. But in the end the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor peasant). Although you may disagree with politics, the art of analogy, combined with the film's more obvious policy, are wonderful. Only Faulkner (I am from Alabama) had the power of the film beyond the Hollywood market, which interesting stories would be told.
