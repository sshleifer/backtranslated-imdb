I hope that, from his place in the comic throne of heaven, Spike Milligan can see and enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy took a book that the author himself said by writing "almost made me mad" in a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Irish city of Puckoon and the problems that struck it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic was drawn up, opening the center of the village and, more worrying, through the center of the churchyard. This means that some dead, buried in the Catholic churchyard, are now in the Protestant north - and so the local priest, assisted by a great variety of local eccentrics, proposes to move the bodies back under cover of darkness, thus avoiding the bureaucratic British border guards. <br /> <br /> The work for the cast of Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes was inspired to play the part of Madigan. He brings innocence to the part, especially in his chamber pieces (which is usually where he interacts with the voice of Richard Attenborough, apparently interpreting the film's writer / director). Daragh O'Malley who plays Father Rudden also deserves considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from familiar names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people with what would normally be called "unusual parts" - like Spike's daughter, Jane, who plays Madigan's wife give 100%. The merit of this goes, in no small part, to the wonderful characterizations given by Spike in the original book. <br /> <br /> I could argue that the film is a little too long, or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent left something to be desired, but those would only be minor points and will not detract from excellence of this movie.
