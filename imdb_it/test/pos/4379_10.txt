This film was tremendously good! It was fun! There are so many jokes that you can simply watch the movie over and over again and never tire of doing it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were as fantastic as Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love those guys! I love the adventures that they too have done. I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the music of this film is exceptional! I love singing along with all the songs!
