This is a really dark film. Noir indeed. The title character is smallpox, brought to New York in an unconscious manner by Evelyn Keyes. <br /> <br /> He is on a mission when he arrives and lasts longer after talking to his no longer innocent sister. But she herself isn't intentionally a murderer. This does not mean that he does not kill. This does not mean that his presence somewhere between eight million other people does not throw the city into turmoil. <br /> <br /> Keyes is excellent. The supporting cast is also very good. There are many little-known people involved in this - the director included. Don't be delayed. It is a film that should not be underestimated! (And how nice to see a picture of Columbia: Columbia and Republic have produced wonderful comedies and noirs, but we almost never see them.)
