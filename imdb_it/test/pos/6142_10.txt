I like the previous description of this film as a poem of life. I took it completely at random on the cinema channel last night, and I was fascinated enough to follow him all the time. There is really only one truly unique voice to the film, a narrative poem that is meaningful without getting lost in claims. There are also many hilarious moments from Wirey's middle school days that are crude without being humorous. It is sad that this film is so low. The fact that there are so many numbers 1 makes me think that the numbers are cooked - I can't see how anyone can see the movie so abysmal. Of course, this is not at all a typical romantic comedy, but it is a truly unique point of view of a truly unique life, of a man whose charm comes from his detachment, a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him. Give this film a chance. It came out of nowhere for me, and I feel richer for it.
