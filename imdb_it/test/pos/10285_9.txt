In this tragedy romantic comedy aimed at the character, we are given a vision of the intertwined lives of thirty-year-old Parisians. At the center is the portrait of Max by Vinz Cassell. A star-eyed Romeo, falls madly in love with the beautiful unknown Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his best friend, Lucien (Écoffey, in a discreet but effective performance), he wins his heart and lives happily ever after ... that is until Alice, the obsessive nebula (the versatile Romane Bohringer) is intriguing and intriguing . becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three. <br /> <br /> The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological triumph, and the film emerges as an intricate puzzle, the postcard candy eye-candy in the center of everything. The use of color does not go unnoticed, especially in Lisa's spectacular apartment (presumably taking into account the title of the film), where reds and yellows provoke the fire of passion and lust. <br /> <br /> The public can refer to Max: he really wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by the irony and circumstances for this. In a memorable scene, our predestined lovers (anguishedly separated by a "choreographic" misunderstanding) almost miss the chance encounter that would have surely brought them together. Independent of each other, they travel to the same destination: she on the subway, he in a taxi, practically a tête-à-tête. Yet destiny seems to have it for them, and the public is teased, fascinated. <br /> <br /> The shows in this film are really what makes L'Appartement stand out. I still can't understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. It has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real life at the time of writing) has recently discovered fame in the English-speaking film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind her is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in the classic "ladylike" style, which many British and American actresses reject in favor of the "subtle" approach all too easy. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch this movie! I doubt you will be disappointed. It's compelling, satisfying, fun, sad, lavish and an art film class.
