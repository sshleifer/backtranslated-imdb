This 1955 robbery film follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, while he undertakes the robbery of his life. He allies with his old robber friends and brings an expert cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed him, directed only because he was blacklisted as a communist in the United States and could not work in Hollywood. ) The brilliance of this film is the half hour during the robbery. During all this time, there is no dialogue and there is no music, only the muffled sounds of digging through the floor or piercing the safe. This increases the suspense and attracts you. They tear apart hundreds of millions of francs of jewelry, but a jewel offered to a dancer by Cesar brings their ray to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. They decided to take the escort for themselves and bring bad luck in their wake. Great robbery / gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's films in this genre. <br /> <br /> This film is like a lemonade I had last night. I had gone to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar. It also had a lot of ice and was heavy on lemons, leaving it quite acid (which I like). Sugar cane juice gave it a subtle flavor, slightly softer than the real one, and the ice made it cool and refreshing as I sucked it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
