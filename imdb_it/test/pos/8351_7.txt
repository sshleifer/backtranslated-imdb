* minor spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know, it's coming to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation could also be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These sequels range from the excellent ("The Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and the fantastic "King Leo II: The Pride of Simba") to horrible ("The Return of Jafar"). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel. "Scamp's adventure", and although imperfect, it's still fun. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animations is not up to the Disney Feature Animation; however, the animators do a good job in bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged for a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and "Ol 'Reliable", and Jock still gives him pain. There is a good fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the kennel, and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic protagonists (although it is very doubtful that this will become a classic scene like his predecessor.) < Br /> <br /> I don't care much about most of the songs (though Roger Bart and Susan Egan - the singing voices of Scamp and Angel - they sing their parts very well). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done a much better job in the past. Danny Troob's score is ok, but nothing memorable. And some members of the landfill gang seem to be excess baggage; that is, they really don't do much. <br /> <br /> Vocal work, on the other hand, is quite good. While I don't like Jeff Bennett like the dog catcher, he is very good as Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a good job as Buster, leader of the junkyard band, and Alyssa Milano gives what could be his best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of his father). He is voiced by PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a great job of showing Scamp's wild streak and soft side. <br /> <br /> All in all, while "Scamp's Adventure" is imperfect, it still makes the vision pleasant. I hope, however, that Walt Disney Television Animation will devote its attention to more original material for their future versions. <br /> <br />
