This is not what could be called a happy story. The main character titled (Edmund Purdom as the Egyptian) does not get the girl - although obviously (?) Get the last word, the otherwise main tragic figure (Michael Wilding in the role of the politically myopic Pharaoh) ends tragically, and the wrong guy ?? even if he is Victor Mature, he ends up winning - all the marbles. Probably Peter Ustinov got the best part (Kafka) and probably could have stolen a little if not most of the film, except Jean Simmons, the most brilliant of the average bartender (Merit), who maybe has more ball? intellectually and spiritually, of all the rest of them put together. <br /> <br /> The brooding and pessimistic Sinuhe the doctor (who is Purdom) is portrayed as a dark, cynical, tortured soul that spends the entire plot ?? his life, looking for the meaning of "Life". (Btw, and to paraphrase John Lennon, "Life" is what happens while you are making other plans.) Forgive the lack of philosophical depth in the previous parenthetical commentary, but in the end the plot takes place to reveal just that! <br /> <br /> And speaking philosophically, as if things were not dark and negative enough, John Carradine (like the homonymous thief) appears in a cameo in the middle of the film that exposes that "Life" fundamentally it doesn't make sense and it's worth living only as a bad alternative to the eventual final disappointment. <br /> <br /> So here are over 200 words and I didn't really have a kind word, so why the hell did I rate it so high? Well, there is a lot of Shakespea tragedy and a lot of moral value in it. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, sincere and unrequited love, and - despite the limits of production capacity in the 1950s, it is very well staged, pleasing to both the eye and the ear, and very well balanced. Is acting, for the most part, uniformly very good ?? since it is a costume drama in the 50s, and the interactions are credible to the fatal flaws of the characters - which abound, and in this they do justice to the best of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> Is there any redemption, Sinuhe discovers and embraces her son ?? played by Tommy Retigg who, despite Ustinov's best efforts, really needed Lassie to make it. Do a couple of other "wrong" souls get their sweets? the "foreign" fleshpot Nefer (Bella Darvi) ?? apparently in Egypt for a carnal exploitation of the study-work visa, which previously cruelly ruthlessly also rejected Sinuhe - and - Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney as sister of Pharoah Wilding) who knew a deep dark secret about the lineage of Sinuhe, and then I tried to use it to put it against his friend, his brother the Pharaoh ?? nice people, eh. <br /> <br /> Purdom's performance is actually something to look at. The whine is taken away well enough that somewhere before the end of the goblin one wants to slap him through the puss, grab him by the collar and say "look mannequin get together, the glass is not half empty is half full!" And then discover that you are personally disappointed by Horemheb - Sinuhe's real best friend, (Victor Mature as Pharoah's Top Soldier) for himself who has that flaw in his character that prevents him from being able to do something positive. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the secret of the whole film is that it reaches very quickly and then supports the necessary "suspension of disbelief" and makes you understand and worry about the characters, worrying to the point that you really feel sorry for them and their missed opportunities for happiness; a happiness that otherwise was not so far from their reach. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this hasn't already been released on DVD and I hope it gets corrected soon.
