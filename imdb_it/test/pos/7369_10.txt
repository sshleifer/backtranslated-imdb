This film is about a group of four friends who destroy a car while driving. They build a bonfire to get the night and wait for help. To pass the time, frightening stories are told. Telling this would ruin the film, so rent it and have fun !! <br /> <br /> I will say that it starts a little slow, but every story gets better and better. This film features the participation of some of today's most anticipated actors, Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you can see that there are big stars of the name but not the biggest ones !! GO the rent or buy it ASAP! This movie is fantastic !!
