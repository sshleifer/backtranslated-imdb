I've seen this movie for a while and can't find it. Does anyone know where I can find it? I feel it's worth seeing it again. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that I had never heard of Chloe Nicholle until this movie. Yes, she can act. When I started following this film, I exchanged it for another of his films, Sex Spa. The plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I saw Dru Berrymore. I looked for some of his other films and it seems to me that she's better as a blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is a good introductory film. Not too soft Not too hard. You have to start somewhere.
