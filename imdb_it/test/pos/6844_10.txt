Of course, there are things that Coens and Elmore Leonard have done before, but then? If you want to entertain, lustful and intelligent - "Judas Kiss" is almost perfect. The prostitutes offended by the tongue on the porn pillow do not understand it (she talks about getting your sex and violence out from one side to the other - she keeps your investors happy. This is independent cinema 101). As for the British who make a package, I strongly doubt it. This film is clearly a labor of love and the budget is probably not half of Mr. Tarantino's salary. Maybe kids don't like it as much as women do. I thought it was crazy. Go to Coco!
