ATTENTION: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This is written for filmmakers who may have moved away from "Mood for Love" perplexed and confused about the paths that the main characters choose in life. Reading other comments and reviews, it seems that many viewers and critics have lost some very important details that may have prevented them from enjoying this delicious movie treat. <br /> <br /> We are so used to seeing brazen SEX in narratives that we forget that there was a time when filmmakers would have suggested "the dirty deed" simply by showing couples with a tight mouth riding in a sleigh or in a flying cart only to return to the next scene with a protruding gut or a fat child attached to the hip ... "Meet your child". <br /> <br /> The director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of Mr Chow and Mrs Chan. Last warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> Mr Chow betrays Mrs. Chan in showing her true emotions when they feel her departure forever. Next scene: Ms. Chan puts her head on Mr Chow in the taxi and says "I don't want to go home tonight". Translation: "Let's do it" <br /> <br /> So why didn't the couple do the modern thing of unloading their deceiving spouses, get a divorce, raise their child love and live happily ever after? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong in the 1960s. A bastard would live in a sad life of shame if he were the son of an adulteress, while a "legitimate" child could live a tragic but noble / honest life if his mother chose to raise him from his "scam" father - the invisible Mr. Chan. In short, Mr. Chow and Ms. Chan sacrifice their relationship for their child's future. That's why Mr. Chow, after learning that Ms. Chan is living alone with a child, smiles knowingly and ends her dream of making Mrs. Chan her Mrs. Chow. Then he also understands why Ms. Chan went to Singapore to be with him, only to reconsider at the last moment and leave ..., choosing to never see him again. (But not before taking some unnamed memories) Mr. Chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to say. No one except a ruined temple wall and of course we the viewer, ... but only if we listen carefully.
