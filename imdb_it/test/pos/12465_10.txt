..specially by Lambert. This is the essential Tarzan of Burrough that I grew up reading as a child. I read some negative reviews about this film and couldn't help wondering what their problem was. Obviously they didn't see the movie I made or expected something more like Saturday afternoon's serials. <br /> <br /> This was the Tarzan that was of the novel and the directors should be applauded addressing the source material and taking it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. This was a film in which it shines. <br /> <br /> The photography and the monkeys, made by Rick Baker, were both fantastic. You've definitely heard the jungle since. The 2nd semester, Tarzan's attempt to be civilized really brings you into the emotional conflict that he was forced to resolve. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie
