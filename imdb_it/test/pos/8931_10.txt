Well, my father drove Lee Evans back and forth to the hotels, so I got to see some facts. It's a brilliant movie! Bob Pugh passed a shed with a lawnmower and accidentally let go and went to a fence and fell. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said: you are cold, I said Yes and he said Well, you hit your hands in the pockets! I think it was really fun and it will be a well-known comedy. Like every other Lee Evans movie! They were really fantastic people. they seemed polite and funny enough. I'd like to meet them again someday. Brenda Blethyn came out of her trailer with the blood down and twigs in her messy hair and I got really scared because I didn't notice until she was right behind me
