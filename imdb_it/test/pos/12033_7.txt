I found parts of this film rather slow, especially the first part; the second part seemed to go much faster, but it is not entirely clear to me why one part was faster than the other. I somehow managed to find it pleasant. The acting was good, the writing was good (yet vulgar). There was also another positive side: it was easier to understand what to say, the Godfather movies. You knew who was on his side, etc. All in all, the film was not bad at all.
