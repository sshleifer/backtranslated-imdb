"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey not only in the mind of a serial killer, but also in one of the most talented directors. This is decisive proof of what can be achieved if humans release their uninhibited imagination. This is boldness at work, putting thoughts aside to fall into formulas and clich√©s and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best film of the year to date. <br /> <br /> I have read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere, from any style and without substance, to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to lose the point. This film could be a reference point, a tradition in which it is hoped that future films will follow. "The Cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in her face and tell her and her director Tarsem Singh we don't want anymore? Personally, I would like more than welcoming another Tarsem film, and I'd like to see someone challenge it. <br /> <br /> We have all heard of entering the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a bit overloaded with work. The 90s were full of films that tried to describe what makes serial killer ticking; some of them worked, but most failed. But "The Cell" does not explode in the same direction, we are given a new turn, we are physically transported in the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever studied. <br /> <br /> I like how the film doesn't bog down us with too many scientific jargons that try to explain how Jennifer Lopez can actually get into someone else's brain. Instead, she lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped in what appear to be long Twizzlers and started in another entity. "The Cell" wants you to "see" what it is and not "how" it's all, and I think that's what some people don't like. True, I like explanations with my films, but when a movie ventures into new terrain you have to allow it to do what you want and simply take it. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the film was very dark when it showed reality, perhaps to counteract the luminous images inside the brain of another. Nevertheless, the set design was simply amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie brought home some Oscar in film, the best costumes, the best director and the like. If it depended on me, at least he would have been nominated for the best photo. <br /> <br /> I noticed that I repeated myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic the thought of "The Cell" was. If you enter the film with a very open mind and you take it from the wonders and a mind-blowing party then you are assured of a good time. I guess this movie was a bit too much for some people, calling it "weird" or "crazy". I'm very interested in the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was right in my alley. Coming out of the theater, I heard a member of the audience say "Anyone who made that film did a lot of good drugs". If so, I want the one who was smoking. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)
