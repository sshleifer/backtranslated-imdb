I can't understand the need to jump back and forth on the set of scenes and to plot the plot. Demonstrating that someone has a skill before using it, I think, is offending our intelligence. He's starting to feel a little forced, and as if they were making up for having been so vague about the first three series. A little disappointing in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also, using the quirks of the past, like Locke's ability to know when a storm is ending, is frankly offensive ... should we ooh and arr, or laugh at softer side of Locke? <br /> <br /> This episode was everywhere.
