Every year you can't miss the long-awaited big-budget title with the right combination of star, director and subject who fails miserably at the box office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982 it was Blade Runner. In 1957 it was The Spirit of St Louis by Billy Wilder, a film that had it all - the best director, a huge star, the true success story of an American hero - except a sufficient audience to cover his costs. Perhaps the public still remembered the antisemitism of Lucky Lindy and his strong admiration for the successes of Nazi Germany before the war (nor covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend became too blurred). Perhaps because they thought they knew the story or that it would be a boy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Wilder and co-writer Wendell Mayes certainly are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively quiet flight, which alternates between a well-executed flashback structure and key points in his life and the creation of the flight itself. Once the film is in flight, it is both surprising and full of suspense, it finds a real drama in its attempts to stay awake and to navigate without adequate tools. <br /> <br /> It also builds a remarkable sense of terror that is unlike anything else in Wilder's filmography, allied to a true sense of the epic: shots like the threatening storm clouds above the crutch, the dark dawn before the flight brings them a real thrill of presage. Even the typical silent and problematic WarnerColor adds to the film rather than diminishes. Next to the superb use of CinemaScope, there is a remarkable soundtrack by Franz Waxman: majestic, slender but full of threatening threat, and cleverly used as part of the film's fabric rather than as a simple musical accompaniment. The film loses points to imply, although it does not actually say so openly, that this was a race to be the first to fly over the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third man to fly across the Atlantic after almost completely forgotten Brits Alcock and Brown incredible flight eight years before - but it's still an incredibly tense and thrilling adventure story that deserved the success he never found.
