Mani sir as usual pulls out another incredible story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an extraordinary relationship between parents and children is carried out in a beautiful way. Hands Sir as usual without many special effects and not many outdoor shots. (In fact this was the only film in which he ever went out of India ... even just for Sri Lanka). The class of Mani is written throughout the film ... and to add to it the music of ARR ... which is simply incredible ... Vellai Pookal is one of my favorite songs of all time ... Maddy, which is what he is in the film industry, he has impressed a lot too. From alaipayuthey, from kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru .. Mani ratnam has shown the world that Maddy is a versatile actor. Simran was also very good. He has shown that he can also act in roles that are not glamorous and of character. In all a fantastic film. Sad that the Tamil public could not appreciate this film gr8 and bombed at the box office ....
