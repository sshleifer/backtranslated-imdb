Adapting his novel "Cabal" to the screen, author / writer / director Clive Barker modeled this wonderful story of horror and fantasy outr√©. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man who is suspected of being a serial killer. The policemen shot him down in front of Midian, a cemetery on the surface but in reality it is a refuge for the monsters that have been avoided by society. When they claim Boone's favor and make one of them, this causes repercussions for everyone, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (the very pretty Anne Bobby) and the dubious psychiatrist (a very funny David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" shows the kind of wild and twisted imagination that I often don't see in movies. First, Ralph McQuarrie, an old conceptual art expert who worked on films like the first three "Star Wars" voices, helps Barker create excellent images for "Nightbreed", starting immediately with the initial credit sequence. The visual and make-up effects are elaborate and the production design and cinematography are quite impressive. Barker and the crew do a great job creating this whole other world with compelling characters. It is colorful and flamboyant entertainment and a pleasure to welcome. And of course there is a strong sense of social commentary on intolerance and fanaticism, not to mention the heavy consequences that can derive from a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great support performances add to the fun. Cronenberg exudes a lot of malicious intent and is a real gas like the bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a type of antagonist of the beloved hatred, a rather bad police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley, once again, is buried under the heavy makeup of the weary Lylesberg, and is rock solid. Hugh Ross is very funny as Narcisse, as is Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as an added bonus, showing her breasts in a sequence). Even Simon Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two images of "Hellraiser", appears here. There is also a nice cameo from the science fiction star of the 50s and 60s John Agar. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman provides another of his fantastic scores, and Barker constantly guides us through the intriguing story towards a terrifying apocalyptic showdown. /> <br /> "Nightbreed" is an excellent genre film that is worth visiting for anyone who has not seen it. I give him a warm recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
