I never remember reading Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said he saw the movie in class, I wanted to see it too. I borrowed the video from the library and saw it as a family. It was a wonderful story. However, I didn't know until a few months ago that there were sequels. I've finished watching those this week. I discovered a small oops: in the second film, Skylark, Jacob is remembering when he was a boy, and he tells Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I would dream ...". In Winter End, those "brothers and sisters" don't exist in conversations between Jacob and his father. But it is a very small oops, and I only saw it when watching the trilogy, the second time. Great movie, a must see for a good family view.
