When this film was released in 1995, I found it incredibly beautiful. Especially with Sandra Bullock. After seeing his brilliant performance in Speed, I was ready to enjoy all his movies. <br /> <br /> Back to The Net, was a movie that keeps you in suspense. All in all, I liked it so I gave a **** *****.
