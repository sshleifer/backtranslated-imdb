I was five years old when the show made its debut in 1958 and, later, it was a normal spectator. I remember that I really enjoyed the show, along with "Leave It To Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Ozzie and Harriet", "Dick Van Dyke", "I Love Lucy" replies, "The Real McCoys", etc. Now I'm enjoying the first season of "Donna Reed" on DVD and I've seen the first two episodes. Donna Stone proved to be an intelligent, polite, resolutive, serene, homely mother, similar to June Cleaver and in contrast to Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like how Mrs. Reed becomes a surrogate dad, exchanging her sweat suit and boxing gloves while teaching her son how to physically defend himself against a much bigger bully. While none of the mothers in the neighborhood where I grew up, including mine, exactly met the idealistic standards portrayed by Ms. Reed, it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision-making prevail at the end of the day, in contrast to today's accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among their neighbors. I can't imagine that Jeff and Mary Stone have been informed by their parents that transgressing on the yards of their neighbors is okay, leaving a dog out to bark all day is acceptable, or telling the mother to "shut up" in a supermarket of in front of everyone.
