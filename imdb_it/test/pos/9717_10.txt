Unfortunately, every single person I ask about this series says he never heard of it. I remember him fondly since my early childhood (I was not 10 years old when he came out). <br /> <br /> My favorite story was "A Story Short". Something about how the story of the "stone soup" has been woven into a bigger story gives me every time. And then the narrator explains why he doesn't have a story to tell, and it becomes a story itself. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and that's just one of the reasons why. <br /> <br /> I'm adding this DVD on itself with Labrynth, The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, The Last Unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all the DVDs I share with my brothers who are 6, 5 and 4 years old.
