History itself is routine: a boy runs away from home and ends up in a music school for children in need. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is an espionage of over 11 weeks of filming, and leaves many funny holes that the observer can find for himself. <br /> <br /> As much as the mustache of the plot may have been, the film is justified with its music and acting. There is a lot of music, with classical works played by Heifetz and The Meremblum Orchestra, one of the most important youth symphonies of that day, and he said that the music is excellent. In itself, it would make the image worth seeing. The tasks of management and evaluation have been put in the best hands: those of Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> Acting is a study of contrasts. The boys of the orchestra, most of whom had little or no acting experience, must have made director Archie Mayo mad, look into the camera, exaggerate with the parts they had, and obviously following the directions given to them. But the spontaneity that comes from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the photo. The veteran actors were wonderful with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was perfectly chosen in his role, one he emulated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were ideal for their parts. And the supporting acting was a real Who's Who of the leading actors: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his typical heavy role - all ideally expressed. And the bit players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, the grinning Lee Phelps in his usual cop role and many more. If you are a fan of the characters, this movie will bring back many memories. <br /> <br /> Overall, the image is very funny and is recommended, even if you are not a fan of classical music. <br /> <br /> tvcat
