As an American fan of The League of Gentlemen I had to wait months to finally see this movie when it was released on DVD, but it was worth (atrocious) waiting. "Apocalypse" is fantastic - fun, extravagant, clever as hell, full of jokes and cryptic references to the television series; pretty much everything you expect from the Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> The plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so I won't bother to copy it, although I will say that when I first read it I was a little hesitant. Obviously these artificial characters entering the real world to confront their creators - have been used before, particularly in Wes Craven's underrated "New Nightmare" and in Stephen King's "Dark Tower" books (where King himself was a character ). The Gentlemen enjoy breaking the fourth wall, and also add a new element: a second fictitious world ("their days"). Soon all three realities intertwined, and the result is exhilarating: Geoff Tipps was knighted in the Middle Ages (and tried to woo Queen Victoria Wood); the real League of Gentlemen of Royston Vasey, compared with characters like Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner summons a little man outside the church of Bernice. I heard that some people disliked the "King's Evil" subplot, but found it hilarious, especially the character of Reece (who seemed to channel Judith "Witch" from series three). <br /> <br /> Speaking of the characters, I was relieved to find that, although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp had been firmly inserted into the core of the film, other more familiar characters had their duty. Bernice's confessional at the beginning was exhilarating, returning to the faster and more sketch-oriented feeling of the first series. Pauline and Mickey have cameos (no Ross though - strange), although I would have liked to have seen more of Mrs Campbell-Jones. Papa Lazarou is represented, as are Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their meager time on the screen an almost magical feeling (and just what HELL did to dad, like an obscene hairball? According to the DVD comment, a "bribe of greasy hair "). /> <br /> The film looks incredible, but then, what's new? Music, as always, is breathtaking. I was happy to hear the new interpretations of Joby Talbot on theme music and his light reworking of the majestic, delightful piece that closes both "Apocalypse" and the last episode of series three. <br /> <br /> I have some minor complaints - it would have been nice to see more of the old, familiar Royston Vasey, and I felt the stop-motion creatures (nice, by the way) were a bit underutilized. Both of these problems, however, can be justified by the film's budget, so they are understandable. However, as much as I loved Bernice's new church, it would have been nice to see the final battle in the main street (the original vision of the Gentlemen, according to the comment). <br /> <br /> In general, "Apocalypse" is stunning, especially if you are a fan of the series. I can't recommend it well enough. 10/10.
