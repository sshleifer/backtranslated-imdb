From the beginning you will like the character of Sam Elliott (Falon): a reliable cop who is particularly loyal to his partner. But too loyal and too vindictive when he sees his companion dead in an alley, because he then kills who he thought was the assailant before giving him a chance to explain. Falon is an alcoholic, and this tends to influence him from being in self-control, even if he manages to direct his attention towards the search for someone who is really behind the death of his partner. He brings with him a novice as his new companion (who seems to be seen too often in the movies) but Esai Morales is right to accompany Sam Elliot, although the disconcerting pieces begin to adapt to where Morales begins a self-approved investigation against Falon; mostly he wants to find the answers since Fallon doesn't let him enter the whole story, and he doesn't like what he finds. There is no last minute to show who the bad detectives are, which is fine; and are unable to influence Falon in joining them, leading to a dramatic ending. Fine acting all around, with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino who is the detective captain. It's a good movie that will make you want to see it several times; so it qualifies as - must see - and a good addition to a movie collection! (Shot in San Francisco)
