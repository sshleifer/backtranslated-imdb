So Udo Kier earned nine dollars and free food for this, so it's a victory in and of itself. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film tells a very interesting story about a group of rescue guys who meet Demetra. I should warn you, I'm crazy to bounce through this really fast review, so hook up. Starting from the beginning. Coolio plays a boy named 187. 187 like drugs. 187 finds a bunch of coffins on board and ... now I don't know anything about the future but maybe they smuggle drugs into shacks. Don't say that Gunna was the craziest thing about this movie. Later the vampire comes out of his mist-filled coffin and then the real hilarity begins. First of all, although this film contains the word Dracula, in reality it is not in this film. I have a theory though. All of a sudden you see the rescue crew ship leave without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his late brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he will come back right away. Dracula came out of this movie before he could be seen leaving Orlock to play the vampire for about six minutes in the movie. The best part of this film, and for those of you who have seen this, you know what I'm saying, it's after he was born, embraced anything. He has this huge ejaculation monologue in various parts of the body of erika Elaniak and ... other fantastic things. Coolio, seriously you're the best thing EVER. <br /> <br /> Other things also happen in this film. As Casper Van Dean has some work. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then we lost his track FOR THE REST OF THE FILM. And thank God really. We find out that the character of Erika is a police robot. As the film closes, we discover that the ship is en route to the sun. The police robot and another surviving character are doomed. Rather than avoiding certain death Erika's police robot reveals that she is also a bitch bitch and they decide to fuck each other and die. Before they die in the sun, they die for no reason, yes it's true ... their ship explodes without a real reason. <br /> <br /> This film received a surprising assessment for a reason, Coolio. My God, if they gave awards to the black rapper Academy, he would be the first to have one. The only reason this didn't get a perfect ten is because there wasn't a drop of nudity. Now I know what you think, how you can judge a movie if women show their products or not. Well easy A film like this takes a lot. It is part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, cold blood, the end of the film's final shock at the end. It is the formula. This one had some blood, the monster was awesome because it sucked so hard that it actually did us the favor of being out of the camera. This was thoughtful for him and I respect him. Nudity, not a drop even though there has been a long conversation about ... well see the statement above and as for the shock / twist ... I certainly didn't see the end coming. What matters. <br /> <br /> I hope Hollywood doesn't think that Coolio has given this film its all and has nothing left. It deserves more work. Well, up to Dracula 4000, I'm out.
