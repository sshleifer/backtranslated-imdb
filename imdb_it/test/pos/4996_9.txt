What hurt this film is everyone and their aunt Matilda is comparing it to its illustrious predecessor, who will always hurt any show. If you take it like a western, it's a fine specimen. Let's find out how the characters of "Lonesome Dove" end up in situations where they start (for example: why two Texas Rangers, who live in the adventure, end up in a dead city? And how did Gus lose the love? Of his life ?) The performances are very good, and we see exactly the same mannerisms that the characters will have along the way. The actors did a great job. The cinematography was superb, and although the music was not up to the legendary soundtrack of nearly two decades ago, it was an impossible task, and it was still beautiful. <br /> <br /> He also helped us have three episodes, which you don't see in a miniseries anymore. Heck, it's absolutely impossible to see a two-part show these days. <br /> <br /> Western fans, rejoice!
