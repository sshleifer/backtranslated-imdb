I've never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught the first ten minutes of this, I giggled and pressed the R button on Sky +. I'm glad I did !! I hope I don't insult anyone (because after all, the BF and I loved it!) But we couldn't take it as seriously as the actors - especially the obsessed (which, I understand, is a huge Bollywood star because we have it) seen on the cover of many DVDs since then and I even saw one of his dolls today at Hamleys !! The BF continues to talk about this - I'm starting to think he's obsessed! He goes on to say it's strange for the traditionally good to be anti-hero of a movie! But then we like movies that are not your predictable price in Hollywood). <br /> <br /> He was completely over the top, but really funny. If all Bollywood movies are like that, we're looking more. I've had that goddamn song in my head all week and can't speak a word of Hindi! PS any recommendation would be appreciated!
