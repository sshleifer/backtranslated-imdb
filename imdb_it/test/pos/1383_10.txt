WOW !! It's about a movie that divides the audience! This is a true love or I hate a movie. I liked it very much. I noticed that other reviews are comparing Pitch Black - this is a little stupid because the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be really stupid. No, this film is much more common with The Thing (the way people don't notice is incredible - they also have the same basic music) A lot of Carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless full landscapes of death and things you do not understand Perhaps what prevents this film from being a true classic is the deference to Carpenter's other works. No less the Dark Star with which he has something in common. Would I be interested to know how REALLY it costs? $ 8000? It's possible? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost $ 8000? But I found myself strangely moved when the various space guys died. They are so undervalued that it's like watching a documentary sometimes. That being said, the script is rather clumsy and only about half of them can still act and I'm not sure if the great captain is one of them. But his gun is FANTASTIC !! Give him a chance, if you like the first Carpenter you could fall back on it, don't expect 2001.
