Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find Desmond completely wasted. His past traumatic experience before sailing around the island is revealed through flashbacks. Sayid draws a plan with Jack to surprise "The Others" in case Michael is crossing the double-height group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not to press the computer button to see what will happen. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we "Lost" lovers can see the lack of respect that the producers of this extraordinary series have with fans. In the United States, this episode's air date was May 24, 2006. Therefore, during this time, fans must wait for season three in a very suspenseful situation, with Jack and his group surrounded by "The Others" and finding the truth about Michael and the deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby; John has locked himself in the hatch without intending to press the button and Mr. Eko is desperate outside the hatch. I hope the fate of "Lost" is better than "Angel" and its very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
