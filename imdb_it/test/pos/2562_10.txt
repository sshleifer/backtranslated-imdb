I was initially discouraged from renting this movie because of the DVD cover. In fact, this was true for my friends who didn't rent it because of the art and mental image evoked by being a film that held little or no interest for me (or my friends). But, I rented it and looked at it and was really amazed. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments of another user that this film is not for everyone because of obvious sexual inferences, so it is definitely not something I would like small children to watch (and seriously doubt whether understand it anyway). I like movies like this where the character's personalities and who they are are really directly defined, without any sense teasers to indicate that they will go wrong. The acting was ... was he acting? Ricci and Jackson behaved so well, I was attracted to this film without even realizing that they were acting. The same thing with the story ... it may seem a bit far-fetched, but it was done very, very well. It reminded me of another film with Mel Gibson, Tim, in which each character had limits, both mental and circumstantial, so they were well defined. <br /> <br /> I found a lot of depth in this film with the character involved, so feeling that everyone involved (from cameramen to actors) should be commended on perfect adaptation / result. After watching this movie, I talked to a couple of friends who took a negative approach to watching it like I did, so after listening to my comments, they rented and watched. They too were quite surprised at how beautiful it was. Too bad the art on the jacket was made as it was, since it's a shift. Now I understand how art is applied, but I had never heard of this film, and art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales / rentals. <br /> <br /> These characters had more depth for them and good timing was given to give an audience like me time to absorb the "feel" for each one. I felt that I could trust that the film ran well, and so it was. So, with the cover aside, I'd recommend watching this movie.
