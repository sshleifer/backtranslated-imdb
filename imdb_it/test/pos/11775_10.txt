Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (the Foss from here on) has invented a cute and creative trailer totally spoiled by Star Wars. This gem is so chock-full of tributes and gags that it laughs every time! Not only that, when Star Wars did a re-issue with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a parody that will not die! There is a reason why George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he even hired Foss to work on "Return of the Jedi" (don't believe me, check his voice on IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This must be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever made. I think the Special Edition was a bit exaggerated, but if you think about it, I think it's PERFECT for today's re-release of Star Wars, and goes to show that sometimes it's wrong to confuse with perfection. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, cry, kiss $ 3 goodbye! Well, maybe 15 for the DVD, but you'll be really glad you did.
