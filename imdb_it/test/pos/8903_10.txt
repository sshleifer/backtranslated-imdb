Wow! it's even better than I expected! the best animated film Astérix ever! and it seems so nice to hear Roger Carel making Astérix's voice again! I would certainly recommend it to everyone who loves Astérix comics! but I suggest you go and see the French version, because it is definitely the best and feel the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel played Astérix for almost forty years? I think he did a wonderful job! and the song by Céline Dion in the end adapts well to the end credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful ... in a word: a masterpiece! go see it! you will not regret!
