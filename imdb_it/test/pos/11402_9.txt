Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples that any aspiring filmmaker should take a long look at. Sure, you could spend a lot of precious time reviewing the classics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but lets follow the example for the modern generation and studies without enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Where to start, I suppose we can look at the film simply as a story, maybe even a docudrama that focuses on the late 70s of the porn industry and what industry it was! The other half could focus on the incredible detail that a brilliant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester rubber and * ahem *. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no-bul! Shi $, in your face a kind of cinema that I've never seen from the greats of the 70s ... ironic ... or stroke of genius. The story is full of characters rich in details, each of which you can also relate to, love or hate; but the impact is clear: try something for them. Among the characters, the two interpretations that stand out are: Burt Reynolds as director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brilliant, as is Heather Graham ... but if I focus on any actor, it should be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance between comic time and character-driven emotion ... I'm a sucker for the phrase "Have you ever seen the movie Star Wars? ... People say I look like Han Solo." In any case, the look of the film is incredible, the director of photography and director / producer / producer, he invented vibrant colors and a flashy style that compares Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in terms of the perfection of his art); but with the creation of his unique look, and pushing to the limit with the single longest shot I've ever seen ... what is the New Year party sequence. <br /> <br /> Music, as in any great film, is a character in its own right. Sometimes, it is consumed with pain or pain ... but above all it is fun, dance and fun; the spirit of the 70s. OK, back to the shows. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the weight of what the future of the "film" means for its genre. The terrible transition from film footage to recording on magnetic tape. The loss of his art, so to speak ... and the changes of mentality for the people he works with. Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocence and sexual bravado necessary for the character. For all those individuals who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, don't pay attention to Wahlberg's performance in that movie ... rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make! <br /> <br /> Julianne Moore interprets the aspiring mother for all, and with this comes the torment and anguish she feels, while life imitates art; and she loses all her neighbors. Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later keeps it to herself and also steals some scenes from the great Mr. Reynolds. Each character is multidimensional, full of life and played by actors who seem to be perfect for the part. <br /> <br /> The film itself is often fun, tragic, exciting and offers an intransigent look into the fast-paced turbulent lifestyle of the 70s. He makes no excuses and does not tell lies; and offers the public a return trip. But more importantly, the film offers us a great example of how films should be made; and a new director whose daring visions bring art back to the cinema.
