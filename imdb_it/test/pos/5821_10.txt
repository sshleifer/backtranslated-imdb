Oz is by far the best television show ever. Better than the Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Intransigent, bold and deeply disturbing but deeply moving. Oz let us pass any picture of prison that someone had ever conjured up on television. Tom Fontana did a really good job with writing. No argument is taboo. Rape, drugs, murders. Oz is the demonstration of how good TV can be. He follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races, but always returns to your friend Tobias Beecher, in prison for manslaughter. We see what we do not want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will disturb you, it will make you shiver, make you look away, but above all it will make you think. To see Oz is to see a truly magnificent television production
