What can we say about a small film full of secondary actors and without "stars", with absolutely negative performances, not a poorly distributed line of dialogue, and with the cold violence from a part balanced by the warm "heart" of the protagonists of the story ? <br /> <br /> It is a jewel, a diamond, a precious little gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West. A West not colonized by great heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp, but by the spread of the everyday man and woman, farmers and ranch hands, merchants and miners and artisans, whores and bartenders and entertainers of the day, some who look for wealth, some for peace and tranquility, some for religious freedom. <br /> <br /> It is, perhaps, a very spiritual story, although it does not promote any particular religion, since even the non-Mormon cowboys played by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. act in kind and noble ways towards everyone in history. , regardless of affiliation and religious beliefs, and does everything to promote tolerance and charity when the train of wagons runs into people in a spectacle of abandoned medicines. And in true biblical style, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, it is the guardian angels sent to the train of wagons that eventually must face the incarnate and wicked Clegg clan, comparing them to the snake in the Garden of Eden, and regretting what they must do after. It is a sweet folkloristic story of the West that affects all the goals that John Ford targets. <br /> <br /> Today I have a Western Santa Claus whose red dress is covered with a denim overcoat, whose red headdress is replaced by a brown Stetson, which carries a bag of gifts and a coil of rope. To my Santa I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to put in his belt. When people in the office ask why my Santa needs to bring guns, I simply answer, "Snakes!" After all, isn't the spirit of the Christmas season one in which everyone should get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> Fifty-five years later, particularly after 911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and the plot of this film are still as relevant today as they were then.
