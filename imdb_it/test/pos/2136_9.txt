I saw this film only once a quarter of a century ago, yet the impact never left me and I still remember my reactions. I was enchanted by the breadth and beauty of so much photography. I was stunned by the fact that an American studio could produce a European film with its slow rhythm and blurry plot. The lack of strong characters seemed to me a defect, but I was furious about the totally useless ending on the yacht that seemed to have been bolted to give a sort of cohesion of the plot and that was completely in disagreement with the style of the rest of the picture.It is it was also refreshing to see a western that did not pretend to talk about the brutality and exploitation that so often were the unfortunate debris of the American dream. Even the western scenes and scenes had an authenticity that was completely new to me and foreshadowed the recent Deadwood series. The film was massively cut for the American public and it is my real desire that in these days of Director's Cuts to Michael Cimino the opportunity is given for a new montage in the light of reflection - a cut that could transform this patient fake film in the masterpiece that had the potential to become. Now I've seen the first original cut and the network of relationships makes a lot more sense, even if Christopher Walken is mainly responsible for his transfer. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson played the lead role, there was still a great concern about creating reality and atmosphere at the expense of a good script. However, camera work was managed so intelligently that sometimes you could almost believe that you were in the action alone. And there have been many special moments. All those who discussed in the hall in different languages ​​trying to overcome their national differences and to look for some unity of action in the face of imminent disaster gave a true vision of the difficulties encountered by the welding of the United States: especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money. Ella's hesitant approach to Ella when she first visited her cabin was in stark contrast to the violence that followed and was another. I had a special screening with a large group of friends to see the new cut and we all had fun with different reservations. This revisionist version and much closer to the truth of the events was probably too much for the Americans to take when the film was first released, but we all felt that it had enormous merit and that its place in film history was also due to a important revision
