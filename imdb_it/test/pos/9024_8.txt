This is a great movie for pure fun, nothing more and nothing less. It's fun, and a vaguely good movie. <br /> <br /> A minor thing, but still irritating of the film, is that we don't know why Justine and Chas broke. Ok, most early reports don't work for one reason or another, but they more or less looked like a nice couple. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's worth looking at a watch to escape reality.
