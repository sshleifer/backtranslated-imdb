There is no boring moment in "Robe d'Ete" by Francois Ozon. It is surprising how much is contained in this short film. As he lies down on a deserted beach after a naked swim, a young gay man is approached by a girl looking for a light for his cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. Back on the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover her nakedness and asks to return it the next day. Guide your bike to the hut on vacation dressed as a girl. His gay partner is sexually excited. The next morning the young man returns to the sea and greets the girl whose party is over. She suggests keeping the dress as a reminder of their summer romance. It is a carefree film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.
