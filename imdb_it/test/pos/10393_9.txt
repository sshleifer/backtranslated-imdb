Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the strangest film I've ever seen. Not for his Culto appeal, for the blood or even for his ideas, but for the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of the most famous directors in Italy. However, if you gave this film only a quick observation, I mean passively, it would seem one of those melodramatic and often useless novels. This film deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. With cheese I don't mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar cheese! The music seems to come from an Italian porn, the story and the dialogue as if they were a soapy Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious that you want to slap yourself in the head. <br /> <br /> But once you have passed all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. The cheese feeds on the fine shoots and attracts our attention, perfectly, on what needs to be known. The basic plot is four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate with each other. Instead they can only communicate with one another. I suppose this is why dialogue and plot are so trivial, because conversations are excessively irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction is overly melodramatic. <br /> <br /> I left that movie thinking of myself; perhaps all of life is a great melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. I hate, because I'm right. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> So melodrama is actually an existential function. A trivial love story is simply a human interaction placed under a magnifying glass, which allows us to see the uselessness of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
