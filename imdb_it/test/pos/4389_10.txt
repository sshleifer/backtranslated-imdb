They loved it and turned it into a horny toad! God, it comes to mind every time. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. Memorable lines, from "Thank God, your mother died at birth, saw that she died of shame" to "I don't understand, Big Dan". Great scenes, from the opening train scene (rice so loud I cried) to the bluegrass. <br /> <br /> Watch it. Okay, it's great, it's fun and it's based on a famous story. Worth it, believe me. Don't look at this if you have a weak bladder, because you will surely get your pants wet and laugh.
