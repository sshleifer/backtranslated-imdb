Pretty damn good for a French movie. I haven't seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films, so I have no opinion on this compared to his previous work. French cinema usually keeps to the films in the final analysis, and leaves the shoot-em-ups and stars for Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy, since no film industry in other nations will probably have the resources to compete on this type of project. Film production films are often boring, as they have little resonance for people who are not in the business. But this kept my interest far more than I thought. Despite the title, (strangely in English) it is not much comedy, despite some funny moments. I've only seen a few of Anne Parillaud's films, but it shows a generous amount of talent and variety, from the action / psychological film of "La Femme Nikita" to the ironic comedy of "Innocent Blood". This film also extends its range while playing a more or less ordinary woman, yet it is still compelling on the screen. Congratulations also to Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was not familiar. She plays a very expressionless actress for most of the film, whose talent is drawn at the end. If you don't have car chases and explosions to entertain, check this out.
