If you've ever worked as a nanny in a home you didn't know, or if you saw the original and liked it, this will be a good choice. Ignoring the reviews and what was published here, I went ahead and rented this movie because of memories of how the original scared me as a teenager. This film has (obviously) changed part of the original story to relate to today's teenagers, as the babysitter is in trouble for spending her minutes on the cell phone and has to accept a babysitting job to pay the bill. However, it does stick quite well to the original plot. If you can relate to the babysitter, not knowing the house and the usual pop and crack appearances, it's quite suspenseful. When the killer is shown, it is very disturbing and you find yourself yelling at the girl to "DOWNLOAD FROM THE HOUSE". If you've never worked as a nanny or been in a situation like this, you probably won't be able to relate to it and you won't like it. It's about understanding his fear.
