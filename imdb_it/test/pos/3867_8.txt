SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love the Simpsons, and I've seen every single episode that ever came out. I must admit that the first season is by far the most underestimated season, and this is the most underestimated episode in the first season. The episode begins with the family playing Scrabble to prepare Bart for an intelligence test he has to take to school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to do it. Explain a word that makes Homer angry and chases Bart into the house. The next day Mrs. Krabappel reassures the class that the test is not part of their vote, just a test that could tell them what their future would be like. Bart cannot answer a question. He thinks quickly. Quickly switch tests with Martin Prince, the smartest in the class. Later that day Marge and Homer are called to go to the principal's office to discuss Bart's behavior. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the school psychologist arrives and tells Skinner, Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and should go to a special school for the most gifted. Bart agrees to go because he doesn't need to do his homework. The next day Homer leads Bart to the new school. It is presented to everyone and everything. Unfortunately, his day is not very good. Smart students take his lunch smartly, can't read any comics, but he does it anyway, and is criticized by his fellow students. Fortunately for Bart, he and Homer start having fun together, but Marge bought tickets for an opera. They go to work and make fun of it. The next day he goes to his old school but is mocked by his friends. They call it a starting point. While at his new school, Bart is told to do a chemistry experiment. It hurts and blows up the school, leaving you green. Bart was told by the psychologist to tell him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him that he wants to go undercover and return to his old school to watch other children. The psychologist is intrigued and asks Bart to explain it on a piece of paper. He finds it too difficult and instead writes a confession that is not really a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All he cares about is that the word confession was wrong. That night Homer bathes Bart and Bart tells him that he is not really a genius and that he has betrayed the test. Homer gets angry and chases Bart into the house while Lisa and Marge look at them casually. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very underestimated season. <br /> <br /> 8/10
