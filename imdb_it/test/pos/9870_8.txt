... I don't like this movie and everyone will understand why. The plot is poor, as is acting. But in my opinion it is better than Halloween 5, although even this doesn't offer many surprising moments. Some scenes are really well directed. But these few moments do not provide the reason to rent it. I don't despise violence in movies, but H6 presents extraordinary strong and bloody scenes that don't fit into the tradition of Halloween movies. The most overwhelming aspect of H6 is the lack of tension. No comparison with the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But don't expect a great horror experience .... <br /> <br />
