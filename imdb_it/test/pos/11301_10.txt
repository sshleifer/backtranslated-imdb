I just want to comment on the aforementioned woman that the film is crediting Beethoven with begging. In the credits show it. Thank you. I think this is a fantastic movie. They chose the right music for the atmosphere of the film, the animation is wonderful and they chose the voices for the characters very well. Teach children to never give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up and shows the children that they can do the same. The film also has humor in it for all ages, parents and children, to laugh. The colors of this film are fantastic and children can really feel good watching it. I saw this movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan and I'm sure your son will be too. Walmart sells tons of Barbie and Magic of Pegasus stuff, so your son can continue to enjoy it even when he's not watching. Thank you!
