One of the most horrible, incredibly disturbing and gruesome films of horror released in the '70s, "Tourist Trap", even with loose, free-wheeling, defying the "everything goes" conventions the standards of its rhythms of time as a real strangeness. And yet, it is the strangeness of the photo - a mysterious and masterfully mounted atmosphere of pervasive supernatural fear that, from the starting registers, is powerfully spooky and becomes increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses, offering great jolts in a few scattered moments of a surreal dreamlike elegance and end up on a bitterly ironic and overwhelming, nihilistic note, with a disquieting final image that is difficult to shake - which makes it such a unique and singularly disturbing experience. <br /> <br /> Five teenagers traveling through the desolate desert of California by car get lost irretrievably. They come across "The Lost Oasis of Slausen", a shabby, ruined dive, which is a service station, a museum of cheap wax in three parts, and all the broken and presumptuous parts. The solitary, seemingly friendless and harmless owner of Slausen (succinctly exaggerated with bout infected by Chuck Conners) turns out to be an unbalanced psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers. Slausen brings his extravagant assortment of human-looking mannequins to life and gathers the children one by one so he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims. <br /> <br /> Director David ("Puppermaster", "The Finish") Schmoeller cleverly tears off every last gram of tension he manages to squeeze out of the pleasantly ambiguous and open script he co-wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (The stubborn refusal of the script to provide a rational excuse for all the bizarre things that shines through the film, often wrongly criticized as one of the main weaknesses of the film, is actually the key strength of the film, giving the image the scary, all-and-all-can-happen, the common-being-damned quality logic of a real nightmare coming horribly to life that would never have been reached if there were some sort of credible explanation offered for what's happening.) Pino Donaggio's beautifully chilling, unobtrusive score, Nicholas von Sternberg's dark cinematography, and the dirty and cramped production design of Robert A. Burns add immensely to the film's deeply disturbing mood. The excellent performances are another advantage, with Jochelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"), particularly beautiful and likeable as the most resilient and comprehensive of endangered adolescents. Even Tanya Roberts is as good as an unfortunate girl who has a knife levitated in her head. Unusual and unusual, "Tourist Trap" is worth a visit.
