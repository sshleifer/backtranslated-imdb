Superb story of a young teacher dedicated to teaching children belonging to minorities in an area outside South Carolina. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is outstanding as the stubborn, dedicated and idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal who believes in strict discipline and has little interest in modern educational techniques and the old school superintendent , played tastefully by the late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her children. <br /> <br /> Since I'm a retired teacher, I could somehow relate to this excellent film. The ignorance shown here and the lack of cooperation with officials is also quite evident in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight realizes that these children need much more than the traditional teachings of a class. It makes them go out and experience life by learning outdoors. <br /> <br /> The end is decidedly negative, but so true to life. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable that such backward students had an enthusiasm for learning and were well disciplined. I guess you answer my question. The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment. <br /> <br /> The ending will pull your heart. It was memorable and so well touching.
