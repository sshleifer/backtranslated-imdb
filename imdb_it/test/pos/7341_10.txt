Thank you for making such a wonderful escape. This is what I love about movies. I'm so impressed with the aireals, the way they were filmed and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music. Being a dancer myself, and having been part of many dance films, the choreography is usually cut, cut and sometimes not even for the beat ..... "Showgirls" the film. The relationship between women had always been so present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one when it is dragged. I saw the movie before, a different version., And I didn't like the husband anymore last time. I felt a little more sorry for him this time. Change the way I feel about female love birds. It's all so magical.
