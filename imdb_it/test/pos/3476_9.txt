All right. You saw the movie and saw the movie. True? If not, there are a lot of plot summaries out there, and there's absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any of my weak attempts to create another one. <br /> <br /> The most surprising aspect of the film is undoubtedly the performances of the two young men and of the young lady in the lead. Their emotional honesty was compelling, if not even more, than any performance I've seen in recent months. I discovered that I was laughing, crying and dealing with them, and this is very important because I am often called a tired and cynical jerk. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, the plot is full of clich√©s and I suppose it's the Achilles heel of the image. It is a story that we have already seen many times; we all know how it will end from the moment they present Rory. Even if you may not know the exact mechanics, you know there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet love story and a harrowing conclusion. If it were not for the cast and the director, this film would be nothing but the soporific that includes eighty percent of the program of the Hallmark Channel program.
