I found this movie fun and engaging to watch, and I'm surprised it's rated so badly. Actually I can understand why it is; I imagine it is Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano's fans who give most of the 1 and 2, because if you put the tape in the car expecting to enjoy the vision of both actors or both, then you might be rather disappointed. Eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the film, and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half, and in those he says little and wears less (although he is not naked if that's what you are looking for, hold on to the vampire). Even though I'm always a pleasure, it's a shame that you, or Eric, don't get much screen time yet I still give this 8. <br /> <br />
