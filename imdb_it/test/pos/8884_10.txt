Did you have it with those who raised you since you were young? Do you just want her out of your life? That woman is your mother. You should respect it, you should honor it, if it is sick or good. But sometimes it can be aggravating. Especially when it becomes very bully. That's how Owen (Danny DeVito) had to deal with "Throw Momma Fron The Train". His mother (Anne Ramsey, 1929-88), is one of the worst. She does her best to become a writer, and she's anything but thankful. He calls it "goffa cacca", "larda $$", "fat" and "stupid". For his friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has his problems as a woman, his ex-wife. He's trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push it overboard. What does he do? Help us return the favor, get rid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked where Owen called Larry, "Cousin Patty". And Mom said, "You don't have a cousin's cousin!" and Owen shouts "You lied to me!" and El Cabongs Larry with the pan. Then comes the fun part when I'm on the train and trying to kill Momma Lift. This is hampered, and she kicks Larry from the train. Well, everything returns to normal, the ex-wife lives, but Momma kicked the bucket alone. Perhaps he should have seen the errors of his overbearing ways. A funny film, and the cast is fantastic. A classic! 5 stars!
