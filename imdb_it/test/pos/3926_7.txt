** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Yet another classic horror film redone with adolescent head-to-head acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film, House of Wax, where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage thugs and turns them into precious wax figures. The film is still a classic horror remake like the classic 1974 Tobe Hooper movie, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, later, despite the film's creativity and acting still being just a goreo movie. The director Serra showed a slight enthusiasm with his direction, but it is still worth looking at. My final vote 7/10.
