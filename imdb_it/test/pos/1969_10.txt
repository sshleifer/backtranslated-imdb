This was a movie I found by chance. I was flipping through it and saw it was on Showtime, so I looked at it. Now I watch it at least once a month. This is a movie full of symbols that could cause some people to break it. Don't listen to people who hate this movie, if they want an action movie with an expensive f / x they should have rented a movie that promises them. If you're in the mood for good science fiction, I highly recommend it. If you buy on DVD I recommend the Alliance Atlantic edition of the film, it contains many more extras than the Dimension Films edition.
