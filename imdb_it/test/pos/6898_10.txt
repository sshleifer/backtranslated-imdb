It's so refreshing to see a movie like this with the real mood and personality instead of a simple bunch of CGI cardboard gimmicks. This is a great parody of the horror that has genuine thrills alongside really fantastic sets and performances. His laughter is subtle, but abundant. Since there is very little if there is any CGI, there is no need to violently shake the camera to hide the effects of crap. This makes the film immensely watchable compared to other films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so. <br /> <br /> Much more enjoyable than Hollywood-made big budget garbage released today. <br /> <br /> Watch it.
