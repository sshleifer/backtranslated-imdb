I first saw this docudrama in the UK in the 1980s, and found myself intrigued and then amazed at how such good intentions could go so badly. Previous commentators (who are Australians) have explained the detail of the plot that is unfolding better than I ever could, but I would like to comment on what might be hiding behind the sovereign power of the Governor General of the United Kingdom. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist first and to become a law. This being the case, and if it is said that the Conner / Khemlani mess was probably created (only how many businessmen / millions had been served by Khemlani, presumably without complaints), then the Labor government could have been the victim of "entrapment", which would surely have been investigated "by the Governor-General as or until he could see that the budget deadlock was a genuine result of Whitlam's inability, and did NOT process an entrapment, sponsored by" unknown person or person "! If it is true that Kerr did not actually have to refer to the law because the fiscal circumstances prevail over everything, then the" real power "borders on unreasonableness; the implications in any Commonwealth country are literally the "tax" rules and that any person or organization has Carte Blanche to violate any other rules, physical or mental, as long as in the end have control over the ropes of the bag!
