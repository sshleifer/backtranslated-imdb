I saw him at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The film is REALLY exceptional. The crowd that I followed liked everyone. Fun, moving and great acting. I'm tired of the real and proven Hollywood novels, which can relate to? David Krumholtz (Max) is truly incredible as Grace's sure and true lover (Natasha Lyonne, also excellent). When Max falls for Grace, we believe it. Why? Because love at first sight is crazy and we are dealing with two lost souls, and perhaps not so crazy. Noteworthy are Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette in the role of a sexless / sexy neurotic, both "roommates" of Max and Grace, before embarking on their journey to Sheboygen, WI and being. Don't miss this, it's something special! Post scriptum The soundtrack, led by Kevin Hearn (of the fame of Bare Naked Ladies) is really super fantastic.
