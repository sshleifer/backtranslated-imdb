This film is a variation of a theme that we have seen over and over again: Posiedan's adventure in Space. The characters are all original characters: evil heroine, Judas, coward, etc. Etc. The only question is really who is next to smell it. Sometimes this tried and tested formula works - as in this case - but more often not - as the truly disturbing "Red Planet". <br /> <br /> So why does it work? Because it's elegant. Acting is above average. And above all it is not predictable. The conclusion is not reported. I really had no idea how it would end and I was surprised how it ended. This alone deserves the highest marks in my book. <br /> <br /> It's an intriguing and fun movie. And although it has never been possible to change the face of cinema as we know it, it does not disappoint.
