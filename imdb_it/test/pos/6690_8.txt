This film is brilliant ... without a doubt. I looked at it a while ago, after being constantly pestered by family members who are right in their science fiction movies (which I am not), and I thought it was pretty good. But after having recently watched some documentaries on outer space, etc. We looked again ... and it's good. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors of all time and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims to be from another planet. Yes, of course, you think ... but if his story was so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth. <br /> <br /> This is how the story evolves with Bridges that crosses all kinds of emotions they deal with Prot (as is known), his psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his fellow cosmologist working astronomer (who after getting some data from Prot, admits that it could be telling the truth!) A great movie ... that is asking you ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
