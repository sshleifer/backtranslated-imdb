I grew up with the films of Abbott and Costello, A. because my father grew up with them and both of our surnames are abbott so we have a little respect for the deo, I didn't realize that this film was shot and others of their. It was really a classic, it was fun because abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was really fun, now what I like about Jack and the beanstalk is that even if the love story is totally boring and that a song is the the prince sings, omg, awefull, but I like the angle at which they took love, the story, the couple has to get married because a kingdom is running out of money, they meet in the cell and fall in love because they both pretend not to to be real and end up being the couple, so happy ending, I don't think it was the original version, if it were they should have cut it out of this film, but I think it's original and I love it. but looking at him it sucks, lol, even when the film really gets into action with the giant + abbott and costello it's really funny. when the giant is knocking on the door and Jack is shouting "OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR" that stuff is really fun. And that joke once where Jack starts to scream the prince, the prince and all those dogs jump on him. a bit brash but really original. I wish they had at least tried to remaster it, even though I had that Africa screaming jack and magic bean, and I don't care about the cause of the quality when I recorded it on tape was a bad quality, so whatever I imagine. the beginning is slightly fun, the medium is really fun, and the end is not funny at all, but I'm 19 and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh so hard, this movie is really fun. I love their style even the chapters suck. even the part where Jack is climbing the magic bean and they're all singing a song about what a case is and that it will be killed, that's pretty funny
