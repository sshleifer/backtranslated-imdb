If the genus of capers owes much to Walter Huston, he also owes a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man who was ahead of his time and who suffered greatly because of his blacklist when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a Communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe proved to be bigger than the same people who had contributed to his disappearance in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> "Rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision. He decided to adapt Auguste Le Breton's novel because he saw the possibilities of turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic. Jules Dassin was penniless in Paris when he discovered the city that would be the backdrop for his film. Bad weather repaid Mr. Dassin because the roads were always wet and there was not much to do to show them that. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Tony, he plays cards. Tony seems to be in bad health; coughs continuously and sweats abundantly. After losing all his money, he goes to see Jo, the Swede, who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at Maupin & Webb, the elegant jewelry of a tony section of Paris. They pass the idea through Mario, who suggests Cesar, the Milanese, a secure cracker. <br /> <br /> Tony, who has recently been released from prison, discovers that Mado, his former lover, is now with Grutter, a Creeping who owns a night club. In front of Mado, instead of loving, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his seat. Grutter has no love for Tony, who is his natural enemy due to his connection with Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day comes, the band manages to get to the apartment building where on the second floor, right above the jewelry store, the owner lives, but he is away. All is well and the band moves away with the jewels. Cesar, the Milanese, a typical gentleman, takes a ring as a souvenir, which in turn gives song to the Grutter's disco. This tactical error is the spark that reveals the well thought plan. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais did an excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who was perhaps making his last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director Jules Dassin are seen as Jo, Mario and Cesar, the quartet's jewel thieves. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with a subdued intensity. Robert Hussein, who will go on to direct the films later, is impressed with his Remi, one of Grutter's men. <br /> <br /> The film is the best photographic film by Philippe Agostini, which captured the atmosphere of Paris and the places from which all these criminals operate. Georges Auric's music plays well with the action of the film. Jules Dassin was peculiar in the choice of the films he directed, and unfortunately this is our loss because this man was a genius, as demonstrated above all with "La città nuda", "La notte e la città" and "Rififi".
