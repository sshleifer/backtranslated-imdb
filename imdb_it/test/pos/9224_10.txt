People talk about how horrible the script is and how awful the animation is, but Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer are really a Japanese Anime for children. If you look at the anime today it is done in the same style, and is immensely popular. I don't think this film was ever meant to be seen by adults. Just like I don't think it was ever meant to be serious. The things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things I love. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. She's smart. She's funny. She cares about the environment. She cares about her friends. This film can teach young children a lot. My brothers also liked this movie. I must say that this film taught me a lot when I was a child. When it came out on DVD, I was in the front row to buy it. It's a fantastic children's movie. So if it's not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look at it close enough.
