Hick Trek is clearly a film that is even jealous of an El Mariachi budget ($ 7,000). However, creators are able to get decent effects sometimes (often due to big changes) such as radiation, situations aboard the cat ship and Slim T. Jerk's unique way of communicating with his ship without the use of traditional communication. device. <br /> <br /> Acting has its weaknesses but the portrait of "Horns" McBoy is excellent and Fluffy is certainly not too hard on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I wish the film had been longer than its approximate time - and this should be seen as a compliment. This film is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of the people involved.
