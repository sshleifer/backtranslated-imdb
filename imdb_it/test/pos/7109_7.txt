This has one of the most unusual plots I've seen in a horror movie, but it's based on good, solid Universal Studios dishes: lots of monsters, a beautiful heroine, villagers with torches. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The Wolf Man) looking for a cure for his lycanthropy. After he died in the original "Wolf Man", he is resurrected and vague for "Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein" in search of a way to end his affliction. I think the new viewers will find his research in this particular very interesting film. <br /> <br />
