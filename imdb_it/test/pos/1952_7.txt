Pre-teen Pot-seek Joshua Miller (like Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (like Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette after killing Danyi Deats (like Jamie). The doll washes away, but the young naked woman remains by the "Edge of the River", so that all passers-by can see. Seeing the corpse is a group of twenty-year-old teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (like Matt) and Crispin Glover (like Layne) find themselves more worthy of a camera. Friends wonder what to do about their culprit, murderous killer friend. <br /> <br /> Veteran Dennis Hopper (in the role of Feck) keeps the young ones fed. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-size sexual dolls, with a mouth that is apparently ready for action. Ion Skye Leitch (like Clarissa) is a more living doll, and is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is significantly crossed with a flashback to the initial strangulation. A teenage girl, in her first feature film, Ms. Leitch is the daughter of 1960s singer Donovan. Create other bizarre connections by yourself. <br /> <br /> You can read a lot in the film, or not, depending on your mood. Some character backgrounds may be a bit too thin. Obviously, the teen killer has been teased; note its weight, attitude and nickname connected to the "cabinet". Some character relationships and motivations are too vaguely defined, but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting; and, director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and writer Neal Jimenez are obviously skilled. <br /> <br /> ******* River's Edge (8/27/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
