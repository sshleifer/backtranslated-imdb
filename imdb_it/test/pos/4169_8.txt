Wow. this film is the voice of a climbing generation. Director Sam Keith takes us into the darkest depths of the soul of Man, where we find love, life and top-roping. Telly, fatigued by the world (Leo Fitzpatrick), follows his heart and his anchors through a brain journey to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly meets the clash with Don (Jason Bortz), the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanistic weaknesses. The epic film comes to a climbax in a harrowing competition that destroys even the strongest eager onlookers at dizzying heights. <br /> <br /> This film has it all: Top-roping out, Top-reduction in the gym, shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, impressive climbing videos (some so good, you see it 2 or 3 times!) , attacks of bears and snakes. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 8 out of 10 because I wanted to see the novel develop a little more. It seemed like the movie was leading to a spicy and top-rop sex scene between Telly and her new lover, but alas, it wouldn't have been suitable for the already jam-filled hour and a thrill. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II fans will find this film a diamond in the rough. Overall, if you're ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing, this is the movie for you !!! 1
