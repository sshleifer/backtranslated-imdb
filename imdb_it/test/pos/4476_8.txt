An excellent story told by the director. The interactions between the man and the leopard have brought many questions to the mind of the spectators about who was simply human. Humans have reasonably killed animals just to survive. At the end of the film he was left wondering who the real "hero" of the film was. A well told story. The human actor did a great job but the leopard stole every scene he was in.
