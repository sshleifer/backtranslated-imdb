OK, if I were to judge the film for a day, it wouldn't be suitable. If you looked at FI now on stage and everything was rather cheese (I agree) But it wasn't all the films of the 80s like that (Gilligan, Wonderwoman, etc.). But even people born in the early 1970s or earlier have cult status. At first the plane was approaching. Tattoo climbed the tower by ringing the bell and with his accent he would shout "Da Plane BOSS Da Plane" and you would have wondered what everyone's desire would be. People who were born in the mid-80s or later would not t understand the question why if you looked at it now. It does not have a Harry Potter, the Jurassic Park FX computer animation. you could even almost see the thread attached to a boy who wanted to be too capable to fly. But to us during that time he was a FANTASY ISLAND.
