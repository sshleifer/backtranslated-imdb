I wanted to see this movie for a long time. In the end I just bought it on E-Bay because it's so hard to find the state. But the wait was ... it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I can't say the film was great. And I can't say that the film was fun. But it was nice and has some pretty funny points. Apart from the shots in this film they are simply beautiful. And the whole cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I've never seen before, unfortunately), was excellent. <br /> <br /> In the end it's a romantic comedy and I recommend checking it out, unless you've just had a death in the family. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the final chapter is really worth it. >. <
