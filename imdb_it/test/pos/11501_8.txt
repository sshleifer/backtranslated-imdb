This film is based on a true story. The author of the novel bearing the same title, Einar Már Guðmundsson, had a brother who was mentally ill. I found this film very moving, following the path of the main character down in the disease, to see how he tries to cope with life after diagnosis and how he makes friends with the psychiatric institution, all this is very convincing. There are several wonderfully funny incidents even in the manuscript. The title of this gives nothing about history. You have to watch it to understand ... and listen to the music, which twists and turns the heart and soul upside down as the film flows. A must for everyone.
