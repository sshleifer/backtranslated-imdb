If you are a science fiction fan and have only seen this movie once, please, PLEASE go and give yourself a second viewing. I just did it and I was INCREDIBLE for how good the movie was, unlike when I first saw it three years ago. The first time I was impressed by the astronomical views we were given in this film, but overall I didn't think about much of the film as a whole. It was an alien rip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a really bad case of science. That they were allergic to light was something I found particularly ridiculous. Based on my first vision, I recently voted this film at 5. <br /> <br /> However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is coming, and the movie poster for this looks incredible, I thought I'll do better brush up on Pitch Black again, so I borrowed a friend's video. I'm so glad I did it. There is so much of what I thought I remembered from the first vision that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. It was not like this. I thought that the character of Claudia Black was the first to die. It was not like this. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. It was not like this. <br /> <br /> I see now that the movie works * extremely * well. There is no excessive and annoying focus on monsters. It is much more than a human drama. The main characters are captivating and capable of acting convincingly. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and credible, like the lack of oxygen in the planet's crashing atmosphere, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet, and so they turn to each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention the astronomical views again. I mean, we start to see the spaceship passing through the tail of a comet, with fragments of mud moving in the hull. So we come to a planet with three suns. Just as castaways think it is going to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is swallowed by a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, giant, giant gas giant rising into the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship glide near one of these rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other science fiction film that has made such a point out of including these things. I hope we will see many more in the sequel. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now gets a 9 out of 10 rating from me. A cult classic? You bet!!
