This is a film that everyone in Sweden should watch. The film shows the political revolts that took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. It is characterized by interviews with those who have been condemned where those people have the first chance after the riots, to tell their version of the story and why they think the world can be a better place to live and be a part of. I react emotionally when I see this, since I feel so angry about how those people were treated both during the riots, but also after the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope that as many as possible see this film, as your mind really makes you think: is it possible? In Sweden, a democracy in 2001?
