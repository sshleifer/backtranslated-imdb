Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best movies and film buffs in the industry, so it shouldn't be surprising that Pola X is an almost perfect shot of the most heartbreaking story ever. Seriously. If I could find a way to get into my monitor, I would have hit Pierre at an inch of his life. No one has the right to be so absorbed and so stupid, both at the same time, except perhaps Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a big glass of brandy. I've never been so angry with a main character. Ok, having said that, Pola X is a sensational film with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie .... which means another piece of brilliant direction ... and I'm talking about graphics here, by the way. Pola X will beat you, however, so make sure you are up to it if you decide to watch it.
