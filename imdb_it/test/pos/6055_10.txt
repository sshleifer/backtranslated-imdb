I saw this film for the first time in the late 1960s, and I try to see it every time it comes on TV, which, unfortunately, is not common. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope it will happen at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer and a Gentleman, Jack Webb offers an incredibly great performance as a Parris Island training sergeant with the classic despondent recruit, and the plot in this, although dated, is moving and very well acted. And having real heads in the cast has certainly also helped the film's realism. It's a great film with first-rate acting and a superb story. Look at it if you have the chance: it's worth it!
