A very powerful drama from the small town of Faulkner in the south that deals with the murder of an innocent local black man will not. Striking cinematography and good narration (via flashback) lead us through the restless relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. A still powerful story that precedes Sidney Poitier's films on racial prejudice. Porter Hall has a great role as the father of the murdered man. Trivia: this film was actually shot in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Miss, with many residents used as extras.
