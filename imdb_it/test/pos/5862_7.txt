"Murder by Numbers" by Barbet Schroeder with Sandra Bullock is a solid work, although not particularly convincing. I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and she's effective here as a forensic detective Cassie Mayweather, who isn't very nice and even a broken person. However, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the structure of history. This is the perfect murder performed by two spoiled sociopaths, Richard (Ryan Gusling) who is the handsome, and Justin (Michael Pitt) who is the friendly geek. Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very intelligent and very arrogant, which is normally not a bad thing, but it just doesn't work here. Tony Gayton's script does a great job detailing the investigation of a perplexing murder, and it's really from the numbers. We have these two punk guys who flaunt their superiority and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a great exploration in the dark side, like Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" on Claus von Bulow. There are interesting turns in "Numbers". The film is not so much a thriller, but rather a study on the character of Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravado, her fear of letting people come in with her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. His partner and a kind of love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more a plot than a real character. Although Chaplin does the thing in an admirable way. The other touch of class is that Richard and Justin have involved a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" is Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are many fun twists during the movie. Everything is done in a very competent way. I saw the movie about a week ago, and in retrospect I like it a little more than I did when I saw it. However, it is not just an inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much more, and so do we.
