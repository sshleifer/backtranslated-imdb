I went to see "I Sell The Dead" by Glenn McQuaid in his North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Since this is the second screening in the world, I didn't know exactly what to expect from this film, especially not having seen the short film that inspired this film adaptation. <br /> <br /> I'll start with a slightly more elaborate synopsis film, without giving away spoilers. <br /> <br /> This film is about Arthur Blake, how he became a thief and about the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor have discovered. <br /> <br /> The costume and set design of this film were excellent. I was stunned to hear that the whole film was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very precise at the time, really bringing you as a spectator in the mentality of the time. This film works as well as a vintage piece as much as a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two protagonists was very fluid. They enjoyed each other acting easily. The dialogue between the two was written very well, with Glenn adding his comedy touch even in tense situations. <br /> <br /> The plot is very engaging and the ball moves from the beginning. I would compare it to a visual visual turner, always asking myself what will happen next. The characters themselves are all very vivid and unique by adding different emotional layers to the film itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for some dark humor, with a bit of mixed horror in it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
