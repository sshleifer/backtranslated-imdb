I ended up enjoying this movie but it wasn't the easiest to get. What makes the film great is the music and the scenery. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. A great job was done to show different settings for Roma. <br /> <br /> However, the viewer was not driven enough. A deeper history of Roma people would have been nice. Only a fraction of the words spoken were given English subtitles. Furthermore, further explanations about the settings and who they were and some of their challenges would be appreciated. It would have been helpful if there was a narrator to explain habits, clothes and music as well.
