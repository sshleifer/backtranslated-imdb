Impeccable writing and brilliant acting make this extraordinarily pleasant and witty plot one of the best American films I've seen this year. The fantastic casting and the cynical direction of Neil Labute prevent this film from becoming too sentimental, while the authentic performances of Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman give it a soul. Violent, provocative and fun at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give an incredible resonance. The biggest parody of soap operas from the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.
