On the surface, TMHS seems to be yet another generic high school drama; but surprisingly hidden underneath there is an immense amount of depth, originality and eccentricity that will not only make it unforgettable for the spectator, but will also make it unquestionably one of the best spirits that the medium has produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through the eyes of Kyon, who on his first day in high school meets Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who boldly claims to the rest of the class who has no interest in "normal humans" and who the top casually invites all the aliens, time travelers, cursors or espers to meet with her. Kyon stares in disbelief, wondering if he is joking or if he has any trouble. However, challenging his instinct, he starts talking to her. Thus it soon becomes clear that he is not a normal high school student. Not long after, he creates his "SOS Brigade" school club, which has the appropriate name, and drags Kyon among other very unfortunate people. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this anime conforms to the usual standard conventions, Kyon the protagonist is an excessively cynical pessimist and contributes to the witty tale. A far cry from the usual 2D characters that tend to populate the medium. The same episodes are not chronological and force the viewer to reflect on the events that are taking place and how they relate to the previous instances. This is a stroke of genius; the effect is similar to a jigsaw puzzle, while a new piece is placed we get a wider sense of the image. The previous scenes now have a completely new meaning and their realization is deeply satisfying. This means however that it seems unarticulated (that's all but), a very cleverly written script has circumvented this problem and ensured that it runs smoothly from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The story itself is extraordinarily original but I will not go beyond the simple pattern of the texture of bare bones I gave earlier, because it will undoubtedly ruin it for you. However what I will mention is that the plot includes a wide range of genres, from comedy to science fiction. How they managed to achieve this in the space of fourteen episodes is beyond me, and undoubtedly a huge achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a real gem, which has such diversity and depth that it will appeal to virtually anyone with an interest in anime. Look at it, rather unusually this is something that is up to the enormous clamor it has received - and even surpasses it.
