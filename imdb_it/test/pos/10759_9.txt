this is an adaptation of a book by Dirk Wittenborn, which I have not read. the young Count Finn Earl lives with his mother Liz (Diane Lane) in a cramped East Side apartment in New York. dreams of joining his anthropologist father who studies a fierce tribe in South America. Liz has boyfriends and makes coca cola. when he is caught picking up a coke for her, one of his clients (Liz is a legitimate masseuse) a wealthy Mr. Osborne bans her in exchange for being his full-time personal masseuse on his huge New Jersey estate. They are driven there in a limousine with her tucked into the back seat with the dress pulled up and her panties showing. (this and some low-necked scenes are the only exploitation of Ms. Lane, some may be disappointed but I'm sorry that she had to do all those things in "Unfaithful" to do the A-List. talent in her Streep little finger, Roberts and Sally Field in their entire BODIES and when it was given due.) When they arrive, Finn befriends Osbornes, Bryce's nephew, and is of legal age with his new girlfriend, Maya nephew. Meanwhile Liz joins AA and goes back with an AA doctor. He washes miraculously instantly. Finn instead does a lot of drugs with sex with his new friends. Bryce looks like a good guy but gets jealous when Osborne takes Finn in a balloon ride for him, and that leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> the genius of history, (and of the film) is that they are cut from the violent acts of the fierce and repulsive Blysdale tribe to the Yanoman warriors. It is somewhat implausible, however, that when Liz discovers what happens to her son, she simply asks for Osborne's intervention and does not contact either the authorities or the Thelma and Louise style. there are elements of a gothic novel with a revelation from the village idiot. Furthermore, they make almost no plot or character development before moving to Blysdale. Liz, for example, as Lane's Pearl Kantrowitz on "Walk on the Moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at 18 and felt trapped. This is in the book but not in the film. However, these are minor gaps. The film will be out on 31/12/05 over a year after the original release date, and I couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> There were many Red Carpet moments in the theater that I saw movies in, with almost the entire cast ... except Diane Lane !! $ #% # Q $ Director Dunne said he was out of a movie shoot. I know he didn't promise to be there, but I came out of the city and it would have been a real thrill to see her in person. Is the film a definitive competitor for the best film, as for acting? Sutherland was pretty good, as was the guy who played Finn. Lane was magnificent as always, but I remember only one or two emotional scenes, when he surprises Finn with drugs "let us go together mother and son" and with Osborne "your twisted grandson ...". It would be better with a supporting actress who nods, but it won't work that way. unless they give it to you for a "body of work".
