This is easily the best of the summer camp movies. In fact, few of the others are also right, let alone how fun it is like this. <br /> <br /> The film is simply out to have something good, clean, fun. Many people who have gone to summer camp as children will see that it is presented here faithfully in the usual way, but with a mixed slapstick comedy. Bill Murray, as chief advisor to the camp, Tripper, leads a beautiful ensemble cast, and is usually at the center of an absurd nonsense. Tripper has large one-liners in all, usually broadcasting its lines as pseudo-announcements on the camp's public address system. <br /> <br /> Several great support actors have played campers and consultants to build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots, all the time scattered among the many hi-jinx field incidents. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two particularly well-made characters. The adventures (and misadventures) of these two are hilarious. Each has classic lines, and they are characters that you like and that are the root of. Search Spaz in the dance dance pandemonium scene. <br /> <br /> Even the girls of the story are realistic characters. They are not mute, naive, bizarre, excessive, nervous, or other abused and abused adolescent stereotypes. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these characters believable. <br /> <br /> The necessary jokes abound, usually at the expense of camp director Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these jokes starts outrageously and progresses from there. However, with all the nonsense going on, Tripper and others have their positives. For example, Tripper befriends a shy lonely boy, Rudy (Chris Makepeace), and takes him under his wing. <br /> <br /> The story culminates with a sporting competition against a rival field. It's a great ending for "root for the underdogs". When the chips are on the ground, Tripper's motivation "It doesn't matter" is inspired by spiel and one of the film's best moments. And get ready to take root: "Spaz. Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
