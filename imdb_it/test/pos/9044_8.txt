This is a 1972 Disney movie. For the moment, I was eleven and I really enjoyed this movie. Feeling nostalgic, I bought the three DVDs of the Dexter Riley movie series and even now, at 46, I still liked them. It was fantasy, magic and clean fun. And it still is! I wasn't sure which of the three films was the first, the second and the last. So now I have the official dates. December 31, 1969 The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes - July 12, 1972 Now you see it now you don't - February 6, 1975 The Strongest Man In The World. I still think the second movie was the best. The special effects were surprising in 1972 for us children. I highly recommend it to all ages.
