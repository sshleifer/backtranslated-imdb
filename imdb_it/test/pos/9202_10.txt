Frankly, I enjoy watching James Caan. Wonderful actor With such simplicity you know exactly what he is thinking. A true professional. <br /> <br /> I saw the show from the beginning and found it different - it's something unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not a third version of a current hit show - <br /> < br /> I also find the show funny and exciting: I like the rhythm - you never get bored - I especially like the mystery of each episode - the way it takes place. I'm a big fan of the mystery and I've read many of the great mysteries, but I find the stories in the show well written and the result is rarely obvious. Even for me extremely interesting, probably because I am not a gambler, it is the different disadvantages that "gamblers" come out of: I was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to rob Vegas. Music: I like music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show ... Set the tone and atmosphere. Simply wonderful And, of course, there is James Caan.
