These immortal lines begin Jack Starret's direct masterpiece, "The Dion Brothers". The plot revolves around two West Virginian brothers (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who commit robberies hoping to use the money to open a fish restaurant !!? What follows is a real adventure, and many comic events ensue. The action scenes are all top notch and consist of some well-made shootings. The latter is absolutely incredible and is presented in an abandoned building that is demolished by a demolition ball! The film was written by the famous director Terrence Malick and presents a first appearance by Margot Kidder. All in all, an excellent hidden gem from the 70s and easily one of the best action / comedy hybrids made. We hope that a discreet DVD in widescreen format will arrive soon.
