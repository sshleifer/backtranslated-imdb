Italian soft clone X Exorcist. <br /> <br /> Woman buys statue of a crucified thief. Said thief comes to life and turns out to be the Devil with rape fantasies. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov brilliantly recites the Devil. Mainly because of his gift of evil looks. And because he was never above nudity. Good with him. <br /> <br /> The lead actress did a decent job. His innocence with wide eyes and the fact that she was beautiful and naked helped. <br /> <br /> This has an element similar to most Italian horror films. The girl's parents are rich and broken and depraved. Look at it to get the details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser's husband, Gabriel Tinti, also appears as a casual stallion. His part is pretty much a phone call, but like a cheap beer, he did his job. <br /> <br /> Lacks the director for his faults. This could be a horror / sex classic.
