Probably this is Clint Eastwood's best film. Here the action is minimal, but with a lot of good acting. A Yankee soldier, Eastwood, is wounded and kidnapped by the students and teachers of a southern school, where he is hidden and takes care of him. Shortly after her recovery, all the women wanted to have fun with him, and some of them managed to include the director of the school (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes come up until the ladies discover that their "macho" is shared by many of them, so they get angry and poison him at a farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, even if a little old, was able to play a very suggestive role as director of the school, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.
