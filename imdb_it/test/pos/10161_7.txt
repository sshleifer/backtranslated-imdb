"The man who knew too much" falls into that middle ground of Hitchcock that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: not a suspenseful masterpiece by any means, but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day play a couple on vacation that gets involved in a heavy plot of foreign intrigue. The famous climatic scene takes place in a classical music concert, in which someone will be murdered during a particular clash between the cassi in the score. The mischievous Hitchcock, of course, lets us know what the point is, so that the race to stop the killer becomes a stinging race against the harpsichord. <br /> <br /> Much of this film reminded me of the 1978 Cheie Chase / Comedy by Goldie Hawn "Foul Play" which I have to believe that the film was inspired by this. No movie is a big deal, but both are easy to appreciate. <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
