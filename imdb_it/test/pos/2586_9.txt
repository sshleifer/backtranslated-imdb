I just came back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent some time reading the reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "thin white girl chained to the radiator of a black man" ... I hate when the "critics" miss the point of a film. Now I suppose you help me live in Memphis ... and I've also lived in Mississippi a couple of times. It might also help that I am the former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewer's simple "redemption story" is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story ... but I think it is highly effective as a "blues". I hope people don't read all the hype ... and / or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Pass things like thin girls in white panties ... pass Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (who plays very well) ... pass "Snakes on a Plane" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... as it turned into a very credible Mid-South blues man. If you know little about Mid-South culture, much of what happens may seem like a cartoon ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer SAPPI how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you'll like this movie. Not one to say final ... so go see this movie ... and yes, I will agree with one thing that critics have been right ... the music is wonderful!
