This, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern B movie. The dialogue is drafted and delivered with wooden stiffness, the premise is predictable (there are some decent twists) and the characters remain in 2D for most of it. Yet there is a certain ... charm. The WWE wrestler Kane revives the sick and twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (even if it's a bit like his character who has been playing for about ten years) and so I find it rather funny when people say it's "not very affordable for him", but Glen Jacobs is, apparently, a good guy, so he actually is. In any case, he threw perfectly like the massive beast and the deaths are conveniently over the top (Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kill scenes. Honestly, go to this movie thinking that you'll have some fun and you'll be a gorefest, oh it's the gorefest HERE. The R rating is well deserved and I actually felt a bit nauseous during some of the more graphic moments. In any case, a very, very funny movie, but quite bad.
