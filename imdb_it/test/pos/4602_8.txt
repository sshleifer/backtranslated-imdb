There is no other word for this ... Fox has downloaded it, with NO marketing of any kind. Nobody in the country, apart from those who have waited for this film, knows something about it. All the red flags have flown. It must be a mess, it can't even be close to Office Space, right? Mistaken. Although Office Space is not, this film certainly has a bite and a satirical spirit. It is a bonfire on certain levels, but whoever is to blame is left to mystery. <br /> <br /> Based on what is shown in cinemas, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes funny, with a crack. It is effective, sometimes brilliant. What is not the farthest I can say is over. We will see something of this film again, whether it be a prolonged cut or new footage. Alone can be fun. Sometimes it's difficult. <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking at the mall, I was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. Not so damn dystopian as 1984, but this film paints a bad future for our culture. And there doesn't seem to be much that anyone can do about it. However, go see if you can and try to find out what happened that was buried so specifically.
