I can't believe this movie only got 7.4 points! This certainly fits in with the best of Hitchcock films like VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think about why the score is so low, is that for the most part, THE MAN ... renounces violence and certainly won't get a degree in "sex and crime". <br /> <br /> From this derives its tension from non-violence, it is the reckless energy of these criminals who take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the child if the operation fails. Today, having seen many hardboiled kidnapped films like Mel Gibson's RANSOM, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, where the family was all in contemporary America, the thought of such a crime has certainly aroused many emotions. <br /> <br /> And this tension still works for me today. Yes, these guys are selfish and ignorant, disturbing bastards in the way they act: it's a deal for them, and they want to be "good businessmen", ignoring the fact that business here is kidnapping children and murdering politicians in the work !! <br /> <br /> What makes the film great, however, are the creative aspects, the whimsical ideas of Hitchcock, the shockingly disturbing scene in the church (which brings to the attention of the viewer how much on its own, how abandoned the protagonists, no one worries, no one helps, the people of the church are just going home ...), the meeting with the owner of that stuffing shop and preparation of dead animals (which underlines the somewhat "oriental" charm that the film had from the opening scenes abroad), last but not least the role of MUSIC in this film. <br /> <br /> Music is the key principle here, as *** SPOILER *** the assassination of the targeted politician must be done exactly at the time of a strong all / gong orchastra; so Hitchcock lets the camera follow the score of the orchestra and you will now happen in a second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY sings Que sera, which has become more famous than the film itself; he sings to notify that his parents' child is in the embassy ... <br /> <br /> All in all: a classic !!
