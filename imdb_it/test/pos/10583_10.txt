I just bought this movie last night, and I love it. Everyone played very well, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was fantastic, and as Dunn said in the DVD extras, they made it look like he was reliving it all over again. This film made my first place in my favorite movies! I can't stop reviewing the scenes over and over again, just to see it again. I never did it with any other film. I would definitely recommend it to other people, because it's a fantastic film, and if you like Bam Margera, it's a perfect movie for you !! The little montages they show between each scene are simply fantastic. I think those should be my favorite parts of the movie. They are very sad, with most of the band's music "HIM", which of course is my favorite band.
