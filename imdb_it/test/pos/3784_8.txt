"Shoulder Arms" by Charles Chaplin from 1918 was his longest film to date, although, just over 45 minutes in length, it was not really a feature film. With the first world war coming to an end, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the adorable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the tramp in training, and the character is exhilarated in an exasperated way even in the simplest military exercises, including marching and shooting with the gun, with great disgust of his instructor sergeant. The tramp then finds himself in the trenches, facing a more formidable enemy, although the Germans are ultimately infinitely more incompetent than he is. The exuberant moment in which the vagabond declares he captured only thirteen German soldiers "surrounding them" tore me to pieces. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this movie. Chaplin is waking up to find his barracks sleeping underwater and not being able to literally find his feet is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a tube from a turntable to sleep under the surface. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve Chaplin hiding behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. The reactions of German clumsy soldiers, unknowingly a few meters from a sworn enemy, since they are individually disabled, are very funny, especially when a soldier fights with an ax with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood . <br /> <br /> This is a very funny film and one of the best of Chaplin's pre-1920 efforts. Highly recommended.
