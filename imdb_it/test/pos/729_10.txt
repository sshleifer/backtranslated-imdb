It might be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw a lot of money into a movie to make it good, or to make it worth watching) but I think it's totally missing the point. If you are expecting fast cars, T & A or a movie that will be spelled for you then don't look at it, you'll be disappointed and stunned. <br /> <br /> This film was really nice, kept us on the edge of our seats and really made us think. Obviously the writer has put a lot of attention and research behind this film and shows it all the way, just remember to keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Note: the school scenes were all shot at McMaster University and most of the rest was done in Toronto.
