It's not your normal movie, but good. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie, in the way he talks, in what he says, etc. I was surprised when I saw it, because I thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. He had a very nice story, fantastic characters and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: probably when Billy Bob starts running in his dress shooting at the rippers
