The Seven-Ups is a good and compelling film. It's full of credible performance from Scheider, LaBianco and a scary effective performance by Richard Lynch - though most of the characters are real tough guys. The character development does not evolve on the screen at all. The only thing we know is that good guys are good and bad guys are bad. Deviating from the norm of the history of crime, the Seven-Ups manage to throw Scheider and the troupe in the middle of a building plot with a touch of unique writing. The on-site locations of New York City and an excellent chase in choreographic car highlight the film. The only downside of the film is the slightly fuzzy plot line at the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the men who are kidnapped are related to the mafia (until later in the film). If someone had started looking blindly at the film it could be a bit confusing in history. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a pleasant and testosterone-filled time.
