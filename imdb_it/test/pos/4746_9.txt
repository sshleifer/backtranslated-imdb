Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is he? The Seven-Ups is one of the best detective films, even today, and is second only to the McQueen Bullitt and Dirty Harry series, which is not a bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good crime movie: a credible script with great acting, big car chase scenes and some heavy action. This film has all three scenes and the car chase scene is better than Dirty Harry's. Scheider plays the head of a group of policemen to have New York's bad guys sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not enough for Dirty Harry or Bullitt but much better than all the crime films made by the Dirty Harry series. 9/10.
