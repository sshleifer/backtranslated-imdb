I had heard about this film from anime legend Hayao Miyazaki, and I wanted to see it. But I was quite lucky with the film online on YouTube; after seeing the film, I realized that it is another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by my favorite fairy tale "The Little Mermaid", is about a 5-year-old boy named Sosuke, and his relationship with a goldfish princess, who he called Ponyo, who wants to become human being and being with Sosuke. I won't give you more details, you'll have to watch the movie for yourself. So overall one of the best animated films ever made, with a lot of imagination, adventure and humor ... I liked it!
