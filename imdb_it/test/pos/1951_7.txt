A movie for teenagers about anxiety, friendship, loyalty and growth ?? but this is not a happy exit on his part because of the circumstances and life-changing dilemmas surrounding the premise. What makes it is quite numb, haunting and downright cold. However I was expecting something a little more powerful and effective, and while compelling and unforgettable, it did not arouse much interest in emotions. The shows are reasonably a mixed bag, but there is a brutal honesty to all of them. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are fantastic ?? Eccentrically above Crispin Glover and Keanu Reeves' dead as the wooden turn seems to repay in his role as a personalized loser. Joshua John Millar is quite good, as is Ione Skye. Jim Metzler plays with a short but very engaging performance. The story is dramatically compared, marked by character and heartbreaking in its eventual rupture in which it infuses a gritty and painful punch. JÃ¼rgen Knieper's turbulent music is boiling with anxiety, tension and wonder, while morals and commitments are put to the test and learned.
