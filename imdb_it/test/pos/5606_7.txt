Although not the best work by Hal Hartley (my favorite is "Surviving Desire"), there is still much to appreciate in this film, especially for fans of Hartley's dialogues. Even to a new Hartley audience, I would certainly recommend this sophomoric movie "Dogma". This film is smarter, more faithful to its source material (the Bible), and more fun than any other pre-millennium apocalypse film. <br /> <br /> This film is actually part of the French "2000 Come Visa Di." (2000 Par Vu) series; as such, it is perhaps also a low-cost film compared to Hartley's other works. While the need for simple scenes taken with a digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this film is the unfortunate overuse of the blur / nervous effect. I would be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again; especially at the beginning, it makes the film almost invisible. But neglect this flaw and you will be treated to a good movie. Particularly noteworthy is Magdalena (played by P.J. Harvey) who tells how Jesus saved her from being stoned to death; a brief scene that I found surprisingly moving. (Despite the fact that it was NOT Mary Magdalene that this happened, the woman in the Bible was unnamed.) <br /> <br />
