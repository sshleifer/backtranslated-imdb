Key West, for too little time was "TV appointment" for my family. I stopped by Red Lobster and took a Party Tray for the night it was on. The irony of the situation was that I was working for an Affiliate Fox at the time, and everyone at the station was furious not to renew the show. Everyone in that cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who couldn't not identify with an "ordinary man" who dreams of being a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly has always been remarkable (and she is a HECK of a Texas Hold'em player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. I would like them to publish the hurricane one. Only that episode should have won an Emmy, as was the rest of the cast.
