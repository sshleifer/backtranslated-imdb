This must be one of Australia's best productions. I completely disagree with the comments of "RamiNour101". <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of the Australian mateship and the lengths in which they went to help each other. Episode Five 'Eddies Birthday' is a great example of this and captures the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used throughout the series only emphasized the situation that men had to face, their desire for home and their loved ones. The many entertaining interpretations of The Road to Gundagai capture the spirit of men and the fact that they have never forgotten the house, and that they were small elements like the song of a song that brought them home for a short time. <br /> <br /> As for the comment on the fact that it's racist towards the Japanese, the only thing to say is that you can't change what happened. The Japanese treated the Australians very little at Changi and represented them as otherwise it would be really misleading. The commentary on the accuracy of the script is also false. These six stories told in the series are composed of real experiences of P.O.W. <br /> <br /> The actors were exceptional; the best is in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His portrayal of David in the first episode was heartbreaking. From being a city boy, to being another nameless face for his captors. We see it drastically change in the first episode because of its violent attack in the jungle, and in other episodes we can see how that event changed it, is more aware of what is really happening and is always one of the first to help other members by The Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in "Eddie's Birthday" is surprising, going from the group's larrikin, to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. The mateship views in this episode touch you emotionally and make you proud to be Australian. <br /> <br /> I study WWII at university level and found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually true, as it captures the true spirit of what would have been an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to John Doyle for capturing the spirit of Changi.
