Rowan Atkinson offers an unforgettable performance as Mr. Bean without fanfare that never goes far without his Teddy Bear. Mr. Bean's appeal is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if it came from the sky or from another planet. It's the kind of weird character that you can't easily invent. He is often alone and used to it. He has difficulty communicating through speech, which could be why we sometimes only hear his grunts. There are other characters who talk to him and he answers. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is. He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing. Mr. Bean is rather a strange man who doesn't care much. He rather lives a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time.
