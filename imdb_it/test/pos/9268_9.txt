I saw this documentary film at the 2005 independent film festival Slamdance. This documentary is shot, directed and edited by a son (Craig) of his mother's battle with cancer. Filmed over the course of a year, "More is approaching", it is a documentary in the truest form and gives you an inner aspect of a family's struggle with the fight against cancer, the viewer gets an internal view of the effects that the cancer has about a family as well as the individual during the whole process. I have never seen such a honest film, this is a powerful and raw film, and since it was not shot by a stranger, you have the true emotions of all the people involved. Many documentaries are shot by a stranger, but having this story told by the child adds another emotional level to the film, unlike those I've seen before on this subject or any other. This is a moving story that everyone should see and can relate to. I highly recommend it.
