15 PARK AVENUE is the address "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) is looking for the beginning of the films. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half-sister of Mithi's previous marriage. The film revolves around these characters and looks at the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through his continuous blabbering towards Anu and others. <br /> <br /> Konkona does not deserve one, but thousands of prizes (which I am sure, I will get) for this interpretation of Mithi in this film. It is possible to see the appearance of a patient written on his face, with drooping lips and sleepy eyes, from the first scene itself. Rahul Bose did a good job, but he was reduced to half of the film despite his importance in their lives. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the intense relationships shown between the characters in the film, Mithi & Anu, Anu & Anu's Mom and between Anu & Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as usual, made a compelling performance to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> The film may not be your usual Hindi hobbyist, but it can certainly make people look schizophrenic patients in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen takes the film to a different end rather than a clich√©, we might think. An affectionate greeting to her, for this beautiful film !!!
