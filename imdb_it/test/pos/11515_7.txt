This is an important historical film since it was the first feature film. <br /> <br /> The film was made for only $ 23,000. <br /> <br /> He cashed over a million dollars on his release. <br /> <br /> This film helped define the gangster melodramas that will become the bread and butter of Warner's studio in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film ended the era of silence more than its most famous part-talkie predecessor, the Jazz Singer. The film deserves its place in history and not as a simple footnote. <br /> <br /> The only actor who could be remembered today that is in it was Eugene Palette.
