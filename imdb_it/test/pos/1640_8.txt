FBI agents Mulder and Scully are instructed to probe the mystery of what happened to an arctic drilling team, in this first episode of "X-Files" that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first "rock" episodes. It pays tribute to John Carpenter's much praised 1982 theatrical feature "The Thing", and you can see the similarities. Visually, color and light combinations come together to give the story an infernal quality. The set design and art direction are particularly impressive; the shots of the exterior of the Arctic field so explicitly remind the previous film to automatically create feelings of déjà vu for some spectators. Of course, our heroes are threatened by time, so the sound design, which involves the wind, evokes the memories of "The Thing". <br /> <br /> The culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team; once inside a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia to take full control and the way the script is set cannot be too sure of who is infected and who is not. This gives rise to the inevitable test scene. This episode certainly works in portraying the way tensions can cause interruptions in groups. It also allows Mulder and Scully to have moments when they are not sure if they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> Guests are a small group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman and Steve Hytner as scientists are forced to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission, and Jeff Kober as a pilot who takes them to the camp. You can even see Jason Voorhees portrait artist Ken Kirzinger once as one of the unfortunate members of the original team. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, there is a direct link between "Ice" and "The Thing": the art director Graeme Murray, who worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
