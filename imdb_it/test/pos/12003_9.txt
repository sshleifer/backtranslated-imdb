Columbo is a guest lecturer for a criminology course. Students invite him to attend their gathering after the lesson. In transit in the nearby garage, they discover their regular teacher, near his car, who died from a gunshot wound. (No, Columbo did not work for man's work.) As a class project, Columbo involves students in his investigation. <br /> <br /> Two students, temporarily identified by the viewer as guilty, were in the classroom for the entire class. Furthermore, the parking surveillance camera tapes show that no one other than the professor has entered or left since the last unexpected visit of the conference room. <br /> <br /> By reversing the normal routine, Columbo is the one who is tormented by evil (?) duo, eager for progress and an ear for their theories. The forensic evidence is almost non-existent. The solution to the case depends on a possible good fortune. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seemed that Columbo had swallowed all the wrong direction of the culprits; however, in the case of repeated viewing, small details revealed that this was not the case at all. <br /> <br /> This reviewer has not yet tired of "Columbo Goes to College".
