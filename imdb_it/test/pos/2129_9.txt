This is a well done story with pretty music, lots of dancing, lots of big sister / little sister interaction (almost all positive) and many wishes granted. There are fun moments that young and old will enjoy, like when King Randolph exclaims: "They are only SHOES!" And delicate moments like when Princess Genevieve comforts her younger sister, Lacey, after a mistake. <br /> <br /> Animation may not be as good as Disney, but it's still very good. The facial expressions are blurred, particularly for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her servant, Derek the cobbler, and little Princess Lacey. My only quirk about animation is in the dance sequences in which the dancing princesses become absolute carbon copies from each other without the slightest deviation - even the three youngest ones perfectly imitate dance moves. I would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dance, considering that these girls are not professional dancers or choir dancers. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the story is cleverly managed to get rid of an evil without actually hurting it. There is some violence to the guards in history, and the villain monkey is bad with other animals in history. <br /> <br /> My 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and watched it repeatedly, and I found it quite acceptable for her to watch.
