Yul Brynner is Major Surov, a Russian singing, dancing and vodka officer drunk near the Austrian-Hungarian border during the 1956 Hungarian uprising in Anatole Litvak's Journey. Although the film still needs to be released on video or DVD, it remains one of Brynner's most compelling performances. Due to political unrest, a group of travelers cannot fly from Budapest but is put on a bus to Vienna. Before they can reach the border, however, their passports are taken and held for questioning by the Russians led by Major Surov. <br /> <br /> The major has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country. In fact Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.) who pretends to be an American but doesn't make fun of anyone. He is helping Fleming primarily to repay a debt due to problems caused by his past partnership. Among the other passengers there is a British journalist played by Robert Morley, an American family played by E.G. Marshall, his wife Anne Jackson and their two children, one of which is the film debut of little Ron Howard. <br /> <br /> Major Surov has a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr), and a love story of types develops between them. He offers him nothing but contempt and a stiff upper lip, however, even if we suspect that he still beats under his heart. The intrigue of the Cold War and powerful acting bring history but the love story is never convincing enough. It remains, however, one of my favorite films of Yul Brynner and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance.
