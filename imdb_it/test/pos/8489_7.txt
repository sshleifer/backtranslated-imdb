'Ray' lives on Ray Dir- Taylor Hackford Cast- Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Queen King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Written by Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Evaluation- *** <br /> <br /> "Hit the road Jack, and never come back or more or more or more!" Who would have thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedy for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived for a fight between lovers! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing he knew, he breathed and lived for; it was music. Thus in a life that included acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful business; Ray still found moments where inspiration hit him from nothing and words and notes took their shape to form an eternal classic instant! <br /> <br /> There are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the big screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It is almost a shock to find that this project has not received any studio support until it is completed! And that support probably came after the initial screenings in which Jamie Foxx's performance was praised and predicted as a certain Oscar-winning winner with subdued voices. Jamie Foxx like Ray almost convinces us that Ray Charles is actually on the screen and not an actor who plays! From the crooked and omniscient smile to the curved gait of a handicapped not so much that a man who dances among his demons, Foxx captures every essence of the true Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it himself. An astute businessman, he assured his success at all costs, sometimes at the cost of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his womanizing ways and always claimed to love his family, which we believe we did. He liked sex; it was so simple! But beneath it all, there was also a Ray that was afraid of darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man who fears darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death, and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself. Ray was a nonconformist who fused gospel with jazz, a blasphemous practice unheard of in the 1950s. But his intentions were not to instigate. He was simply practicing the only way he knew how to get closer to God! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to capture a life so rich in events like Ray's, and perhaps that is where the film fails. We are never really allowed to approach Ray as a person. We only know it as much as we see it. His relationships, particularly with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), are not explored in detail. And the script barely passes on to Della Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, who everyone knows is a rock by his side. And the biggest mistake of all is the hasty, almost sudden climax. It is as if the director suddenly realizes that he was exhausted and asked for a package! Nevertheless, "Ray" is definitely recommended for a flawless performance by Jamie Foxx and a skilled star complex. The songs and age create a sense of nostalgia, and we have the genuine feeling that the film is done with sincerity. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Note - 'Ray' is nominated in six categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx ). <br /> <br /> Evaluation- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Medium *** Good **** Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> 19 February 2005
