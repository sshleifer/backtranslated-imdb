I don't understand why it is so undervalued on IMDb. This film is just perfection .. The best adaptation of all time of the Tarzan myth! As a Frenchman, I can say that this is the best role of Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in many films, but here absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is fantastic, well told, the magnificent story, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, everything is perfect! How to believe that these sequences with the music of Elgar, simply simply perfect ... <br /> <br /> Greystoke is really an incredible film, underestimated here, I really don't know why, but really appreciated
