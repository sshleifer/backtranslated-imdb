I was about 14 when I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as the songs I have been to the cinema several times to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learned the songs by heart, just like I did with "The sound of Music" (which people barely know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who post their comments is that they don't have a romantic soul and haven't seen the movie through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he's a fan of Ingrid Bergman, but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Can Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so beautiful about her? Perhaps the critic did not appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses since he sees a close resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and the story behind the film, philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical color made it more fun and entertaining without damaging the intellectually attractive aspects. It is a pity that many other films with so-called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are absolutely boring in comparison.
