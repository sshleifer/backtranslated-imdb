I think this is one of Burts best five films, along with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also directed this, so he also had a talent for his friend Clint Eastwood. I'd like you to have made more films like this or even a sequel to Sharkys Machine by artists like Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. This is a tough and gritty thriller with Reynolds at the top of his game. He also helped the beautiful Rachel Ward with the fame of Thorn Birds. Henry Silva is the bad boy and always does a good job. The film is also a fantastic soundtrack. I highly recommend this, I wish it was on DVD in the UK, an audio commentary from Reynolds would be great as well. *** 7/10 ***
