I loved this movie. I thought it was very well done. The character's interaction was wonderfully done, as was the characterization. The actors were very credible. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Although some parts are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring, it is certainly worth looking at them several times. The chemistry between the three main actors was great. If you don't want to watch it for that, at least watch it for the drama between the characters. I mean, it was just "Whoa!" It was as if I couldn't look away. The whole film caught my attention and kept my interest, even through slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything. I loved the ending because it was so interesting and, if you watch the movie a second time, it makes perfect sense. But I'm not ruining anything.
