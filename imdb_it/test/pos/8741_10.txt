From 1965 or around 1965 American films took a turn for the shocking and the iconoclast that was great for the times - a kind of seeds that would have paved the way for more daring and daring dramas. However, since the decade that gave birth to these films was so conditioned by his own convictions, most of the films released during this period are dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. The title itself suggests a "solar" romantic comedy with occasional falls in the bold. This does not mean that it is a bad thing: on the contrary, the films on hot topics must start somewhere and America being a culture rooted in specific traditions, in turn intertwined in deep hypocrisies, it is silly for the sake of it when he sees an indirect reflection of the customs of the time. Meanwhile, European films face these same situations, they seem to go away like a million dollars and have a longer shelf life because we consider them to be scandalous, they shrug their shoulders, say "Forward" and move on. <br /> <br /> Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in her starring role), a young and brilliant sixty-year-old, continues with a much older dentist by the name of Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), who has commitment problems. He cannot marry her: he is already married. Toni decides instead to sneak away actually wants to meet his wife and "fix things". In the photo comes his assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (a bright Ingrid Bergman, who returns to American cinema after a twenty year absence), a woman closer to her age who behaves as if she and he had the perfect marriage and family. There is a reason for this: it has nurtured some quiet emotions for Julian, emotions of which he is not aware, even when he asks her to play the wife to prevent Toni from taking a step forward in the relationship. And then he takes it up a step when Toni's blissfully innocent actions transform the action into the unexpected and he introduces Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephanie's "lover". By the way, Harvey is also an old gentleman who has a relationship with a much younger woman (Eve Bruce) who is also in a very funny scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the person we are looking for is the one who has always been there. What could have been an ungrateful role for Rick Lenz who plays Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor, turns into a man who not only sees the real beauty in the partner eliminated Stephanie, but the one who saves Toni in the beginning by killing if same. (It's not comedy stuff, suicide.) Again, this is not your average comedy.) And needless to say, Ingrid Bergman's subtle and touching portrait of a woman who somehow lost her chances to love, that has become pungent, due to a lie told to another she becomes the real person that has always been meant to be. I can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but profound role. <br /> <br /> Films like these can be appreciated for their face value and seen as fun for evasion - a product of their times - or to be seen for the deep symbolism that, like the title, brings in depth. It's a complicated film, in the same way that the performances of Hawn and Bergman are equally difficult because they seem so simple, lacking in style and pose, nor do they come out and proclaim what it is. Their acting becomes "not really acting" but playing real people, warts and everything else. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems to take itself too seriously, but reveals itself to be profound and very human after all.
