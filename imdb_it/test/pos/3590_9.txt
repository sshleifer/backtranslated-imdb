I admit to being admired by the sea and spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am a little biased about this. I lost this documentary when it came out, but it harassed various people to buy it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Part of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make this type of documentary, to see the 200 ton Blue Whales that cross the sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and facts transmitted through storytelling, that's right, I don't want to know a load of science just some of the basics, to see these things is enough for most people. The BBC has the talent to put things at the right level for the intended audience. <br /> <br /> A truly exceptional documentary, up there with "The World at War for" me, the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had minor criticisms, some of the sound effects obviously added here and there, I think they take away some scenes. But well done for the BBC and Discovery.
