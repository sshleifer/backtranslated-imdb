Are we authorized to interfere with the daily life of our fellows? Is it possible to intrude on their intimacy, penetrate the interior of their thoughts by violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost in tune with the destabilizing decision of Judge Jean Luis to come to terms with his own self-confinement by means of fragments of lives taken from him. <br /> <br /> "Trois couleurs: Rouge" is based on the concept of "UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEPED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF A WINDOW OPEN ON THE WORLD". The phone can be considered the main character of the story: after his performance in "Dekalog 9" he gives the encore to the viewers of Kieslowski at the beginning, followed step by step in his fast race across the world. The director looks deeply into the communication faculty of human beings, without assuming a definitive position on the ethical side of individual behavior. Once again it shows us the unpredictability of future events, leafing through accurate descriptions of strange courses and recourses of life separated from each other for a considerable number of years. Unexplained combinations strangely converging in a series of continuous and shocking situations. - Some books that fall on the floor. - One of them randomly opens on a fatal page, predetermines the fate of a future profession, as in a similar past. - Glimpses of everyday life that meet fleetingly, ideally united by their predilection for the fake musician Van den Budermayer. - Human fortunes marked by the most unfortunate coincidence. <br /> <br /> In this work worthy of being seen with the eyes of our hearts instead of those of the mind, we can witness a dialectical game between Judge Jean Luis (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob , perhaps the sweetest actress of our times, along with the beautiful Winona Ryder), in a generational conflict between the experience of a tired old world and the awkward immaturity of a beautiful girl about to face the steepest path of her way to go up. Kieslowski speaks of a "test of dialogue" between a disappointed human life and a young woman unaware of her future, between a spiritless misanthrope and a spontaneous girl full of common sense of altruism. <br /> <br /> And the final parade when the damp smell of tragedy still lingers in the air, with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence, saved from a fortune thanks to the screenplay providentially written in an intelligent way, gives us the extreme greetings of this master of cinema completely accustomed his great passion for cinema. Only a sense of bitter displeasure and emptiness is left to remind us of the existence of an emptiness impossible to fill. GOOD-BYE KRZYSZTOF. WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!
