What's wrong? <br /> <br /> I took this message again tonight and was amazed that Hugh Bonneville captured the essence of Philip Larkin without resorting to tics and caricatures. <br /> <br /> There are many overlaps with the representation of the complexity of the main character and Hugh brings them to life. His modest mother, her unsolved problems with her father and her inability to engage with a woman. <br /> <br /> His poems intertwine everywhere and some scenes are captured by telling them to a friend's wife who he later proposed, but rather casually, almost innocently. It is not difficult to understand where his attraction was to the many women who fell in love with him (and who knew each other, to start, and continued to see him!) <br /> <br /> Cerebral, fun-loving, jazz enthusiast, loyal friend. It is always more than it seems, women move beyond their baldness, deafness and myopia. And a wonderfully nuanced performance by Eileen Atkins as her mom is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
