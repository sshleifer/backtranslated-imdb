Recently I was lucky to see the name of Ingrid Bergman associated with a film I had never seen (or heard) about AMC. What a stroke of luck. <br /> <br /> Surprising his flawless and uninterrupted performance is not the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie. The script is wonderfully comic and the performances are excellent. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fabulous. Tender sometimes, demanding, so simply silly. There are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will be involved in the story and will forget that it is a movie. <br /> <br /> That Bergman can steal a dance scene from a 20-year-old crowd - the old ones were amazing to watch. It is effortless in its return to the screen (at the age of 54?). The supporting cast was great and the lines ... the lines are exquisite. <br /> <br /> A 5 ​​romantic comedy of all time.
