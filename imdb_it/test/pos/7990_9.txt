As a child I grew up with the chintzy TV series of the 60s (and I'm not so old ?? POW!). However, when director Tim Burton brought his new vision onto the silver screen, I simply had an immediate prominence and never backed away from favoring his bets on the much more exaggerated additions ("Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight "), which I don't really care about. Even if they have a much more rooted approach and want to further explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne / Batman ?? but honestly I don't think there is so much to exploit. I wanted crazy fun with a dark vein and in my eyes that's what Burton brought around, and that's why I can watch them over and over again. <br /> <br /> After having thrilled the public with the 1989 'Batman', thanks to the gothic-style artistic direction and Jack Nicholson, he performed in non-prisoner shows of the camp, but a psychotic Joker. Burton would be back 3 years later for the sequel and my favorite batman movie so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well done. In what would be right to be even more expansive, stronger, dark and nihilistic and have two evil enemies for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito striking beautifully on a limb) and the beautiful Catwoman (a smoky Michelle Pfeiffer who gracefully fills her dress) coming to ruin Gotham's party. Once again Batman (an appropriately brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite impressive in that bat costume ??? looks at the eyes) plays the second violin to the bad guys, but I have always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him a gloomy dark mixture but also a psychological complexity that has never felt the need to force food. His turn to Bruce Wayne was also well served. The illustratively atmospheric direction of Burton opens with its elegant Gothic style that engraves a world of carnival comics filtered by a splendid range of characters and lively costumes. The moody tale (in what is probably a little too long) is more symbolic in its progression, rather it shows off its spontaneously extraordinary and extravagant pieces and the strongly engraved art direction, covered by dark shades and gray neon lights / blue of a winter background. The magnetic-flex camera takes flight and Danny Elfman's big score balances playfulness with dark touches with a very hypnotic boost. The rest of the performances could be obscured, but Christopher Walken digs himself between his teeth in a thin and worldly role of a two-faced businessman, Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but he gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is as delightful as Alfred. In full support Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also make a cameo.
