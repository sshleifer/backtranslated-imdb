Tipping the Velvet (2002) (TV) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for the BBC. The basic plot is a training story for the main character, Nan Astley, played well by Rachael Stirling. As a teenager, Nan works in her family-run oyster house. Everyone expects you to stay at home, marry an appropriate husband and settle in family life. Nan expects this too. <br /> <br /> Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothes and captures the hearts of her audience. Audiences include Nan, who is sexually attracted to Kitty in a way she is not attracted to her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows Nan in London and through his (species) and (horrible) origins as a lesbian and sometimes male imitator. <br /> <br /> As is typical for the BBC, every role, no matter how small, is played by an excellent actor. The BBC has a depth and breadth of artists that are truly wonderful. None of the supporting actors stand out in my mind: they were uniformly good. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful, and their acting brings the film forward. It is always sad to remember how difficult life can be for someone who does not fit the mold of society for what is normal. I know it's not easy for lesbians even in the United States, even today. Imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
