The three short films included in this compilation published in 1959 are timeless classics by Chaplin, nothing wrong and nothing to criticize. Also the soundtrack of Chaplin for these films and the framework added as connecting sections between the short films are well made. The problem with this compilation is minor, yet annoying. The shorts were elastically printed to fit the frame at 24 p.s. speed of contemporary films while the shorts themselves have shot at 20 frames a day This result is a jerky movement that does not seem very attractive, yet this was an excusable solution given the limitation of optical printing technology at the moment, it is not only excusable that the current DVD version is not restored, the films look as dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretched. There are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on DVD, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but unfortunately it was not done. <br /> <br /> A small quirk has absorbed a lot of space in my article, but I say a minor quibble again, it should not detract from the experience, although I have penalized a point of my evaluation. The shorts are still worth "10".
