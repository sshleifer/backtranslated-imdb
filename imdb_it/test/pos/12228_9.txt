I came across this film while the channel was sailing one day; and I decided to give it a chance. To my surprise I liked this darkhorse movie. I heard some genuine chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a cheerful and warm film that when it ended I felt optimistic. Of course, this film was predictable from the beginning, but I gave it a high score for the way it made me feel when it was over. I have to admit that I've never seen Challen Cates before, but I feel he can definitely act. When you combine her good acting with her cute face and her attractive figure. He has the qualities of becoming at least a well-known star.
