I think Crewes did his bad part very well, he should have won a prize. All that Dunne does is recoverable because Dunne is a great actress and can pull out anything, even a weak script. So I would recommend it just for this reason. This film may have been a little bit ahead of its time, the plot may be more acceptable these days. <br /> <br /> During the golden age of Hollywood movies were destined to entertain or teach, especially to make us feel good or face the times. This plot seems to deviate from that profile. Yet once again I have to say what ever Irene Dunne was, at least, was "good" because it made things so believable! The only other actress I can say made me think this way, maybe, Deborah Kerr. Watch Silver Cord if you have the opportunity to "act" if nothing else.
