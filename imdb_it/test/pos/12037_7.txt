The Turner Classic Movie Channel spent the month of January making films for one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are mostly rarely watched these days, except for those that were atypical for most of his career - which means that the roles that frequently reappear on TV are EXPANDABLE FACTS, THE LADY IN THE LAKE, THE BRIDE JUNE, THE NIGHT MUST FALL, THE SAXONIA CHARM, DRIVE THE ROSE HORSE, REACH THE SKY, THE SURE OF CHICAGO (in short the films he fought to get the roles because they weren't the usual comic stuff he used to see) . It is ironic that nowadays, when one thinks of Montgomery's career, it is films made mostly after 1937 that push - those that broke the original image that MGM and Louis B. Mayer pushed. The pity is that Montgomery was a talented comedian and saved many films from being routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is one of these films. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO, it was a year of good performance by Montgomery and helped convince his MGM powers to allow him to play "Danny" in NOTTE MUST FALL next year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is set in Labrador, and Montgomery is a weather station operator called Dascom Dinsmore. He lived there for five years, and was not in the company of a woman (except for Inuit women) for most of that time. He has a girl named Clara (Winifred Shotter) whom he proposed, but it's been two years since he heard from her, so he thinks he gave up on him. <br /> <br /> Dinsmore's world is lulled when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) appear. They were flying to Toronto for a business meeting that Felton would have to face. Felton is engaged to Campton, but Dinsmore finds her charming ... and gradually finds him equally attractive. Certainly the pompous, presumptuous, and hopelessly inept Felton is not a competition (it is a measure of Owen's acting that keeps the character entertaining even though it is hard to believe that such a busty is a Canadian captain of the industry). /> <br /> There is something surreal about this film, probably because of the original game. While the "Labrador" scenario is rather fake, it serves its purpose for comedy (testimony to the polar bear sequence). But the pinnacle of surrealism is the dinner that Dinsmore serves his guests, a dinner of "pemmican steaks", which Owen eats with real taste. Owen (a minor nobleman as a baronet) is dressed in normal clothes - a winter climate suit). But Montgomery is dressed in his evening dress (as if he were attending an embassy dance). Loy, seeing him dress, also wears a suit. They are served by Dinsmore's servant-assistant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also wears an evening dress - it turns out he is from Owen! Owen, who previously insisted that Dinsmore turn into the most appropriate clothing for his station, is the only person who is improperly dressed for this dinner !! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his most direct rival). This is a problem in the film if Montgomery or Fred Astaire were the most elegant figure in these dresses. Difficult to decide. <br /> <br /> The course of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama. Clara introduces herself (we are warned too early about this at the beginning of the film when we see her on an ice ship). Will Dinsmore break with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The film is fun, and Loy and Montgomery make it a nice couple. They had appeared together in another film, and both were in separate scenes in a second, before this film. But this would be their last film together. <br /> <br /> One last interesting point: at the beginning of the film when the credits are shown, we see illustrations of men and women in comic situations. They are based on the artwork of John Held Jr., the great cartoonist / illustrator of the '20s and' 30s - who was the recorder of the flapper and "Jazz Age". It is an unusual choice, since it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the film or with Labrador.
