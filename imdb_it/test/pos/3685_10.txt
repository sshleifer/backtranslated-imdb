We loved this movie because it was so fun and off beat - not the usual Hollywood tour. <br /> <br /> My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and broadcast a series of new versions of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to leave when he saw this and decided to risk it. There was only one copy - and with some flaws on the DVD that we eventually had to run on a widescreen version and then go back to the full screen version to lock it. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. And she can sing too! <br /> <br /> If only Hollywood learned from independent directors! Maybe we should go back to real movies. But for now, we're sticking out of time and fun movies like this! Other examples we appreciated include: A full Moonlight box, April pieces, Delivering Milo, The Celestine Prophesy. Most of Christopher Guest's like: Best in Show, For your Consideration, A Mighty Wind, Waiting for Guffman
