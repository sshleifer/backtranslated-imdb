Having grown up a Mormon and struggled with church bigotry towards blacks (they were not allowed to hold the church priesthood when I was a member) - I was not aware of the organizations' policy to excommunicate homosexual men and women until I I left the church in 1966 - (I was 20). I was amazed when I learned that the friends who were gay had been excommunicated even after serving on mission. LATTER DAYS exposes the persecution of gay members by Mormons. The film is LONG late. It does a great job of showing how the two main males confront each other, while they manage to grow and develop more fully as individuals. LATTER DAYS has a big heart, a wonderful original music and a touch of class added by Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who abandons the boundaries of organized religion and claims his own soul.
