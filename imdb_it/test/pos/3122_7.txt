By 1950, John Ford had already fully developed the ideas and motives that would form the core of his most successful westerns. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, the most affected in the Joad family of Steinbeck "The Grapes of Wrath (1940)". Within these communities, even among Ford's highest racism themes and pioneering spirit, there is always room for the smallest human interactions, minor friendships and love stories that make life worth living He lived. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy ?? 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)' ?? and covers a similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damnably, the strong advantage of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are good actors, but they feel like they have to play with someone, and the evil old Ward Bond Mormon, while potentially a candidate for a role like that, isn't given enough fire to adapt satisfactorily to the bill. <br /> <br /> In "Wagon Master", Ford seems so comfortable with its proven Western formula that any character development is widely overlooked. Ben Johnson's love affair with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charming Mormon girl is so superficial as to be almost non-existent in the final film, leaving one to meditate on the survival of the deleted scenes. Only in the charismatic and shamelessly unfortunate uncle Shiloh of Charles Kemper Ford tries to do something different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of loose jokers with unbearably soft jaws. Where does Ford manage to orchestrate the conglomerate of three distinct races of Americans ?? the values-oriented Mormons, the itinerant traders, the eccentric traveling showmen? in a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of uncle Shiloh's armed outlaws, who exploit the illegality of the western border, but in the end get lost for the noble cowboys who "have always drawn snakes". <br /> <br /> Reportedly, Ford Wagon Master is a favorite of his films and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with his selection of titles of usual players, Ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding focusing on any character, although most Mormom travelers still remain completely anonymous. Although it is undoubtedly well done, I cannot help but think that this film is good only for what the other images of Ford have done even better: the majestic majesty of the western border was presented in a more beautiful way in "He wore a ribbon yellow"; novels and friendly quarrels among community members have taken more prominence in "Fort Apache"; the first relations with Native Americans, only hinted at here, were examined in more detail in "The Searchers (1956)"; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more touchingly (though by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in 'How the West Was Won (1962).' 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it is not a point of reference.
