The musical bios are all cut from the same fabric. Hopeful fights, she succeeds and eventually the girl wins, but this one - a life of the Irish tenor, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - is more successful than the usual traps. It has great charm and great sincerity and is interpreted beautifully by all interested parties. Dennis Morgan is good in the head and Arlene Dahl is her love interest. Andrea King's supporting performance as Lillian Russell is far better than Alice Faye's organic performance in the film dedicated to her career. William Frawley is moving when the elderly tenor champion, William Scanlon, and Sara Allgood are adorable as Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale lend good support. There are over 25 songs (a real treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; My Nellie's Blue Eyes; You tell me your dream; Wait Till The Sun Shines, Nellie; Will Love Me Me in December? By The Light Of The Silvery Moon; Minstrel days; Polly Wolly Doodle; The Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; If I'm dreaming; Wee Rose of Killarney; Shake hands; A little girl A little paradise; Maria; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When the Irish eyes smile; Mother Machree; The Kerey fair; Room in my heart; My Wild Irish Rose. <br /> <br /> Although the film has only earned an Oscar for scoring - and deservedly, it also deserves a nod of Art Direction and Costume Design - sumptuous and beautiful in Technicolor. <br /> <The reasons why this is not in the video may be due to the large amount of time spent in the Minstrel Show atmosphere - at least for a quarter of the film - with a large amount of fairly politically INCORRECT material for today's audience. It is historically accurate, however. <br /> <br /> This is a real gem and worth finding. It leaves one with a warm light.
