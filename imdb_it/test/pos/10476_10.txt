This film tells all there is to say about religion - I wish it was necessary to see all the fanatics and aspiring ecclesiastics. <br /> <br /> The story, set in a Danish village at the end of the century, is of two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and explored the world and its so many beauties. Now they are old and have spent their lives and beauty. Their quiet new help - which they "teach" to cook - is Babette (played by the adorable Stephane Audran who has graced so many films by her husband Claude Chabrol). Life in the village is simple and the rigid direction reflects it. <br /> <br /> When Babette wins the lottery, she asks for the possibility of preparing a party - a real labor of love. The course of the party and its main guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a must for the devotion with which Babette prepares the party and for the speech that the General gives at the end. Perhaps the best international film of the 80s.
