I saw this film "miniseries" on television in 1989 and it was a fantastic film. I'd like to track down a copy just to see it again and again. It's been 15 years since I looked at it and it continues to resonate in my mind. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it draws you in. The characters and the plot hold you back. The finish was magnificent. The feeling and anger that the child shows when he finds out the truth about his father are unforgettable. The suspense on how it will end and how he will face his father is really intense. <br /> <br /> If you can get a copy of this movie, you'll have a great time watching it. <br /> <br /> So send me an e-mail and tell me where I can get a copy.
