Whether one sees him as a gallant knight of the plains or a glory that chases the egocentric, the debates about the life and military career of George Armstrong Custer continue to this day. They died with their boots On show some facts from Custer's history and took liberty with others. <br /> <br /> He actually graduated from his class at West Point and got this promotion overnight on the battlefield to the Brigadier. His drive that led the Michigan regiment under his command was one of genius. <br /> <br /> It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love encounters of the nineteenth century. Libby and George have been married for 12 years up to The Little Big Horn. What is not known to today's public is that Libby survived until 1933. During that time he was the guardian of the Custer legend. Due to her iron will and her strong personality, her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way. <br /> <br /> I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to have Custer's career told in flashbacks. Olivia DeHavilland should have been invented in the way Jeanette MacDonald was at Maytime and tell the story of her husband and her marriage in terms of nostalgia and memory. Even then the cracks in the Custer legend appeared, but if made from Libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet performed well as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, he was retired and replaced by George B. McClellan in late 1861 while Custer was still at West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful Winfield Scott. A beautiful story of the Mexican war should have been what they gave to Greenstreet instead for his careful portrayal of the old Fuss and Feathers. <br /> <br /> The film is brought by one of the great romantic film teams, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of eight films that they did together. The last scene they ever did for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George as he leaves to join his regiment for what will be his last campaign. Both of their performances, especially those of Olivia, have been a highlight in their career at Warner Brothers. We know through history that Custer is riding his destiny, and that the fact that this was their last team of writers gives this scene such a special intensity. If your eyes don't get wet, you're made of marble. <br /> <br /> As a story they died with their boots In leaves leaves much to be desired. As a western adventure that successfully mixes romance with action, you can't beat this movie.
