Two Hands restored my confidence in Australian films. It took an old premise and made it fresh. I liked this endless movie. I recommend it to those people who love Guy Ritchie movies. Bryan Brown was fantastic and almost perfect in a role tailored to him. Ledger was absolutely stupid and his performance anchored a very satisfying film for me.
