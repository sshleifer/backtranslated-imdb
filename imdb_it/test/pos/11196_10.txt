I like one of the best films of all time and everyone has to make this film. I'm a Turkish guy and a great fun movie. and these days our film industry is skyrocketing. And UZAK is the best Turkish film of the last ten years. And perhaps one of the best films of all time. The nuri sentinel ceylan director is quite surprising. History, characters, atmosphere is wonderful. Is a minimalist director and tells the routine of family events, dreams, expectations, life. Talk about you, tell about me, tell about us. I promise you will find a piece of your body in this movie. Life in film welcomes a new director. It is waiting to be realized. I promise you will love this movie please watch it
