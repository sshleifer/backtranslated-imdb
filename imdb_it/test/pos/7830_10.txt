This is one of the most fun movies ever made. And for those of you who don't understand, it should be fun. So often the comedies try to be so intentionally fun to miss, but here's finally a movie that manages to be hilarious in the thinnest way possible. Even the "spoofs" lack the originality and naturalness of this film. It's a classic comic that will surely be appreciated at another time when the studios are doing this kind of thing regularly. congratulations to the producers and to a hilarious cast of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are of a high standard. Really, a real show of stars by a true underrated stage actor. It will be nice to see this guy get his due.
