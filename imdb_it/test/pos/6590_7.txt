So far, Miguel Bardem's career has been one of the most terrible in recent Spanish cinema. He has done nothing but rubbish ... until now. "Incautos" was rather a surprise: it is a serious film, with rhythm, with an exceptional and very funny cast. <br /> <br /> The art of stealing, that's what "Incautos" means. A film very similar to "House of game" by David Mamet and things like that. A thousand twists in the script and a story in which nothing is as it seems. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses of Bardem's latest film could be the American language, which makes some of the characters a bit unnatural (especially Victoria Abril. She is an infernal actress, but in "incautos" it seems like a little forced). Ernesto Alterio is not so bad, but he is not as good an actor as his father ... And what about Luppi ?? Well, he's the man. <br /> <br /> In short: a good movie. The best Miguel Bardem has ever done. I hope this is the beginning of a new stage in your career. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
