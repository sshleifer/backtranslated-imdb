I'm tired and sick of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes, the influence of that film is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of the re-made films is reserved for such reckless and unintelligent films as the 1998 remake of Psycho. While it is true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and last Connery film) of Bond is one of the worst of the whole series, the film itself still manages to stand alone, despite many other weaknesses. In addition to this, even the song of the weak title is made to join perfectly with the closing dialogue in the film. Surely, Sean Connery was getting a little younger when this film was shot (at least James Bond Standard), but there is a lot of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this wasn't exactly unknown to the filmmakers. James Bond is nearing retirement before being given his assignment, having spent most of his time teaching, not doing so, and there is even a tongue in his throat because of M's insistence that he pays more attention to his health, diet and training and more exercise and more. Also, this is James Bond, remember? This guy should be kind of super human, and all his fans are getting angry because he has gray hair. When this boy retires at the end of the film, M sends poor "Small-Fawcett" (in a hilarious cameo by Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond that without him he worries about the security of the free world and I can't overcome the fact that he is no longer a lively boy. Come on, Sean Connery might STILL play James Bond in the best possible way, or at least better than anyone else has ever been able. <br /> <br /> Most of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, "Oh hell, let's just do what we always do ??") , so clearly there is not much new there, but this is one of the James Bond films that had better linings. Is there a funny scene in which Bond is asked for a urine sample? "If I could fill this glass for me ??" "From here?" There are many good jokes, but the sexual allusions addressed to Mr. Bond are particularly widespread in this episode. But then later he happens to throw that urine sample in the face of a villain, making him scream as if his face was burning. It's not a good attempt at comic relief, especially since this guy had kicked Bond's butt with some sort of super-spring device that could cut pretty much anything. And of course, Kim Basinger is the protagonist of this film as one of the best Bond girls in the entire series. <br /> <br /> Isn't it a secret that Never Say Never Again is dated badly, and one of the things that came out the worst is the special effects ?? with the sole exception of flying missiles, which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982. Colored contact lenses at the beginning of the film were totally lacking in effect and the laser clock was one of the worst things in the whole film, second only to those damned sharks. Evidently, Fatima Blush put a kind of device in her shark-tank (guaranteed, they had strange driving mechanisms) in a scene that most likely inspired the classic line, "I have a simple request. And that is have sharks with FRICKIN's laser beams attached to their heads! And then, of course, there's the explosive scene of the hotel room that was redone in an episode of The Simpsons, and that was obviously followed by a another obligatory and too casual one-liner by James. <br /> <br /> Domination The videogame created by Largo, the villain of the film, is a particularly memorable scene, and the film also boasts what is probably the best chase in motion of the whole series (from afar to superior to the ridiculous one of Tomorrow Never Dies.) But despite many strengths, the weaknesses of the film are left clearer in the mind of the public at the end of the film, largely due to the at the conclusion anticlimatic underwater (one of the most obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball, and recreated below). Never mind that Largo revealed some crucial information to Bond, leaving him alive in the tower (Dr. Evil's splendor, once again, "I'll leave him there without actually witnessing his death and assuming that everything went as planned. What ? '), The climax of what should be a fast-paced action film should never take place in an underground atmosphere. <br /> <br /> All in all, Never Say Never Again fits very well into James's scale Bond, and Connery's wink at the end of the film (as well as the two closing lines) suggested at the time that he could still come back for another round as Bond. Clearly, this is no longer very probable, so we can only hope.
