There are subtleties in this film that I think many people might lose if they are not careful. You really need to follow what Leland says and read his character to understand the "why" of the film presented at the end. Nothing solid, it's not defined, it's about what the individual spectator takes out. I think this was the plan from the beginning, people are not meant to understand it all the same, it's almost like forming your personal relationship with Leland to feel it a little better. <br /> <br /> The plot is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is. It is dramatic and stimulating, many heavy ideas, but the rhythm of the film is almost relaxing, even with the most intense scenes with screams. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost serene, even for all his sadness. The film personifies Leland in a sense. <br /> <br /> Of course it is captivating and attracts you if you leave it, but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has a lot of awesome dialogues, he's anything but typical, but he's not a prophet. All he says is not a revelation, many people I know have mentioned the things he mentioned, I also observed some things he observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character that is probably mainly for the portrait of Ryan Gosling. <br /> <br /> In the end the acting is exceptional, there are no real villains, there is no way to evaluate psychologically Leland, just to understand him and life a little better. <br /> <br /> Comparable to Igby Goes Down I think, not comical, but similar in its general view of life.
