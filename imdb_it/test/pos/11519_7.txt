Fascinating and fun, Lights of New York is the first function of talkies and one that has almost never seen the light of day. <br /> <br /> Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) from out of town are involved with bootleggers and end up facing a speech. When a policeman is hit by one of the smugglers, the police start to close and the hawk (who shot the officer) decides to blame the murder on Eddie who orders his henchman to "take him for a ride". But it is the same Falco who takes the bullet in a turn that will not surprise. <br /> <br /> Filmed in a week at a cost of $ 23,000, "Lights" was originally intended as a two reeler but Foy took advantage of the absence of Jack Warner to extend it to six. When Warner discovered it, he ordered Foy to reduce it to the original short. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $ 25k for the film, did Warner actually watch the film, which made an astonishing $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> Seen now this is an extremely eccentric piece, with recitation ranging from the passable (Eugene Pallette) to trance like (Eddie's Granny in a particularly ridiculous scene) and much of the game is at the level of vaudeville. Since it's an early talkie (4 share-talkies preceded it) this affects all the characters, and very slowly. The script seems to be improvised, the visual style is non-existent (apart from the scene in silhouette) and the scenes follow one another in an interminable way. The title cards are intercut which announce characters and places redundantly. <br /> <br /> Despite all this "Lights" is a compelling experience, as we watch the actors and the crew grappling with alien technology and changing cinema forever. /> <br /> Take it if you can
