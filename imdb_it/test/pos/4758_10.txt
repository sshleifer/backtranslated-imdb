Having grown up in New Jersey and having spent many days and nights in the gritty streets of New York in the 70s, watching a movie like "The Seven-Ups", or his kindred spirit, "The French Connection", always evokes fond memories of a time and a place that, for some, may have been the darkest hour in New York, but for me, in my first twenty years, it was always an adventure full of fun after another. I really miss those times. As one review noted, "This film captures very well the rigid, cold and concrete feeling of the New York winter season, while keenly exposing the weak point of the infamous underworld of crime and the police, a time and a culture." A punctual characterization of the film and the city. The stellar attributes of this film - the plot, the cast, the characters and, of course, the car chase - are widely described in many of the reviews here, so I won't go into that, except to say that one of my moments favorites occur during the car chase, when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch driving the rifle to the maniac Bill Hickman. The expression of horror on Richard Lynch's face, along with defensive gestures, is so out of character for an actor much more known as a source of terror rather than an object of it, which is actually comic to watch. Every time it makes me laugh.
