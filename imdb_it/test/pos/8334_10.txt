A cartoon SUPERMAN. <br /> <br /> When America unveils its colossal new bomber, the JAPOTEURS, an elite force of Japanese spies and saboteurs, strikes. Stealing the behemoth, with the intrepid reporter of the girl Lois Lane on board, and the destination in Tokyo or destruction, it's time for Superman to get involved ... <br /> <br /> This was another of the series of excellent cartoons initially created by Max Fleischer for Paramount Studio. They have great animations and tense and fast textures. Designed to be screened in cinemas, it is far ahead of its Saturday morning counterparts. Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman; Joan Alexander honors Lois Lane.
