I'm a big horror fan and I really enjoyed this remake. With all these floating horror remakes I think this is one of the best attempts. I saw him with my two little sisters and I think he improved because they were pretty scared. Even with the screams on the screen "Don't do it!", "Not this way!" <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is absolutely stunning in the title role and a very good actress - so you keep your attention well. <br /> <br /> Overall a decent film.
