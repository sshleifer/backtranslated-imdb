Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far produced 2 theatrical feature films and a third is coming this summer. <br /> <br /> The first, released in the summer of 2004, was a fun adventure with the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, you must be a blind, deaf and one-legged chicken to deny the flaws in that film. While the first one was definitely fun, there were many things that could be improved. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all these aspects and excels on them. <br /> <br /> The action first and foremost was incredibly cinematic. The lighting, the setting and the style were three times more effective than the first film. In the first we were given a basic animation, well animated and choreographic animation, but nothing amazing, however the film's cinematography was exceptional, the use of shadows and lights that combined to make the action all the more intense it was very effective and added to the strength of combat. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. He competed with Disney, but since this is a film about television characters, there was nothing exceptional about character design or the details of real characters, however, the animation was incredibly smooth and realistic. I think they used twice the amount of cels per second because there was absolutely nothing nervous about the animation, it was incredibly fluid. <br /> <br /> The music ... I think it's where this movie fails. The original composer / conductor for the TV show was used for the film, and I don't really think he did that good job. The music reminded me especially of many pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film failed to convey the melody very well. However the film did not fail at all, adding a good accompaniment to the action. But, with the exception of some pieces of violin / strings towards the end and some choral work, the music has never crossed the boundaries and has not involved anything special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a fairly normal storyline for Naruto and was very similar to the first films, except, again, it took everything that was wrong in the story of the first movie and improved on them. The characters were much more interesting and the way the story progressed was what made me watch the whole movie. He kept making you think the movie would end at any moment, but then he would go on, but instead of feeling dragged out, the action and the characters made it all still fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a goodun, but however good it may be, it is definitely one for the fans. I liked the movie, but that's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see, just like with Final Fantasy's Advent Children, it's not as good as a movie, but simply serves as a fantastic fan service for a good hour and a half. Although I think this film represents a good introduction to the series for current non-observers, it will not give a complete effect to anyone other than the one glued to Naruto's screens. However, despite all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of annoying fillers.
