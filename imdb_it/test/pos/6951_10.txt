I was really surprised when I discovered this film on cable TV a couple of years ago. History is a wonderful example of how our land continues to change and the struggle to cling to it and use it according to need. Desires in conflict between "the people" and the government. The actors were fantastic in their portraits and I fell in love with Cardinal Tantoo, she is so believable and was such a character in this film, as was Rip Torn. The story was also a love story on earth, the past and between the 2 main characters. I tried to buy this movie and I wasn't able to locate it, but I'd certainly like to own it.
