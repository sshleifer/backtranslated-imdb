A demonstration that a film does not need to have a multi-layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. Even if the story could be expanded in many directions, especially in a more sociological way (people want money), it seems to be perfect as it is. Through many sudden changes, he brings the viewer to the end without unnecessary complications and without letting the viewer take the eyes of the screen. <br /> <br /> But acting is not so good for me. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon the others were average or even worse. In some scenes they simply emptied their eyes in front of themselves. With the exception of Lindsey who was more convincing. It's a really simple movie to relax and have fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
