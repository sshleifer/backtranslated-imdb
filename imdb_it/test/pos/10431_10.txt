Eric Bogosian's ability to move from character to character in this "one man show" shows his true range as a character actor. Each person has his own message to communicate truth, society, class, drugs, etc. This is an absolute must for anyone who is an avid acting actor! His performance contains some of the most fun and real moments I've ever experienced as a viewing audience.
