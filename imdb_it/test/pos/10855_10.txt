"Tipping The Velvet" is one of today's TV productions that shows that some televisions can be just as good or even better (like this) than you see in your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the plot, read this and if you want more details go to the next paragraph. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional girl named Nan who works as a naive oyster girl, until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty who dresses as a boy for her theatrical profession. The young girl soon joins another male imitator and is a great success. Soon they both embarked on a tender affair. Kitty eventually becomes wrapped in a marriage of convenience and upsets the heart of young Nan. From that moment, Nan works as a prostitute played by men for men who want to have sex with boys, then she becomes the private sex slave of the wicked and sadomasochist Diana where Nan suffers severe emotional abuse. When it ends badly, Nan is back on the street where she remembers a young woman named Florence; a good-hearted socialist who has the true potential of being a wonderful partner. That's where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame. <br /> <br /> The transfer of region 1 has exceptional image quality, there is a good selection of scenes, an elegant photo gallery and a funny interview between the writer Sara Waters and the film's writer Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> The sets, costumes, cinematography and music are wonderful. Acting, writing and directing are extremely strong and full of realism, class and originality. I loved the film and the novel. Section III of the film is very different in the film than in the novel, because section III of the novel is large written, but is not material for the screen. I will be brave and say that I love the interpretation of films. <br /> <br /> This breathtaking historian cleverly combines Drama, Comedy, Erotica and Romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is deeply moving and spiritually uplifting. For every mature and open minded adult who has ever experienced the pleasures, pains and power to fall in love and live life to its fullest. A revolutionary production; an absolute must see!
