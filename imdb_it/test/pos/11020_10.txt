I like movies about eccentric people. "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest" is perhaps my all-time favorite, so you can imagine that I enjoyed it a lot. It is definitely not to look at if you want to leave smiling. This film is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are definitely terrifying, even after multiple visions (because this kind of thing can really happen). It will surely keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the ride. And after seeing the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you should really control yourself for an impulse. <br /> <br /> The acting was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette, goes from eccentric-cute to completely terrifying, sometimes appearing so out of control that she looks like the undead. Seth was also fantastic. The focal point of the film does not fall so much on him as on Marcy, even though it seems to be the one that gains the greatest momentum as a flowering character. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story with some unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story alongside "True Romance". There are two bad reviews for this up here, but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his data in the clear and admitted he didn't see the whole movie, while the other one was just looking for some Hollywood thrills without the deep characters (and perhaps he was a little disconcerted by the apparent superficiality of the plot, given that the ultimate goal revolves around the theft of a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this film is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "carefree". This is as messed up and indie as it can be, and it won't let you go until the climax.
