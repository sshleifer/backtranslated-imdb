There are some things in life that we cannot experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we live in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. The main character of Xavier leaves his orderly life in Paris, his former hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a French doctor and makes friends that makes him look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the roommates) comes from England, the film starts to get a lot more fun. Well, in any case, Xavier starts to see things differently with all his new friends and probably lives something that he will never forget and will change his life forever. Overall a very beautiful nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting thanks to the multinational cast. I thought it was very interesting to see all these kids from different countries, all of whom speak different languages ​​and that different cultures get along and are fun. I gave a 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thinking about things I haven't done while I'm still in college and I would like to do before it's too late.
