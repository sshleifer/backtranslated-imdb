My God, this was a fantastic movie. Every time we look, it takes us to another place in "WOW". Rhett & Scarlett have been brilliantly interpreted by Joanne and Timothy. They did a fantastic job reviewing the roles of our two favorite heroes. All! It's a must see ..... Don't deprive yourself of this movie. If you love Gone With The Wind you will love this mini series. Go to Rhett !!! Go to Scarllett !!!
