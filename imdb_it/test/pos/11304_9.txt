I must say that in general Barbie's films have impressed me. I have a 5-year-old granddaughter Barbie and she looks at them all the time, so needless to say, I've seen a lot of Barbie in these holidays, but I'm not sick of it. <br /> <br /> This film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and character animation is improved with each new movie. One thing I noticed in particular was a huge improvement in Barbie's hair animation in this movie. It has a nice range of classical music tracks and I think it's great, because it exposes a new generation to the classics. This film is worth it, especially if you have young breeders. They will be entertained for hours!
