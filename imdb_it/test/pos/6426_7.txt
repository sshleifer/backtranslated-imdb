Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator who lives in Italy, discovers she has a memory loss and does not remember the last two days. She begins to follow a trace of fragments of memory, which lead her to the small town of Garma. People in the city seem to recognize it and are beginning to suspect that the coming nightmares of astronauts who conduct horrible experiments have something to do with its own amnesia. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting and the plot is good, but it is a bit slow to move and artistic for my taste. The plot takes some twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's going. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "Flavia the heretic") and it's always nice to see the protagonist "protagonist" Nocoletta Elmi. The role of Klaus Kinski is too small though. This is not a movie for the passionate gore or passionate about exploitation, but it is still a beautiful mystery of an hour and a half.
