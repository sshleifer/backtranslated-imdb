I write this after having just seen the last episode in the UK, and it must be hard work for me to keep the standard. The last episode shown called "Blink" has elements of gothic horror that have to do with statues that are not quite as they seem. The Doctor and Martha do not appear much, but this does not detract from a well realized episode. The general standard has reached a high level and the last three episodes, the two parters with "The Family" and the last were for me the best that the current team has ever done. <br /> <br /> It's not just David Tennant who holds it together, even the entire support cast week by week helps. For those expecting the 3 series abroad, the wait was worth it.
