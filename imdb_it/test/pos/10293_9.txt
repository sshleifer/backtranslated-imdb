When I saw L'Appartement with my girlfriend, he sighed: "How complicated!" And you're right, of course. When you're used to simple, one-sided plots, especially violent schemes of heroes against scammers, L'Appartement is hard to follow. Even a couple of negative reviewers have lost one or more important points. More whining about confused flashbacks. Come on! This is not the kind of movie to start in the bathroom, go back and get back in touch in seconds. This requires full concentration and a keen eye for detail. So it's not really that hard to understand what's going on and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all the scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film focuses on the question: why did Max and Lisa split up? The film, as my girlfriend observed, begins as a romantic love, suggesting that two lost lovers will find themselves again. Having experience with French films, I predicted that the story would soon become a negative turn and I was right. At the end of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max didn't know, that Lisa was gone and why. Lisa didn't know, because Max didn't contact her in Rome and left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had the same reasons to keep her mouth shut. <br /> <br /> After both Max and Lisa have discovered the truth, the question obviously becomes: can Alice's manipulations be canceled? Well, of course not, time has passed and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use a narrative technique that I fully appreciate. There is no exposure of the basic conflict at the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide for their own benefit. Instead the viewer is gradually fed with fragments of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. The Appartement is a subtle and subtle example of this technique. In the first time Alice appears to be a secondary character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is the key figure. <br /> <br /> Acting is simply fantastic. Vincent Cassel is perfect as a somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a safe life only to drive a dream of the past. Monica Belucci is obviously very beautiful, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comic touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, tormented by guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is the end that is a bit unsatisfactory. Of course, it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events, Max is exactly where the film started, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But the small twists on the airport are still a bit artificial. Max exchanges Lisa too easily for Alice; Even Alice decides easily to refuse Max, who has been his dream for so long; Max easily returns to his girlfriend. But then again, I don't know how this can be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I imagine that sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.
