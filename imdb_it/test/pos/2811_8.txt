Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar as Saved By The Bell? Of course it's not fair, it's ridiculous. And is it right to give this film a "10" rating? Hahahahahaha ... it's fun. This film was not so horrible; better than I expected. Movies created for TV are often so similar. So many of them have the same feeling for them. This had the same feeling, but it worked even though it was still another tortured wife who has to get the b * stard in the final story. Before he started, I had imagined Ms. Thiessen as a 90210 type violinist seductress, but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski who was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me by playing his part very well. With decent writing, the director achieved a rather good and convincing performance without being at all shoddy. All in all it was a bit interesting, definitely better than most TV movies. My vote: B-
