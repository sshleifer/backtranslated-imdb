this brought me back to my childhood in the fifties in a silly but really fabulous way that no one could ever play FLASH GORDON like LARRY BUSTER CRABBE, simply fantastic. I have two other series to see the journey of the gordon flash on Mars and the gordon flash conquers that the universe cannot wait <br /> <br />
