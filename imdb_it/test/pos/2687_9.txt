As in the last ten years or even longer, the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (in reality only very few deserve this title because they are so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and incredibly fun alternative. It's about the daily life of a bellhop and his wife working as a legal assistant in Manhattan, Queens, New York. With them lives the father of Carrie Arthur, an extroverted picture book, played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from everyone else whenever it appears. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, a married couple, and their other friend Spence, who is almost 30 and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and fun is, above all, that every single character seems so real and Carrie's cynical and sarcastic attitude is the exact opposite of Doug's kindly obtuse optimism. And Arthur is what makes his strange ideas and habits absolutely unpredictable. He often gets into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to drag him out of the mud. Although in my opinion the quality of the show has decreased a little in recent years, it is still one of the best sitcoms ever made. It takes some time to enter the characters and relate to them, but once finished, you get some unstoppable laughs. Although I think I could not survive one day with Arthur in a closed room without blinking, I really love him in this show. Look and have fun, I give him a 9 out of 10.
