putting aside the "I'm so sure" and "totally gnarly" this is one of the sweetest and most realistic novels portrayed in the film. deborah foreman (where is she now?) as julie and nicolas cage as randy are classic like romeo and giulietta, tony and maria, jake and samantha ... you can't help but fall in love with them. moreover, the soundtrack - the plimsouls, the sparks, the furs, the flirts and, of course, modern English - is also exceptional. for fans of films about youth love, I would also recommend the recent film to all the real girls of david gordon green.
