I saw this movie last night at Phila. Film Festival. It was an interesting and entertaining film with captivating and moving scenes. Peter Falk was as excellent as the rest of the cast. They were credible and played their roles well. The film could be a bit long and the conclusion went well. The public laughed in the right places. Family dynamics were fantastic and, although it was a Jewish family, they could be Italian, Irish or any other, including Greek. I recommend this movie if you are interested in laughing at a topic that is not often managed in this way. IOT makes you think about the consequences of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those that are not clearly in your life.
