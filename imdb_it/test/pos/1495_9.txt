"Mr. Bean", played by the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a great success during his run in the 90s, and I probably saw it for the first time when I was about ten, shortly after the end, so I saw the replicas. At the time I wasn't a fan at all and I didn't see too many episodes. I didn't enter the show until my teenage years, just a few years ago, when I finally saw every episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, it's always been like that during repeated episodes! <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a mysterious, egocentric, antisocial, extremely naive fool whose best friend is his Teddy! He is practically isolated from society, and life is not easy for him, for he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks a fairly basic knowledge and has the mind of a child. He finds himself in various kinds of problems wherever he goes, and presents himself with very bizarre ways of trying to solve the problems he faces! Not only does it often cause problems for itself, but sometimes also for other people, who often do not tend to realize! In other words, Mr. Bean is a walking disaster! <br /> <br /> The humor in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. The gags are almost always gags of sight, which is mainly what the show is about. Although there may be an occasional lackluster gag, I would say that the vast majority of them are funny, often hilarious (there are so many highlights)! While "Mr. Bean" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it is still exceptional for many of those who like visual humor, and thanks to very limited dialogue, you don't even have to speak fluent English to enjoy the show, why he received such a worldwide reputation! The show lasted for a few years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only fourteen were made in total. Nevertheless, it is a classic series and deserves all its charm!
