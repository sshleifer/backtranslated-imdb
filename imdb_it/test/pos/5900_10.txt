In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb forum when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie: <br /> <br /> ***** For me watching this movie is like open on a time capsule. I think that in many ways "The Best Years of Our Lives" is probably one of the most fascinating character studies and holds up very well as a look at life in the United States in the mid-1940s after the Second World War. I believe that "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter", both published in 1978, were the most recent films that were the closest to capturing the many issues of military returning from the war that were raised in "The Best Years of Our Lives ". <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was watching the film in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many, if not all university students applauded at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This film still contains a wallop and I am very happy to read other users in other posts the feeling of a film that will surely stand the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see the film ranked in the top 100 films on IMDb and AFI. Moreover, even though he was competing with what eventually became a Christmas classic, It's a Wonderful Life, probably the Best Years of Our Lives Oscars, including the Best Film Oscar, were well deserved. <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully performed and beautifully made film.
