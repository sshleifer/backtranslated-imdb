I didn't expect much when I decided to watch this movie, so I was surprised to find myself completely amused. A couple of scenes made me laugh almost uncontrollably. The characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. The fun comes from watching Crawl (the character of Shore), a wise Californian guy that a country student brings home for Thanksgiving, looking in his awkward (but captivating) way to adapt to their lifestyle. He also surprised me that there was a message in all this. If you get the chance, watch this movie!
