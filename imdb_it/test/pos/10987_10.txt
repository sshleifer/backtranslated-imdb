The manna from heaven is heavenly. This is a film for the family - kids and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it's not syrupy, sweet or silly. The characters are really "characters". The plot is quite complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a puzzle together while everything goes well a little at a time. The beginning of the period is like looking at an old photo album or remembering when. It is extremely well done with very precise hairstyles and costumes. The story moves quickly with twists, turns and a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> A special treatment is to watch the cast of familiar faces, many of which we haven't seen for a long time. Part of the fun is to recognize them and mentally name them as they appear, although this can be distracting. Cloris Leachman at the end of the film seems to have had a make-over on "Oprah". I had never seen Faye Grant in a movie - I only knew her as Grace's mother in the TV series "Saving Grace". It was fantastic, even without the southern accent. And I didn't even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this beautiful film are a very talented quintet and Sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
