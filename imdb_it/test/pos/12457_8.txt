I thought it was a very bold representation of the old concept of 'Tarzan' of hokey made so popular by Hollywood, Weismuller, and others. <br /> <br /> Yes; there are many stupid things. But then, the idea is stupid. It is almost unbelievable that a human child can be brought to adulthood by chimpanzees. I am tempted to say absolutely incredible, but the concept has never been tried. And there is certainly a little too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Even if, under the circumstances, I can see how it would be very difficult to avoid. We now also have a much broader view of the problems of acculturation, and we know that a human being raised without a human behavioral guide will eventually never learn them in adulthood. <br /> <br /> Yet, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a lot to admire that is both imaginative and bold. Lambert does the thing of the beast with tremendous ease. I'm tempted to say that it's the most convincing and understanding role I've ever seen. There are many other excellent performances. No less important are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. <br /> <br /> What is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the perception of monkeys about humans. We see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor brutes, mute and helpless, on whom we command them so habitually. And it clearly shows how the false 'civilization' and 'morality' with which we hide and justify our conduct, is nothing more than an expression of our own selfishness and arrogance. Sometimes it may seem a bit exaggerated, especially in the horrible dissecting rooms of museums, but what we see is not just a truth about the Victorians; it's a truth about how we are today. It is one that must be declared and cannot be declared often enough. The obsession of the character of Holm with the "ray-zor" as a symptom of civilization - as if possessing facial hair was a primitive condition to disdain - is an excellent example. Primitive bearded readers take note. <br /> <br /> The story is depressing. After all, it's a tragedy. Because even if it returns to the jungle and freedom from moral tyranny which is truly human "civilization"; we know he is doomed. Before the third millennium turns 50, wild monkeys will be hunted as bush meat and their environment developed for agriculture and mining to gratify insatiable human excess. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a story of ourselves The path to extinction that other monkeys are going through, must eventually be followed by humans. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for its ethical grip, despite hockey moments.
