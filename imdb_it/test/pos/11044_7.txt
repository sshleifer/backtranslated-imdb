'Anne Christie' was Garbo's fourteenth film and the first in which his Swedish voice was heard. He plays the main character, Anna, who struggled to be abandoned by his father Chris (owner of a drunken barge played by George F Marion), and with the misfortune of life that must lead to keeping his head above water. <br /> Meeting Irish Matt (Charles Bickford) could mark the turning point for you ... or does it? Garbo has a look and a great sound in this drama that, despite being rather clumsy and moving at a slow pace, still manages to interest and involve an audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler has an impact in the role that brought her a second success in the film in films such as Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than adequate. <br /> <br /> An interesting slice of the history of cinema. Garbo would have made the best talkies in the following years, but "Anna Christie" will always be remembered for the first time he spoke on the screen.
