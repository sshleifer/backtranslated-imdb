I saw the longer version and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had passed. the characters were very believable and amusing, and the photography was excellent. history attracted me and caught my attention. I will definitely watch it again and again. this true story tells the best ... not the usual cheap chills and the pomp of the skin. I've seen a lot of reviews on this movie. most seem to shoot the movie or give it a weak eulogy. after all, it's a great film that has received unfair reviews. watch it for yourself with an open mind. if you like westerns, pieces of a historical period, even if historically inaccurate you will enjoy the movie. Superb !!! 10/10
