Although this film does not have the darkness of books, it is in my opinion a great film. It's great campy fun with the beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be honest, it wouldn't be nice with blond hair, and Lestat definitely looks good. It moves like the predator that I always imagined that Lestat would have had. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not an interview with the Vampire, so don't try to compare the two. The interview is the story of Louis. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat. In any case, I highly recommend it.
