This movie has it all! It has a good plot, good acting, great scenery, adventure and some brilliant gags! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe, the mega successful company "Callaghan Auto Parts" must get in the way to stop the company that will go into crisis after Big Tom's death. The trouble is that Tommy knows nothing about break-down blocks and needs the help of Richard Callaghan Auto Parts (David Spade). From the moment the two big dogs reach the road, the film is so funny. If you love slapstick with a fantastic plot you'll like it a lot because the gags keep getting thick and fast and the movie will make you laugh out loud! He was so sad about Farley's untimely death in 1997, but his genius is "Tommy Boy". Take it, relax and enjoy this fantastic slapstick!
