In Hong Kong, in 1962, the publisher Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband move into an old building simultaneously. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Most of the time, his wife and husband stay away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they love kung-fu stories and spaghetti and restaurant soap near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their companions have a relationship, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but his shyness and probably the repressed condition of the married woman keeps his love in a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a script and the actors were never sure what they would shoot. Subsequently, the director edited his story based on the videos. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in history until 1966, when his conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions like who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Amor Ã€ Flor da Pele' ('Love on the surface of the skin')
