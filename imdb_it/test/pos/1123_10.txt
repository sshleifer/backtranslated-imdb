This show is absolutely fantastic. It provides all the great drama and romance of kid shows like The OC and Dawsons, but it's a lot more fun. It is a show with morals and values, without everything being covered in sugar and sterilized (wing 7th Heaven). We have no sororities or brotherhoods in Australia, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how accurate the Greek life portrayed is. But I don't care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can make me love a murderous, confederate racist and homophobic biblical hitter must be brilliant. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. Sorry Josh Jackson, you've been dethroned!
