I had never seen this film before it was broadcast on a local sci-fi network. It reminded me of the TV series by Irwin Allen from the late 1960s (Time Tunnel, etc.). Excellent effects (they beat Star Trek 5 20 years later, but then it wasn't very difficult to do). <br /> <br /> I found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production. They would have needed a little tweaking to tie some free ends to the level of the characters, but for a film for children it is surprisingly interesting (especially the look at the futuristic Europolitics, surprisingly similar to today's European Union!) <br /> < br /> The plot really remembers Twilight Zone in general (as other users have pointed out), but in this case it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Big sets, by the way! <br /> 7/10
