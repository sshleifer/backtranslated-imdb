Two people living in the same complex apartment find that their partners have a mutual relationship. While trying to reconstruct together how it happened, they also embark on an emotional journey that requires resolution ?? <br /> <br /> Based on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai offers us this rather old and wonderful story of awakened passions, desire and unrequited love. <br /> <br /> Possibly, In the Mood for Love is not for everyone. He wanders quite lazily at 98 minutes: not particularly long for a film, but it seems longer because it doesn't happen much. But this lazy feeling hides a fairly well-structured film. Most of the story is cleverly entwined around a series of role-playing games, where the characters play alleged scenarios between their spouses, trying to understand how the relationship started. I say cunning because, of course, this makes it difficult for the public (and the characters) to say what is "in-role" and what is genuine. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds rather artistic and self-conscious, it is because it is. So unfortunately. And it is played to perfection by two of the most beautiful in Hong Kong, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. <br /> <br /> It is also a virtuous performance by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the public of a sensory and sensual overload. Putting together Christopher Doyle (who later explained his lustful and over-mature style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose wonderfully underrated style can be seen in Springtime in a Small Town) was a cinematic genius. He has all the bold beauty of Doyle, without, frankly, the joy of Athena's poster of his work on Hero. Music, as always with Wong, is prominent. From the singing of Nat King Cole in Spanish, to the disturbing strings of the main theme, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> All in all an exceptional film, judged on plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than, Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful old-fashioned story about lost and regained love. <br /> <br /> And watch out for Tony Leung's 2046 hotel room, which foretold Wong's recent film of the same name.
