The Emperor and the Assassin (with English subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but time is full of a story that barely fits. Scenes of golden palaces and yellow and dusty landscapes of Chinese landscapes a true story of the unifying king of China, around 300 BC. An intricate plot with a myriad of twists is played with excellent portraits of the cast. King Qin's simple desire for a unified Empire for his common people is satisfied, but not without betrayal, plots and consideration and oh yes, bodies. Lots of bodies. This epic story of early China is a great way for Westerners to catch a glimpse of little-known Asian history. Emperor Qin's legacy includes the thousands of life-size terracotta figures that are still excavated today. As a historical figure, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin should be considered along with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, to name some of the greatest conquerors / statesmen in the world. I highly recommend seeing The Emperor and the Assassin, especially on the big screen.
