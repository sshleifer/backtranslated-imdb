This is another of Robert Altman's undervalued films (let's be honest, the only film that realized it didn't work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives us a fascinating performance. It is much better here than in "The Out of Towners". The material, I will admit, is below the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that doesn't matter. As long as we are allowed to do their thing and do it well, any story will be fine.
