"Best in Show" is an often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners preparing for the event. The only thing that separates this film from real dog shows is that dogs in "Best in Show" act healthier than their owners! The stuff of a first-rate cast including Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the film), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Christopher Guest (who collaborated with Levy and directed) . They're all fun, but Fred Willard steals the movie with his explosive fun show as the dog announcer who says the most outrageous things. Also, dogs are nice too. "Best in Show" is not exactly the riot of laughter I was expecting, but there are laughs and it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
