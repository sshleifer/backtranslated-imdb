I loved this movie. Not because of romantic stories among women, but because of the visualization of human strength, desperation and liberation. This film is a must see. Funny! Emotional! Captivating! All the characters are very well written and interpreted by gifted actors. This story is a story of personal discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of mind, body and soul. You find yourself identifying with the characters and in some places, even in the plot. <br /> <br /> I have to say I recommend watching the movie first, then reading the book. If you read the book first, you will be slightly disappointed. The adaptation of the script is very intense and some things have changed. Some for the better and others for the worst.
