Pink Flamingos: A representation of the society's past <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a film directed by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrait of the negative impact that a traumatized childhood can have on future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. Conspicuously, you can see the impact this has had on society through its actions until the end where she swallows dog feces. Was this film just a sick and distorted perversion of endless occurrences, or did it symbolize something much deeper? Next to the first would be the easy way and to the side with the latter it might seem demented, but probably true. The film has some credible resemblance to the real events of our social past. Every leader that we as people consider "horrible" shows characteristics similar to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Staling all had a "disturbing" childhood. Babs Johnson has had a disturbing childhood and is therefore associated in the same class as all the sovereigns mentioned above. That's why many of his actions in the film can be seen as disturbing. However, his actions were his fault or the company for letting it grow as she did. Furthermore, each character in this film represents a past leader or event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind this can be linked to genocide and Hitler's attempt to annihilate the Jews. Some consider Hitler a genius, others a fool. John Waters must have seen him as a fool because his portrayal of Edith was really mentally ill. The son of Edith Crackers and his traveling companion Cotton are the symbol of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names are slang terms that represent a period of time that many of us would rather forget. These characters are crucial in terms that emphasize that on some occasions our society in America was no better than what we often consider horrendous acts of social assault in other cultures. The f ** king chicken scene is the epitome of what was wrong with our society at this time and is still wrong. Pollo, is a slang term from the 70s for women. So it may be possible that John Waters is trying to bring out the subject of rape through the actions of Cotton and Crackers. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was of marble. Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. So this may be the symbol of the struggle between the poor and the rich, a struggle that continues today and will probably continue forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film due to its disturbing scenes, but it should also be noted for its disguised political program that Waters has shown so affluently in its entirety.
