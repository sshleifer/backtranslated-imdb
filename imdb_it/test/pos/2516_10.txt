Cool action - yes, the premise was made - but not this way - this is the trick. hey gente - SHOCK - is an X-File. <br /> <br /> For me - it's nice that Scully / Mulder have almost no scene at all - they have to adapt, rely on the intrinsic sense of the other about what's really going on and their adaptive capacities. They read each other's moves and do the job ... (kind of). <br /> <br /> Oh yeah --- really good acting - are these people paid to do this? Or - a slow day when the store doesn't call them to work. (hey - Duchovny - where are the donuts of a day? Malcolm - go to school ...)
