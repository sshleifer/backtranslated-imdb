Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in France with family and friends when they receive a letter asking them to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. It is said that Gerald's uncle became ill and asked that Gerald, the sole heir, be present. Gerald leaves for Scotland, leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks go by and he doesn't come back. Concerned, Kitty sends telegrams but doesn't respond to her boyfriend. Four more weeks pass and Kitty finally receives a strange response from Gerald, who interrupts the engagement and tells her to go on with her life. Not ready to give up her relationship and looking for answers, Kitty jumps on a plane and decides to pay a visit to Gerald. Aunt Edith will accompany her on the trip (Katherine Emery, the most balanced, known for her starring role in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate, they immediately suspect that something strange is going on. For beginners, Gerald appears to be twenty years old in a few weeks. Secondly, this once nice and charming boy turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly asks to leave the castle and never come back. When Edith falls with a slight cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things. <br /> <br /> Why is Gerald so cold and cruel to the woman who was just about to get married? Why is Gerald so against having company? Why do house rules indicate that guests must be locked in their bedrooms during the night? Why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the property, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large hedge maze in the back? And what does that strange roaring noise do every night? These are just some of the questions that the MAZE asks. The film actually does a good job of building mystery and intrigue. Become sincerely interested in what is happening and wait patiently for the resolution to explain the strange events that are occurring. And then it happens ... I absolutely don't want to ruin the ending of this film because you're better not knowing, but it takes one of the most incredible and amazing turns I've ever seen in every movie. It is wonderfully ridiculous in a sense, but it also takes quite a bit of mysterious b / w and sends it straight into the Z-Grade schlock territory. Yet this ending seems so out of place, it's not likely to forget it once you see it. <br /> <br /> Despite the ending (or maybe even partially due to the ending), I really liked this weird bird. He is extremely friendly and slow for the duration of the execution time, but he has managed to keep my interest alive. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the INVADERS FROM MARS of the same year famous) is best known as two-time Academy Award-winning art director and his set designers are also very interesting. There is almost a silent film at times, with the working model for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and poorly decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As in any good castle, there are also secret passages and long staircases. This also throws some nibbles on the strings for good measure. <br /> <br /> Some actors are a bit stiff and clumsy, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. Emery, who also plays the role of narrator in framing shots at the beginning and at the end of the film, is as decent as the overly polite and cautious aunt. My favorite though was Michael Pate as the silver-haired sinister servant who makes this hilarious zombie walk every time he climbs the stairs. Among the minor roles we also mention Hillary Brooke (who played the lead role in the mystery of Sherlock Holmes THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE). Obviously, Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and other horror films, so you got a pretty decent cast for fans of the genre. I say, take a look!
