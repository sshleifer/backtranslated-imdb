Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse traders forced to sell their animals to a Mormon group and guide them across the border to a settlement. What they do not expect is to meet the notorious killers of Clegg, with their wounded leader Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs, the main voice for the Mormon group that moves the wagon train to the Lord's destination. Along the way they also meet "Doctor" A Locksley Hall and his "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and help them. <br /> <br /> Lovingly directed by Ford that pays close attention to detail with realistic problems that every group would encounter during a sturdy trail. The film has a wonderful cast composed of actors of characters with a real star in the film who is actually a blessing to behold, if it were not for a change of pace. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. come off really well, but this is the Bond movie to shine because it has the best lines. Johnson is what seems to understand pimps and brutes like Shiloh and will certainly be useful when a certain conflict could develop while Clegg's boys ride alongside them. <br /> <br /> I should say this is one of his best and least appreciated westerns and seems to run very well.
