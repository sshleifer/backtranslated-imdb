I am Egyptian. I have a green card. I live in the United States since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I am married (not American but not Egyptian, non-Arab wife). I have children who were born in the United States. I have a doctorate in cell biology in the United States and travel for conferences. I earn 6 digits and I own a home in the Washington, DC area. I pay my taxes and outside of 1 or 2 parking tickets I have no flaws on my record since I arrived in this country in 1991. I have a more Egyptian appearance than Ibrahimi but my spoken English is as good as the his. <br /> <br /> A couple of months ago I was returning from a conference / business in Spain through Monaco Germany to Washington, DC (Home). As soon as I got off the Madrid plane, I was picked up at the Munich airport by a German officer. He was waiting for me. He was about to start questioning me until I simply said "I have no business in Germany, I'm just passing by". He had let me go with the utmost disappointment. It was nothing compared to what happened at the Washington airport, Dulles (which wasn't as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the film). The customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the duration and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my custom declaration form and let me go. After I took my checked bag, I stopped at the last exit point (a crap from Homeland Security). I sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my detention. I was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone. At first I was exuberant asking to be informed of the reason or let me go, but I decided to suck it and wait and see. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her I'll be late but they said no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "good morning", an agent ripped the phone and threatened to confiscate it. When I asked if I needed to call home because my family was waiting, they said "Three hours is nothing, we will make contact after 5 hours". When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. The bathroom was fun; I imagine it was a prison-style toilet that is all metal without a toilet seat. Eventually they called my name and they gave me my passport / green card and I said you can go. I asked what the problem was, they said "nothing" !! I know it was only 3 hours but I was dead tired and I wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was done very well. Unlike most films that involve Arabs and use non-Arab actors who simply speak nonsense, this video in Arabic was 100% correct. I assume that the country is Morocco (North Africa).
