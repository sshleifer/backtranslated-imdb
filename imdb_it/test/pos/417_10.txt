He is not your conventional taxi driver. <br /> <br /> These guys have problems. With his wife, his son, a priest, all his rates, his former partner and above all himself. And the biggest thing is that they throw us all inside. So we have to keep looking to learn more about his past. <br /> <br /> The idea may not be original but David Morse does it. I think this is a great show, and I hope people will recover before the end of the season. <br /> <br /> WATCH THIS EXHIBITION !!!!!!!!!
