Surface is one of the best shows I've ever seen. NBC is so stupid for having canceled a great show like this and, worse, left it only half. NBC or someone else should give Surface at least another season just so it can be completed. It is as if NBC had given you a book to read and halfway they decide to take it away from you and so you can never discover the ending. I just want to see what happens to everyone and, more importantly, see what happens to Nim. I think I can say this safely on most Surface fans is that we want to save Nim! Nim took away all our hearts and then NBC cut them in two. Come on NBC, just give Surface another season!
