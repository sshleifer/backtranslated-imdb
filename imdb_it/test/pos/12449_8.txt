This is one of the funniest teen movies I've ever seen (and which I wanted to be released on video). It was released the same year as another great comedy in which Tim Matheson played an "Animal House" role (which is probably why he was overlooked). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this film would surely be the soundtrack, which could and should have been a formal release of labels. The soundtrack presents a famous act from the 70s called High Inergy, whose song "We are the future", played a leading role in the Prom scene of the film. I remember buying the album "Steppin 'Out" as a child, mainly due to the appearance of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talent. <br /> <br /> The final song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I can still hear it in my head. I would like to know the name of the group so that I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you liked movies like "Over the edge" and "Rich Kids", I think this is one of those that will love it too.
