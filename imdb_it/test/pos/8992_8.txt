I'm a big movie buff and also an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the biggest game ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of Coach Carter and sloppy rugby. This film is full of great acting, well-developed characters and in action scenes that will make you dodge and dodge in your place, but with more weapons than pee football and almost all the shots disappear as soon as a player touches the ground. filmed to look almost like a soccer ball. If you want to take your children to see a movie that will build a character from within and could inspire a blind person to see it again, I can easily give it 9 out of 10, if you want to watch a great rugby movie that really shows the sport you have to wait for the next one Forever Strong is mostly practice, racing and a ruck movie, so I give it a 7.75 out of 10.
