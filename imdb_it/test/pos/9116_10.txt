I was able to see the MTV premiere of this movie last night and I needed to tell everyone that this movie caused thunder. Obviously this film will be more appreciated by fans of D, since it has a lot of jokes for those who have seen the HBO series and has more than enough D for the most recent fans and the mass of future converts. The music really shines with the new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than the one it plays), "Master Exploder" (perhaps the third best song in the world) and "Dude (I totally miss you)". There are a lot of excellent scenes (car chase, rock-off, meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I could really go on for hours but I don't want to give the film away. Go see it. You will not be disappointed.
