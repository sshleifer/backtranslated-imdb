As a rule, there are few things more daunting than Hollywood's attempts to be brave. Mixing caution with a heavy hand, the "message films" clatter loudly on their backs to dare confront important problems. CROSSFIRE is not completely free from this spot; includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious, assuming a level of ingenuity in its audience that is depressing to contemplate. Still in 1947, it was a big problem for a film to announce that anti-Semitism existed and that it was bad. (It was unthinkable, of course, that Hollywood faced the real topic of the book on which the film was based - his victim was a homosexual). However, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime. <br /> <br /> The postwar malaise was one of the main components of the film noir, and CROSSFIRE confronts it directly. The film is set in Washington, D.C., among soldiers still in uniform but idle, who spend their days playing poker and bar-crawling. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void: all the energy that has gone to hate and fight the enemy is now blurred and bottled. Samuels meets three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive Mitchell, who is near a nervous breakdown, the weak-willed Floyd Bowers, and Montgomery, a tall and overbearing bully who belittles a young Tennessee soldier like a stupid hill. The three soldiers end up in Samuels' apartment, where the drunk Monty becomes increasingly violent, calling his "Jewish" guest. Samuels is beaten to death, and Mitchell disappears, becoming the main suspect in the murder. <br /> <br /> Detecting the crime is Detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and textbook, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a caring and experienced friend who knows that Mitchell is incapable of killing. Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him the apartment key, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who as a witness to the crime remains terrified in a squalid house of rooms. Although there is no real "whodunit" suspense, the story remains compelling, and the trap set for the killer is extremely clever. <br /> <br /> The strong noir atmosphere saves the film from being didactic or hypocritical. Cinematography is a surprising shadow game, with darkness of ink and harsh lights, rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. The tiredness of the world is as pervasive as noir lighting. "Nothing interests me," says Finlay quietly; "A nulla", is Ginny's toast in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the noir femininity model, almost steals the film with her two scenes. Platinum blonde, exhausted and caustic, she is the quintessential B-girl, poisoned by the "fetid gin mill" where she works ("for laughter", she says bitterly), her sweet face stirring when Mitchell tells her she reminds him of his wife. From time to time a melancholy goodness peeks at his defensive shell, like when he dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard, then offers to cook his spaghetti in his apartment. When he goes there, he meets an ungainly and chubby-looking man (Paul Kelly) who seems to be robbing Ginny, and whose conversation is a dense stratification of lies and false confessions. Gloria takes Mitchell's wife, a good girl, off the screen in a scene where she is asked to give Mitchell an alibi. Thin and fragile in her bathrobe, with her thin little girl, she shows us how often Ginny has been insulted and fired like a tramp. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is an anonymous actor, and he has no chance of Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of maintaining his pipe character, drowned in delivering the sincere message of the film, this side of pomposity. Mitchum, meanwhile, gets interesting dialogues, but not enough to do; however, even when it's not doing anything but relaxing in a corner, you can't look away from him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a completely shadowed and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant and unstable bigot; we see his fake genius, his bullying, his resentment towards anyone who has advantages, his "am I right or am I right?" complacency; how easily slaps the labels on people and how satisfying it is to despise them. <br /> <br /> The CROSSFIRE message seems cautious and dated now, although not as much as the same year GENTILEMAN AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech about bigotry policemen coming back a hundred years for an instance of white victim, reminding us that once the persecutors had been persecuted by Irish Catholics; later it could be the people of Tennessee, he says, or the men wearing striped ties. Or maybe blacks, or Japanese, or homosexuals or communists? The script seems to be afraid of talking about real contemporary problems. He sweetens his message by making the Jewish victim holy, as if his innocence was not enough; and is committed to exonerating the military, with a superior officer declaring that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery, and points out that Samuels has served honorably in the war. However, it took some courage to paint, immediately after the Second World War, an American who could have been happier in the Nazi army, and the basic premise of the film is still valid. If Monty were alive today, he would have left September 12, 2001 and beat a Sikh.
