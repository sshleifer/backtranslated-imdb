This film, Blade Master, can be cheap, awkward in appearance and sometimes it does, but it shares thoughts on problems that go well beyond the era in which this film is set. Ator is the chosen one who must protect the earth from a terrible weapon, which is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. He crosses obstacles like a witty character who is more than just a muscular force, even if he has enough is a lot. I would say that this aspect of the film overcomes a film like Conan the Barbarian, which is the least I can say, quite mindless. It does not diminish in any way the great adventure film that is Conan, but it gives Ator its healthiness that it does not share with the barbarian. For a film with a lower budget, this film does well in terms of setting and the fighting is for the most part credible. Zor, the villain, has with him captive throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological clashes that gives tension to the film, even if Ator seems too suitable for the task of losing. <br /> <br /> What gives this film that extra something are those scenes that may seem bizarre, but worth mentioning. The fight with the snake god, even if it is a gigantic puppet, is well managed since the snake, with a good flash, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The film culminates in an unusual, rather anachronistic, but breathtaking way: the hang gliding sequence. The scene itself was not introduced correctly, not read at all, where Ator got that car, is rather unconvincing, but leads to a poetic and beautiful sequence in mid-air, the autonomous one, is the culminating point of the film, raising Ator in a place where few heroes of human fantasy have been. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not among the great fantastic films of all time it is not a surprise because of his shortcomings, it is a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way he chooses in the clash between good and evil , the truth speaks and shows the heart, that this film is so unfulfilled. I recommend it to all fans of the genre and try to take it seriously as an intelligent film that must be taken more seriously than it seems.
