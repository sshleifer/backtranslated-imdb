This set of two discs is incredible! If you're like me and you've never had the opportunity to see the band live, this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, which in my opinion is the second best guitarist of all time to walk on the face of the earth (second only to Slowfingers himself), stages an incredible show in every movie in this film. John Paul Jones, even if not in front of Page, puts on an infernal show. Although in the live atmosphere, his rhythmic lines are not as defined as in studio recordings, except of course in tracks like Dazed and Confused, or What is and What Be Never Be Be), but his wide range of instrumental talents is well displayed on these DVDs. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, its beats stand out like no other, and this DVD is the proof. Last, but not least, Robert Plant cries like no one else can cry. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you're wondering the same thing about Page when he met Robert Plant for the first time, why the hell isn't he already famous? And so my review concludes, I'm sorry for spelling or grammar errors, Zeppelin rocks.
