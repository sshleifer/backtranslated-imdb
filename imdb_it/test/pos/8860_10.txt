Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antarctica. They are invaded by something from space - it completely devours and duplicates whatever it chooses. Start as a dog but get loose and have the chance to duplicate some of the men. Soon no one trusts anyone: they are isolated, the radio is destroyed and even their helicopter. What will they do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 film meant that it was just a big human monster. That movie was scary. This is also - but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material - the novel "Who Goes There?") And it's scary in a different way. The film immediately begins with the extremely disturbing soundtrack of Ennio Morricone that sets the right tone and - when the Thing is attacked - the amount of blood is staggering. There is blood and parts of the body flying everywhere - the arms are bitten, the heads come off and - in the strongest - a man is devoured face first by the Thing. The effects of blood are STRONG and real nightmare material. It doesn't scare me easily, but I had to sleep with the lights on when I originally saw it in 1982. The effects of Rob Bottin are incredible - as this image obtained with an R rating is beyond me! <br /> <br /> It also has a very disturbing feeling - apart from gore, it is very full of suspense. Not sure who it is and the Carpenter management and the score really increase the tension. A complaint: no one is assigned distinctive traits of personality. The actors simply remain face to face and say their lines. It's annoying ... but the film still works. <br /> <br /> This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - he competed with "E.T." and MANY critics have complained about the amount of blood and there are no female characters in the film. He is now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see ... for strong stomachs. NOT a dating movie! <br /> <br /> A funny note: when it was released, Universal sent a note along with all the prints of the film. They suggested that the theater owners play the film in an auditorium near the toilets. They were afraid that people would be so disgusted by the violence that they should have been close to a structure to throw up!
