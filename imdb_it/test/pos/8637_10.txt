Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the master of film expression. At the screening last night I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. Performances are astounding, entrancing score and fascinating photography. David's ability to weave the many elements of filmmaking into a unique and extraordinary cinematic experience is unmatched. As I watched Mullholland Drive I couldn't help but realize that with David Lynch we are truly blessed in this world. Cinema is also blessed, in David Lynch's films, we are shown that a man's vision can be achieved with surprising results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only way. We realize that a true film artist has a chance in this world and we are truly blessed.
