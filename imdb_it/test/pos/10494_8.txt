I have to admit that when I started watching this movie I had no idea what was going on. So the start was a bit confusing to me. However, this did not diminish my enjoyment of the film. The characters turn out to be more complex than they appear before, and this is what makes this film memorable. At first I felt that this was a real "Hollywood" movie. Although obviously lacking the stereotyped element of "pistols and fists", the convincing performances of talented actors like Martin Sheen and Sam Neill made up for a lot. I'd rather see a movie with more substance than shooting any day.
