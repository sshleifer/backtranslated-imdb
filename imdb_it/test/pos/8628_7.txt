For us, an Abbott and Costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for. I am very happy to have registered it - my wife remembered it since she was young, but I had never seen it. The family wanted to look at something not too serious before going to bed and this was selected. <br /> <br /> Our daughter saw many of the old movies with us - she always complained at first, but very often she approached. For the most part he ignored this at first, preferring to check his email, but he started to have fun - many times laughing out loud with laziness. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful to think you can spend a fun evening with a 55 year old. The monochrome introduction that blends with the fairy tale in color. It's a fun version of a story that everyone is familiar with, which includes a little song and a bit of dance, along with everything you expect from Lou and Bud on delivery. <br /> <br /> Watch it with your kids and have a really fun evening!
