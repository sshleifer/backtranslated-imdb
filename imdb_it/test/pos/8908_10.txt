Easily one of the best shows ever made, and only gets better with age. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main reasons for this was the English adaptation made by David Weir. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in its original language was more whimsical and less entertaining than the version we all know. <br /> <br /> The fact that the show resonates so strongly to its non-Japanese fans is, I believe, largely thanks to Weir's inspired efforts and some winning voice-over jobs. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
