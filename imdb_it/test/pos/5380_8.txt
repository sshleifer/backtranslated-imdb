Every great once in a while, you run into a film that surpasses even your wildest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0, I didn't expect much with The Brotherhood of Satan. I was hoping that at least there could be a fun game like The Devil's Rain or one of the other satanic horror movies of the 70s. I could not have been more wrong. What I have instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast that I really enjoyed. Speaking in general terms to avoid giving something different, the style and structure of the film are much more experimental than the direct narrative so important in the early 1970s. The Brotherhood of Satan does not beat you on the head with points and explanations of the plot. Much is left to the viewer to fill in the empty spaces. As a spectator, you know something is wrong, but for the longest time you're not really sure what it is. The unknown contributes to creating a much more disturbing atmosphere than most similar films. The ending is effective with his surreal images. I was amazed when the credits began to turn. Those who want a grand slam-bang finale will be disappointed by the simplicity of the finale. A minor film would try to pull out all the stops and most likely would fail miserably. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film where it is easy to forget that the director, Bernard McEveety, had worked primarily on television before the Brotherhood of Satan. There are some scenes that are so well set, lit up and taken that even the most experienced directors could learn one or two things. For example, I've seen enough movies over the years to realize that sometimes directors seem to have trouble taking pictures in widescreen format indoors. Not here. The scene where men are discussing their action plan in the sheriff's office is amazing. Do we see all five men at once? everyone does their own thing like in real life. In a minor film, we could see all the men at the same time, but everyone would be immobile, waiting for their turn to express their dialogue. It's a small scene, but it looks so natural and it's so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of The Brotherhood of Satan. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned the acting in my opening, so without entering a long speech, I will simply say that The Brotherhood of Satan presents Strother Martin and LQ Jones. Every movie with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.
