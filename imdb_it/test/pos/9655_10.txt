This is a great film, a must-have. I loved every aspect, from sword fighting to romance, the costumes were really well made and put together. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. I also loved mystery and magic. Even the message of the power of love, that love is the greatest power there is. I really like the king's heart in the sense that he wants peace instead of blood and hatred. I wish I could live in a world like that with flying ships, castles in the sky. I also think it was really nice how they brought the animals into the film. I also thought the cook was really funny. I've seen it many times in one day and I never get tired. I just wish they would bring it on a DVD.
