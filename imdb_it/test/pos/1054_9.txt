I just got this movie for Christmas and I've already added it to my list of favorites. A cute and simple story that makes a good movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have your mouth watering at the sound of all that food. The decisive points go to Sydney Greenstreet for her interpretation of Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane, the incredibly boring girlfriend. Truly a jewel to watch every Christmas.
