Okay, so there was a strange hole in the plot where you could drive a zeppelin, but how were the emotions managed? It would have been so easy to get off in style but the writer pulled it off. The image of the former cyberman who makes crying noises while he sees his reflection after having regained his emotions is one that will remain with me forever. Twice the monsters showed a soft side and was presented briefly with sympathy, the previous one being the last Dalek of the series one, but for Jupiter it worked. Add to that the other ex-woman who was "promoted" on the eve of her marriage, and Jackie Tyler who recognized her husband after she became "cyber" and had a permanent lump in her throat. Keep it up!
