I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than that of Quentin Tarantino. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the boy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, it has been a disappointment for some. Well, I'm relieved to say that Tarantino hasn't lost his touch. It brings us its best from Pulp Fiction and thankfully. <br /> <br /> We know the story, a story of the Second World War told only as Tarantino. (Imaginary of course) A war movie has never been done before. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine leads the Bastards in Nazi-occupied France. Their goal: to kill the Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He is known as the "Jewish Hunter" and talks about his merciless business like no other. The third sub-story is composed of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the massacre of her family. And she, of course, wants to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating loss. In reality, here are three stories that intertwine and connect with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new to him. <br /> <br /> War has never been so fun. Basterds are haunting, but at the same time very funny, sometimes even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect plays an important role in this as in many other Tarantino films. Entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found it extremely fun and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see it again on the screen. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Great impressions were also MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were extraordinary. The film was filled with noteworthy performances. <br /> <br /> The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to count, but then? It is not meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun, like us. The cinematography department deserves great props with beautiful bright colors that highlight the film. You really have to love the last line of the movie ... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino, among other things, is an entertainer. World War II is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino somehow manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a funny film, tremendously funny, shocking, dramatic, full of suspense and fun at the same time. Jam full of everything you look for in a movie, made with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth checking out. It's time to try for yourself what the war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.
