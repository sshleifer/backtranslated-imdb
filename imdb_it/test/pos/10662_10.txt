Sergei Eisenstein's most famous film has really stood the test of time. The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 has the feeling of Soviet propaganda, but it does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt. The scene in Odessa's footsteps should remain etched in anyone's mind. <br /> <br /> Okay, so "The Pottery of the Battleship" wasn't actually the first movie to use editing, but they did a great job here. Certainly any film history lesson should show this film. It's a great historical drama (although I admit that I don't know how accurate). A 10/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and we should have learned by now that "Potemkin" should be transliterated as "Potyomkin".
