Okay, I've marked this spoiler, so don't be upset when I finish it. Now I went into the movie waiting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost all the horror movies I've ever seen were predictable but not as bad as most. What helped me was the story, I didn't expect there to be a "WHY" for Kane's madness. But there was and even if a little fog you still had the idea and understood the madness. Now, of course, if you like something that scares you for the nights to come, this isn't the movie you're looking for. But if you're a fan of Saw, or other films that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content, this is a movie to watch. Now where do I really launch a spoiler for a second warning. I give this film a 9, maybe because I'm a fan of WWE and a fan of Kane, but who doesn't like a movie a little better when acting in someone we love. However this film could have scored a 10 for me SE. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the film when he showed Kane dead on the floor. While a dog pissing in his eyes was "CUTE", it could have been a classic with the Kane / Undertaker that sat quickly and turned its head. A perfect 10 would have been awarded if this happened. It was a perfect opportunity, but neither the WWE has thought of it, nor a future sequel will start with the same sequence I mentioned. That's all. (9)
