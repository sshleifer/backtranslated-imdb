I can't get my hand off my brain. It's definitely totally different from everything that's out there. I saw a ton of movies during the holidays and while some are okay, nothing really shook my world like BlindSpot did. There is only something interesting about the actors and the way they put the film together. It's like there's something scary mixed with a hilarious funny black humor. Franco is fantastic, but the old rough guy steals the show in some scenes, like when he beats the child in the dirty pit. I imagine some politically correct people won't like the atmosphere (don't bring your grandmother) but it's absolutely fantastic. The best thing is the Kaliedescope style. There are some really serious things mixed with extraordinary shots of the road. The film makes you really sad and scared in some parts, but it also makes your head spin with what's happening and the way it's being filmed. Is WTF in step with the world? Sooo many critics are excited about all these seemingly revolutionary revolutionary films and when you see them they are boring and predictable and not-all-that. I don't understand why there are many other better choices. Blind Spot is truly exceptional because it gives you chills, chills and an important stellar power, but it does so in a completely new and totally radiant way.
