The first time I saw this great movie and Alyssa, my star *, playing Frances Ella Fitz, was so great in this movie! He was so real and his little dog so cute! I saw it the first time when I was 11 and it was the best movie I had ever seen, and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = the greatest ever!
