True, this is not the best film by John Sayles (Brother From Another Planet), but it is not entirely forgettable, if only for its message. Like Batman, Wild Thing's parents were killed in front of him, leaving him to defend himself in "The Zone", a corrupt section of a nameless city where greed and violence reign supreme. Instead of meeting Chopper (Robert Davi) Wild Thing fights for justice, using his powers of Tai Chi and the disturbing impressions of the cat, sometimes lighting up. Become something of an urban legend, a modern day Robin Hood and a hero for the ages. 1987 at its best, WILD THING LIVES
