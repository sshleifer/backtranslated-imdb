A beautiful performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful performance by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this story of lust, desire and alienation in France. The work of the two protagonists is surprising: subtle, intense and passionate. Alas, the script is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the overall effect leaves a dejected spirit. However, those who appreciate high-quality acting can savor the courageous work of the protagonists in this difficult and difficult film of the low Gallic life. <br /> <br />
