I was surprised to see him on TV on Friday, and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the numerous references to everything that could be considered "cyberpunk", this was a fun movie to watch. I liked the story, which reminded me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin), and it was fun to watch it on TV. Bobbie looks good, but I also liked his performance as Kam because he looked different from everyone else. But the best thing about this film was the atmosphere that was described in the books by Gibson, Sterling and others. It was fun to watch it on TV.
