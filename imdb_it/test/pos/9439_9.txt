What is the most violent film of all time? Rambo III? Commando? Robocop? Add these three violent ones together, and you won't be the same as the carnage in The Stabilizer, the wildest, silliest and craziest action movie I've ever seen. For a hundred minutes things explode and people die in dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and cheer up, and when it's all over you'll be more than a little exhausted. This film is a buried gem, a cult cult that sadly lacks a cult. <br /> <br /> The stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a big fat man with a curly mullet. Arrives in Indonesia on the trail of the villain and villain Greg Rainmaker. We know he is evil because he is called only by his full name ("I hate SCUM like Greg RAINmaker!") And he uses a method of killing so horrible that I can't even pronounce it here. Wait, yes, I can. Switch to people with pointed shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker does not pour alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he kidnaps important professors and directs a huge empire in the underworld. It is up to Goldson (a Jewish action hero Gevalt!) And to his heterogeneous group of helpers to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing up many things. Perhaps "stabilizing" has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> And violence, oh violence. This is a film that does not want, indeed, inapplicable, to spend five minutes of screen time without a sort of explosion, knife, car accident or squib that interrupts the dialogue. Violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just really weird. For example, The Stabilizer & company invade one of Rainmaker's stores (driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). When it perches on the balcony, with heavy fire coming from below, the stabilizer does the only thing it can do. He pushes the balcony into the boy's head, his front tire bounces like a basketball. Amazing. <br /> <br /> From excessively free love scenes (Both female protagonists jump into the sack with the hero of their choice not two minutes after speaking to them for the first time alone) to the little-known dialogue ("Victor , you talented bastard! ") The stabilizer has it all. This is a film for the ages, right there with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available in version. If you find it anywhere for any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
