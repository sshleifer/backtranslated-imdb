I really enjoyed this movie. I don't usually do it for fairy tales or to make plans of beliefs, but this film caught my attention. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time in the British channel Hallmark ... which usually shows bad taste movies ... but then came Snow Queen ... and I loved it! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this film ... she plays the snow queen in a brilliant and fascinating way. <br /> <br /> I will not explain what the story is about as others have already done, so there it is, I wouldn't repeat. <br /> <br /> I would just like to suggest that if you want to see a fun fairy tale trip ... take this movie ... but if you want to buy it and live in the UK, you may have a hard time. I bought it from the brand new South Korea (English edition of course).
