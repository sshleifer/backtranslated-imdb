I got this complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I knew nothing about the history of the series. Season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then another 3 episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being Beyond Good and Evil with an original Air Data of 7 December 1998. another 4 episodes in season 2 were broadcast from December 1997 to Febrausry 1998. So Beyond Good and Evil looks like episode 1 of the third season, except there are no other episodes in season 3. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. The two main characters of the first 8 episodes, dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and Dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner), miss this episode to be replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and by dr. Charley Fielding (Eva Pope). I recognized Nathaniel Parker of the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, which began in 2001. So they were planning a season 3, but only one episode was broadcast. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to try to continue a series named after the main character, McCallum, when the main character disappeared from the series. So they could have planned a return of Dr. Iain McCallum, but when that failed the series was canceled. I have no inside information on this, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information on this?
