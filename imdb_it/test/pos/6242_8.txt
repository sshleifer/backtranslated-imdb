A group of young travelers who have just finished their gas enter a strange wax museum called "The Lost Oasis of Saluesen" owned by a strange man named Slausen (Chuck Conners) while the mannequins are controlled by a mysterious force and a fool with special powers wants them dead. <br /> <br /> One of the least popular horror films of the late 1970s! This production by Charles Band (producer of "Re-Animator") has become one of the scariest and most unique low-cost horror productions of its kind, combining some psychological themes without having to look a bit gore like the usual slasher movie. The film keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some fright, the film has become a diamond of cult for the genre since then and is worth watching. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "Pin", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)", "The Hills have Eyes (1977)", "Maniac (1980)", "Magic" (1978), " Dolls "," May "," Just before dawn "", "House of 1000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects", "Sleepaway Camp", "Mother's Day", "A nightmare on Elm Street", "Friday The 13th "," Halloween 1 & 2 "," Puppet Master "," House of Wax (1953 and 2005) "," Jeepers Creepers "," High Tension "," Evil Dead II "," From Dusk Till Dawn "," Waxwork "," Nothing But Trouble "and" Psycho (1960) ".
