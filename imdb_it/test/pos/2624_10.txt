This film has been in my mind for years as one of the best TV movie films I've ever seen. The acting is superb. I've seen it twice and I'm still puzzled in some parts. I'd like to have a copy so you can play some parts over and over again. I'm interested in buying a copy of this film, but I can't find it anywhere. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions on how to find it? I've tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches and I'm completely frustrated. I haven't seen it on Turner Classic Movies, nor on American Movie Classics, and I've even launched flyers in our community asking if anyone had a copy.
