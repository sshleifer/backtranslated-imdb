From the point of view of the hectic and contemporary world in which we live, the so-called "good old days" always seem much more serene and innocent; an idyllic past era of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the big screen, as in "Christmas In Connecticut", a hot and captivating film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck plays Elizabeth Lane, a popular columnist of the "Martha Stewart" magazine who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story. One of his biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the editor of the magazine he writes for. Yardley has never visited his farm and, in response to an idea expressed in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), decides to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and her son and, as a special guest, a Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor has just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed. Obviously Elizabeth can't refuse her boss, but there are problems; not least the fact that he has no farm and writes his column from the comfort of a skyscraper in the city. It represents a precarious situation for both you and your publisher, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), because the only thing Mr. Yardley requires of his employees is total honesty. What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that brings the public back to a seemingly simpler time and place, to share a Christmas past in which a warm heart, good food and kindness prevail. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck absolutely shines like Elizabeth, with a warmer smile and presence than the largest hearth can offer, and totally convincing as a city girl completely out of her element on the farm. Even Morgan behaves well like a somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellows is admirable. Even with the deceptions played around him, he is the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it's Elizabeth for which you really feel. One of the real delights of this film, however, is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley looks bizarre, but underneath you no doubt know that he is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It is an honest and honest portrait, and it is a joy to see him work; the most memorable scenes in the film belong to him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the formidable Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers). A film in a good mood that plays particularly well during the Christmas season (although it could work at any time of the year), "Christmas In Connecticut" is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, it is really uplifting and will leave you with hot spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be. It is a true classic and one not to be missed. I consider this 10/10. <br /> <br />
