This is Ghibli's last film and is also a great departure from the established style of the studio. First of all, this film was obviously aimed at small children, much more than any other previous film. Is the depth of the other films missing and does it present a brand new style of animation that is much less realistic? yet it is always so funny. Although there is nothing that can attract adults, I still find myself drawn to the screen and completely immersed in the story. The secret of the film is the brutal honesty towards the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very early with their feelings / intentions etc. But this makes them even more appealing. Particular attention was also paid to the soundtrack, which is absolutely incredible despite being very different from previous Ghibli soundtracks. I find myself singing the theme song all the time as well as anyone who saw this movie!
