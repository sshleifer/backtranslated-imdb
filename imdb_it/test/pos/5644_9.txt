I released this film a week after the death of Ichikawa Kon - I suppose if there's a way to mark the death of a great director, it's to raise a glass of wine while watching one of his greatest films. Ichikawa had one of the best careers in Japanese cinema, but since he never had a distinctive style or theme, he often seems undervalued compared to his closest contemporaries, like Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not of very ). He is one of those filmmakers who challenge the authors' theories - it's likely that his wife (who wrote the script for this and many of his other films) was as responsible for the quality of the films as he was. But at its best, it matched any Japanese director at the time. In particular, he had great technical skills, allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible way. But in terms of theme, this film could not be simpler: war is hell. No really, it's really hell. <br /> <br /> Fire on the plain does not follow the normal rules of the war genre. There is no real beginning - we start as the wretched Tamura, who is a regular private (although it is understood that he is more thoughtful and polite than most others - at some point he is shown to understand English, but yes closes when others ask him how he knows it) is ordered to the hospital, since his unit is already in a frightening state. The soldiers are defeated and starved to death. They are no longer an army, just a group of tattered refugees - driven out by the locals, and practically ignored by the Americans, who have bigger fish to fry. Hunger and despair push soldiers to the limit and beyond madness. <br /> <br /> In typical Ichikawa style, it's not all just gloomy - it's strangely funny in parts (a very black humor, of course). /> <br /> The highlights of this film for me are the exceptional lead performances and vivid photography. The characters, in all their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are all too credible. This is that rare film - one that will refuse to get rid of your head, even if you want to forget it.
