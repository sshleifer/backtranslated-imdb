I really enjoyed this film.it presents John Wayne in his first starring performance. Even then, you can say that Wayne has a real presence, even if he wouldn't be really mature in the icon he is known for until Stagecoach, 9 years later , in 1939. They are settlers from all over the country heading for the new West to colonize it. Wayne's character, Breck Coleman, joins, but for his personal reasons. Most of the main actors were theater actors and had never made a film before, which makes the film even more surprising. They have succeeded in creating credible and distinctive characters and here is a rather strange mix. Cimarron will come out a year later, and has a very similar story, although I didn't like it as much as this movie. For me, The Big Trail is a strong 8/10.
