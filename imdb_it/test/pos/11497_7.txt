Jolene (Heather Graham) runs a night club in New York and lives with her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene returns home to find a note from Carl that needs "some space" ... and a bouquet of daisies, her favorite flower. Jo promptly puts the daisies in the blender and presses the button. Shortly thereafter, he embarks on a journey to find Carl somewhere in the west because, after all, he is "busy" with Carl. However, when she finally tracks him down to Texas, Jo camps near her home at first, hoping to find clues to her decision to leave. Meet a wonderful sculptor-neighbor (Goran, he can't write his name!) But Jo discourages his attraction for her. When he learns that Carl could have a new girl, he decides to consult a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau) for advice. Jo is busy, but does this mean anything to Carl? This is a very imaginative, rather humorous look at the marriage vow. It's a bizarre script and an unusual style is definitely contagious. Graham is just as fantastic as the woman in disgrace who is having trouble letting go. Wilson does not give his best performance but is as adequate as his confused husband. The rest of the cast is nice enough, however, with Goran, the wonderful, wonderful as the sexy neighbor. The scenery, in both New York and Texas, is very beautiful and the costumes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedies and independent films, this is tailor-made for you. Switch to a different rhythm that is more attractive, but still offers in the final happy end category.
