<br /> <br /> When I unexpectedly rented A Thousand Acres, I thought about taking part in a fun story about King Lear and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was there too, so what could go wrong? <br /> <br /> Very quickly, however, I realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just Acri. I started crying and I couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate film! Thanks to the cast, to be involved and interpret the characters with so much depth and kindness! <br /> <br /> I recognized the sister Angry; sister Runaway and sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusivo Husband and the reason he was there and then the Father, oh oh the Father ... he played superbly. I also recognized myself and this film opened my eyes, a relief, a chance to face my OWN truth and finally to do something about it. I really hope that A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there. <br /> <br /> Since I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting on the floor - they didn't fight Other at all - I looked at it a second time. Then I was able to see that if one had not lived a similar story, one would easily lose the overwhelming background of terror and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that crosses all this. This is exactly why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors, for example. <br /> <br /> But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I don't give you a rat rat (excuse my French) regarding the extension of King Lear's story. All I know is that I can honestly say this film changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, guys, CAN and DO make the difference. <br /> <br />
