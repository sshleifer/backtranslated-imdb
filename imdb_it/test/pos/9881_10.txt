A hilarious comedy of the best director ever, Oz Scott. The list of 80's TV icons goes on and on. Milan (Who's The Boss), Yothers (Family Ties), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (Night Court), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!). It is one of the most entertaining films of all time. Big lines, meaningless subplots, cheese, bad acting. This is a group of high school kids who have to pass drivers. Mac from Night Court needs them to pass the final exam, otherwise he will be fired. Great interpretation of Brian Bloom in the role of Riko Conner, the idiot / gentle type, but it is nothing compared to B.D. Kiki di Wong (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, so bad it's fine.
