Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a hard-cheering member of the Texas Congress who has no discernible legislative records. In 1980, he found himself interested in the situation in Afghanistan, in the midst of a brutal war with the Soviet Union. With the hope of his old flame, arch-conservative Texan socialist Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation, and is stunned by what she sees. He returns to the United States determined to help the Afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and himself under investigation for drug use charges. Undeterred, Wilson recruits Herring and the vulgar, outcast of CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to start a complicated arms deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and a mostly unconscious US Congress. Ultimately, the Afghans defeat the Soviets, but while America celebrates their victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan that falls on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's war is a brilliant brain candy, a truly beautiful film for the most intellectual spectator and entertaining entertainment for the average movie-goer. The film assembles a surprising array of talents, both in front of and behind the camera, and holds the promise of being a beautiful moment. The film has only one flaw, which we will arrive later. As an examination of the unlikely way the greatest secret war of the 20th century was conducted - and perhaps the way things are done by the CIA and other intelligence agencies - it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting on a number of levels. The story portrayed in the film - with all its scandalous double relationships, its subtle secret operations and, perhaps most of all, its success - would be as outrageous as a work of fiction, which could easily be dismissed as a satire. But things really worked that way, at least within reasonable limits. The film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their defects. Wilson is a person who does not apologize for his vices (he does not even embrace them), yet he is willing to embrace a just cause. Herring is something elitist, and his attitude of righteousness born again is daunting, yet he is deeply committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA outsider with an attitude problem, looked down on because of his "street" background - yet his love for the country and hatred for communism are unshakable. The fact that this strange trio can play an important role in the ruin of the USSR is not only proof that anyone can make a difference, but also that the truth is stranger than fiction. It is also very interesting that all this is interpreted as a comedy - not too surprising, given that our writer is Aaron Sorkin, but it is an interesting way to approach this story. <br /> <br /> The film, however, has a drawback, which is somewhat surprising. The film seems to blatantly celebrate the success of Wilson and Co .. Okay, there's nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, is it? - until it is considered that the Taliban and finally al-Qaeda arrived from the ashes of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan. Regardless of the level of responsibility of the United States, it happened and the portrait of the film on Wilson's success is almost absolute. To be honest, the film addresses this problem towards the end, with a rather timely speech by Wilson on the inability of the United States to clean up itself, but it is done in such a tertiary way that the average observer probably won't take much of it . The general impression will be that these three extraordinary people have helped the Afghans defeat the Soviets. This is not a fatal inconvenience, mind you, but it is a disturbing aspect of an otherwise brilliant film. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols offers a lucid production with a splendid appearance; the material adapts perfectly to its sober and ironic directorial style. Sorkin offers another brilliant script; the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best is the discussion of the "Scottish bottle" between Wilson and Avrakotos), and retains something of a political and historical perspective. The cast of the film is a marvel: Tom Hanks does a nice performance as the lovable rogue with a cause, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the hateful but busy Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene (as usual) like the abrasive Gus. The ever adorable Amy Adams takes another step on her way to celebrity as Wilson's long-suffering assistant, and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott enrich the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is an intelligent and entertaining film, a wonderful little more than light entertainment. The fact that he decides not to be more than that should not be held against it; he is brilliant in what he does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
