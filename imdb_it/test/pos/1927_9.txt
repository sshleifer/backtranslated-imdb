Note: it should probably be read only after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a documentary or a film focused on the loser. Deep Water does just that, making it one of the most inspiring films in a long time. It does not provide us with a hero to look at, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look inside ourselves. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of men trying to navigate the world, alone, and without stopping. Only one does it, several die, one decides not to go home, each of them on a psychological journey that is intriguing enough to deserve entire films for themselves. Yet the most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way he is played by filmmakers and our reactions to him as spectators. <br /> <br /> By standards, this man should be considered a contemptible character, but why did he paint so heroically? Why are we so nice to him? From the beginning he made all the wrong choices. He risked his family financially to get the boat, left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, ignored all warnings despite his lack of experience, chose to lie instead of admitting defeat, these snowball choices until the inevitable and last: suicide. All for what? A place in history? A feeling of accomplishment? Maybe. What is important to consider is whether this man's situation was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Every individual must ask himself whether his natural human impulse to fame and achievement would lead to such recklessness, and I believe that examining his reaction to Crowhurst's story will offer at least an answer to this question.
