I had never heard of this film, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story seemed interesting, so I thought I'd give it a try. I found it very funny. Heath Ledger plays a nineteen year old who works in some kind of lousy job and wants to start making a serious dough, so he goes and asks for the work of gangster Bryan Brown. I won't go into details, but things are very bad for Ledger and they get into trouble with Bryan Brown. From them the film gets better and better, with a scene that involves Ledger connecting with a couple of bank robbers. And let's not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I highly recommend this movie.
