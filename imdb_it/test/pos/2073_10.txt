I have never been interested in this play in the past, even though I love Shakespeare and have seen most of his works now and I have enthusiastically studied some of them at school. It seemed that something about this story and all the confusion about it put me in trouble. I never bothered trying to see Hamlet until recently deciding that I should at least try to watch him and borrowed Olivier's version from the library. Well, I struggled with it. Olivier seemed too old, not only in his appearance, but in his acting of the part. The work had been cut off enormously to fit a length of the more conventional film and I think I must have missed it too much because I found it difficult to concentrate on it, I soon became bored and annoyed. I still think that Henry V of Olivier is the best version I've ever seen of that exciting game - I admit that I haven't reviewed Beeb's version yet and I can't remember what it was like when it was first shown. <br /> <br /> I heard about the full version of Branagh of Hamlet. Although I liked his Much Ado, I think Beeb's version is far better and I wasn't very impressed with his Henry V. But I was out of Branagh a little after seeing his disappointing engagement in a Love's musical Labor's Lost which is a game I like and it was so well done by Beeb. <br /> <br /> Lately, by acquiring the complete Beeb Shakespeare on DVD, I soon rewatched one of my most beloved Shakespeare plays, Richard II, and was simply fascinated by Jacobi in the part, so I was immediately persuaded to watch his Hamlet later. What a revelation this play is now for me! Yes, it's splendid, but I feel that he needs an actor with whom you can emphasize to play Hamlet and this is Jacobi for me. Amazing. Interestingly, although he is older than I understand, the character of Hamlet was not shown while he was in Olivier. Now I notice that it is also in the Branagh version and has a lot to do with Branagh training, so I'll have to watch it to see what Jocobi does with Claudius! I am interested in finding out that Jacobi has trained Branagh as yes, you can certainly see the flu. <br /> <br /> And now I'll watch it all over again ....
