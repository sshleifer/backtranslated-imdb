Before watching this movie - clean your ears, remove makeup from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. You don't have to. This image will give you enough warmth to keep your relationship long enough. If you are Jewish / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, as a popular film minority, as always, laugh in your memories. If you are something else or whatever you are, laugh at the bittersweet memory of the importance of friendship and family. This film, nothing will seem strange as it may seem strange. However, I fear that few will see this film, because it is not the kind of photos that people look at when they go to the movies. But please do it for humanity, and don't forget to get the soundtrack, please.
