I come from the city of Phoenix and the first time I saw this movie and read the book, I just confirmed the stories I had heard all my life. I asked my grandfather of the crowd and he told me that when he returned from fighting in the peaceful theater he started a CPA firm which is the largest in the Columbus area. when he was just starting out he was asked by the crowd to do a financial job for them, but he said he politely refused. even when the FBI and the army crossed the city of Phoenix and cleaned it up, my grandfather didn't take it lightly when my mother, aunt or uncle crossed the river, but I assure you that all this is over. the downtown Phoenix area needs restoration work and has shacks near the courthouse where all footage is OCCASIONALLY about angry, ignorant, low socio-economic people, and the fourteenth Phoenix-eagle road bridge has been closed for 15 solid years and replaced by a new thirteenth road bridge, but on the fairer side of the city of Phoenix on summerville rd. it is very characteristic and the depressing scenario. <br /> <br /> another incident was told to me by the family of my best friend from high school who lives in a nothing place in Hwy 165 called Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is about 28 minutes from Columbus, Ga. my best friend in high school uncle was a man named Old Man Davis. Regardless of how the film goes, the fact is that there were 3 leaders and old Davis was one of them ... you can even read about him in the original book. legend has it that he was so cold-blooded that he went to downtown Phoenix to make a deal with a man, but apparently the man pulled back on the deal right in front of Old Man Davis, so old Davis proceeded to take a rifle sawn out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of the city by the court. they say he went off nonchalantly because the crowd had paid all the law enforcement officials in the city, so he had nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> another incident involves a bridge that another of my friends owns a house rental next to downtown Phoenix. it's the same bridge that the crowd killed and threw away a black man, and you can even read that part of the book. I would also like that in many of the columbuses and the city of Phoenix the civilians were requested as extras in the film. when the friend of the patterson is murdered and brought to trial and found guilty before the judge but still released, well, the judge is my father's partner in his law firm in Columbus, which unfortunately passed away.
