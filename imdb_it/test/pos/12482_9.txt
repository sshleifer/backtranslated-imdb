First, the obvious ?? like a police drama crossed by a funny melodrama, QUAY ?? it is puzzling, directly independent and a threat to banality. Jouvet's aplomb is put to good use in a policeman's performance that is immediately noticeable for its vigor and exuberant strength; his Antoine is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of vast experience of life and earthly instinct. QUAY ?? it is not subversive in the sense that the philistines of today (and already of yesterday) love to use the word. It is Clouzot's most playful time. He tended to adapt Steeman's books into a satirical note. (It is said that Clouzot was a great reader of detective novels). As a director, Clouzot's steady hand was successful. <br /> <br /> It is not a mystery or a thriller, but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and the police proceedings. Those accustomed to the masterpiece of Clouzot LES DIABOLIQUES could find the variety of things, styles and elements in QUAY a bit disconcerting. Here Clouzot talks about many things, about a couple and a hidden love story (Simone Renant's for Blier), about world entertainment and about old spinsters, about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a guy to raise, etc. . There is a note of exuberance not only in Jouvet's performance, but also in the conception of the film. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic crime drama made like a satire. It offers exceptional performance by Jouvet as a bristling police inspector. Antoine is an old policeman with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa, but he didn't climb the ladder due to his independent behavior); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; at work, Antoine is tough and ruthless, a capable, bitter, intelligent and hard inspector. It is a very tasteful, very picturesque role. Jouvet has composed his character of many distinctive features: his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality and that mocking air. Antoine is not made to look smarter than plausible; when he questions Blier, Antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented as the talent we encounter in real life, mixed with errors and gaps and defects. Antoine's talent is one that also derives from experience, from everyday observation he is not the almost supernatural genius of almost all the famous detective. <br /> <br /> QUAY ?? is it faceted? it is a realistic crime drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. It can be considered among the first cinematic forays into the legendary toughness of the French police. Long time ago the tough cops of Eastwood and Wayne, there was Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, suggesting that it is a police film, not a case or a mystery. <br /> <br /> As a craftsman, Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (in the way Welles was). QUAY ?? he is very faithful to Clouzot's nature, a sardonic comic, acute observations, a lot of psychology, a sharp and ruthless irony. The man was the first of the class when he filmed something, he knew what to shoot, what to choose, see the introductory scenes of this film, with the great success on the stage of Jenny Lamour. Every scene is memorable, in an exemplary way. Clouzot's technical and stylistic aptitudes were incredible. His style is inventive, satirical, acute, extremely clear, brilliant. <br /> <br /> Jouvet's style was exuberant, powerful, vehement. (Some disliked these characteristics. Being a great theater actor, his cinematographic style was considered too theatrical, etc.) His Antoine is a good example of what is meant by composition of a role, a composition . <br /> <br /> Jouvet had a very particular physiognomy, similar to a threatening bird of prey, a little like Van Cleef, even thinner, nobler, smarter and more distinguished. Jouvet had a ferocious and predatory air, and is useful here, while performing in an old policeman. One of the sides of QUAY is that it is a recital by Jouvet. It is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his show (I see that many, watching this film, do not know that it is a film by Jouvet that is in itself a stunning quality). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors I most admire; the first was revealed to me by a drama by Renoir (the famous), while Jouvet from a comedy by Carn√©. I was fascinated to see that Clouzot played a leading role in both of them. <br /> <br /> Finally, a word about Steeman; he wrote the novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel, like a Fresnay comedy). Steeman was an old-school mystery writer, in Wallace's vein. It quickly became obsolete with the new hardboiled fashions. When I was 11 I read one of his thrillers and I loved it.
