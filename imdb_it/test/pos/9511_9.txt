I've never seen a file in a language that I don't understand just because I wanted to watch the movie and I couldn't find it with English subtitles. I don't know how much I missed it, but it wasn't much. Probably just specific details that seem silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact. I want to tell The Diceman from Germany there is no reason to feel "disgusting" when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. As I said, I don't understand Japanese, or at least the small amount I got reading the very long novel, probably my favorite book of all time, which I couldn't delete and which I took the next day from work just to finish reading! I don't know if there is a dubbed or subbed English version but if the movie, but if there is, I'd like to see it. The film was incredible in Japanese, all the better the icing on the cake !!
