Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/ this film does not provide basic information. We are shown a snapshot of Danton's fall, his mock process and execution but, unless one has studied the revolution quite widely, it is difficult to understand where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) and then appreciate them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb could be the same person for the viewer. For example, Robespierre and Desmoulins have been close friends since their youth and this explains how Robespierre works. Those who know the facts, however, will easily orient themselves and appreciate this beautiful film with actors who play solid performances, without useless subplots and a good reconstruction of the times. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but they all do a good job, even the 'demented' Saint-Just portrayed as a kind of psychopath. 'Terreur' was a period of massacres whose importance was not fully documented and which - for the most part - were driven by ambition, greed and the settlement of personal disputes, fueled by ignorant sans-culottes like the next epochal step against tyranny.
