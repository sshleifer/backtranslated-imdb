Years before pre-marital agreements became normal, Ernest Lubitsch made a comedy on screen on which they are the basis. Bluebeard's eighth wife involves Gary Cooper as a multimillionaire living on the French Riviera, married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for the number eight. But Cooper is a good sport in this regard, always settling with his ex-wives for $ 50,000.00 a year as per the contract signed before marrying him. It looks like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement. <br /> <br /> Of course Claudette wants much more and feels that Cooper has a totally too similar approach to marriage. She would like the real deal and is willing to do a lot of things to get it. <br /> <br /> Bluebeard's Eighth Wife has some really fun moments, the original meeting of Cooper and Colbert in a store for men in which Cooper is insisting that he just wants his pajamas and that Colbert only looks for the bottom . And of course my favorite is Colbert who drags and blackmail the detective that Cooper sends out to spy on her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that same detective agitated. <br /> <br /> I have often wondered why Hollywood managed to cope with so many people who are not French films like this. Of course Cooper is an American and the cast is the only Colbert in reality of French origin. Although David Niven is as charming as ever, being a Frenchman is ridiculous, he is a true Englishman. <br /> <br /> However, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife is a fun movie and a great example of what has been called "the Lubitsch touch" back in the day.
