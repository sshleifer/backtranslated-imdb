>>>> Author: msgreen-1 from Canada >>>> The big problem was the affirmation of the "Chinese Syndrome": if the error of the reactor had occurred and the radioactive waste leaked, it could have caught fire in China. A lot of people have made fun of this and if the filmmakers seriously wanted it then yes, it should be made fun of. The spill would not do so in any way near the center of the earth or even the molten rock. Even if he arrived at the center of the Earth, how would he come out in China? It should flow against gravity for everything else! Even China is not the opposite part of the world, the Indian Ocean is. <<<<< ......... ......... ........... ............. ... ............. ..................... ................ .. .............. ............ ...... .......... <br /> <br /> This point is raised by the characters of the film, saying that obviously it could not happen, since the nucleus would have hit the aquifer and released a radio-active cloud, it rains on the population. <br /> <br /> Before trying to find a weak spot in the film, you should watch it first !!!! Don't judge a book by its title ...
