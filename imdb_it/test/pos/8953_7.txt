This was the film that started the cinematic love story <br /> between the Jaundiced Eye crew and Matthew Ferguson. His <br /> <br /> ability to portray normal characters RELATIVELY like Birkoff in <br /> <br /> "La Femme Nikita" is counterbalanced by his equally clever <br /> <br /> treatment of quirks like "Kane". One wants to be assigned only multiple roles, larger roles and others, even more complex <br /> <br /> roles to use to overcome the limits of his abilities. There were <br /> <br /> four or five memorable scenes in this film, and Matthew Ferguson <br /> <br /> stole two of them from much more experienced actors. The movie itself <br /> <br /> is good, and it's worth watching for its merits, but <br /> <br /> Ferguson makes it a little more special. His * ouevre * could <br /> <br /> show in the end what Anthony Perkins MIGHT's career was like if he hadn't been typecast as "Norman Bates" for so long <br /> <br /> ago . "Kane" is not as well chosen as Norman, and much less <br /> <br /> people have seen "Love and Human Remains" that have seen "Psycho", so we can <br /> <br /> hope that Ferguson will show us some suggestions on what Perkins MIGHT <br /> <br /> was able to accomplish, if he was allowed to do so ...
