Great movie. I was laughing all the time. Why? Well, I'm from Austria, I can get along with the kind of German (Bavarian) humor. So I guess this movie makes sense just looking when you're a native German speaker. Both Stefan and Erkan are talking about a new type of Turkish-German accent, which has become very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As in any comedy your personal mood will decide whether it's thumb up or down.
