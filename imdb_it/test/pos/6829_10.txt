The second episode of the new "Lost" gives you just what your fans missed: a good dose of compelling action. From the first scene, you keep seeing new features that you didn't expect to meet. It is the best proof that the series, which is about to pass into its fourth season, is still alive and well. <br /> <br /> Although the producers don't surprise us with a few flashes this time, the return to flashbacks is more than satisfactory, as it brings some shocking facts. The flashbacks introduce some new characters, and the familiar ones turn out to be connected in a surprising way. <br /> <br /> Cool characters dominate the whole episode and I can't say it hurts. Their scenic parts and their actors both do very well, giving us a feeling of courage - right after the episode, you will realize that the show really needed people just like that. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Confirmed dead" is full of compelling action and much written dialogue. I'm sure I'll mention the best scenes of the episode for a long time - they're just so good that they stay in the mind of the viewer. The episode is fun, intelligent and lively. You like "Lost", you have to watch it. My vote is ten.
