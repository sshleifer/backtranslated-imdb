This is Falcon's thirteenth film. Tom Conway has not lost his humor and style and shows no signs of fatigue. The film has a very satisfying story, with a lot of false suspicions, suspicions and ladies. Madge Meredith is the good girl of the story, she interprets it adequately, but it doesn't bring the screen into focus. Myrna Dell is a bad girl, and she wears an excellent stone face, with agate eyes, and you're just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible to cheer herself up. Edward Brophy is back as Goldie the assistant, but surprise surprise, his excessive manic action has stopped and is under control. This is a nice tribute to the directorial skills of William A. Berke, who had done so many westerns that he was probably not willing to take any nonsense from a Brooklyn mannequin. The result is that for the first time, perhaps in his career, Brophy has been softened enough to add something to a film rather than feel the patience of the viewer with the irritating behavior of a retarded but unruly six-year-old. It's all very well, and it's a lot of fun.
