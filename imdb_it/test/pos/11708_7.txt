I was very impressed by Mick Molloy's last production. As his fan, I was used to a different kind of humor than shown here. He wisely opted for a more subtle and broader style of comedy in Crackerjack, rather than his usual cowardice and perplexity. Sometimes it is inconsistent and messy, but a decent script acts beyond and makes the vision pleasant. Directed by Paul Moloney (who directed almost every conceivable Australian television series), Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a boy who belongs to his local bowling club for the sole reason of parking. When the club encounters financial problems, he is forced to play competitively in an attempt to raise funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine paradise. A familiar and successful formula, well managed. There is no denying that the film owes its success to the great casting of Molloy. He seemed to have an excellent relationship with Samuel Johnson, and an excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and even if the character is probably not very far from his personality, you can't help but wonder why he didn't try his arm in the cinema before . To smooth the inexperienced cast, the delicious Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter support and often steal their scenes. They are two good actors and the couple easily cross their roles. Had it not been for the huge success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", Crackerjack would have reached number 1 at the Australian box office, but if you consider what the film is about and who is involved, even if it makes it become a number 2 it was an exceptional effort. All in all, a witty and well-being film. Great cast, great crew and a fantastic soundtrack come together to make one of the best Australian films of 2002. 7/10.
