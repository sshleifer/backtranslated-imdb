I really enjoyed this movie and I think most of Lauren Ambrose's fans too. His character is much softer than his role in Six Feet Under and all the performances are strong. I particularly liked the way the role of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. Despite some other misinformed user reviews, the role was performed accurately and without clich√© by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Among the protagonists also Fran Kranz, whose natural naturalness has joined the veteran actors of the season. Although the management hit an obstacle here and there, it seemed that the only problems involved were an underdeveloped script. What may have worked well as a script did not go very well on the screen. However the beautiful photography of Paul Ryan surely compensates for this, as well as the rhythm of the film, which surprisingly is not slow. I recommend this film to fans of six feet and also to fans of simple good acting and cinematography.
