I love pop culture, but I was a little worried when I heard about it for the first time. Then, I saw an episode, and I love it! I was a little upset when I discovered that Christopher Eccelson would no longer play Doctor Who. It was probably the best they had. It fits the character so well. It is sad to see him go. I really don't think the new guy is going to pull out the doctor besides Eccelson's. I think everyone can ignore the effects of cheese in some places and creatures, like the Darleks. Plots and characters can more than compensate. I am currently waiting for the second season and will examine it too, in case, for any reason, the quality goes down. <br /> <br /> However, I think everyone should try to watch an episode. I did it, and since then I've always loved it. Well written, well cast and well produced, this show is worth watching. Doctor Who gets a 10/10
