then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's almost the same basic concept, a beautiful mixture of music, soul and drama. I have to admit that I was a bit worried about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white garbage girl chained to a radiator, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I had fun with Hustle & Flow so I thought I would like to give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I'm very glad I did it. It turned out to be more than the superficial story of a nymphomaniac southern girl imprisoned by a black man of 60 years. History has had a heart and has been very influential. <br /> <br /> Even the music of this film added a touch of class. Craig Brewer mixed his style with Hustle & Flow in this film, except he took a new spin and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts for performance scenes. It also has very interesting flashback scenes and gives you a general crazy feeling during some of the most controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a blues fan you should definitely go see this. I give him a very interesting movie out of 9, and he is extremely underestimated. shame. <br /> <br /> Go out and rent this movie.
