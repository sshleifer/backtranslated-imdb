I also remember seeing this film as a young man in a small local theater that featured foreign films every week. It was the bold adventure of all that has remained in my memory since then. <br /> <br /> Particularly impressive was the scene with Noel Purcell as the old sailor, Paddy, who drank too much, saw or heard the apparitions and died of fright in a cave. I always kept track of Noel's career even decades later because of my seeing him then. There is also a very young Cyril Cusack in the role of the crazy boatman James, with the drawings of the handsome Jean Simmons, shown as Emmeline grown up. <br /> <br /> I would love to have a video of this disturbing film and refresh my memory of it. Where do I send my request?
