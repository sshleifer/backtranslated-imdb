Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a small fable that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for young and old, and respect for cultural differences. It's a new story about a little goldfish that wants to be a girl, rather than a revisitation of the Disney Little Mermaid. Miyazaki has animated a bizarre and magical film for young and young people by hand. The film begins with a slow wavy blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish and dozens of fancy little goldfish with childlike faces. There is no need for narrative, the movement of creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi say the beginning. Released last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Animated Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The fanciful goldfish, Brunhild, leaves his ocean at home on a jellyfish. Once it reaches the surface, it is caught in a fishing net full of other fish, garbage and mud. She is pushed into a jar, which is brought to shore where it is recovered by Sosuke (voice of Frankie Jonas) of five years. He cuts his hand when he breaks the open jar to free the little red fish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosuke's cut, and sets his transformation into a human being, at the same time launching nature out of balance. Sosuke puts the small goldfish in a green bucket and names his Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and gelatinous. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), allows him to take Ponyo to school, which is right next to the nursing home where he works. Lisa is mad as she walks the picturesque winding road, crosses a dry dock, crosses the lively fishing town, and along a tree-lined road towards the nursing home is representative of Miyazaki's wonderful sequence of actions and perfectly illustrates the frantic morning of a parent. Miyazaki created another strong and independent female character in Lisa. Making it a loving, sensitive and modern mother with both Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's phone conversation with the non-new-husband-of-home, Kiochi (Matt Damon) because the ship he captain has to make another run, is the typical reaction of his wife. Later that evening Sosuke intercedes using a signal lamp to talk to his father as the ship crosses the cliff on which their home is located. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology and jumps up and reports "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off", it's a hilarious scene. But when Sosuke takes the spy and tells his father "Good luck, I love you", Lisa hugs him and tells him that he has a good heart, it's a very touching scene. <br /> <br /> My favorites Miyazaki's old women are in wheelchairs in the nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their interchange on Sosuke's small goldfish is wonderful and recalls the bickering between the waste witch (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they trudge up a long flight of stairs in Howl's moving castle. The magical father of Ponyo, god of the sea, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson) who resembles Howl the magician arrives to bring Ponyo back to his home on the ocean. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try to balance nature, but the magical little Ponyo again escapes upsetting other elixirs in the process and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, this red-haired girl reminds the public of the stubborn and adventurous little Mei in my neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is just as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto understands what Ponyo has done, he calls Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the ocean goddess, to help the situation. This wise and soothing Goddess arrives in a blue garment that never ends. He has a private talk with Lisa about the future of young children, which helps the audience understand that Sosuke and Ponyo's relationship are not lovers, but brothers and sisters. The simple and peaceful ending of life is typical of Miyazaki films, leaving the audience full of hope.
