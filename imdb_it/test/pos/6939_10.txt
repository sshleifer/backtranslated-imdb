Governments are elected for a period of three years, as stated by Reg Whithers in 1973, the liberals were determined to continue to force the Labor party in the polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but anyone who claims that Kerr acted properly in this way does not recognize the selfish and costly strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia. On the series itself, I thought Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. Furthermore, a greater number of key political actors on both sides should have been used, although this may have been a reflection of the budgetary constraints at the time. However, I recommend it, with caution.
