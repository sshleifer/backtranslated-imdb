I was flipping through the channels and I had to stop and laugh when I found this movie. It was so clearly on the teenage years in the early 1980s, and I called my mother "hahaha, turn to such a channel and so, the child looks totally like if dad was a child". <br /> <br /> Um. Yes. It turns out that this film is about my father and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even without it being a vaguely based story on my father's childhood, I'd say watch this movie! <br /> <br /> It's just ..... bizarre to say the least, the apathy instilled in the teenage years even then. This is a good "human interest" and shows some strange sides of the psyche.
