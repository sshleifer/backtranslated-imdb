Definitely worth looking at. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite work of air. You don't need to be an opera lover to watch this movie. (Although, of course, if you hate the work, you really have a bad time with this!) <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the segments range from bright to just beautiful. Most of the confusion seems to be above Godard's contribution - if you think it is brilliant or pretentious, its segment will not change your mind. <br /> <br /> Some of the pieces have a clear narrative; others are more a montage of linked images. <br /> <br /> None of the pieces is more than 10 minutes or so; if you're not happy with what's on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you're absorbing. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye out for performances by Buck Henry, Beverly D 'Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briget Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the admission price). <br /> <br />
