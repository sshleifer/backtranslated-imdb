I love this movie. The portrait of Shehzad Khan as Bhalla a.k.a. "Shut up, Robert!" it was so funny. Whenever he was hit during a fight scene, you could hear him screaming. Viju Khote is the incredulous Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". The dual role of Paresh Rawal is so exhilarating for his portrayal of Ramgopal Bajaj and Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother does a beautiful mimicry of Bhalla saying. "Relax, PLEASE relax." I love the scene where Aamir Khan puts a laxative in Salman "Muscles", Khan's food that caused irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the bathroom a good number of times.
