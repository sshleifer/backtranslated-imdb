Susie Q is an original and is not like those other Disney movies, *** spoiler *** a boy named Zach moves to a new city and has problems at school, he is a good basketball player. a girl in the 1950s died with her boyfriend when their car was smashed from a bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) of the power rangers - pink ranger - is helping Zach as a ghost to get a necklace along the way he has to explain to his sister about his ghost, and eventually getting this necklace, Susie returns to the bridge which is dead and then enters the spooky machine of her boyfriend and they float. later, when she misses her, she finds a girl who looks like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to watch from time to time but barely gives away because Disney needs to fill it all up with silly movies and shows I give it a <br /> <br /> 7/10
