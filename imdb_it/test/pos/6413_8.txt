It is less visceral than the only other Tsai film I saw ("Vive L'amour"), but the idea of ​​doors (holes) in the emotions and existences of others is vividly portrayed here, like Tsai that ranks closely after a long shot, usually long term, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, leave one perplexed but are the welcome indicators of millet that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs. It's not necessarily a movie that is easy to watch (even if it's not heavy at all), so I'd warn all casual viewers looking for "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you'd like to know something about the isolation between Taiwanese city dwellers and something more universal about the alienation of the city and the romantic desire, then watch this movie immediately.
