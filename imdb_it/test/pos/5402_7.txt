so. I was completely in love with this movie. gaga for this, even with all its twists ... but the only thing that I found really disturbing was the connection between Tim and Kyle's two best friends. While the scriptwriter of the film gave us such a touching moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation / confusion, does he then give us a twist that makes them half-brothers?!?! (Although the subject was not taken up in the film ... and left unexplained and unknown) I thought it was tacky and the fact that it wasn't even discussed was even worse. (Oops we have created a taboo ... now we do not face the situation, because in reality it would not be a P.C.) Otherwise a spectacular film
