Cooley High is such a beautiful film that even with the soundtrack of the period, the urban landscape, the wardrobe and the jargon ... it still doesn't feel dated. The soundtrack is a timeless classic in itself. <br /> <br /> Instead it absorbs you directly. This is a staple of a good movie. From the beginning to the end he doesn't miss a beat and I never tire of looking at him. <br /> <br /> The ending is unique in respect of the fact that it is one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie terminations. There may have been few since then (Backdraft comes to mind) but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
