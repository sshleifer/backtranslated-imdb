Even for a 17-year-old student who loves history and has glimpsed the excitement and excitement in his childhood years of this series, his arrival on DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South are really a series of friendship, love, honor ... you give your list of feelings you feel by watching this series. I still remember the first time I saw this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. Even if wow seems exciting. To the evil I have never had the chance to see the book one and two on TV in the Netherlands. When the third book was released in the late evening series in the Netherlands in the summer of 2004, I knew I had to see the other two series. For most people booking three was a big disappointment as far as I know. Well since I saw the first book on DVD, I must say that so far it is the best of all 3 books. For all young people who watch only fantasy films like The Patriot "Oh America for Freedom" there is a more realistic vision to see here for them .....
