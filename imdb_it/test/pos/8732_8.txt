CACTUS FLOWER was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a play by Neil Simon about a dentist (Walter Matthau) who had an affair with a young free-spirited woman (Goldie Hawn), totally unaware that his devoted nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) was in love with him. Matthau can play this kind of role in sleep and does not disappoint as the itinerant dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, who goes out with a woman, but actually has no idea he is in love with another. Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her glittering interpretation of Toni Simmons, the elderly flower child who slowly realizes she is trapped in a dead end and is not as blurry as it appears on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary Ingrid Bergman as Stephanie Dickinson, Dr. Winston's all-devoted assistant, who is willing to bury and sacrifice his happiness until Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is bright in this film, he looks absolutely beautiful (even though the camera has always loved her) and shows an unexpected ability for light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and settings are a bit dated, but the story is timeless and the stars' performances make it imminently watchable.
