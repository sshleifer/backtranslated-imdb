Yes, I saw this mini series with My Mom and dad as a child. It was one of the few mini-series that my 9-year-old mind could actually follow. I remember he was very well done, and he didn't necessarily have the feeling of the typical mini crap series. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your attention. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and twists. Although most twists in this film are written or predictable, it is still worth it. I haven't verified yet if you can do it via netflix. I could not imagine. They should play it on the story channel or something.
