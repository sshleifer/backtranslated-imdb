The films of Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra have never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was cool and perfect to look at. Mohabbatein remains one of my favorite movies of all time. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, although not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned films, but certainly deserves a watch. And SRK, who upset me with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats an evil deed. And this time he receives an expert Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him. <br /> <br /> Before commenting on acting, it's not just acting, but the wonderful script that makes a watch deserve. It is the writing that compliments the great acting. The plot is compelling, but the characterization is what stands out. The comic song gets along. But the film has a tendency to shift too much to romanticism. The viewer is bound to lose interest and make a couple of yawns. But the film is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his role as an author. Shahrukh Khan is again nice and cruel. You are destined to cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. His screams are bound to become annoying after a while. But in the facial expression it is excellent. But his final scene is brilliant (even though it was overshadowed by SRK). It has a role supported by the author that makes it very nice. Sunny Deol is adequate. His character was very nice, but too perfect. And it gets boring after a while. However it does a good job. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role seems a little out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. <br /> <br /> The songs are fun and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and the presentation is very similar to the 90s. You Mere Saamne (You're in front of me) and Likha Hai (written here) are beautiful love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is also a decent love song. The instrumental song is danced to perfection, as is the wedding song Solah Button. The film may not be perfect, but it's worth it, especially if your favorite actor is present.
