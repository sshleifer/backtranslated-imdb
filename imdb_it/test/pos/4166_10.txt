All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman, the Viking guardian, had memorable phrases and the master of the skull, the villain, would always swear to kill Max with a mad resentment. Writing is the best <br /> <br /> I was glued to the set when this happened when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes, I would be forced to buy it. This and a cartoon by Conan the Barbarian are the ones I miss the most since childhood. I think these cartoons are the most misunderstood of all the great cartoons. I watched these cartoons on channel 13 in the Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I remember that the owl was always afraid, warning Max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. Max didn't believe he was the chosen one and always gave trouble to the owl. Norman was less talkative but his simplicity was fun. He said things like "I eat monsters for breakfast" when he was fighting them. And then, when he was fighting the zombies, he would have said "I eat zombies for ... it doesn't matter". Classic comedy and cartoon action. I vote that re-air Mighty Max.
