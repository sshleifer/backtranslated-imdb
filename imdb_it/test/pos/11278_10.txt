This kind of anxiety can only be within a young person who is very serious about his religion and his place in this world. As the text says at the beginning of the film, these images are dead: they are already the past and they have gone well since the product is ready. But this is only for those who produce these "products": perhaps for someone who is in the same mood (I think that many people, at least among those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible anxieties and doubts in their development staff). And this, of course, is the reason why art is made in the first place: identification and consolation among other human beings. <br /> <br /> This film uses the "classic" techniques of experimental cinema very well. And it is here that those techniques are in my opinion in the best possible use: as a tool to tell stories and create atmosphere for them, not only as a pure abstraction or as an end in themselves. Those "tricks" have already been done many times. Some other films I imagine have influenced / inspired this director are "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu". It is interesting how these techniques make this film absolutely timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this film. Or nothing from any other specific time either. It may have been created a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> It is interesting in this story how these people treat this newly born holy child: they use it selfishly in their purposes and do not even try to listen to it. They beat him, tore off his intestines and castrate him. They drag his (living) body with strength from one place to another. And they do the same kind of violence to his mother. The story also reminds me of Borges' story "El informe de Brodie". Even the criticism of the practices of Christian institutions reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> Unpleasant sometimes but beautiful watch. Very simple, thought and concentrated. Very strong film, almost too strong. The whole human energy has focused on this. This film also shows that when you have passion and ideas, you can make a film with a zero budget. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that it was a bit difficult to look at for a "contemporary" viewer like me, due to the experimentation. He was so slow and demanding. But after all, it's worth it. I have to give ten points just for the effort someone makes this kind of film.
