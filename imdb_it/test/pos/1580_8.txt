This film, I would say, was fantastic. I see how many people would think it's just a more shocking movie. This is not completely false, but it is as much a fiction as shocking as Chuck Palahniuk's books. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata is a certain kind of starkly made movie about which you can have any reaction. It's scary, funny, silly, vulgar, full of off-the-top stuff and for some people, arousing. The first time I saw him he was with my friend, and his mother had brought him home to see him. He said he was just a little fucking Japanese movie, but I saw a lot more. It is badly done, yes, but it has a certain kind of intensity that is also beautiful. As the director himself says, this is a shocking film made for some reason. It's like atrophy. If you lose the audience, then the whole human race will be soft. I think this is a good philosophy, and I agree one hundred percent. Bijo no Harawata is the kind of movie that the gang raps for fitness, yogurt and all this new-wave stuff.
