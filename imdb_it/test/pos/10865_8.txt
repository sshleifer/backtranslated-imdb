I started looking at this aspect of the worst, I was happy to find out that the film turned out to be pleasant, slightly confused in the parts, like when everyone started singing. It gave me the chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, he's a better actor than I thought, sometimes he seemed a little out of place. I thought the purple storm deserved his version of Hong Kong legends, as it is different from most other Hong Kong films, it concerns a man's emotional struggles when faced with memory loss, it may seem trivial but when in the end he puts out something and who he really is really makes the film much more interesting. Once you get into the film, you will find that it holds you tight, as if you missed it a bit, so a lot of the film will make sense, for example I lost a little at the beginning and I recommend to anyone who looks at it nothing missing . So I can say that this film was worth looking at and a pleasant surprise for me, which I liked.
