This is one that you can look at repeatedly and laugh every time. We were at a Keaton festival here after buying some of his films. In this Buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes, but also what's best about Buster - his creativity. The opening scene is really fun and just continues from there.
