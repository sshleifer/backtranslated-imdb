This is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler approaches the real magic on the screen as anyone in turn is the brave, clumsy, brave and very scary mother of Gypsy Lee. It evokes a sense of desperation that is sometimes both comic and tragic but always genuine and very beautiful. Such charm and determination is truly a pioneer woman without borders. This frontier is discovered for children. Those who in turn must forge their own in a world dominated by the overbearing mother. <br /> <br /> This particular version is, as I understand it, in its entirety, including the brilliant choreography by Jerome Robbins, as well as the original captions.
