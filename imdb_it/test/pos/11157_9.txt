Ok, I know it's a clich√©. Taken on the surface, this is a bad movie, perhaps in a league with "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The dialogue is suspect (but the Singlish is rather funny ...), the plot is not entirely believable, the character of Gavin overlaps too much. While watching the movie, things happen that really make you wonder ... Nice and Kim coming out on a tank, Gwen eating a banana in a bathroom, pretty much everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho !!") These things taken separately are perhaps flaws. Taken together, however, they are just oddities. Watch this movie with an open mind (especially if you're not familiar with Singapore culture), and with a group of open-minded friends it's guaranteed to offer lots of laughs and a memorable time. You cannot enter this movie expecting a masterpiece, or even expect to take something serious. If you can bring this movie for what it is - a loser film about the underdog, filled to the brim with its quirks - then you should have fun watching this! I've seen it three times already and wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times !!
