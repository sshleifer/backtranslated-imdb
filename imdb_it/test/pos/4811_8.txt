I recently saw An zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong film, but because I was looking for a change from the films produced here in the United States. In my humble opinion, I believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers that are produced here, with the exception of the traditional idiosyncrasies of the Hong Kong film. What still bothers me was the chief inspector character. I still can't understand why there should be a complete-idiot-relief-comedian character - even in serious movies coming out of Hong Kong, but I can live with it when the film is so beautiful. The characters are credible even if the situations in which they find themselves are not. The plot is fast and it really makes you sick. The real cincher scenes for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes. Overall, a really solid film.
