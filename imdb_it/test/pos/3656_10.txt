Between extraordinary and extraordinary scenes in a myriad of Indian places and a plot that is inspired by Bollywood and anchored to reality, this highly moving film is absolutely not to be missed for those who love a good adventure / romance. And by that I mean "good", not a Hollywood or a happy happy ending to Hollywood. The East meets the West in a different interpretation of the film friend. The shows are inspired and brilliant, the epic of cinematography and the amusing, engaging and moving storyline without a trace of schmaltz or economic tug on the heart's strings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't make your teeth rot. Watch it!
