I liked this Columbo movie its atmosphere, which was a real thriller and its approach also sometimes reminded me of the film noir, in the film its first 30 minutes or so. It's really beautiful and done in an old-fashioned way, with the camera's camera angles and the use of light. It doesn't immediately mean that this film is brilliant, but it's solid enough to consider it a good late Columbo movie. It is certainly a film better than the "next" average on the voice of a Columbo film. <br /> <br /> 26 years after his previous appearance in a Columbo film, George Hamilton returns to play the lead role of Peter Falk, still as a murderer, in a totally different and new role, of course. I liked his role and he was a good "villain" from Columbo, who gave the good old lieutenant a good competition. They had nice sequences together. The problem with Columbo's new "modern" films has always been that he didn't have a well-known actor alongside Peter Falk. This film obviously does not suffer from this problem. But I must say that this film does not present Peter Falk to the fullest. He certainly played the character better and his performance is not quite consistent in this film, probably also thanks to the film of his director Daryl Duke, who also directed the terrible movie "Tai-Pan", among many other projects. <br /> <br /> It has a pretty good and funny story, but the fact that the same type of plot to cover the murder had already been used in a previous Columbo film does not help naturally. It was first used in the 1975 film "Columbo: Playback". Nevertheless, of course, he still has enough "original" moments with his story, although obviously in essence every Columbo film is more or less the same. But oh well, this is what made the Columbo series so big and consistent. If it's not broken, don't fix it. <br /> <br /> It is also true that within this film more clues than usual are left out of the lieutenant, which does not mean that the film is his most stupid or sloppy assassin but I see it more as I writers are more enthusiastic than others. It doesn't make the film or the story bad, and perhaps even makes it even more fun to see Columbo at work and discover all kinds of small but important clues. Fortunately the film is also full of fun and exciting Columbo comedies. <br /> <br /> Simply a good late movie Columbo. <br /> <br /> 7/10
