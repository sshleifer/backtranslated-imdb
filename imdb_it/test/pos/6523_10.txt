"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island!" it's a hilarious show that is Saturday morning on WB. Celebrate Fred Coconut and all his friends on the island, and each episode is a very funny misfortune for them. Most of the time, it is due to the difficulty of Coconut Fred to create antics that make it fun and other things happening on the island at the same time. The humor is fantastic and no one on the island is very bright, which adds that it's as fun as it is. I don't think this could be more fun. The character's vocal talents are magnificently superior and exaggerated, which adds to the show's hilarity. If this is ever on DVD, I'm taking it A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended for a good laugh.
