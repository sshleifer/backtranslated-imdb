When I saw this movie, the first thing that struck me was the acting of Kelly Overton, a young (and active and leading) actress I saw for the first time totally upset me .. she's fantastic on screen and I am really looking forward to seeing what the future brings ... <br /> <br /> The film itself was good in the sense that it let Kelly Overton do his thing and take the wiever for a ride ... much more I had the feeling of having seen it all before .. but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if only to see Kelly Overton .. this theatrical actor takes the storm screen .. I I give this film a grade of 7 ... 5 for acting and 2 for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> And on a last note .. sorry for my bad English .. if this is meaningless to you: P plz ignore me ...
