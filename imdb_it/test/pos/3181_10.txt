This was an excellent show. He came to PBS at home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teenage daughter. The show dealt with topics such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was a middle-class black family that had a teenage daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood in Oakland or somewhere (I don't remember). I remember several episodes, but what I remember most was when their cousin got his period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I looked at it for the first time and was able to keep up with the program. This was a great show. I can't remember the name of the guy who played the son on the show, but I always confused him with Kevin Hooks.
