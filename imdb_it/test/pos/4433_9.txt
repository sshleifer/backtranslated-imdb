After visiting the Kimbell museum in Forth-Worth, Texas, USA, enjoying art and architecture (including the nearby Modern Art Museum), and having a pleasant conversation with the bookstore lady, I purchased this DVD with some 'high expectations ?? and was not disappointed at all. <br /> <br /> The thematic approach, dramatic tension, revealing interviews, archival footage and breathtaking architecture are also mixed together to explore the life of the late iconic Louis I. Khan. <br /> <br /> Start the documentary: contemplative classical music games, the archives are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed, blurred letters that symbolically refer to a train window that crosses a landscape in the background ?? a journey, a focus and out of focus, the search eventually culminates in an article in a newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads from the front page of the New York Times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best living American architect and his death announced. <br /> <br /> "When I first read that obituary, I have to admit I was looking for my name, I was also his son, his only son, I didn't know my father very well. He never married my mother and he never lived with us (??) He died when I was eleven. <br /> <br /> So years later, this illegitimate child is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father that seems to be a great professional and public figure, but who is the secret private life escapes him and hits him to the point where he intends to do something about it. <br /> <br /> "For years I struggled to be satisfied with the small pieces of life of my father that I was allowed to see, but it was not enough, I needed to know him, I needed to find out who he really was, so I embarked on a journey, to see his buildings and to find all that was left of him out there. He would take me to the other side of the world, looking for the man who left me with so many questions. "<br /> <br /> So the documentary is two -continuous, with a slow systematic discovery by the world-famous architect, we know: 1) his ideas, buildings and architectural perspective and 2) his families, the colleagues, the lives of the people who have affected and the human perspective <br /> <br /> The DVD also offers a more in-depth view with a series of questions and answers with the writer / director and additional films that include the great Louis I. Khan who quotes "All they all say is the truth. It is their truth. It may not be real. "And" A good idea that does not happen is not an idea at all. "<br /> <br /> This film is a journey of discovery. Self-discovery and discovery of a man, a great man, yet human, imperfect like all of us. We know him through the eyes of an admired and slightly bitter son , but with the openness and the objectivity to really explore without drawing easy and judging conclusions. <br /> <br /> Through key interviews with people who interacted with him in various guises, we slowly put together some pieces until to the final interview with this Bangladeshi man who really seems to bring him home with visceral and sensible comments. <br /> <br /> Brilliant architect, brilliant documentary.
