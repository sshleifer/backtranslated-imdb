Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was full of twists, good acting, great story and a surprising ending. To be completely honest, this film was not overly bloody, but contains some blood, but it was more psychologically. I read it on the Internet: the film cost 3000 dollars and was shot in 8 days. Amazing!!! This is for someone who wants to think and love making movies. What starts as a terrifying thriller slowly turns into something a little more twisted, even a little more sinister. I can't say much without giving away points in the plot, only that this film went beyond my expectations
