Scary in places, even if the effects left something to be desired, unless you had a bad view or were afraid of the dark. However most of the acting was convincing and most of the effects were well performed. I thought the creature looked a little like a man in a gorilla suit for my taste. It reminded me of the original pink panther movie.
