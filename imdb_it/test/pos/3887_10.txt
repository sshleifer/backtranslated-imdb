Garlin is unquestionably a comedian and a comedian for anyone looking for fun. His first film, which is entirely his creation and production, tells the story of a combative Chicago actor, James Aaron, with whom Jeff obviously identifies. Marvelously crossing James with "Marty" by Paddy Chayefsky and with Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul, he exposes James's dilemmas with a host of actors who in real life are Jeff's friends, many of whom are Second City students. <br /> <br /> He delightfully uses the sweetness of Sarah Silverman and the absurdly absurd humor to exemplify how, despite common sense and talent, the contentment of life can too often deny inflexible frustration. Bonnie Hunt offers a captivating show as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Don't let a simple story mislead you, the characters and conflicts are well thought out and sound real. Those who follow Garlin's career and understand that his humor is based on telling reality with humor, not necessarily creating fictions that too easily can be invented, will appreciate his dialogue-driven story. <br /> <br /> We will certainly see Garlin working much more as a director and writer with other talented intelligent comic actors who take on the great challenge of making life fun.
