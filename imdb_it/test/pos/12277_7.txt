You must love the universe of spaghetti westerns. The vision of a west where the good guys are struck point blank without warning, the cartoon villains chew the scenery in extreme close-ups and the anti-hero walks away from the girl at the end. A lot of people call Corbucci's films "depressing". I find it a bit ambiguous regarding the descriptions. I think that squalor and implacable are more suitable above all because "depressing" suggests a level of sentimentality that almost every director of Eurowestern has ignored in favor of painting large characters. <br /> <br /> SPECIALISTS must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take the right place in the Sergio Corbucci fee. It is a good movie. And it is logical that Corbucci wanted to blow some steam with the COMPANEROS after the incessant two punch of THE GREAT SILENCE and this (even if he would later return to his usual tricks with the crazy SONNY AND JED). There is still a certain amount of caricature that distracts from the general gloom of the film, because it hurts more than it is useful to have a useless inclusion of three little boys dressed as hippies who wander around the city looking for gold and trouble. And it hurts to have Mario Adorf who plays the Mexican bandit with one hand El Diablo as over the top while always playing his characters. <br /> <br /> Those little complaints aside there is more than enough here to wet the palate of the spaghetti aficionado. Shooting galore, the population of an entire city reduced to crawling naked in the dirt, the typical iconic speed of the laconic anti-hero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost all the characters in the film. Corbucci could never receive the praise of the most famous Sergio or of the American patriarchs of the genus, but you and I know that it is a grave injustice for a very talented director. His selection of dynamic strokes, in-depth staging with objects that approach the camera and retreat into the background, his enthusiasm for rapid rhythm and feverish energy in moving a story that is not always over, the way in which he photographs open spaces, everything in his work I am sure that if Corbucci were American and emerged 15 years later together with Mann and Hawks, the critics of the Cahiers du Cinema would have praised him as an author worthy of serious critical consideration.
