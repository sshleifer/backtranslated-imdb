This NFBC film was made in honor of the Montreal Canadian dynasty in the 50s, 60s and 70s. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my eleventh birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I was a fan of Canadians for 29 of my 30 years of life . on a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film a 117. All hockey fans should see it as I hope it will be placed in the Toronto Hockey Hall of Fame and shown at the Bell Center in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Posto. Watch this movie with your family is a great movie. I also recommend the book in French and English. Go Habs Go.
