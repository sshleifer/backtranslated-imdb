Brilliant actors and brilliant image !! I love the chopper scene with music at the beginning, it's so touching and at the same time real but at the same time surreal! The Vietnam war was anything but human and I believe that this type of cinema show can lead to terrible human beings in certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a simple smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A film that imagines evil and hatred mixed with fear and destiny. How crazy the world is and the power of will and friendship, of love and passion. A must-see film and without a doubt the best war movie ever! Many have tried to copy but still there are no films not even so close !!
