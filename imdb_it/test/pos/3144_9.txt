I saw this movie the same night I saw 6 other short films. This was a step ahead of the others in terms of acting quality, direction, filming and originality of the story. It is accompanied by a professionalism often lacking in short films. <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Amazing shows. The 2 actresses are both compelling and credible. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is transmitted, even if the film lasts 10 minutes. Acting and directing are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully filmed. The lighting, framing and general shots are impressive. The 35mm film distinguishes this film from other short films. And what a difference it makes. Filming is worthy of this film. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong story Short films often try to do too little or too much with time. Or are they trying to tell a predictable story. This is a good balance to tell you an interesting story, without attracting it too long or leaving you unsatisfied. You wonder what will happen next, while at the same time you feel that you have seen something happen. <br /> <br /> Nice score too. Congratulations without oppression. <br /> <br /> If you can find it at a festival, make an effort to see it.
