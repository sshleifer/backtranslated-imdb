I loved this movie! I'm shocked and disappointed that he never made it to the movies. Each story was better than the last .. much better than the much-quoted "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" series and much better than the terrible "Urban Legend". I would recommend this movie to any horror fan.
