After seeing this John Leguizamo routine, I finally understood why he is such a talent. I really like working on stage, and this is theater work at its best. I can't label it as a stand-up routine, because Leguizamo is so intense when he plays the different characters. The only time he breaks the character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part where he does it so coldly, that you cannot help but appreciate his talents. I wasn't sure what I felt for him as an actor, but Freak solidified my appreciation for him. For those out there who have not had the opportunity to see this show, I try for you. Definitely check. It's one of the nesting routines I've ever seen. He aligns with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
