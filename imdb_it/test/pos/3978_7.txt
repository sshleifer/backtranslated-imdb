A great movie. The film was even better than what the commercials publish. And believe it or not it was really very inspiring. I really think that anyone out of the movie will eventually be inspired in one way or another. <br /> <br /> It was a little trivial at first, but quickly resumed. I laughed. I laughed very hard at some parts. Acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better than average. I can safely say that it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (the first one is CLERKS II). So, after all, I give him a 7/10 (a high seven, but not really an eight).
