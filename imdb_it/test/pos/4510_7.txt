In the 1970s in Afghanistan, the boy Pushtun Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and the boy Hazara Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), who is his faithful friend and son of their servant Hazara Ali (Nabi Tanha), grew up together in the paternal home of Amir, playing and playing in the streets of a quiet Kabul. Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi) blames him for his mother's death in the delivery, and also that his father loves and prefers Hassam to him. In return, Amir has great respect for his father's best friend Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir won a kitting contest, Hassam runs to bring a kite to Amir, but he is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef (Elham Ehsas) on an empty road to protect Amir's kite; the coward Amir is witness of the assault, but does not help the faithful Hassam. The day after his birthday party, Amir hides his new watch in Hassam's bed to frame the boy like a thief and force his father to fire Ali, freeing his conscience from remembering his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invaded Afghanistan and Baba and Amir fled to Pakistan. In 1988, they had a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduated from a public college because of Baba's pride and joy. Later Amir meets his peasant Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and they get married. In 2000, after Baba's death, Amir is a famous novelist and receives a call from the Rahim Khan terminal, which reveals secrets about his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, Pakistan, on a journey of redemption. /> <br /> I am not familiar with Afghan culture and I have not read this novel despite my daughter's recommendation, and yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief insight into the recent history of Afghanistan, from a period of peace in the 1970s to the present with the Taliban. The actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. The dry places in China recall the images we see on television from Afghanistan. In the end, I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ca√ßador de Pipa" ("The Kite Chaser")
