This is a great horror movie for people who don't want all that gore vomit and vomit and sensationalism. This film has equal amounts of horror, suspense, humor and even a little bit of nudity, but nothing big. Linnea Quigley is not exaggerated as in "The Return of the Living Dead", where she danced naked on a crypt, but is still essentially the same slutty character. Cathy Podewell is a virginal and chaste character before going to "Dallas", and we are also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkade, the sexy and sinister aspiring dark matron of the house. While she and Linnea are possessed and take possession of the house, they revive the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits of the survivors. I've heard many people compare this movie to "The Evil Dead", but if anything, this movie is a rival to that in the same way that Freddie rivaled Jason. This movie series is much higher than that!
