We rented the video for a slow Saturday night. First vision I thought it was fun. It took a while to get used to American caricatures (here we are more in tune with the British grotesques) but very funny. <br /> <br /> I looked at it again the next night and really warmed up. The characters seemed more human - lovable, too. A movie can be watched multiple times and get more every time. However, my wife * hated * this. I guess there is no need to think in terms of humor.
