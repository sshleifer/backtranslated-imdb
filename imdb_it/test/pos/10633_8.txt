Erika Kohut is a woman with profound sexual problems. At the beginning of the film, we see her arrive home late. When the mother protests, Erika goes into a frenzy, attacking the old woman mercilessly. Erika, apparently, is a music teacher of a certain reputation in the conservatory where she teaches. When we see her later, she is the model of composure, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels that she is wasting her time, and hers. The same applies to the insecure Anna, a talented girl whom Erika hates, perhaps because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, we watch Erika enter a fun zone and proceed to one of the booths where pornographic material is shown. Erika is staring as she looks at the things that are done on the screen. On another occasion, Erika arrives at a drive-in where a movie is in progress. His focus is on a parked car where two lovers perform a sexual act. The camera focuses on Erika as she gets lost in reverie watching what the two lovers are doing, until she is caught by the young man inside the car. Erika flees in horror has been discovered. <br /> <br /> When a wealthy couple invites Erika to recite in a recital in their opulent home, she meets an eager young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's game; the young man is a talented pianist himself. His impatience to compliment Erika meets skepticism on his part. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class, and he is accepted. <br /> <br /> Thus begins the search for Erika's Walter, who is caught off guard when he realizes what the young man's motivations really are. In turn, Erika begins to fantasize about Walter in ways that only her mind could, imagining what she would like him to do when, and if, they got together. Walter is disregarded by the letter Erika wrote to him describing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man. <br /> <br /> The film's ending reminded us of Mr. Haneke's latest "Cache" sequence. We are taken to a concert hall where Erika will perform. She is seen walking around the entrance looking for Walter, who enters the lobby without noticing her. Erika's expression to the camera reveals much more than her mood in the last few minutes of the film. While she escapes from the lobby after inflicting a wound on herself, the camera abandons her and concentrates on the facade of the building which seems to remain on the screen for a long time. <br /> <br /> "The Pianist" is a personal triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This magnificent actress makes one of her best screen appearances, guided by the sure hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Huppert's works with economic gestures, however, project so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast does wonders under the director's guidance. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. It seems to be the key to everything that went wrong with his daughter. There is a bit of incest that is played with subtlety in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is played perfectly like Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man, so in love with a woman possessed by demons, who will never be able to drive away or convince him to love him in a normal way. /> <br /> Michael Haneke's films are always annoying to watch, but offer so many rewards because he dares to go where others don't. The magnificent music heard in the film are mainly by Schubert and Schumann, two Erika's favorite composers. The film was helped tremendously by Christian Berger's cinematography.
