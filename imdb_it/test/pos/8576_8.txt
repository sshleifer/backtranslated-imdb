I've seen this movie twice already and I'm very impressed. <br /> <br /> The conversations between Nimi and his mother plus Nimi and Matthew are very touching. The Nigerian community is shown in a very sincere and colorful manner as usual. <br /> <br /> Although some things could have done with a little more explanation; if we knew why Matthew was in the south of France, the scenes that follow Matthew that are in his car would be more understandable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website with detailed production notes that help make those scenes easier to understand. <br /> <br /> I would like to go see him again but unfortunately he had a limited release in London and is no longer available to see it. I hope the video's release reaches a wider audience because the film deserves it.
