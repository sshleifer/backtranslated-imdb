I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was looking at Hoods and it was fun. So, as I said, never go against the family! The request for multiple lines is OK as I like to express my opinions quite frequently. If something is badly written it is most likely my sight and not my brain. This gives me yet another chance to take my shots at "The Departed". When you know exactly what is going to happen in the last scene without any previous knowledge, this usually means that it wasn't all so suspenseful. All you need is a good directer, the same guy I think he made my favorite movie, "Goodfellows", but in a completely different way. And then throw yourself to Jack the big one and get yourself an Oscar. I need to see the hoods to make sure it's not better than "The Departed" Gibbs
