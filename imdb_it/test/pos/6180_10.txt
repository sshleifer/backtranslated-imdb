the planktonic comments must have been written on Topsy-Turvy Day, because all that is declared by that simple form of life is the opposite of true truth! <br /> <br /> Bluebeard's Eighth Wife is hilarious in every scene, anyway - the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper couldn't be more beautiful ... the supporting cast is superb. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing are magnificent !!! <br /> <br /> Like so many other comments on this advice, I complain again, "Why can't movies be like that anymore?" <br /> <br /> This is the classic Paramount 1930 screwball comedy at its best, folks!
