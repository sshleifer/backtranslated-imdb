Although Bullet In The Brain is, without a doubt, superior among short films, it seems more like a short piece of writing than a film. And it's a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher, when his intelligent observations make him shoot. But after the bullet entered his brain, we begin to understand a little about why he became so tired of life in the first place. There is an impressive amount of detail enclosed in this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a bit - it seems like there is almost too much to capture at once as details get to fly so fast . A slightly more relaxed rhythm and a less pungent narrator in the final section would have benefited a little this film. Despite these complaints, it cannot be denied that Bullet In The Brain is a pretty amazing job compared to many short films, and even full-length ones. Producers should be applauded for trying to make a film so emotional and literal in the current climate of fast jokes and Hollywood action.
