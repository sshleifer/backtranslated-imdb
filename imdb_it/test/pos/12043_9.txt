Darr (1993) was an incredible film. In my opinion, it is one of the best in Bollywood. The film itself triggers feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. The role of Shahrukh was incredible, in fact he gave the obsession a new face. The innocent and girly character of Juhi Chawla contrasted greatly with the ardent and passionate character of Shahrukh. The role of Sunny Deol made the role of "good boy" that of "bad". The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, caught the public's attention shows that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that is not in their hands. Although the film has several years, it surpasses any recent. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fits the role perfectly. He should seriously consider acting in a similar film.
