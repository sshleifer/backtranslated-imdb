I saw this movie at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I entered with the assumption that if he played Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank he had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the English accented by Afrikaaner and Xhosa (?) of some of the actors was rather difficult to understand but how to see "Waking Ned Devine", "Trainspotting" or any other movie with actors from strong accent I adjusted after about 15 minutes. And I was trying to figure out why Hilary Swank should have been South African and seemed to be trying to put an accent but it sounded very American ... like she was making a weak attempt to put the accent. But later in the film, when something more is revealed about his character and how she moved to the United States as a teenager, she begins to understand how she could have lost some or most of her accent. So he started to make sense of the fact that only certain words could have an Afrikaaner touch to them. <br /> <br /> I know it is a bit weak to use the film as an education, but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a trial for truth and reconciliation. I had heard about the T and R process in South Africa since the fall of apartheid, but I didn't really know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that, although some scenes seemed a little conceived, this was overall a very strong film. The closing sequence in which the "truth" emerges was the strong conclusion that each film hopes for. A definite must see for all those who care about what happens outside their borders.
