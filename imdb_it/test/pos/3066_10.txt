Mel Brooks has really outdone himself in this film. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic and a breakthrough in this style of comedy, but Men In Tights has become the pinnacle of his creative genius. This film is not to be missed. If you like this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The same applies to the contrary. If you've seen any of these movies, then Men In Tights should be next on your list.
