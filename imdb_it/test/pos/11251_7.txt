I come from Texas and live very close to Plano where actual deaths occurred, so I might be a little biased in saying that "Wasted" is a movie you can't get out of your head. <br /> Stahl, Phoenix and Paul play all their characters in a very realistic way. You really believe they are all high school students who are simply heroin addicts. The content of the drug is also managed in a very graphic manner - although everything that happens in the film has a purpose, and every moment the characters move further down is heartbreaking. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Once you look at it, it sticks with you!
