I saw Linda, and it's a Top-Rate movie! The lives of Paul and his wife, Linda, whom he loved as a young man and eventually married. They meet another married couple, Jeff and Stella, and the four become good friends. But their friendship takes a turn after spending the holidays together in Varona Beach .... A turning point that never returns married couples to their previous status as friends. <br /> <br /> Linda is not to be missed !!! ! Virginia Madsen's acting is acceptable; however, Richard Thomas steals the film with his incredible acting ... and the emotions he shows. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie! "Fight honey"
