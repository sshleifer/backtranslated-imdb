Clearly my assessment for this is not to suggest that it compares to Silver's class horrors, but with other low budgets of the 70's, driving in economic terms and in that department is really a classic. The lack of money shows (does anyone worry too much?) Acting is adequate rather than professional (does it make it more realistic?) But unlike many other films, and not just low-budget ones, this does not lead to moment. Shit can be, but crap non stop, in the face disgusting and although inevitably a little campy at times, this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what I'm talking about. Sometimes quite delusional, this little crazy movie filled with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and entertainment, in fact it is to watch.
