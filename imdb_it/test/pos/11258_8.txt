I wasn't planning to look wasted when I saw the preview of MTV but since I had nothing better to do or watch on Sunday night I watched it. <br /> <br /> Wasted was not Requiem for a dream but it was a very nice film considering it was made by MTV. One thing that attracted me to watch it was Summer Pheonix, the sister of the late and wonderful Pheonix River. I imagine the talents work in the Pheonix family because she was good, as was Jaquien, even though I'm not River. Nick Stahl also gives a great preformance like a junky jock. There is not much else to say about wasted. It was a dark, depressing and penetrating gaze into the lives of three small-town drug addicts. I recommend it to those who like the subject. 8/10
