For me this is a good series. I'm a little disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby are dead, but more upset that Michael lied to everyone about who killed them. And if someone can answer this, as that guy who was supposedly "Henry Gale" was called, he was like the leader of the others (or was Ms Clue ??) anyway if he knew his fashionable name. Well, I'm trying to think about what can happen after they finally didn't push the button. This ruins the whole DARMA project and I personally thought it was nice the way they had the fundamental thing underground that Desmond used to block the magnetic thing, yes and what was the point? I'm glad I didn't press the button at the end, but what happens to the people in the door? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and Desmond are probably dead, but what about the others? I think they survived, did I forget? well this is just my little thing about what i thought of this season finale !!!
