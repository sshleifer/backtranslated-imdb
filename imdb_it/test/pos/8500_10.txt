This kind of show shouldn't happen on television. This is the kind of nervousness usually reserved for independent films. This is what only HBO should do. The fact is that Denis Leary has succeeded in inventing one of the best television programs ever, easily entering the ranks of SOPRANOS, OZ, ED etc. Kudos, the ABC band for showing that NYPD Blue was no accident, and for Mr. Leary and his band for creating a truly unique visual experience. My only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... an hour would make it better, but I can't wait for the next episode!
