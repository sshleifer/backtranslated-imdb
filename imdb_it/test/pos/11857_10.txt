Because this film was released only in 4 states is beyond me. I thought this film was a divine story. The name says it all: seeing other people. This film has more logic than laughter, which I suppose is why it works so well. Common sense also makes an appearance in what appears to be another childish sexual comedy. Alice is freezing her feet in the cold, when she feels irrationally about the way she could perform for her boyfriend, not just sexually, but as a partner and friend, etc. Thus begins what appears to be an almost archetypal journey for both of them. An adventure after another leads to problems, as if it were not a bad idea from the beginning. Witty dialogue and comic scenes make this fun to die for! Nicholson and Mohr set the tone of the film in the beginning and keep the promise they anticipate. Other highlights are Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in her first film in 10 years!). Climax starts to make a crazy turn, but a simple ending makes this much more enjoyable than most movies today. Mohr fans will see something different in his character of Ed, and fans of Helen Slater will enjoy his brilliant moments of a quick but excellent return. Any Richter takes home the prize for the most moralistic character. Romantic and fun, or just fun. Seeing other people is a gem, which must be noticed.
