This film was a triumph, making fun of "Madonna - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I adore Madonna and I adore Julie Brown. How could I ask for more ... Julie's "Vogue" parody, entitled "Vague", was hysterical ... "Kelly LeBrock thinks she's fantastic, she's just a jerk on a paper plate". "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam personality of Spam" !! I could be dead! And just wait to see what it can do with a watermelon !!
