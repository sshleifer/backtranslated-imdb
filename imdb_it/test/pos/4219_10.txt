I know this movie is not for everyone, and I will not push my opinions about you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie ... It was the best I've ever seen! !! It was so funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I'd ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what would happen next. If you like funny movies, you have to see this!
