'Blade' would be an extremely above-average action movie / horror film, if it weren't for two minor flaws. # 1 I enjoyed seeing the invincible Blade / Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole "Yes!" fist / punch was literally a disappointment. # 2 Bad, don't make it horrible, CGI ?? even by 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some are scattered everywhere. Ok, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All the actors have done suburban work and the fact that this now resembles the umpteenth "Matrix" repercussion is hilarious considering that it came out a year earlier. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade'. In any case, it is a film for many types of audiences that are lovers of the genre: comic book geeks, action fanatics and horror / vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half man / half vampire, or "day-walker" and his smug, Whisler (a "Batman and Alfred") fighting against the undead that, seemingly almost out of human numbers. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade is more than an anti-hero) our ninja / sword of the sword saves a newly infected blood / medical specialist (coincidentally). Meanwhile, problems arise between vampires as you want (you guessed) the supreme power and somehow it needs Blade to get it. It is not the most original concept, if you read what I have just written, but still extremely pleasant. You'll want to see Blade succeed, you'll root him for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what will happen as this is the typical 1-2-3 act of an introductory comic book movie. Still, look at this without trying to go too deep. How the Vampire SPF-1000 "tanning lotion? Really? And the scalp? Wouldn't it still be burned? Just like the money you burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I'm going too deep. Once again, sit down and enjoy the fun techno ride.
