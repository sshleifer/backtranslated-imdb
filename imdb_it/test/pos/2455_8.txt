This film has a very deep look at the relationship between a mother raised in a Christian environment and has learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who have just returned from Vietnam, clash on some very tense issues. The relationship has no intimate connections and is a very accurate portrait of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of problems. Kathy Bates does a great job portraying a woman of false faith who is or forgets her cruelty, forgets or simply doesn't want to be confronted. Jeremy's wrath is never feared and leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers, love for him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads to despair.
