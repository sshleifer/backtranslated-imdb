This episode so far is the best in the series. The story was told perfectly. I particularly liked how writers made it an episode of Desmond; it was his best performance to date and he deserved the Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> We had some of our questions in this episode, but since the show is called Lost we know that there will be other questions also raised First the answer: Walt finally meets with his father Michael, second , the betrayal of Michael is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly and, because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are all taken prisoner by the Others. This was a great way to end the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answer question about how the plane really went down. However, there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to Locke, Eko and Desmond when Desmond transformed the security key and what was the pact with scientists in the Arctic in search of electromagnetic annamols. I guess we'll find out about the next season, however, a great final for the best TV show.
