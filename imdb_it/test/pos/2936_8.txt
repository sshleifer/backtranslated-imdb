This is ten times better than "Who wants to be a Super Model" on Bravo I think it's more true for business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of any aspiring model. The photos look for depth in each of the models, in the personality and beauty, in the attributes of strength and indifference, and in the ability to endure and work for what they want. I like to see Tyra's personal experience in the photo shoot and on the catwalk. I don't always agree with the comments of the judges' or Tyra's decision and at least one of the winners, which I think didn't deserve to win. But this is just a show and every girl there is very lucky to have this chance.
