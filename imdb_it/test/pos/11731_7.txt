Sharky's Machine finds Burt Reynolds as a narcotics cop who after a failed purchase and failure was not his fault, but who killed a couple of people, finds himself downgraded to the Atlanta deputy team. <br /> <br /> Prestige is hardly as good as the beat of narcotics, but it has its marginal benefits. One evening, after a succession of girls working where one of their books falls into their hands, the boys ask for Rachel Ward's surveillance. It is an expensive item, serving both the notorious gangster Vittorio Gassman and the government's law and order candidate Earl Holliman. <br /> <br /> The surveillance, however, records a murder and the rest of the film is Sharky and his new colleagues of the vice who are trying to solve this prestigious case. <br /> <br /> Even if it's a Burt Reynolds movie and those usually have some humor to them, the play is kept at bay because the film becomes as deadly serious as Dirty Harry. It has been reported that Clint Eastwood was offered this film. <br /> <br /> Look for good performances by fellow deputy cops Bernie Casey and Brian Keith and by Henry Silva Gassman's stubborn brother who does the dirty work of the organization and loves his work. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, a mix of Dirty Harry and Laura. Why Laura? You will need to see Sharky's Machine for that answer.
