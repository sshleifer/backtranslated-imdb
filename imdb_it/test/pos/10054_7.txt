Nicole Finn (Madonna) has just been released from prison. Even if she is ordered to go by bus to Philadelphia, she wants to stay near the place where she was arrested. This is because he claims to have information that would erase his record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is in charge of accompanying her to the bus from her future father-in-law. Louden will still travel the city (in his future Rolls Royce mother-in-law), gathering the faith and a rare big fat cat for an eccentric collector. Nicki, however, begins the chaos that ensues as soon as he jumps on Rolls to take control of the guide. Among big cats, taxi drivers, assassins, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns, the lawyer Louden knows he is no longer in Kansas. Is there a way out of madness? This film is a wild journey to comedy. Madonna and Dunneare touch perfectly, making their connection noisy, as they play their roles as ex-inmates and a rebel lawyer, respectively. The script is commendable in its ability to send the viewer into hysteria attacks while a plausible scene gives way to the next and the next. Everything that is secondary, from the secondary actors to the scenario to the costumes, is also very nice. If you know someone who needs a jolt of joy, rent this movie for them. You will be both cheerio ready.
