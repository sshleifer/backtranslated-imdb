I think it was a good movie. It shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man, but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him led to his destruction. Show that you can't trust anyone, especially in a world that takes care of a lot of money and envy. The character that I liked most is Sebeva. She was another ambitious, powerful and ruthless woman in the world of a man who loved and respected Kilo. He also knew that business was business and dangerous. Everything he did was risky but he completed the job. He helped Kilo get rich with his connections. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and I have it in my collection and waiting for El Padrino 2.
