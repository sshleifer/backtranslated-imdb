This is one of the best soloists of Stan Laurel, before 1927 paired with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in the film and offers a good comedy. The film's best scene is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his real common law wife) at Cafe Espanol. Stan does stupid dances that are fun, without you listening to music. I will recommend it to all Stan Laurel fans.
