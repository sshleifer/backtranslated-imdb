THE JUDGMENT of the need to have someone who interprets the role of arbiter of public taste and political correctness always manages to put us under the skin. It seems that these self-named, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types appear everywhere; whether it's the family, the church or the bowling league. <br /> <br /> THESE are the guys who would let the company go completely and ignore everything that came before us; unless, of course, whatever it is, does not go before today's "acceptable" language, the general customs and "standards" of "correct" behavior. <br /> <br /> SO that these last few days, high-tech book burners have targeted a great deal of what has been Hollywood's biggest success; that is, their participation in our allied propaganda through their selfless message and themed films. <br /> <br /> COLDLY brutal in its generation, the forbidden code and unacceptable List of Now extends to the war comics that do not meet the new "official" sensible and thickly socialized attitudes; that these "Thought Policemen" have seized us. <br /> <br /> We were really surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of these short animated subjects. Most of us are the LOONEY TUNES of Warner Brothers and MERRES MELODIES; with Bugs, Daffy, Elmer and Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, "Il Duce", Tojo and the like. Surprisingly, however, we found a wide offer of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and Brothers Fleischer. <br /> <br /> YOU'RE A SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is a great example of what we are talking about. BE virtually indistinguishable from the comics that were the production of Studios of Max and Dave Fleischer before the corporate coup-de-tat of 1941 that moved them, bearing the new name of "Famous" Studios, YOU ARE A SAP MR. JAP did not carry any of the mild elements of the plot that would have reduced Popeye cartoons to the last day up to the level of the definitive short film. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we would have made Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Bluto, usually the exponent of the wolf's whistle and an acceptable on-screen version of a male reaction to the female pulchritude. The olive falls for the less than honorable attention of Bluto; until it gets a little too physical and invariably comes out, "Hey baby, how's a kiss?" At this point we hear "Help! Help, Popeye and the little sailor show up to save the day, full of the obligatory spinach can!" Do we exaggerate, Schultz? ONCE AGAIN this JAP SAP comic is not like any of this. of course, follows the plot of having Popeye in the US Navy. The Brothers Fleischer put the little boy on duty in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men who are now enrolled in the first Peacetime Draft in US history Max and Dave even put Popeye into service aboard the legendary Battleship, the USS Pensyltucky. <br /> <br /> OUR point is just that. IT IS A SAP MR JAP AND others like SPINACH FER Great Britain is not at all a comic cartoon in the Theater program, in the true sense of the word, but rather a sort of grouping of editorial comics very similar to those of any "Grande Metropolitan Newspaper". still an illustration panel, they have characs that are highly symbolic and representative of Nations, Ideas and Ideals, as a just and lasting Peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or anyone else) is only with the Enemy symbol. Both are extremely exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concepts and thoughts; even if they are covered with humorous ornaments for a wider palatability. <br /> <br /> Our liberal stupidity (the antithesis of intelligence) may not be seen in this way; but for this type of behavior they are no longer writers of neo-Nazi books. <br /> <br /> PLEASE allow future generations to see and appreciate a vision of past events that is both historical and humorous. <br /> <br /> POOL SCHNITZ !!
