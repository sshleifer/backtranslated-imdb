I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has NOTHING in this movie! Night of the Demons 2 and 3 are a festival of boredom, but this is a classic. It's super cheesy and acting is good at best, but what more could you want from a horror movie from the 80s? Stooge has some of the best one-liner to ever hit the screen in this one. (he is my favorite character) Many people talk about the lipstick scene in this film, but my favorite is the ending, unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man eats his left hand on Halloween apples in a cake, and his throat is crippled from within. The soundtrack is fantastic. The scene with Angela's dance is totally disturbing, especially after the strobe light turns on, and you can see it jump from one side of the floor to the other with every shot of a camera shot on the song it's playing. The effects of make-up in this film are rather sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a child. If you are the kind of person who demands perfection from the shooting experience, you may want to give this a pass. But, if you're like me, and you're really digging the whole Halloween house, infested with the demon clich√©s, this is definitely a must.
