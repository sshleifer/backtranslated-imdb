My guide to the quality of a film is if I think about it again after leaving the theater. I'm still thinking about this the next day, which doesn't happen often. <br /> <br /> The scenario (a reasonable hypothesis for 16th century Italy), the costumes, the lighting, the cinematography are all excellent. It is visually a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Characters can never get past the script they have to play, but these actors have made the most of their excellent material. This is one of Shakespeare's best shows, that people will still enjoy another 400 years along the way. All the principals were interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says this is anti-Semitic must be deaf and blind. If nothing else, it is anti-Venitian-XVI century-Catholic. While Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the wounds he has suffered, it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame. The script clearly sets his personal responsibility to which he belongs, too. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
