If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this comic is not for you. But if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of animation in time of war, come in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Popeye patrols the seas and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen deceive Popeye into thinking they want to sign a peace treaty. But the appearance can be deceptive; the fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese navy ship! What follows is considered today as a propaganda that stimulates morale. <br /> <br /> Being prejudiced, the representations of the Japanese in the film are made in a petty way. Keep in mind, however, that at the time there was a war going on. But I highly recommend this cartoon to those interested in the era of World War II.
