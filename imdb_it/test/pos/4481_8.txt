Recently I stumbled upon a television program of "Passion ...." (having lost the opening scenes). Mrs. Currier should be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange story of Balzac to the screen. I am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a beautiful film. It must have been hard to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can't understand how his coach persuaded such a beautiful "performance" from the leopard, Simoon. (This adverb brings to mind another suspenseful adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why is this film no longer known? I hope to find it on video.
