First of all - I am not one of the best on film. I saw Friends in the 70s when he was released. I was about 17 at the time. Even now, at 50, I can still remember some scenes. The film is sweet and sad and could be too docile for today's teenagers, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of two young people to make a better life for themselves, then at home. At the time it was rather risky to shoot a movie about a couple of young runaways who manage to set up their home and have a baby on their own. I'm not surprised by the film and the soundtrack of Elton John is almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
