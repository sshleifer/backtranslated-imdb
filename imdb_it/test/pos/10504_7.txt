<----- Minor Spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman becomes pregnant, but not from her husband. Develop "something" inside her, or at least that's what her husband thinks. They go through a lot of difficult moments while she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The husband contacts a UFO professor and with his help they try to find out what's wrong with her. <br /> <br /> <----- Minor Spoilers! ----> <br /> <br /> The story could have been a little better, or at least be made less predictable, but the film is captivating and made me and my sister get involved throughout the film without problems . The acting is very good and the shooting is much better than normal, if you compare this with the normal b-alien movie. The effects are good, and something is happening every second of the film. The characters are very nice and, apart from a stupid nurse on stage, they are all very convincing in their roles. I thought it was a good movie and I can recommend it if you like aliens / monster-abduction movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story could have been a little less predictable.
