I strongly feel that this film was like Waiting to Exhale with white women in the 1950s. As in Waiting to Exhale, all the female characters mixed with married or non-good men. The only difference, apart from the obvious, was that there was not much humor in this film. I would even say that it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere (Hope Lange's boy), but even in that relationship there was a conflict. <br /> <br /> The story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success. Unfortunately for them, romance didn't seem easy, even though they were young, smart and attractive. This film could be called a tear-jerker with the saddest part involving the character of Suzy Parker, whose obsession with an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> This is a must see.
