This is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular ... but who's complaining? It's always fun to see the poor coyote try various gadgets to get the Road Runner, and then be pulverized from each of those inventions. <br /> <br /> The underground pursuit of the caves was different from the normal one and was intelligent. He gave us an aerial view of the chase in a labyrinthine structure. I didn't say it was hilarious; simply different from the usual off-shore antics. <br /> <br /> This, along with other Road Runner shorts, are featured in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and their transfers are spectacular. The colors are magnificent.
