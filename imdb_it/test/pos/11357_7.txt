I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie had the weird minute or two where the accents were a little off but not worse than any other Brad Pitt or other American who did the accent. Furthermore, I have rarely seen a British actor handle an American or Canadian accent except for Colin Farrel in Minority Report. This film is a little movie and it was fun. No, it wasn't a successful Hollywood production but frankly I'm sick of that shit. I laughed several times and enjoyed myself. It was definitely worth it. The main character is a parody of other British gangsters. At least that's how I saw it. If you expect a $ 100 million production you will be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is: a little funny movie.
