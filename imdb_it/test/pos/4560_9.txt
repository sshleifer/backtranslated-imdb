Sean Bean returns as the Napoleonic hero Richard Sharpe in Sharpe's Honor, the fifth film in the series and as always Patrick Harper and the rest of the men chosen by Sharpes are always ready for the journey, but this time Major Sharpe is in serious trouble. > <br /> Under the influence of Sharpe's greatest sworn enemy, Major Ducos, a mysterious lady named La Marquesa accused Sharpe of a rape. Her husband arrives at the Sharpe camp to challenge his wife's attacker to a double. <br /> <br /> The double is discovered and stopped by the authorities, and as a result Sharpe becomes the first suspect when his opponent is killed in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> Nobody in the British Army, apart from Wellington and Major Nairn, considers Sharpe anything but an ordinary citizen with little or no honor, being given a simulation process and sentenced to death for hanging, and Harper and the chosen men have no choice but to watch their beloved commander walking slowly toward the gallows. <br /> <br /> However, convinced of his innocence, Wellington and Nairn hang another prisoner sentenced to Sharpe and release him and his chosen men to find the real murderer and La Marquesa herself, not only to prove her innocence, but to discover his reasons for framing it in the first place. <br /> <br /> Daragh O'Malley, Michael Byrne and Hugh Fraser are co-stars of brilliant interpretations of Alice Krige La Marquesa and FÃ©odor Atkine as the evil Major Ducos, in what is another exciting and bold story through Sharpe's eventful journey through the Napoleonic Wars.
