I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3am. My brother and I used to surf the canal and see if not a young Russel Crowe. But not the phone that launched Russel Crowe, which we had come to know and almost love in the United States. This film, to my surprise, was incredibly creative and fun. He stars in a series of clumsy teenagers with hilarious stories of strange sexual experiences, including a talkative salesman, prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother. If you're lucky enough to meet this movie, I strongly suggest you pick it up. I must say that this film was incredibly funny and I thank the good Australian people who made it ...
