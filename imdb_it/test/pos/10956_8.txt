Hey; Beautiful world! Look, there's Anna Karina! The great American improvised wave (or independent you want to call it that), not as beautiful as Godard or Truffaut, and not impeccable, but hey is such a realism, style, warmth and humor. I love that NY accent; "you know nothing!"; "forget about it". Just like the French New Wave, it concerns young people; celebrate, fall in love or simply wander around. Lelia Goldoni is so pretty; she is lovely; wonderful. Ben Carruthers is also good, Belmondo reminds me. A film you will not forget. <br /> <br /> A constant 26.5 out of 31 ;-)
