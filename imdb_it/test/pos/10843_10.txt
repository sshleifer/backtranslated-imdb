The BBC has surpassed itself with the borders it has crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past they have been "bold" with the works of Dennis Potter but this miniseries (as it was shown in the UK) is superb. Andrew Davies' work is top notch - I didn't read the Sarah Water novel but I can imagine it really did justice. I commented on the embarrassment - most men saw it for this - proved to be a point of main discussion and sales when originally advertised. The fact is that it brings the lesbian side of society in the 1800s - a time when most thought it was about old men and boys for rent - well, it was - lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors. <br /> <br /> You can also see Tipping The Velvet as a "love story" - in reality it is - as well as the "self-discovery" that many gay / bi and heterosexual people pass and comments on this happen and which repeat continuously. /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet - repeated on TV or on DVD - take it - you'll like it - and production and shooting are perfect too. Try to hide your blushes in parts - as I said - "obscene" is on the agenda - and watch out for "foul" or two! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
