"Apocalypse Now" by Francis Ford Coppola is not a Vietnam War movie. Don't confuse it with one. It is set on the flip side of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most daring films ever made, produced or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Calling it a masterpiece would be as euphemistic as the ambitious levels of production of the film. <br /> <br /> Opening without credits and after a memorable first scene played on the Doors stage "The End" while Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates the images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially presented in the first Willard's mission is "to finish ... with extreme prejudice" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who is invariably absent in the distant territories of the Cambodian jungle and, as his general says, "is out there that operates without discreet control, totally beyond every acceptable human behavior, and is still in the field to command the troops. "Kurtz is a delirious colonel who is now revered by a large group of followers who have nicknamed him n god. For Willard, this secret operated seems a little more manageable than actual combat, however, the journey he is about to make will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> Working with a small crew, they embark down the vast expanses of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all of Kurtz's things. During Sheen's raucous voice, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a very decorated and respected green cap. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and headed along the path that Willard leads. The descent into the jungle is characterized by a fascinating aura that echoes the battles fought not too far away. Eventually the power of experience weighs on the group as a drug and a kind of solitary isolation attacks their senses. But Willard seems unmoved and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. While reading this mythical figure, he is attracted by the power of man and by the reason why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will be parallel to Kurtz's. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unparalleled. His genius: undeniable. But for those who do not know his acting skills and are not used to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. It certainly isn't. Brando was difficult to work with, difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for incomprehensible deceptions and unprecedented monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of unlimited illusions and of a continuous depth. <br /> <br /> If the film is an indication of journeys to hell, the real experience of Francis Ford Coppola in making this masterpiece is a true life story of a man struggling to produce a film. It was reported that during the film's most important photographic program of over 200 days, Coppola thought of suicide. The film was not just an undeniable struggle to make; it's a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's infested soldier, Willard. I can't help feeling a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of everything that was original and unprecedented, challenged and stimulated films were the order of the day. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest degree. But I shudder when I return to what has become the norm for today's standards for cinema: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the non-originality of the world of cinema today; is the fact that nobody seems to worry about telling a story or saying it with the heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film that has immersed itself in its ability to give us something deeper than what we could understand. <br /> <br /> That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step towards madness. Murder can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the innumerable bursts of images that distress, irritate and detach from our everyday world and memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregate us from humanity and pushes us into the realm of instinct, the wild and the animal. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with his fundamental catharsis.
