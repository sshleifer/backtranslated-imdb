Now I know that Sandra Bullock produced this film, but she needs to learn that sometimes it is necessary to make some sacrifices to advance the story ... like not trying to do the whole movie about her character! <br /> <br /> The story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other intelligent and anti-social) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it with the number ... only for see if they can get away with it. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. The boys have collected evidence, created alibis and cleaned up so well that the cops fall for the entire act. But Sandra has the feeling that this is not what it seems. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a great Hitchcock-style thriller, but the film takes too long to learn more about Sandra's character rather than focusing on the crime itself. See, something happened in his past that continues to haunt you throughout the film. And we know all about this ... EVERYTHING about it. It gets pretty boring after a while, especially when you're right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then you have to interrupt that investigation to know what happened to you in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the real winners of this film. They play their characters convincingly and with the right amount of malice. If the script had spent more time focusing on these characters, and had kept the investigators there to do their work, this could have been an immensely fun thriller. With the way it is, most of the thrill is lost. They would have to cut everything out with Sandra's character and turn it into a separate TV movie for the Lifetime channel. But I digress. It's still a fun movie, though. I recommend this movie ... but I'm waiting for the video / DVD.
