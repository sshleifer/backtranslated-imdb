I think the costumes were excellent, and even the hairdressers did well. It has a very authentic feeling for that period of time. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was the magic of the computer or if it was real. Some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was particularly struck by the scene of that bridge. <br /> <br /> The main character, the actress, played well, showed us a nervous and witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants. <br /> <br /> some scenes were fun. Although it was about 2 hours long, but it was never boring. a great fun movie.
