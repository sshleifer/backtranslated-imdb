I love this movie, even if I don't like how the Egyptians imagine, being myself an Egyptian citizen! that's why he earns eight out of 10. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is embarrassing, and obviously because of the solitude and living in that cave for so long, it develops a kind of madness and passion for that leopard. <br /> <br /> A very moving scene when the leopard dies, look at Augustin's reaction .. <br /> <br /> All in all I find it pleasant, and I can't wait to read Balzac's story .
