The majesty of Ramin Bahrani's second feature is that, like a poet's work, he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen. Beyond most of the other independent films, CHOP SHOP is wise, exuding the best of the great cinema of the centuries; we can look back at the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare Bahrani's work with their own, yet the CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent for modern society. Can we see how a master works here? a certain sense of beauty, style and content all come together in a film that reminds us of what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the side of New York that we see so often, do we live and breathe with our young hero, Alejandro, in the indistinct Willits Point ?? a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture ?? yet it is a very, very real place. Trying to stay afloat, Alejandro must support himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the sense of a raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani takes us to? all with a deep and concise realism.
