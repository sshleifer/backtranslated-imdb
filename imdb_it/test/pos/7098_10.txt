Despite all the comparisons with House of Frankenstein, this film surpasses its predecessor and is one of the funniest monster films in the Universal Monsters series and, unfortunately, the last. Ok. so it doesn't exactly overlap something like the Bride of Frankenstein like a classic to be revered by fans of all the movies, but with a cast of Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster (What? help but enjoy this schlock fest! And unlike House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this film interact much more. But this film also offers some unique narrative lines for both Dracula and the Wolf Man who both go to Dr. Adleman for the treatment of their afflictions. While the wolf man actually finds a cure, Dracula injects his blood into the doctor and at that moment the real fun begins! I highly recommend this movie to classic horror movie fans. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
