<br /> <br /> First of all, I reviewed this documentary because I was interested in the subject I portrayed, the punks of LA. <br /> <br /> I listened to that music and I loved that music and I read many of the small zines that were made in the early 1980s and that were not so easily obtained in Finland. <br /> <br /> So, if you don't like this kind of music, why are you writing about it? I like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, so I know punks from all over Europe and the Americas, so why, who finds this "repulsive" music, care to comment? <br /> <br />
