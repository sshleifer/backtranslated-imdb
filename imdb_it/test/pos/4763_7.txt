I think the filmographic lineage can work like this. Pay attention, please, because I had to look for this. In 1967 Peter Yates, a former car driver, directs the British film "Robbery", the most electrifying part of which is a car chase through the streets of London, in the alleys where there are crowds of children playing and everything else. It's a success. <br /> <br /> A year later, Yates directs "Bullet", played by Steve McCool, I mean McQueen, with another even more spectacular car chase up and down the San Francisco Hills, with incredibly authentic engine sounds that they seem to include double couplings, complete racing cams, no silencers, twelve-cylinder engines under hoods forty feet, supercharged, supercharged, and all five thousand horses running at full tilt. A lot of McQueen's chewing-face frowning blows of concentration as he tries to hit another car off the highway, even though a passenger in the other vehicle loads a rifle. The pursuit is staged by Filippo D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins leads the criminal vehicle. <br /> <br /> A year or two later, hearing a good thing, Bill Friedkin directs "The French Connection", with a chase between a requisitioned police car (Gene Hackman) and a high level train in New York City . A lot of shots from Hackman's cursed face as he fights the battered car on the streets. The pursuit is staged by Filippo D'Antoni. Following the Academy Awards <br /> <br /> Sensing a good thing, a year or two brings us "The Seven Ups", with a chase between a car driven by Roy Scheider, with many shots of Scheider's malevolent face like he tries to hit the other car, which is driven by Bill Hopkins, off the road, although the criminal car, to be sure, carries a passenger with a shotgun. No hills in New York City, just bumps, but they are still sharp enough to lift cars a few feet. The chased car slips around a corner and runs along a road where a dozen children play. Shots of screaming children as they scatter on the sidewalk and allow the car to zoom. But once it's not enough. The children immediately return to the street and have to repeat the retreat for the pursuit of the police car carrying Scheider. I once saw a high-speed race on the streets of Philadelphia. Both the criminal and the policemen crossed the streets at about 25 miles per hour, arriving at fixed points at each stop sign and at the red light - very boring things compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> About this movie, it's pretty good. "Robbery" and "Bullet" were fantastic. Everyone dressed well. But the New York movies are dirty. There is garbage everywhere and the subway cars are covered in graffiti. Shootings and beats take place in vacant lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings, or in disposal dumps for industrial sized freezers. <br /> <br /> Even acting is pretty good. Roy Scheider seems to be an elegant whippet. The other actors have faces made for the camera, in particular Richard Welsh. And the story is engaging, if not completely unknown. The best thing about the film is the way it captures New York City in its almost total indifference to depravity and human nobility. At a funeral, limousine drivers are hanging around with their collars raised, butts coming out of their mouth, kicking their cold feet together, completely bored by ongoing rituals. The film wants us to believe that The Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable policemen who do not stop at nothing to complete the job, and here there is a bit of a sell-out. They always seem threatened to do something unethical and illegal: defeat a suspect or physically damage a defenseless and defenseless hood - but they always manage to avoid it. (If they really did, their characters would become realistic and ambiguous and we would prefer to have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature.) Very funny, even if you've seen it before, and you could do very well in one the other of his previous incarnations.
