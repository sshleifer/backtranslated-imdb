For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "The Blues Brothers" ... and hell, even "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you will find much to appreciate (but probably not love) in "Tenacious D : The Pick "of Destiny," a fictional epic about the formation of the band JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass). Two losers out of work with a love for rock n'roll meet a dilemma when the mother long KG's support stops sending him rent checks, JB and KG create tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a wise salesman from a music store (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells them about the title choice (a funny sequence of animated tapestries provides the backstory. ‚ÄùAlong the way, our zeros meet a toothless stranger (a Tim Robbins game), Sasquatch, stone security guards, sorority chicks and Satan himself (an ironic cast Dave Grohl) in a climatic sequence that must be seen to be believed (and preferably g Iocated at high volume). I rarely see comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is an extremely pleasant change of pace ... it may not reach 11, but hums a melody that is as raw as it is clever for 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired by the hilarity of the forehead. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
