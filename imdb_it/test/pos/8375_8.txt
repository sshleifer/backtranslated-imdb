It's a nice film set in Vienna about a taxi driver, Toni (Donald Buka), who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is hit while sitting in the back of his taxi. This gives him an identity since he is an illegal immigrant, but he needs to play the role of the victim until he takes a flight to the United States with a ticket made out to the victim. Ms. Manelli (Joan Camden) grumbles but is accused of having mental problems from her husband Claude (Francis Lederer), a concert pianist. As a result, Toni is released. Claude doesn't want to part with his wife, but she runs away from him. There are several twists and turns, and both Toni and Signora Manelli end up running together - both trying to escape their life in Vienna. There is an accumulation of tension, exciting for the finale. They are about to escape ..... ?? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the image quality is not fantastic and there is a line that runs halfway in the center of the image. The cast are all very good in their roles, in particular the portrait of Claude by Francis Lederer. Equally important for the story are Heinth (Manfred Inger) as the owner of the taxi company, Marie (Inge Konradi), as the girlfriend of Toni's hometown and the inspector (Hermann Erhardt). <br /> <br /> It's a good movie.
