George Hilton never really grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but this is a great opportunity for him. Basically filling the Django / nameless man and doing a great job. The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat and mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. Fans of the genre will be in heaven.
