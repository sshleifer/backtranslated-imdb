This can't be considered as a review on any film, but just a comment on a movie I saw when I was a boy. I remember coming home from an evening full of wonder at what I had seen. I tried to tell the story of my parents but they listened without understanding what was strange for two children stranded on an island who fall in love and grow up together and have a child. As you may have already guessed, I am referring to The Blue Lagoon (1949) which has kept me bewitched and bewildered over the years (almost 50) and now I wonder full of anxiety and disgust who or what has prevented the film from being available in the box or DVD or other. I spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to take it one day and no one knows anything about it. What a waste indeed! Sorry if my English is not technical or scientific at all, but my mother tongue is Spanish. I'm doing my best to make myself understood. Thank you, my name is Juan and I'm writing from Uruguay to America.
