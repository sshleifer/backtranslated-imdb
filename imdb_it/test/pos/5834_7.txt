This is a difficult show to watch. It's not something to sit and relax. He kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People are cheated, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, excrement, vomit and blood. Oz is a brave show. It raises questions like racism, homosexuality, the reality of prisoners and above all; - capital punishment. It is, in my opinion, also the success in doing it, unlike, for example, the single-tracked "Medium". <br /> <br /> I was bored sometimes. He had weird plots and spent a lot of time on characters that didn't interest me. Strangely, I found season 1 quite boring. If I had seen him go on the air, I think I wouldn't have kept looking at him. I love seasons 2 - 4. Seasons 5 and 6 are watchable, (although I think it shouldn't be allowed to pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence) <br /> <br /> there are so many wonderful characters to cheer on. The old Bob and Busmalis, which I absolutely loved from day one. Said, Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, whose monologues bind the episodes together so efficiently. The staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada is also brilliant. Even minor characters who were only for a couple of episodes or a few seasons, but left a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorites are the O'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most heartbreaking and hot I've seen on television. If there's anything I will always remember about this show, it's them. There will never be another "pairing" or what to call it, which will hurt me so much. That's why, even when the ends come to them, it almost hurts many. I wish it would never have happened. I wish I'd never looked at him. <br /> <br /> But good, Fontana. I recommend it.
