The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It has never been thought to be a serious story but an amusing saga and it succeeds there. Errol Flynn has never been better as this role was tailored to him. Olivia DeHavilland has never been more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy is never more evil. Anthony Quinn never nobler than like Crazy Horse. He had a lot of humor and pathos and kept your interest in everything. The only historical aspect that I found extremely evident was the last "Last Stand" that occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn. The film version was shot in a desert with no river in sight. However, I still consider it a wonderful entertainment typical of the Hollywood golden age.
