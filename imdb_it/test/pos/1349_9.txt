This is a film, which has all the basic elements of its genre. Makes you want to cry, makes you laugh, disgusts you, makes you angry, etc. <br /> <br /> The topic of the story fortunately does not concern any disease or drug, what is the common tendency in gay-themed films these days, but focuses on social interactions between characters that may not be considered high school elite. The game and the direction could be a little more sophisticated, but on the other hand it is somewhat better, because it really shows the anguish of the characters, who are living. If this was intended, then this is an extraordinary job and certainly a result, especially for a young director. <br /> <br /> It is actually a beautiful story that gives you a little insight, how a fat girl must be and recognize her to yourself.
