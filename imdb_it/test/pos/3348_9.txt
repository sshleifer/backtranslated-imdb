I only gave nine stars instead of ten because I really don't like pornography. pornography has a useful purpose in society (I can't say that it can always think of one) but it probably does. <br /> <br /> The personal views put aside, I really thought that this movie was pretty funny. I didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I'm one of those obsessive "Alice" guys who will watch everything on "Alice in Wonderland". I own virtually every DVD version, so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this one. I have to admit that I was shocked beyond my expectations, and it would have been completely offensive if it wasn't so damn funny. besides, the music is really good and I like musicals. <br /> <br /> not everyone can make a good nudist musical. anyone who saw "The First Nudie Musical" knows what a stinky bomb was. considering how much Bill Osco worked on a low budget, "Alice" is quite remarkable as a musical (it's better than some musicals made with expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> the film cannot totally escape the filth of porn. I usually watch the XXX version for a complete shock effect and some of those scenes are scandalizing (shocking because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I found myself very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where "Alice" (Kristine DeBell) starts to masturbate. made me feel like a voyeur. and the free lesbian scenes with "Alice" and the kittens were a bit too rudimentary. <br /> <br /> However, the film has a great sense of humor about everything. there is a particularly amusing moment during the queen's orgy when one of the actresses stands up and says "who do I need F --- K to get out of this movie?" Exhilarating. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I buy all the sex it's good for you to vent your mind here, but sex is human, and nothing human disgusts me (I don't know if I really feel that way, but I couldn't resist from saying it) some people think that everything should be about sex. I do not know. Gee, it shows only a little responsibility and decorum. this movie certainly has a score for sex lovers, but I wouldn't want to push my luck, next time you could really scare someone. I mean we are dealing with children's literature here.
