A nice film about the introduction of films in China. It captures the astonishment of the film's first audience in much the same way as described throughout the world, and uses real Lumiere films for most realities. I disagree with other people about bad acting by the British - I thought he was okay, but the Chinese leader really stole the show. In any case, I found myself with a smile on my face for most of the film. People who fear subtitles might notice that much of the film is in English (which for some reason is given subtitles as well as Chinese on the DVD).
