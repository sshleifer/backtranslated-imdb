Another beautiful annotation in the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10], with an almost disturbing black and white photograph and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets. And also a more offensive plot! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like the crazy killer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (apparently as a guest) to proclaim it immediately and resigned, and so we are presented with a rather strange group of people to think about, because one of them did the deed. He was the frothy brother of his first deceased wife, his third wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke, her dancer brother and sister vampire, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinetmaker Lloyd Corrigan on loan from the Boston Blackie, the irreplaceable butler odd -on Jerome Cowan? Police inspector Emory Parnell had his job cut off, but Warner Baxter like Ordway was more imperturbable than ever in working out everything. One of the messes listed on IMDb is wrong: breaking into the murder room Ordway says "Right through the middle of the forehead" and Cowan replies "He didn't miss this time". Favorite pieces: Baxter and Cowan traveling between club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make up for their interrupted dinner; The scene in which Braga's resting place is apparently roaring. The plot seems to wander a little at times and the way everything was explained is perhaps more worthy than Monogram, but leaving it in the air as a supernatural wouldn't do it! <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at if you already like the genre, you won't be disappointed if you don't really like the genre.
