My yardstick for measuring a film's ability is if I enjoy it. If I start to change position and notice that my butt is sore, the film is too long. This film has not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts safe, but never boring. <br /> <br /> All other military branches have had love notes written about them and have seen their recruitment levels increase, why not also the Coast Guard? They are definitely not appreciated until the day the boat sinks. <br /> <br /> The film was a lot of fun and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as an old macho man who doesn't know when to stop. However, I was very impressed with Ashton Kutcher's performance. I never liked it, I've never seen any of its TV shows and I've always considered it immature ... well, punk. In this film, it does a great job! He is well on his way to having the status of a manager. I think the movie that was shown to us must have been a sharp cut or something, because at around 2/3 of the film, the film became very wide, the sound level dropped and the microphones were seen falling everywhere. There were also representatives of the film looking for feedback from the public - in particular on the parts of the film that we did not like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerns a couple of lines at the beginning. Kevin Costner returns home to see his wife, Sela Ward, who prepares her things and leaves. He says, "Maybe I should be moving in." And she replies: "No, you don't know where something is in this house, I should be the one who has to go." This makes no sense: if he knows the layout so well, Costner is right, he * should * be the one to leave.
