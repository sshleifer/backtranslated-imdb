Bwana Devil is reputed to be the first main studio, a feature film entirely shot entirely in the 3D process. It is assumed that the producer Oboler went to Africa to shoot a different film, but after hearing the story of two man-eating lions, terrifying railway builders, he decided to do this. It is also a beautiful story, almost like Hemmingway's; fear, redemption, the great white hunter and everything. It is the story of the story that seems to drag on, almost as if the shooting of the new trial were too heavy for the crew. The action scenes are rigid, almost too scenic. But these technical problems appear small in light of the dramatic conclusion of the film.
