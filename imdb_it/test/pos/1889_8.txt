These are the kinds of movies I loved, and I still love growing. Unlike the big budget movies that create huge holes in the plot and never recognize them. This film takes all things considered and just does something you can relax and enjoy. <br /> <br /> There were a few film students previously who complained that it was not a list material. But this is not the point. The point of this film is that no one likes full CGI Clich√© movies. There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to entertain you and have no more money than they can. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is also nice to know that good old Bruce is not dead yet.
