I can never tell if it's the Art Soap Opera ever produced or the Soapiest Art Movie. Never mind, John Seale's cinematography is absolutely fascinating. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, raised to the cinema. If there is a flaw, it's in the original novel, not in the beautiful Anthony Minghella film. Anyone with a problem with its length almost certainly has not read the book and probably cannot read. I don't like to repeat adjectives, but pleasure serves the purpose. <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot, players excel. But it is the Australian sense of lights and shadows that eventually triumphs. As a Dutch master of appetizers, Seale uses a flash of light, where Van Rijn would have used the shadow. You could cry for the cinematography of this magnificent one.
