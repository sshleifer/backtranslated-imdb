I'm a next-generation person ... I've never seen the original doctor who, but I've heard of the series that sparked a big fan in the past and continues to make its mark in the 21st century; the new "Doctor who" started in 2005, but for those who live here in states like me, we see it practically as new episodes on the science fiction channel or BBC America; from the first season we introduce ourselves to a new player Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and a new rather cool doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (wrong surname sorry). these two go on many incredible and very dangerous missions to save the world ... sometimes they have companions from the mickey of Rose's ex boyfriend to the irascible Jack harkness (which can now be seen on spin off) Torchwood "). season one at the second season the pace is right ... the stories can be from the bizarre, strange to the busier rhythm driven, but in both cases his turn of a rollerbaker from the beginning of the theme song which is very catchy. /> <br /> in the second season it becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the struggle to save the world with roses and from this point there may be some who say that some of the seasons have not been good but I have to disagree and it was sad to see Rose and the doctor in part, but she leaves the role of "companion" of opening to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman) who helps to continue the struggle to save humanity ... the third season is now more on the level of action / adventure and sometimes on the emotional level, but not as much as the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and Martha is appropriate but the attractiveness can be rushed at times and the obviousness comes into play that she is NOT a rose Tyler is that you have lived his company in the first two seasons and not in the third season can be it was a bit embarrassing for me because you got used to raising your ways and now to see someone who sometimes doesn't question the doctor emotionally, but still makes the rhythm very exciting for the spectators who keep you on the edge of your place. <br /> <br /> all in all this is a thrill of a television program, I'd give it more but there are some flaws in this show and I can't mention it because sometimes it's hard to learn but only one does which one is the doctor and Martha's relationship is hasty and not leveled with knowing your base; I've seen some good programs on British TV, but this is by far one of the most fantastic science fiction adventures for the old and the new generation, but you don't have to take my world to do it ... get into the tardis and join the adventure
