Dead Man Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears until the end! You can't watch this movie and don't think about the problems it poses; how can you justify murder (whether it be murder or the death penalty) and to what extent forgiveness is possible (not only spiritually). Don't watch this movie when you're down! But watch !!!
