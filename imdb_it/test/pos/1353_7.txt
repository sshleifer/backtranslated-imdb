The main role of this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. It is a young gun that is separated with his partner David Carradine after making a contract with a Mexican general. In evading their pursuers, Carradine and Walker separate. Walker comes across the field of Walker lawyer Robert Mitchum and makes him a protege and a remediation project. <br /> <br /> This is the first of two films that Robert Mitchum made with writer / director Burt Kennedy. The second was the funniest The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> Not that the young Billy Young doesn't have his moments of hilarity. But it is a tripartite story about the reclamation of the Walkers, the hunt for Mitchum to the villains who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving Mitchum, Angie Dickinson and the head of the city Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> The film abounds with nepotism. David Carradine is the son of John. Dean Martin's daughter, Deana, is in this, Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son Chris plays Mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks. Robert Mitchum had his debut in western and always had the impression at home in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats her role in Rio Bravo. Walker had a brief career playing young rebels and doing a good job. I've often wondered what happened to him. He seems obsessed with his father. Perhaps he did not want to arrive at such a tragic tragedy as his father. <br /> <br /> And that wasn't enough, Mitchum fans hear the old rumple eyes singing the title song at the beginning of the film.
