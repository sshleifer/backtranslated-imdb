Although Hayao Miyazaki's films have always been a hit with me in terms of the plot, they are unmistakably fantastic, with characters of simple animation on a background of artistic images. Ponyo sticks to that formula, with such a lovely main character that I want a plush doll of hers and a scenery so beautiful that it wouldn't look out of place framed like a picture on a wall. <br /> <br /> The story, on the other hand, I didn't like as much as its last two releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. He was just a little too young, which looked like something more to children and let the adults enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed by the score made by Joe Hisaishi, who also got the scores for the previous two films mentioned, this time was not memorable. Although I can't remember Howl's score, I still remember that it's one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. Ditto of Spirited - although I just remember that it is very complementary to the film. Perhaps it is because Ponyo is a more youthful rate that the score is not as disturbing. In any case, this film is still a must for anime or Miyazaki fans.
