I have written hardboiled detective novels for a number of years. When a scriptwriter develops a story, he always has a character / actor in mind to give life to the story. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario who plays Uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a lucid film highlighted by the presence of Vario both on and off the screen (as well as his voice-over was heard). I especially liked the actress who plays Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, even though they all did a great job in this exciting movie about playing with villains and the double crossing that goes with it. A nice job all around ... and Mr. Vario shined the most. Must be my Tony Gangi someday ...
