This is the essence of the early eighties! Shopping malls, credit card machines, food, punk hair color, the soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This sweet and intelligent teen movie Romeo & Juliet is immediately addicting. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. He really employs his actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out Joy of Sex and Real Genius. -Valley Girl- soundtracks are fantastic. If you can find a copy of the film, buy it! It is exhausted and very difficult to find.
