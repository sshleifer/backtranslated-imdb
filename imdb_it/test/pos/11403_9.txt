I have seen both films and I have no doubt seen that the re-make is the best, I know that many people would disagree with those who became fans of the original most likely will not appreciate this re-make, but I have it thought it was well thought out and decidedly scary, it was so beautiful that I will see it again tonight, the original scared me because they kill children, I mean, whoever does it in the movies anyway .... but in this the children have at least a half chance ... The only negative part of this film is when the babysitter (Jill) walks towards the sounds she hears and runs out into the bushes to look for someone, clearly no one who is sane would do that while babysitting, so this is the only thing I found wrong with the film, and even so they probably had to put it there to create suspense, I don't want to give too much to anyone for those who haven't seen it, I suggest you do instead of listening to all this gen you who say its crap and worse than the original, would make it a better movie for teenagers, as it shows things that many of us are afraid of, but when I was in the cinema there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 years watching them, and they had fun, if they had fun I think you will! I give him a 9 out of 10!
