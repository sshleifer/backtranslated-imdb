If you want to see a little horror comedy that looks mysterious, this is the only one. If you're expecting blood and guts of blood that will make your pants scare you, then this is not for you. For the budget on which this film was shot, the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was shot on a budget, the music and audio were definitely better than most movies on a huge budget! <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the director must be praised. There's an almost perfect blend of comedy and horror in this movie! The acting is top notch and leaves room for a sequel that is definitely waiting for me! I have no doubt that this film will become an instant cult classic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell this film tells the story of a boy who enters the career of becoming a tomb robber. Tell the story in flashback of each of the most fantastic experiences that the thief duo meets. Zombie vampires and even aliens! Our stars are born as simple thieves who steal for jewelry, but quickly become fierce artillerymen for a mad doctor (Angus Scrim) who needs bodies for his medical practice. When the two find a way to have their cruel employer sent to a vampire, tomb robbers discover that the traffic of corpses of the undead is much more profitable than a simple theft of corpses. The only problem is that there is another gang called Murphy's house that competes for the same undead corpses and this is where both gangs of thieves collide head to head with dire consequences. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies I've seen in years and reminds me of the Evil Dead. Don't miss this, you will regret it!
