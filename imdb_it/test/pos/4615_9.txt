I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and I was amazed! A panic scene opens this film, at 2.37pm set in a high school in Adelaide. This scene remained unresolved as we return to the beginning of the day, and are presented to teenagers preparing to go to school. The public becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the daily problems faced by adolescents - including drugs, promiscuity, homosexuality, bullying and violence. Each scene is played repeatedly by perspectives of different boys, and recalls the Elephant of Gus Van Sant. This is an extraordinary film by debut director Murali K. Thalluri. It was created with non-professional student actors and worked on an unprecedented draft of 76 screenplays. It presents extraordinary performances by numerous student actors, in particular Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This training film is both intimate and stimulating, with a surprising and disturbing ending.
