Born from previously developed characters in a series of highly appreciated short films, THE RABBIT CURSE is further from the "familiar plates" that you can find: beautifully crafted and with witty dialogues and intelligent concepts, this is really a film that will appeal to almost everyone family members. <br /> <br /> The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village obsessed with the cultivation of large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate "Anti-Pesto", a human solution to all those annoying rabbits that torment passionate gardeners everywhere. Business is a great success - but Wallace proves to be a little too smart for his own good. When he tries to "rehabilitate" rabbits by their ways of crunching vegetables, he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions: the werewolf-rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in the city is safe! The film is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly intelligent dialogues and references to everything from KING KONG to THE WOLF MAN - more than enough to attract even an exhausted teenager - but the real charm of the thing is in its characters. The amount of personality that artists and animators can tear from pieces of clay is incredible: they seem completely alive like any actor in the flesh. The DVD version (and I recommend the widescreen) also includes a series of fun and informative extras. Highly recommended! GFT, Amazon reviewer
