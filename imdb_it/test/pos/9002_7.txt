Now before people start having a break in this movie (those who play rugby anyway) this is a movie! The Hollywood treatment has been given to entertain people and therefore those who play rugby (myself included) are naturally going to take holes in the choreography of the game in the film. Otherwise it is a decent film and brings to the attention the moral and the ideas behind the game of rugby. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real team, a real coach and his work helps guide children in the right direction to be better people in the future, and is also based on real people who have played for the highland team. It's just a typical sports movie with a character that is misled and eventually finds the right path on the right path through rugby in this case. In general, it is a pleasant film, fun but with flaws in terms of the representation of the game. however, as I said, it is a film under Hollywood treatment.
