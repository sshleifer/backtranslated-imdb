As a child I had never been in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and although I had heard about the series in passing, I never really understood exactly what it was. It was then, with a little hesitation, that I sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his antics that had told him that it was something like Arthur Dent (from the Guide to the Galaxy for hitchhikers) but cooler. Can't believe what I missed, seriously, because nobody had ever told me about this before? My whole childhood has been deprived of the adventures of Doctor Who; I'm a big fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Honestly, I really enjoyed it and can't wait for some future episode. <br /> <br /> I must admit that initially I wasn't so sure that Billie Piper would be the best actress, but I'm happy to say that she did very well, I thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. I actually think it was one of my favorite aspects of the series; the contrast between the great scenes of alien conflict contrasted with the raging normality of the life of the Municipality of the South London Council. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and change it in their mind so that it can adapt to their trivial lives. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I haven't seen many of his films and I've never seen another actor like Dr Who, but I thought his portrait of the Doctor was brilliant, immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder. I find that many other characters with his character story tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seem slightly superficial. This doctor, on the other hand, has earned my loyalty with his layered personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for special effects, aliens and so on may have been a little more effective. but again, it's not about special effects (even if they help) from what I've read and heard from Dr Who's longtime fans; it is the spirit of all that really matters. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had. I quite liked all the aliens but my favorite had to be the Dalek; if I ever knew anything about Dr Who before watching the series, it was that there were things that looked like overturned dustbins on wheels. Before looking, I was rather skeptical about these pepper pots that threatened humanity's existence, but some of them were pretty scary! Which I loved, of course. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good show. I look forward to future episodes. The Doctor has a new fan.
