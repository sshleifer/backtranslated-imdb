I've seen this movie five times and I never get tired. This presents traces of the "yellow" genre, but also with a vivid Italian country setting, where ignorance and superstition are more lethal than any serial killer. Characterized by an excellent position (sometimes recalling Fellini, sometimes by the Taviani brothers), a good characterization and some of the best actors of the genre (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), this is NOT euro- rubbish, just a masterpiece that should be discovered from generation to generation (He recently received great recognition at the Film Library of Paris on the occasion of a tribute to two feature films to Lucio Fulci)
