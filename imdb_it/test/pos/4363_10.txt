This movie is excellent! Afraid to watch documentary films? Cancel your shrink and see Dieter's little story. You won't believe how fascinating this beautiful piece of film making is until you've experienced it. I am anxious to say that almost every Vietnam war movie, including Apocalypse Now, also works. It's a true story, it's a personal story, a story about love for flight, the dream of being a pilot and the nightmare of being shot down over enemy territory. Everything is shot in the style of "back to ..." - in its place, Herzog asks the questions, Dieter responds with a memorable German-English accent, and with a good memory emphasizing what happened where about 25 years ago. There is this part I told friends over and over again: saved by his US Navy plane, Dieter becomes a Vietcong prisoner of war. Blinded for most days, he is dragged into the jungles of Southeast Asia for miles and miles - barefoot. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, hungry and covered with infected wounds, they arrive in a small friendly village to spend the night. The next morning, after walking for several hours, Dieter discovers that someone stole his wedding ring from his finger. It is so. He can't take it anymore. He begins to cry, as a result of complete fatigue. The Vietcong men react surprised. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Immediately, the group returns to the village and starts looking for the person who stole the ring. They find the man, they immediately cut the finger and return the ring to Dieter. - The film is full of shocking and surprising situations. The immense cultural differences, the clash between the East and the West, the fear of the unknown (that is, all that represents America on one side, the Asian jungle and its secrets on the other) can be perceived in the whole film. Back problems? This is because you sat on the edge of your seat for two hours and didn't notice.
