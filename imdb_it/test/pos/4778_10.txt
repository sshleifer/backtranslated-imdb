STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an incredibly important film for our film history. This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (which follows the silent PLANE CRAZY at the beginning of that year) is probably his most famous film - especially because it was so revolutionary. This is because it was the first sound cartoon. While you haven't heard of Mickey yet, there are a lot of sound effects and music throughout the film - something we take for granted now, but that was a huge public success in 1928. <br /> <br /> Now if this was just an important historical film, it would be worth seeing - especially for animation lovers. However, after seeing the short film again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film is. While Mickey and Minnie behave a bit strangely with respect to the characters that we have become in love (especially thanks to the extravagant mind and the talent of the Ub Iwerks animator), there is a contagious charm in the film. It's lovely to see Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a very imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way. Smart and a real pleasure for the crowd - this film is still among the best Mickey Mouse films even after 80 wonderful years.
