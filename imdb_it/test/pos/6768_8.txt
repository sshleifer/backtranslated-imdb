of the Adam's apple and with your permission. I didn't know until I was looking at it now. Even the errrrrrrrmmmmm 'Wilbur wants to kill himself' I prefer this very focused focus ... drama on Adam's Apple over the highest comic zeal. But With Your Permission is much more layered and subtle, but this is another director. <br /> <br /> Once the "meaty" part of the story took place, I felt the terror of returning to the store again and again. A bit claustrophobic ... maybe it's intentional. It is based on the atmosphere. You are afraid of rediscovery and again and again until the 'kick in the tibia'. <br /> <br /> this is something fun.
