I'm an avid Vijay fan. I've never seen another film of his that is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual clich√©s that you can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is evil in his studies but a star in his forte i.e. Kabbadi. His friends fill the share of the play. A heroine in a life and death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane tracking and action sequences. Music that can make you dance. And above all, a perfect plot to keep all the aforementioned factors within a fun circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director offers no opportunity for the public to relax. Continue from one nail on the head to the next. And you can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film that rarely performs. <br /> <br /> Said everything ..... This film has been and will be perfect for many years to come ....
