Michael Polish's hypnotic "Northfork" is a film that will remain in the memory for a long time. This exquisitely crafted film that Michael and Mark Polish wrote is visually one of the best things released last year by the world of independent films. The film is beautifully photographed by M. David Mullen, with a bewitching soundtrack by Stuart Matthewman. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​setting the film in Montana was a great coup for the Polish brothers. Never have the majestic views of the country and mountains been captured as vividly as in "Northfork". We don't need any color! Beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of desolation in this remote outpost. <br /> <br /> At the center of the story is Irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious father Harlan. This boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is giving medicine to his body. But is it really there? We watch him interact with the strange group we meet for the first time around the cemetery. There are two newly opened tombs. Will one of them be for Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. We see the six men in black who came to the area to remove as many people from the area as they can. This will be the bed for the artificial lake that will be created. Their reward is one and a half acre of lakefront property if they move a certain amount of people. <br /> <br /> The third plot focuses on the mystical group consisting of Fiore Ercole, Coppa di tea, Merluzzo and Felice. They are following the possibility of a connection to an angel who was injured in this area. When Irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers to help, only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. Let's watch as the quartet examines the pens that the boy put between the pages of his Bible. Could Irwin be that angel? <br /> <br /> The closing sequence shows us all the parts that come out of Northfork in different directions. The men in black who drive their cars, perhaps returning home to enjoy the newly acquired properties, give them as a reward. The mystical group is seen getting on a plane and taking off for a higher place. We also realize that Father Harlan's child, despite the medicines and care he received from the holy figure, died. Michael Polacco obtained one of the best actors of all the main ones. Nick Nolte, while Father Harlan performs a key role in his interpretation of this type of man. James Woods, like Walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a good job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who makes an excellent impression as Irwin. This child actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise. <br /> <br /> The mystical group is brilliantly played by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, the man with fun shows. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and the rest of the cast are impeccable under Mr. Polish's guidance. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is based on its simplicity. The vision of Mr. Polish will haunt someone's memory. The images of Montana, like perhaps an unreal landscape, have been one of the best things in American films for some time.
