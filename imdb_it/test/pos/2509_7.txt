Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter about to camp for the summer, giving her mother a little more freedom. Helen's shop is staffed by the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a crazy gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck) and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) . One day, Helen comes across a romantic and tender love letter and suspects that Johnny wrote it for her. With caution in the wind, Helen and Johnny have started a "thing" for a short time. But later, the letter lands in the hands of others, including that of Janet, who thinks George sent it to her, and that of Johnny, who imagines that Helen wrote to him for him. And, back and forth in the letter. But actually, George could have eyes for Helen and Jennifer fell in love with Johnny. Even the curator of the city museum can have a secret love. Do tangled business like these straighten out? This is a cute movie with wonderful settings and capable stars. Each of the main actors gives a pleasant performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to those mentioned above. Furthermore, the coastal scenery is very beautiful, the costumes are quite well chosen and the photography is very beautiful indeed. There are some surprises, including a subtle development of the gay storyline, which may not appeal to all viewers. But, for those who love romantic comedies, this should be included in every list of good choices for the genre.
