"Five Fingers of Death" kicked off the American kung-fu craze, but I remember seeing it for the first time as "King Boxer" in Chinatown, New York, without the bad dubbing and a few Americans. I also had the good fortune to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers Of Death" in Times Square, New York. What a contrast it turned out to be ... the same film but a different audience. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this film has taken on a more serious tone for the spectators. It was to hear the true voices of the actors (in Chinese) that made this film more credible. Chinatown's cinemas had been showing violent kung fu films for years (the "Boxer From Shantung" of 1972 beat them all in cold blood), so the choreography and action story was the main attraction. The rival school plots were not abused, however the plot seemed fresh. Every great kung fu movie had nasty, hateful criminals you wanted to see get their well-deserved punishment and FFD had them too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a well-known actor in Chinese theaters. The predominantly Chinese public enjoyed this film immensely. The public buzzes while leaving this film gives me the final satisfaction. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this film was an action comedy ... probably unintentionally. I liked it here too, but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the beginning, the film made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard those strange British accents from those Chinese actors, the film turned into a violent and bloody cartoon. Most of the American public saw this kind of blood in a horror movie not in an action movie. The action sequences have wiped out the audience. Unfortunately, the film studios saw that they liked it so much that the ugly dubbing and unnecessary violence became a Kung Fu Flick formula. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this movie with an American audience, but I liked Chinatown the most. Some films can stand the test of time but the dubbed version of FFoD cannot. The original "King Boxer" is still pleasant ... a CLASSIC!
