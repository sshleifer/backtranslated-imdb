Watching the preview of Armored I thought the film would be a very bad or very good movie. Fortunately, the film was fun, full of suspense and realistic. There was never the perfect crime and Armored showed why. The film shows perfectly when people enter stressful situations behave like animals. The last hour of the film is a lot of fun. Matt Dillon is still a great actor. Hard to believe that Dillon is 50 years old. I would buy this movie. I give Armored eight out of ten. It's not a Christmas movie. Have I still written ten lines? No! However, there are not many action films. Armored has a lot of excitement in it, which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy.
