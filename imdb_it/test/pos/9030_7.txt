If it wasn't for To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. Had it not been for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, the acting here would be much more praised. Had it not been for William Faulkner, perhaps A Kill a Mockingbird would never have been written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this film sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, To Kill a Mockingbird, may not have been as original as I had always thought. Perhaps he was inspired by this very similar film. Oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a lonely "white" solitary lawyer against a white southern city defending a black man is all too familiar. And, written by a woman, Mockingbird focuses on rape, the last betrayal of a woman while this film focuses on her brother against brother hatred, the rape a man feels for brotherly betrayal. <br /> <br /> There is no Mockingbird depth here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with its presence. So you were left alone with the sadness that, whether he intended to raise the plot from this movie or not, Harper Lee's Mockingbird reflects. Nothing has changed in about 10 years since he read Faulkner's book and saw his film while he was in college in Alabama and unconsciously or he didn't take most of it as in later years. Nothing has changed in race relations and some may say that nothing has changed even now, many years later. <br /> <br /> Too sadly familiar, and one would like there to be a modern-day addicus to do everything right. Where Mockingbird leaves you with hope, swinging in the arms of Addicus and waiting for a morning of better times, this film leaves you just sad that the pride of blacks can match or better the pride of whites. But the pride of both is not an answer at all. <br /> <br /> Rather, it is the response of Addicus that we need, we comfort that we are all imperfect and that in our fragility we should have mercy, not pride, when we face each other in our differences.
