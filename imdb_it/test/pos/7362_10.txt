Wow! My mother bought me this movie because it was really cheap for sale in some store in my city, and she knows I love scary movies. First I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking it was a normal B-series movie that tried to scare. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake of looking at him alone, my parents and my brother were asleep and it was really late. After watching the movie I was so scared that I was shaking ... I didn't even dare go and get the videotape from the VCR! I slept with the lights on ... <br /> <br /> The main story of this film is about some teenagers walking away from the street and having to spend the night in the woods, telling scary stories ... The first story is Really scary, and makes you hug a really hard pillow if you look at it alone. The second story is also scary, but not in the same way as the first. The third story (my favorite) is really disturbing. Especially the stories scared me. This is a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle. One night when there's a storm outside, he goes to the nearest house and knocks on the door .. A girl opens up, and she's mute .. I don't want to tell you more, but you'll feel the chills when you look at him (I could add that my heartbeats were really abnormal when I looked at it). The main plot of "Campfire Tales" has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it sucked, but I, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and it's been a long time since we've been scared .. rating: 10/10, oh by the way, it's NOT like the Urban legend to everything, it's much scarier.
