not a Larry McMurty masterpiece, but it stands alone like a good western, any of the solitary doves does it. whoever takes on the role of Woodrow calls, makes a great portrait in his own style. It is also easy to see that they were trying to use this as a springboard for the TV series (both versions) and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive. - this guy can do everything that seems <br /> <br /> deserves to be appreciated by those who love westerns <br /> <br /> 4out5 stars
