This is one of the classic American ones made for TV movies that are made for watching on a rainy afternoon. Even though the script is highly implausible, it never takes itself too seriously, and not even the cast that leads to a great language in a hodgepodge of mystery / horror film really enjoyed using a bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. A great advantage of this film is the fantastic filming location and despite the strange events and even the unknown residents around Lake Tommahawk I would not mind living there first! <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie to watch and more.
