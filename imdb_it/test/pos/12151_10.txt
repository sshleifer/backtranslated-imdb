if you get the slight enjoyment of Pink Floyd music, you will love this movie. the soundtrack is completely pink Floyd and, of course, the drug element plays an important role in this film, giving you doubts about life in the weakest moments. this film also touches the heart with the love story and the people around you ... there is also a huge bond with the world around you with the environment of a personal island. This tells me that I need ten lines to summarize a film, but I'm done, that's all you get, that's why this movie is a 6.1 which is a big shock for any movie with a score like this. take a look at the requiem for a dream and the fountain .... equally good scores for our generation but overrated
