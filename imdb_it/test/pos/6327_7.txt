Barely three and a half years after marching for a month (7-31 October 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theater (on West 49th Street, since renamed it O'Neill), MGM has relied on the previous solid London comedy success to lavish a wonderful cast and - for the most part - carefully "opened" the production on a sadly reduced screenplay of this sly subversive boulevard comedy and were rewarded with a modest hit. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and completely complacent "workaholic" (before the term was coined) using the perpetually frustrated David Niven to try to rekindle the passion in his bride. When Gardner's "second honeymoon" cruise leaves Granger in leaves, the trio (and Granger's dog) abandoned on an island in the southern sea (were there other survivors?) For subsequent developments of the plot, Granger continues to manage the world around him - building a large hut for himself and his wife and a small part of the title for Niven - or the detached male. <br /> <br /> The core of the actual plot of the drama is only made in the middle of the film when Niven proposes that Granger and he alternate as tenants of the Piccola Capanna - sharing the only female on the island as Granger he was willing to share the only pair of shoes (his). <br /> <br /> Reason (which Granger considers his strong point) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are superb in their designated roles of seductive aspiring seducers, and Stuart Granger - usually simply called to be handsome and virile in action roles and the strange strange specia Lty (an affectionate sympathetic as Apollodorus in Shaw's CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA in 1945) offers one of the best acting performances of his film career as a husband that could actually be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later he again showed this sweet urbanity alongside Rex Harrison in the first (and BOTH of their last) Broadway engagements in Granger in a hit revival of Somerset Maugham's THE CIRCLE that ended only with Harrison's death. We would be much richer if Granger had used these skills more often. <br /> <br /> As promising how much the menage is, after all, is a British Boulevard Comedy AND Hollywood in the 1950s which is to say that (unlike the starting game) very small sex actually goes on. To be honest, if you don't abandon yourself to the ideas that guide the stratagems it becomes a bit silly (the same basic plot is developed much more satisfactorily three years later in Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons (The current wife by Stewart Granger) THE GRASS IS GREENER, based on an even less successful comedy, but for some reason that top bole failed at the box office. <br /> <br /> How magnificently how MGM set the piece, they were unlucky there errors - the stupidity that ends the stay on the island is presumably animated in what should have been a moment of real excitement - the sinking of the yacht that drove them to the island, ultimately we receive only about three quarters of time of the real Little Hut, but ninety good minutes of David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger that make the film a fun diversion. Not high culture, but a worthy culprit pleasure. <br /> <br /> We also have and some very nice decorations in Walter Chiari (who is believed to be Ava's true lover at the time). One of his best speeches is: "Boola, boola!"
