This is a Hallmark TV movie. Hallmark has always made quality family-oriented films. Just Desserts is a boy and a girl fall in love while working together at the cinema. Two bakers vied for a $ 250,000 prize against a field of professional bakers. It's fun and light. The desserts are fantastic. The film has a catchy and lively song played during the competition. I assume it's made for the song from Roger Bellon's movie. To bad that the soundtrack is not available. I would really like to have a copy of the song. I don't even know the name of the song, because the credits are crushed at the end of the film to make room for hundreds of promotions. However, the cast is fantastic. It's always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very bubbly and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always an advantage and Costas Mandylor completes the good guys with a wonderful performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest appearance. The film deserves to be seen.
