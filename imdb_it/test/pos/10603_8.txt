I didn't know what to expect from this. I have always considered Bam Margera and the CKY team a team of jointed heads dedicated to doing stupid things for entertainment. I didn't know they could act. But everyone who acted in this film performed well. The hilarity of 'aaaaagh!' the scene mixes perfectly with Ryan Dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend. Sometimes the movie some scenes seem useless but at the same time they are fun. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good laugh, but this film might not appeal to those who prefer detailed narrative lines and a series of twists.
