The story is incredible, it starts with a new guy in the city named Roy, while on the bus at school, he notices a little boy running without shoes, and on that same day he breaks the big nose of bullies he's trying to fight with him . Roy soon discovers that the child is a fugitive, and he and his half-sister are trying to mess up a building view, which could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help them fight, they can win this battle before the bizarre cop Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) runs into them. A funny, fun and adventurous film. I admire Luke Wilson for taking this role. I don't think his brother Owen would ever take this role.
