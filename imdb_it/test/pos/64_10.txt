Darling Lili is a blend of Perfection and Magic! The stars; Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson couldn't have made a better attempt if they tried. It is full of all the magic that a young woman wants and makes it seem that everything can really happen to you. The genius of the director; Blake Edwards has proven to be at his best. He was really capturing the woman he loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The mix of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film. The film opened with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and ending with the same song by Andrews. <br /> <br /> For a film of this excellence it was such a failure when it was released, it's a total shock ... <br /> <br /> As It Is: "Inspirational ... Purely. ... Inspirational! " ~ One of Andrews' most memorable lines in this movie!
