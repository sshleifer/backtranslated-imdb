I know a lot of people have said that they don't care about this movie because it's not a good fighting film and hard on subtitles. This is a really lazy way to think about a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the film, you should find something else and also learn to respect cinema as an art form, this being a masterful job. If you want to see this, it's not really about fighting. There are good fight scenes that sometimes turn out pretty well with good photographic work, but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic movie of Kung-fu. The plot is really the center of attention and not the fights, and the combination of the two makes an excellent film worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles.
