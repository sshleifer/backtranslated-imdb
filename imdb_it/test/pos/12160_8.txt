With all continental Europe under his control, Hitler prepares for the last obstacle on his way before heading to North America, Great Britain. With an overwhelming advantage in planes, Goering's Luftwaffe seems unstoppable on paper. Once in the air, however, the RAF tenaciously interrupts the paradigm by blowing the sky from the air of the sky at a speed of seven to one. The Battle of Great Britain has been raging for over a year, while the island nation is bloody, but does not trust, providing a crucial moment for their American allies to produce more weapons for the inevitable struggle. <br /> <br /> Using a more permanent video of the three previous documentaries of the series Why We Fight, the Battle of Britain has a more propagandistic aspect with the dramatized scenes (some with unmistakable Warner music) glaring scenes for newsreels. In an ironic twist between the devastation caused by German air strikes, Beethoven's seventh symphony is used to emphasize visual suffering. The story itself is of considerable courage on the part of a rebel nation that has refused to give in to the devastating attacks that have been inflicted on it until then in an invincible war machine. It is the 20th century version of the 300 Spartans. <br /> <br /> There have been more exhaustive and sought-after commercial efforts made on this battle by this film, but the immediacy and motivation The Battle of Britain provided then will always make it a most precious document of England during his "Final Time".
