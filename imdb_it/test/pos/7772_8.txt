From the opening sequence, full of black and white shots reminiscent of the photos of Gordan Parks, this film recalls the viewer in a feeling of artistic rebirth. The background of a coffee of poetry aptly titled "The Sanctuary" provides just that. The jazz that permeates the film and the cinematography will seduce you. <br /> <br /> This love story actually allows love to grow, evolve and eventually mature, a rarity in Hollywood. Everyone can identify with some phase of their journey to the other. This story by two artists who just can't put it together has sparked a debate among its viewers. Should she have left? Should he have stopped her? Who knows ...? <br /> <br /> Interpreted by Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall) and Nia Long (Nina Moseley) with a scene that steals performances from Isiah Washington (Savon) and Lisa Nicole Carson (Josie Nichols) as the last best friend, this film it is a romantic jewel. <br /> <br /> See this with someone you love (wink).
