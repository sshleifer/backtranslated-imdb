After 66 years, "Flash Gordon" still has a captivating / adventure / epic aspect that many of today's science fiction adventures seek and fail to produce. The only way to fully enjoy this serial is just to sit down and not choose anything (hockey effects, dialogues, because Flash doesn't work for Princess Aura etc.). And as for older people who have seen "Flash Gordon" again on the serial screen or on TV "again a day", if you want this beautiful serial to remain attractive to future generations, take your kids / grandchildren to watch this when you are young. It worked for me (male 18 years or less). 9 out of 10
