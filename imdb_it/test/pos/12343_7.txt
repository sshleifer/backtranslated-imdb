Julie (Meg Tilly) is a "goody two shoes" girl who, determined to prove something to herself, lets herself undergo the rituals of "The Sisters", a small-scale clique presided over by haughty, homecoming queen-like Carol (Robin Evans). The sisters propose that for Julie's last test she will spend the night in a mausoleum, preparing to push Julie up the wall, but not knowing that Raymar, a recently deceased and sick person, is buried there and intends to cause the chaos beyond the grave. <br /> <br /> While this debut photo for Tom McLoughlin ("Friday the 13th part VI: Jason Lives" and "Sometimes they come back") is limited by his obviously low budget, that's what McLoughlin and his crew are able to do it with what matters. It's really creepy, a disturbing thing; could have frightened very well the fact that I had got out of the way if I had less than 10 years, and even at my current age, it has still reached me a certain degree. <br /> <br /> Some of the effects seem poor but the corpses and decent-looking blood are created by Tom Burman, an expert make-up artist who, while tending to be overshadowed by more famous names like Winston , Baker and Bottin, has a good resume with other films like "Cat People" (1982) and "The Beast Within" to his credit. <br /> <br /> What I liked most was a real one a sense of foreboding and atmosphere, an aspect that was missing in some of the current trendy horror films in our multiplexes. <br /> <br /> Tilly is pretty and attractive in her role, having recently completed her debut film in " Tex "before entering this production." One Dark Night "was completed some time before its theatrical release in 1983, where it actually did decent business in the first few weeks. The other actors do what they have to do quite well; familiar faces in the supporting cast include the equally charming sings veteran actress / voice-over artist / voice-over Elizabeth (aka EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, for once * not * who plays a sort of creature character, but unfortunately ends up with very little time on the screen and no less than Adam "Batman" West. The director's wife, Nancy, who will play Lizbeth in "Jason Lives", appears here as the space girl in front of the arcade. <br /> <br /> It's a decent B-level horror entertainment, maybe too cheap for its ambitions, and maybe not so smooth (hey, McLoughlin * was * just getting started), but certainly good for some thrills. <br /> <br /> 7/10
