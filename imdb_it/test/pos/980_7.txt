I saw this movie about my flight from Philadelphia to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 "x 10". So I wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle, so I thought I'd only look at a few minutes. The next thing I know is that I was sucked, I enjoyed it, and I was happy with how beautiful it was and how quickly it seemed to pass the time. I agree that acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the greatest baby boomers, I was pleased to see Lee Majors with a role in the film, as with a couple of other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) "Yesterday" but they are out of the spotlight today Yourself. <br /> <br /> It is your basic "child", the child becomes equanimous (and then some), and everyone has fun in the process ". No heavy thought, no great analysis needed. Just a fun way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5.
