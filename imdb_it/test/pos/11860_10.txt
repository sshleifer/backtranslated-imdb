I saw this movie for the first time at an early evening party in Mr. Zwarts' hometown of Fredrikstad. There, among directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed ... I couldn't stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, clear lines and excellent acting - this is a movie you must see! It's like mixing "True Romance" with "The Wedding Singer" and adding a touch of "Mad about you" Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
