I saw this movie last night and it was one of the best made for the TV movies I saw. It was very well directed and the acting was superb, very convincing. The music was good and the photography was beautifully filmed. Bring out the despair from Requiem for a Dream and you're lost. An excellent representation of the world of drug addiction and its consequences in a very open way in which everyone can identify. cudos to mtv for giving us a good movie for a change from! * $ *% as Crossroads.
