Where would Hollywood without Fredric March like Robert Browning or Dennis Price like Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor like Normally Narrow like Michael Redgrave has brought a certain moody charm to a portrait of W.B. Yeats. The lives of writers are an endless source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But of all the poets it was Dylan Thomas, the crude and Welsh lover who loved one or two beers (and drank in New York in New York for 39 years), which was the most close to the spirit of the film industry. During World War II, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He also wrote the script for a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters, in which three old maids in a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich step-brother. All that is now forgiven. <br /> <br /> In John Maybury's The Edge of Love, Thomas is played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It is not a large-scale biopic. The film covers four years in the poet's life during World War II, when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he met again by chance during the war. Looks like he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women - with Thomas and others - is at the heart of Maybury's engaging film. <br /> <br /> The way it was made is a story almost as extraordinary as that of the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, the film's producer, is the niece of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in the Cillian Murphy film), married Vera while still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when he discovered a book about his grandparents, Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and Bungalow, by David Thomas, which describes their intricate lives. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the script, is Knightley's mother. The part requires Knightley to sing, and her mother has included songs specifically for her. Surely no film with such a happy family deserves to do other than succeed. <br /> <br /> We start in London during the Blitz. The bombs fall, the sirens complain and Phillips sings to repair the crowd in a subway station. In a pub, by chance, he meets Thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and a child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship not disturbed by jealousy or resentment and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs, listening to Thomas reading his poems, exchanging intimate secrets and smoking his head, as everyone did in wartime. Caitlin turns out to be more expert in the ways of the world ("My first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15"). But it is the refined and soulful Phillips that elicits Thomas's deepest answers and eventually succumbs to its charm. Meanwhile, he reluctantly married Killick, who saw her in the subway station and was immediately fascinated by her beauty (if not by singing). <br /> <br /> It is an intense and strangely beautiful film, even if Thomas himself could be his less impressive character. He is remembered for Under Milk Wood, his radio track of verses on a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub, whose backward name was not something educated by English educators. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton reading the poem (he appeared in an Under Milk Wood movie in 1971), and I have never forgotten the creamy and seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of man, is something I lost in Rhys' performance. Thomas looks like a strangely pale, even secondary, figure compared to the women of his life. <br /> <br /> In his previous film, Love Is the Devil, Maybury explored the turbulent life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochist relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. The Edge of Love seems to me to be a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights are offered in the sources of Thomas's creative inspiration, I should say Llareggub. But as intuition about his egotism, his smoking moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others, he is wonderfully sad and revealing. <br /> <br /> Thomas had a good war drinking and writing while other Killick men were traumatized by the horrors of battle. In a scene towards the end, Thomas's behavior towards his friends seems inexcusably callous. But this is not, after all, Thomas's film. Murphy offers us a magnificent study of condemned passion and the emotional debilitation of war. Miller is as charming and pathetic as his wife. And Knightley seems almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as he did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably his best performance. And in every respect the film is worthy of her.
