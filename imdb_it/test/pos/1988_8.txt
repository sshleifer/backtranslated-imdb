After his previous film "Videodrome", which certainly shows similarities with this film, director David Cronenberg ventures back into the world of virtual reality, where truth and fiction mix. Virtual reality is taken to another level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a very original film that is well directed and performed but above all written very well. The film is characterized by a fascinating and well thought-out concept, which is made with great care by director David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a film that knows how to constantly deceive you. Just when you thought you understood things, another surprise awaits you just around the corner. Things are never what you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction is explored. You never really know what the reality is and what the game world is until the end. It makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and provides the film with a fantastic ending that will leave you thinking even more. <br /> <br /> The film has a perfect kind of game storytelling, mainly with its character appearances and its baffling events. They must complete a certain step or task before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever going over the top with either of them. Storytelling keeps the film as simple as possible, although obviously the film is not always so simple to follow due to its unusual events, dialogues and environments. <br /> <br /> The film is not only just weird though. I was really surprised to see that "Videodrome" has a higher rating here, I thought it was a much more inaccessible and "weird" movie. The film is also made fun and has a good fast pace. It never allows the film to remain stuck in its most philosophical moments and in its deepest meanings. It also makes this film perfectly watchable for people who don't normally watch this type of film. <br /> <br /> The film is good-looking, with subtle and effective special effects of great visual impact, which also provides the film with a certain feeling of "game" required. <br /> <br /> The film is well launched, with Jude Law in a role where you don't see it too often, that of a shy and insecure person. Show once again how versatile Law is as an actor and that is more than just another beautiful Hollywood face. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a great female protagonist. He has never acted in so many big parts in big productions, but with this film he shows why he has always been considered a great movie star. The film also features other well-known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A very original film that is worth watching, especially if you've seen "Videodrome" before. <br /> <br /> 8/10
