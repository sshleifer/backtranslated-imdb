In 1937 Darryl Zanuck, who had recently moved from the head of production to Warner Brothers, was trying to get his new company, 20th Century Fox, to take off on an equal footing with his old Warners bosses and the glittering palace of MGM. "This Is My Affair" was an attempt to cash in the current success of historical films set at the beginning of the century ("San Francisco" "In Old Chicago") and in retrospect it did very well. The plot is fascinating. A producer of trouble but a heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor) receives a secret assignment from President McKinley to discover a ring of bank robbers who paralyze American finance. Find the band but fall in love with their female mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and must decide between love and duty. <br /> <br /> Not everything about this vintage movie works well, but overall it's a good slice of movie studio. The plot plot would have been borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for "Mother Night" (the main role of that film in the book was brilliantly interpreted by Nick Nolte) and seems quite credible, at least within the studio's confidences. As a fan of old movies, I'm always thrilled when I stumble on one I've never seen and "This is my Affair" was no exception.
