It's strange how lesser-known films sometimes end up among the best you've seen. This film has all the elements of a normal modern thriller, guns, techno, villains, money, etc. Yet it also stands out from your average Hollywood. I would attribute it to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has great confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the hottest and sexiest women I've ever seen on screen. Another important reason why this film stands out is the change in layout in Jamaica after the start. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful that you would like to be there sitting by the pool at night, with a Run'n'Coke. . . I know I did. I'm very happy to have seen this movie - it was just too good to miss it!
