"Think like a Dinosaur" was a well-made and performed show of the -Outoslimiti- series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni in the role of Michael Burr) plays an extraordinarily good and convincing lead role. You can identify with him and his "introspective" feelings about what to do to the girl he fell for (because he was left alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until "Kamala" arrives to his life with a timid fear to carry out the task of being transported, then consoles her and we let her know that everything will go well, that it ends up being a deception for both of us.More still something bad happens and she (prototype) returns ... and she (clone) is sent to the other planet of the inhabitants, even if the -Dino- and the "Micheal" have yet to find out, when they do it is Michael's job to decide whether to kill her or let her live. he was very attached to what happened to his wife, his wife similarly died. This show professes irregularity and sadness for most of it. After the show he allowed himself to be meditated ... what he SHOULD have been done and you are stuck with 50/50 of what is right from wr ong. Thus, the equation of "balance" being exclusively there does not exist. <br /> <br /> 10/10 I highly recommend watching this show.
