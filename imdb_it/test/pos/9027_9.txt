I really can't understand why people don't appreciate this movie. I found it very funny (obviously the fact that you play the wonderful Laura Fraser is a bonus!) When I heard about it for the first time, I thought it would be along the lines of a "Weird Science" reversed from the role and, for a measure, this is true, however there is a turning point that I really didn't see coming. After seeing the trailer on the DVD (which I had never seen before watching the movie) I saw that the "twist" is actually shown in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the comparison between "Weird Science" adapts less and less, and I think this is the best of the two films. Certainly there are some scenes that do not work wonderfully, but these are offset by the enthusiasm of the young cast. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would suggest that this is a fine example of Sci -Facta film, and I don't think I've seen many!
