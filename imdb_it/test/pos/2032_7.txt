Nothing really unpredictable in this film, but a solid film in every respect. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there was nothing that couldn't be seen coming. Maybe a bit melodramatic in points, but again, a pretty decent movie anyway. Definitely worth a look. If in doubt about which movie to rent over the weekend, try it. Even if you don't feel like running out and buying it, I found it worth it.
