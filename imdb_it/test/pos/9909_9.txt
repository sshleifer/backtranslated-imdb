I really enjoyed this movie. For one it didn't have the trivial special effects that big-budget films have. The acting was decent in this, only you can tell right away that it has been nicknamed, but once you get past this, and you can't change the language in the DVD version, it's nice. The plot was really unique, it takes a situation like a wave of heat very common all over the world, especially in Frankfurt, which I have seen many times, and there is a garbage strike that often happens in this country and you have a recipe for disaster. I liked how the hordes of mice went everywhere and like the idea that if you picked up the garbage, this is the last thing you want to do, collect it, the rats don't get what they want, in essence they are the following garbage collection, so ask if garbage collectors are on strike, who collects garbage, private contractors, however the military wants to quarantine the city or something wrong to do, then you would have all the mice conquer the city, then launch a mayor who wants to keep a budget limit and get in line, you have a realistic film, and even the female protagonist is a pleasure to watch on the screen, a very dignified film I thought, I wish more were done this way, another small nitpick is the depiction of Frankfurt could have been a little better, but for the average spectator who has never been to Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and have been to Frankfurt many times .. he won 't impor ta, but all in all a big thumb up.
