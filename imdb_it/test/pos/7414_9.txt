Why this film is no longer widely considered is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I got it for Â£ 1, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best kilo I've ever spent a movie. <br /> <br /> The thing that usually leaves films on the club scene is the actual music or scenes shot in a club. <br /> <br /> Here, the music and scenes of the club are completely believable, using some great tunes of the time, and shot in real clubs, with people who really seem to want to be there. <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are high-level all-round, although Jason Donovan in particular stands out for me (he was playing Frank N Furter at The Rocky Horror Show in London at about the time he was supposed to turn, so his endurance phase was full blown!), And of course Tim Curry who is eloquent The drug boss is convincing. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, if you are a fan of the British film you have to see it, it doesn't matter if you like clubs because the film is strong anyway like a story. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
