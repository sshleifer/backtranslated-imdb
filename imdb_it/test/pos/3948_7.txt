One of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the "Tories" or American British loyalists are portrayed, and the kind of glory given to their ardent support for King George III. In many ways the American Revolution was certainly a family affair, as some of the richest colonial families were separated from it. If there is a strong criticism to be made about this film, it is that perhaps the people in this story are meant to be a little more beautiful than they were in real life. <br /> <br /> In some respects, the actions of Major Boulton's character, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least sympathetic member of the cast and the flaw in the plot. It seems that you become a pungent type of patriot to be some kind of "something for the cause", man. This film focuses a lot on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige that were an important social "norm" at that time and age. <br /> <br /> In its subtext, the fact that around 25% of the colonial population was decidedly pro-British. But the strength of the Tory element is obviously not slandered, although the good doctor is about eighty-five percent of the upper class twit (to steal a beautiful phrase from the Flying Circus of Monty Python). Anne Francis does a lot with a pretty thin section of the script, and stands out. It was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalty, a "girl" who was a little more modern than the social conventions of that day would have allowed - if there had not been a struggle for life and death. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the film is the way in which the rivalries of American revolutionary leaders degenerated into jealousies, and how these personal conflicts almost sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. All in all, the main characters are very well designed, the minor characters are not just human "props" and the fighting scenes are credible enough to bring dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. It is not a great historical drama, but satisfies quite well. It marks a seven largely because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and he does it so well, and because Anne Francis makes the most of his support effort. <br /> <br /> The color print used on Turner Classic Movies was very clear, so it was a nice presentation in that important consideration. <br /> <br /> I hope it works again soon.
