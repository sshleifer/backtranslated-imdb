Rainbow Brite and star Stealer are not for people born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of these people would not appreciate the great things that are cartoons from the 1980s. The fact that Rainbow Brite has been turned into a movie is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember watching the television program as a child. Of course, much of the dialogue is pretty funny and silly, and the plot is not non-existent, but it's still a very nice movie.
