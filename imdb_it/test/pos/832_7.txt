This film is good in its genre and that genre is naturally action with a medium / small budget. It seems that Van Damme offers much better performances when he has a good director who drives it. There's your basic bar fight, the alley scene and most of all a lot of shootings. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an action movie OK if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive action star like Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't know. Director Isaac Florentine has already made a film with Scott Adkins, called Special Forces (2003), who has an incredible talent in martial arts able to satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiast. Another amazing feature of Scott Adkins is Indomita 2. Check out this guy and make a noise, this guy needs to get super star status and he needs to do it right away! <br /> <br /> What else can I say about movies? It is Van Damme who has taken a step forward compared to some of his most recent works. No Oscar here, of course, but you already knew. But never the less has a nice little town atmosphere and I could find worse ways to spend my time. So I'm giving a full 7 of its kind.
