I loved it, it was really creepy and disgusting. I thought the tearing of human flesh was completely provacative. the way he depicted the human crucifix on Jesus Christ was really interesting. The tearing of limbs and jaws was terrifyingly brutal creepy. Don't look at this if you have a weak heart, you couldn't stand it.
