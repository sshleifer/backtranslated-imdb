This film focuses on a young woman who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. It made me think of other films like "Song of Bernadette" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a strong Catholic influence on the film. Ann Blyth is very charming as before, the Catholic student and then as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint Anne (which is the name of the street I live in, by the way) and does many prayers for the holy intercession when problems arise in his life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea on the Andy Griffith show) and Edmund Gwenn (of Miracle on 34th Street) play her relatives. A local priest of mine said that my sister looked like Ann Blyth and that both had the same name and second name. A nice family film that came from a time when life was a little easier.
