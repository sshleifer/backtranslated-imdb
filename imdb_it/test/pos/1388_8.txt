A screen caption informs us that it is "the Caribbean Sea, May 1891". A small lifeboat moves aimlessly into the sea with six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's doctor to Lieutenant Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It is night, a strange current takes the boat to an unknown island, nameless and unexplored. The boat hits some rocks and is torn to pieces. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. The next morning, Claude wakes up and finds himself washed up on a beach. Find a pool of boiling white water and one of the dead prisoners next to it. Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose (Franco Iavarone) not to drink the water because he will kill him. Both finally meet the other surviving prisoners, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois wanders alone to try to catch an animal for food, finds and kills a large water bird. But in turn he is killed by one of the fishmen. Claude, Jose, Peter and Skip continue to explore the island as they put Francois' death to an attack of some sort. Immediately afterwards, Skip is killed when he is impaled on a peak at the bottom of a well. Now only Claude, Jose and Peter remain. They come across a cemetery with lots of empty tombs and signs of recent black magic rituals. Claude sees a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes' head explodes. A woman on a horse named Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) turns out to be Claudes's savior. She tells them to leave the island immediately because it is owned by an Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and does not like visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to go ahead regardless, finally finding Rackham's big house where they are invited to stay. That night Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, Peter quickly becomes food for fishmen. And a Voodoo priestess named Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, performs a ritual of black magic that involves cutting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. The next day Claude and Jose decide they should leave the island because they feel very uncomfortable with Rackham and think they are lying to them. Jose rides on horseback and gets lost. Claude is rescued by one of Amanda's fishmen and told to leave again. Claude wants to face Rackham again. Rackham reveals he has a scientist and Amanda's father, called Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), who needs to be kept alive. Rackham says that the longer Ernest stays alive, the more likely his survival to increase dramatically. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. He is using fish-men as a means to reach the lost treasures of Atlantis and he needs Amanda and his father to control them. He claims that the fishmen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a portion of the treasure if he helps keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude remembers the name of Ernest Marvin as a condemned scientist for animal organ transplantation experiments in humans. Finding Ernest's secret lab finds that Rackham had lied to him and the fishmen are not descendants, their genetically modified people turned into amphibious creatures by Ernest's grotesque experiments! Rackham has finally had enough of Claude and decides to end his interference by blocking him in a large tank and slowly filling him with water, while the volcano of the islands begins to erupt and sends lava that flies everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda, will Claude manage to escape almost certain death to save Amanda and get off the island before the eruption of the volcano tears it apart? Directed by Sergio Martino, I really enjoyed this film that mixes various genres. Sergio Donati's screenplay is fast, interesting and fun. The plot is revealed a little at a time, which prompted me to look at it all the way. I must say at this point that I saw the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for the American release of Roger Corman. Barbara Bach is a beautiful leading actress, but I hated the way she was presented by shooting a snakehead, I thought it was more than a little unpleasant. Richard Johnson is a big villain and Claudio Cassinelli a nice hero. The fishmen seem a bit fake when the camera lingers on them for too long, but their appearance is cool and I've seen worse. Some miniature effects seem a bit poor, but overall I saw a lot worse again. There is no blood, violence or nakedness, but it didn't really bother me. Giancarlo Ferrando's photography and Massimo Antonello Geleng's production design combine to create a very beautiful film. Period costumes, props and sets like Rackham's house and Ernest's laboratory with its old scientific equipment. The lush green jungle scenery also contributes to the visual splendor on display. I really enjoyed this movie and was entertained throughout the execution time. I'm not sure who I would recommend because it mixes various genres, I imagine someone who perhaps imagines something slightly different and generally well done. If you can find a copy, try it, I'm glad I did.
