Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) engage in a battle of wits to control the most recent bombing creation of a Switz inventor. Holmes wants to safeguard it for the British, while Moriarty is not selling to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> While no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see Holmes updated in the 1940s, this particular film demonstrates carefree fun that does not wallow in wartime propaganda as it might very well have done. Dennis Hoey Lestrade's inspector and Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson tend to steal the show, as their bumbling methods consistently represent a delightful comic relief. The clash between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out. Atwill does quite well as Moriarty even though it is not as memorable as others who played the role. <br /> <br /> Although this does not provide anything particularly new or exciting for the fans of the series, it is a wonderful escape from reality, a bit appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, which reflects many of the film serial adventures of the 30s and 40s but boasts a more compact and less repetitive texture. And all this is done while remaining faithful to the basic spirit of Sherlock Holmes.
