To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan on one of the many comments on DVD, that "shaky music" on the HTV logo was enough to make me jump from whatever I was doing to paste my face on the screen for an hour. The individual stories in the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. Robin of Loxley goes through a very convincing journey on the two series in which it appears, even if his departure from the program was not planned. Marian also develops her relationship with both of Herne's children very well. <br /> <br /> After languishing for many years in the TV desert, I reviewed the series on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid-nineties and was even more impressed by the fact that the series looked even better than it was remembered. This is not a television program for children, it deals with witchcraft, betrayal, rebellion and injustice. And he can do it without showing too much blood. As far as I can remember, you only see some of the red stuff in the movie Pilot (Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set). DVDs are fantastic and contain many extras, including comments on the cast of the 3 series (Jason Connery Robin) and crew comments for series 1 and 2. Image quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing . /> <br /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing is ever forgotten.
