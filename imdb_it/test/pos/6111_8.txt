"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for his time, and even today it is still difficult to watch. Not that I didn't like the movie, it's fun; but it's very repulsive and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as he can. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine), she is the most filthy woman alive. He lives in a trailer with his son Crackers and his daughter Cotton. Not to mention the overweight Edie who is obsessed with eggs and sleeping in a crib. Then there are Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts who are jealous of Babs. They want to overcome it to be the dirtiest person alive. This means having their janitor impregnate abducted women and sells children to lesbian couples, which makes people flash in public, and even sends Babs an asshole in the mail. Babs fights to prove that she is the most unbalanced person alive. Which also includes incest, murder and eating dog poop and other sick sexual acts. It's a fun movie for the whole family. (well depending on where you live?) Look at "Pink Flamingos", but don't forget your barf bag. For more perverted, weird sex and bodily functions also see "Sweet Movie".
