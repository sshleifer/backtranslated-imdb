Shame on Fox for downloading this movie. It was a total revolt and I only hope that it will find a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> This is an exhilarating satire. He takes the "What if" situation to an extreme and does not punch (or kick in the groin). Makes you think ... what will become of this empire once we are totally lazy and stupid? Everyone gets hit in this esp. a number of big companies, and even Fox News takes a handful (which is probably why the film never had a correct version - besides the marketing department that thinks about the campaign and doesn't know how to market it) so we'll give up! ") Some may find the sophomoric movie, due to the groin kicking, and farting, but the film is much more than that. Or get what Mike Judge is saying, or not. Most of the negative reviews I've read seem to come from people who simply don't understand or are movie snobs. <br /> <br /> You will probably play for a week in selected markets, so if you miss keeping an eye on the DVD, it will be worth it and eventually I will have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> Good work Mike Judge, it's a pity you got screwed, but you made me laugh out loud and I can't wait for the next movie you make.
