"Nobi" or "Fires On the Plain" is a film that is so excellent on so many levels, that you can't say enough good things about it. My only regret is that I haven't been able to see this 1959 film before. <br /> <br /> Being a bit of a film purist, I tend to watch movies for their artistic merits based on dialogue, acting, photography and even efforts to remain faithful to the period in terms of costume. Ultimately, I want to know if the film is "truthful" enough to reveal the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think. <br /> <br /> "Fires on the Plain" is a great film because it creates a portrait full of realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war on all levels - like any good war movie should be. The war is terrifying, bloody, destructive. It is also deadly on the psyche. However, what is fundamental about "Fires on the Plain" is his unrepentant look at Japanese soldiers. It shows that they are slowly collapsing under the weight of the superior American firepower and the inability of their nation to wage a war of its own. A fatalistic code that encourages death before surrender is at the center of this madness. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of Japan's military mishap made just 14 years after the end of what the Japanese call the "Great Pacific War". Ichikawa, reveals what the Germans called the "war life", the difficult situation of the common soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is interesting, since even today Japan is going through a difficult period to come to terms with its war fanaticism, its subjugation of conquered peoples, the racism of its war against the Chinese and war crimes that included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against each other, but against Allied prisoners of war. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa produces a strong representation of the victimization of soldiers from a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures. <br /> <br /> This harsh examination is skillfully portrayed as soldiers condemned as human beings who exhibit, on various occasions, fear, brilliantly laconic humor, dialogues enriched by its scarcity, and a plot whose complexity is denied by the sad and wild setting. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Ichikawa is a torn and painful tapestry of defeated men. The Tamura tuberculosis, played by Eiji Funakoshi as a gentle and kind soul, is a good soldier who cannot abandon his humanity, although he is scared and lost like his companions. Before leaving for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy, Tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who, recognizing the desperation of their situation, advises Tamura to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Because Tamura is hopelessly ill - the replenished and militarily incapacitated unit was not ordered to surrender at the beginning of the movie he is telling. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is simply waiting to die. While Tamura leaves his unity for his search without hope of physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his companions uselessly dig a bomb shelter. They look like corpses looking up from their common grave. <br /> <br /> Let's look later as the fatigued hospital medical staff abandons dying patients to a barrage of American artillery that consumes everything. The pathetic patients, who crawl out of their huts in a vain attempt to survive, appear as pathetic and serpentine creatures that drag themselves by an all-powerful force. You know they won't survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than a defeated army is the one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its companions. While Tamura staggers through the jungles of Leyte we meet the noble, the dying and the exploiter. Cannibalism raises its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat each other rather than surrender to American "canned meat". <br /> <br /> When men talk of surrender, the propaganda of how Americans kill prisoners is thwarted by a one-way soldier world that reveals that Americans are approaching and taking care of prisoners of war because , unlike the Japanese, they respect the brave soldiers who are forced to give up. <br /> <br /> It is the Japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor for a long time that the resistance has lost all meaning. Those willing to fight to the death will be killed. It is the calculation of war. <br /> <br /> After shooting a killer and cannibal companion, who had previously offered his body as food, even the disappointing surrender of fatal Tamura appears to be a deliberate form of suicide. His death is a solitary image. Ichikawa was trying to tell us about the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by his nation's suicidal cultural codes? <br /> <br /> If someone watches this movie carefully, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism are the enemies. Americans are portrayed as technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power - a lesson that has transformed Japanese post-war society. Ichikawa's film is not so superficial as to accuse America. Ichikawa points to the sedimentary strata of Japan's destructive policies that created the war and then continue it when all was lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons launched on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He doesn't have to. The slow-motion destruction of the Japanese imperial army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan's immolation.
