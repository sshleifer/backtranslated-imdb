Some movies are designed to entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or raise, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, to make you angry. I was angry during this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it was true, that America, the free, tortured in the illogical vision that is doing it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this film were heartbreaking, people's indifference was shocking, the film was compelling in its arguments and showed how wrong it was to torture people. Of course, now that makes me a "bloody liberal" label pushed on people by others who close their minds to the facts that this happens and should not. People who do not realize this, as the film said, for each tortured person, bring up ten or a hundred people to perform acts of revenge. You have an ever-growing cycle of violence. This film didn't make me hate America, although I can see how it could do that, but it made me hate the way America reacted in its post-9/11 world. There is a significant quote in the film, right after we learned that 19 people died and seventy-five were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is "an American is dead" - this makes the difference. You can't kill an American, America can kill thousands but you can't kill just one American, or they'll do whatever it takes, including torture to do justice. Apparently this is the American way. Call me liberal, call me naive (although I think people who think torture is naive) call me deluded, call me anything you want, but this movie is a shining example of what's wrong with America and west of today. I would like this film to be shown to all school students, at the very least. This film will stay with me for a long time, a part of me would like to be able to forget it, because I wish this kind of thing had never happened, but I know it does, the other part of me wishes I will never forget, because we need remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and I will tell everyone I know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.
