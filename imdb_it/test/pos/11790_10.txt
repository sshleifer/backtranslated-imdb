I thought this film was excellent, weird and different from the usual run of the movie "absent-minded cop who captures the serial killer". Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual - I don't really think I saw anything he did where he didn't play brilliantly. The dialogue was fun sometimes lightening the atmosphere and the engaging storyline. Thanks to other reviewers for showing the connection to Alice in Wonderland - I hadn't noticed those. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherlands (as I am) and anyone who wants to watch a funny movie for a couple of hours. It was a pity that it was not released in theaters for a wider audience.
