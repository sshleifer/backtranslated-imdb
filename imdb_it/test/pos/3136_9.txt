This small image succeeds where many fail. Because it was a small image, John Ford was not tormented by large studio wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors who had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them like Ben Johnson were discovered by Ford and gave the opportunity to showcase their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic Oklahoma cowboy who usually did his stunts. Years later he would win the coveted Oscar for his brilliant performance in "The Last Show". Ward Bond surpasses even Ben Johnson in this film. He is not the master of the wagon, that role is played by Johnson, but because of this film he was later assigned the role of Wagon Master in the classic television series "Wagon Train". Ironically, one of the "Wagon Master" villains, James Arness, allegedly starred in the hit television series "Gunsmoke" on a rival "Wagon Train" network. Ward Bond plays the leader of the Mormons heading west, which is often found in his sinful days framing only to be called by the Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When an annoying situation occurs, Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts: "Horn sounds, Sister Ledeyard!" The Mormon sister, played to perfection by Jane Darwell, then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford's classic version of John Steinbeck's novel "The Grapes of Wrath". <br /> <br /> Another of the great protagonists of the company of Ford was Hank Worden, who plays one of the notoriously notorious but not too brilliant sons of uncle Shiloh Clegg. Worden will become famous a few years later to play Mose in Ford's "The Searchers". Worden lived up to the age of 91. He was still making movies when he died. <br /> <br /> Master Wagon Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse dealers who never take their work seriously, having a lot of fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. They mix with a West Mormon wagon train. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the film. The team's main reason is a red-haired Mormon beauty, Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley) who captures Sandy's attention. Along the way the train picks up a Hoochie Coochie show which includes a charlatan doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). He also joins the Clegg family, wanted for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how difficult the journey to the west in a carriage was in those days. <br /> <br /> The songs in the film were written by Stan Jones of the legendary pioneer children. Jones's writing was almost as good as that of Bob Nolan, who had previously written most of the writing for the group. The most famous song by Jones, not in this movie, is the much-recorded "Ghost Riders In The Sky". The pioneer children make the background by singing in "Wagon Master". This contributes to the overall impact of the wagons to the west. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that the acclaimed native American athlete Jim Thorpe of Oklahoma plays the role of a Navajo leader. This was his last film appearance. He died shortly after the release of "Wagon Master".
