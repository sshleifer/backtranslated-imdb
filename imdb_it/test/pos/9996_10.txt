This film gives golf a high score, has been well played and well directed. Give you a vision of history that some non-sports fans will like. The historical factor alone gives it a high score, the Brookline golf course has been done really well. I'm in the northeast and I've seen Brookline as a fan and like someone who loves the game. The film was well done at all levels. A MUST SEE 5 STARS. The acting was superb, Disney has another winner in her bag of Great movies. If for no other reason, watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people who may not see hope in their lives. I would say that the setting, while between the end of the 1800s and the beginning of the 1900s is very realistic. The costumes and dialect were also in the sign. Beyond and beyond the call of duty for a golf movie. A must see fans and non-fans alike.
