So, do you want to be a rock star? See this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or are you REALLY in heavy metal? So put your favorite album and dream of yourself, this movie has nothing to offer. I have rarely seen a film that can portray the dream of being in a rock band like this. I had long hair in the late 80s and early 90s, and I've played guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did you like Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not great, the actors are good and credible, even Jennifer Aniston plays her part to perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as the aspiring rock singer. So you know what you are going to get. A film about dreams that become reality, being trampled on and finally understanding what life really is. It's a good seven out of ten, no more, no less.
