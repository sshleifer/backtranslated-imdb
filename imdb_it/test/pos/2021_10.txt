I love this film, first of all because Mark Wahlberg is present and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something in this film that sucks you and allows you to experience all the emotions that the characters experience. Jen Aniston is as big as the girlfriend in this movie. Take a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers have experienced during the day (perhaps these days they have simply become more skilled). It carries through a rainbow of emotions and has lots of subtle facets to allow light through. Like a diamond, this film shines. You won't lose your popcorn with this. Flick semi-chick but my husband loved it too. There are also some laughs.
