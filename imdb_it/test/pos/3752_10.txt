The main reason I loved this movie is because IMx (formerly Immature) was present. They were in House Party 3 when they were 11, but now they're all adults! I was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but I had to realize that they weren't my kids anymore. I think Chris Stokes did a great job considering it was his first film.
