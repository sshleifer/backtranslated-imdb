Like many other commentators here, I expected a taste of music that could satisfy my curiosity - and I got more than I asked for. I heard and saw a powerful, exquisite, sometimes bewitching, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the truest) and absolutely amazing sound of music and musicians. It reminded me of many forms of Indian music (East Indian) but at the same time it was very different. <br /> <br /> Starting from the first song by Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur (which voice) to Siyasiyabend at the jam session (or 'Jugalbandhi' as we call it in India) in Selim Seslar's small Turkish bar (Big fan now :)), I enjoyed every minute and I wish it wouldn't end. /> <br /> One of the best music commentaries I've seen and heard in a long time. <br /> <br /> I look forward to a CD of the soundtrack and hope to find it online somewhere soon and also for the old and latest albums by Baba Zula. <br /> <br /> A day later, the music is still etched in my brain and I don't want it to go away. Turkey and especially Istanbul now look like such beautiful and exciting places - and I'll start saving today to go and get it. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin - this is a gem.
