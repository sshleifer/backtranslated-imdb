The centurion is one of the best cartoons ever and must be put on TV and DVD, so people can have younger generations enjoy such a good show that it is much better than the trash they have been doing for the last 14 years. I have an online petition that is on the website http: / / www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html which was originally trying to get this show five days a week, but is now trying to get this show on DVD from the station on which he concentrated, he has bad public relations. We all need to convince people who own this show to put it on DVD so that it can be seen by future generations. Also, since Hasbro Toys now owns the line of toys in this show, we may want to try to convince them to make a live action movie just like they did with Transformers and this year G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like this to come back and be enjoyed by the younger generations. Please sign this petition so you can one day have DVDs of the guys who are famous for shouting "Power Extreme!"
