Four stories on the European drug trade are intertwined during this 6-part miniseries. In Germany, a businessman is arrested for drug trafficking and his wife tries to save her family by continuing the illegal trade in her husband. Meanwhile, the British Interior Minister travels to Pakistan to negotiate an aid package that he hopes to stop the drug flow from that country. Even if he does, his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, tearing their family to pieces. This is the miniseries on which the American film and miniseries were based. The original is far superior to its two descendants. The poverty and despair of the third world are portrayed very well. He is strong, uncompromising and brutal.
