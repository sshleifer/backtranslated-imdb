Very reliable entertainment, as Las Vegas entertains as well as intrigue, very light and very supported by Josh Duhanel !! I like this TV show and I think a lot of people look at it as an evasive form of voyeurism ... Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many women in this series are very beautiful to look at ... This show incorporates Las Vegas legends like Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre !! There have been copious representations of the city of sin, this is one of the best efforts ... Producers and directors are fortunate to have James Caan in the show, as he is a very complete actor !!! In general, I like the Las Vegas TV Show and I watch it on Friday, I also watched it on Monday, but with Monday Night Football I could see why NBC changed on Friday ... Anyway, I like Las Vegas A lot!!
