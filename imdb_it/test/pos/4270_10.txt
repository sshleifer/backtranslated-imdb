As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, make you think, reflect and predict. This movie made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses interesting tips, symbolism and turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the choices that the characters make in the film, their choices don't seem as adolescent or as happy as the other films I've seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry between them. Great soundtrack, with songs you can't hear on the radio. It is a film of reconciliation with the spontaneous life / journey that deserves more than just a glance.
