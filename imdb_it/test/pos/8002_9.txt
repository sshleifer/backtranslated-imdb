I really wanted to be able to give this movie at 10. I have long thought that it was my favorite of the four modern Batman movies (and maybe it will still be). I have yet to watch Schumacher's films yet). I'm also starting to worry if I'm somehow unconsciously upstream. See, I've always liked Schumacher's films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s for me. But the conventional wisdom is that Tim Burton's two direct films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time - I ended up giving him a 7 - and I apologize as I could, I couldn't help but think that Batman Returns has too many problems of direction, plot and script scattered everywhere to justify a 10. <br /> <br /> But Burton _almost_ overcomes problems with the sheer force of style, and even if there are a lot of little flaws, Batman Returns is still a great movie, especially if you're a fan of Burton, like Batman Returns has so much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as with anything else in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a child. We see their dismay: people leave the birth room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Eventually they pull him out for an evening stroll and throw him into the Gotham City river. The child ends up becoming the villain of Batman The Penguin (Danny DeVito). Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the film's "bad capitalist", comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning to cheat Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally offending his secretary, timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but is saved by the cats, becoming Catwoman. While all this is happening, The Penguin, which has long been said to exist and whoever is thought to be dangerous, starts a pattern that must be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent reasons, second. <br /> <br /> Before reviewing Batman's films of Batman this time I didn't remember how little Batman movies (Michael Keaton) were. It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character interesting enough to focus on it. The attention here is much more on the bad guys, especially on The Penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially at the beginning of the film, and surprisingly we often observe him while we watch The Penguin. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers necessarily consider the precedent as a flaw, I can say it, although I would like to learn more about Batman and follow its history more. Even the bad stories are interesting, and as a "story of origin" for two of Batman's main criminals, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot. <br /> <br /> However, there are some character issues that count as a flaw. The Penguin has a group of circus performers who follow his orders, but even though they are often on the screen, we never learn anything about them. Burton has a core of intriguing characters like those of Tod Browning's Freaks (1932), with interesting actors like Vincent Schiavelli, but he doesn't have the space to use them. <br /> <br /> matter, it has almost no room to explore Catwoman. The film sounds like if Catwoman could have been so developed and staged in all The Penguin scenes, but that cut of the film would have lasted 4 hours. So most of the Catwoman scenes had to be deleted. Of course, all of this barely leaves room for Batman. Burton makes the Batman film become very obscure in the eyes of the public in this film, and in an unusual way, it never bothered to solve the problem. As far as we know, in the end Gothamites still thinks that Batman is a crazy killer. This is an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this movie and the next. <br /> <br /> As for the script, although there are minor issues including some non sequiturs and bizarre (in terms of logic) decisions created by characters, it is clear that Burton and the writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters they are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. Much of the dialogue is word game oriented, but often this is quite subtle and / or complex (of course, sometimes it is also very blatant or transparent). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more "poetic" film, as I believe it was the intention. This also translates into a more general plot and directorial decisions: a lot of odd actions, even from minor characters, are done in the service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well. <br /> <br /> "Dark" is the simplest way to summarize Batman's Returns in a word and whether that's positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love the dark. So for me, Burton's style largely transcends defects in the plot and in the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like a crazy campy horror movie, with a wonderfully disturbing production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there is still a slight reference to Star Wars), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that "Max Schreck" was the name of the actor who played the character of Dracula there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal and dark side) and zombie movies - made more explicit in the final scene of The Penguin. <br /> <br /> In terms of images and general atmosphere - and this includes the general "feeling" of the story, the characters and so on - this could not be a stronger 10
