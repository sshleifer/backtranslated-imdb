I am very grateful that the small university town of Abingdon, Virginia, near Bristol, TN. and home of the famous Barter Theater, where Gregory Peck once performed, he managed to get an art film festival and show this movie there. Abingdon is two hours and an hour from where I live, but the journey was worthwhile in every sense. UZAK / DISTANT is an incredible film, brilliant, strident, exciting and captivating. As a Turkish-American, this film was not just a testament to what life in Turkey is like; but on a larger scale tells the world what it means to be Turkish if you live in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It can last two hours instead of five minutes, but this is actually our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose only a few random ones. But, for me, a narrative scene takes place in a cinema in Beyoglu (in the center of Istanbul). The title character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak who sadly died in a car accident shortly after the completion of this film, follows a very attractive young woman down a staircase to the main cinema auditorium. Go see "Vanilla Sky". While the image of Tom Cruise is reflected from a glass, we hear that Turkish men are competing with Tom Cruise for the affection of their own women, even though Tom Cruise was never found in Beyoglu. The scenes shot across the shores of the Bosphorus are also quite revealing as they symbolize beauty, but desperate empty depths, which are a painful fact of life in Turkey. In this film, the gulf separates lovers and families. A simple empty pack of Samsun cigarettes (Turkish brand) and a dying mouse jumps off the screen like the seagulls in the 1982 Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney movie "Yol". Many of Guney's films, including "Yol", "Suru- the Herd" (1978- completed by Zeki Okten) and "Baba-The Father" (1971) were considered by many to be the best Turkish films ever made. Without the sometimes-inflated social-political anger of Guney (especially in his latest film, the 1983 prison drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Distance" captures the essence of Turkish life quite dramatically. This is an encouraging result for a director who in my opinion can already be proclaimed as the Turkish equivalent of directors like Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can't wait to see his other films!
