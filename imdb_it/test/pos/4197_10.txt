"Head" is one of those movies that you will have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, but once they do they will fall in love with it. I don't know how many times it happened to me. This film is so funny and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the Monkees have had up to this point in their careers. The credit goes to Bob Rafelson who practically ended Monkee's career with this film. My hypothesis is that he wanted to stop directing the television program and get into functions, which he did in a big sense after that. Micky Dolenz is absolutely fun. I can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comedian after this movie. This movie has a lot of great cameos and a lot of stupid psychedelic nonsense. I feel that the reputation of this film continues to grow and I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually became a cult classic
