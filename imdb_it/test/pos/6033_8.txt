As for the story this is not among the best or most intelligent writings of the Columbo film, but the film is extremely well done, with excellent direction and really excellent acting. <br /> <br /> Above all the acting in this film attracts attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the film's actors. As a result he granted Peter Falk and John Cassavetes a lot of space to play with, also because both were credited here as unaccredited directors of this film. It must be part of his directing style to allow the actors to have plenty of space. It works very well for this movie. Maybe he did it because even Colasanto himself worked as an actor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of Coach in the hit series "Cheers", beginning in 1982 until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> So Peter Falk looks better than ever in the role of Lt. Columbo. Even veteran actor John Cassavetes does a great job as the film is his killer and it's a good match for the lieutenant. Next to them, the film also contains Myrna Loy. A great star of the silent film era and also of Pat Morita, in a small initial role. <br /> <br /> But not only the acting direction in the film is really good. Visually and technically it is also a really fantastic film, with slow slow shots, without the use of cuts. Obviously also the reason why this film is longer than most Columbo films. It really takes time to set things up and tell his story. The film also features a couple of beautiful artistic and experimental shots. Obviously all perfectly suited to the 70s. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, as far as history goes, this is not just one of Columbo's best films. Even the clues left out for the lieutenant are a little too obvious this time. It makes the killer look a bit silly, as if he didn't think his plan was good enough, while the character is obviously a smart man. This time Columbo also tries to irritate the suspect and the other characters a little more than he usually tries to do in order to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's different acting approach is one reason his character may seem different from what he does in other Columbo films. But different does not mean worse in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also features a pretty good soundtrack by Richard DeBenedictis, who later became a sort of stable composer for Columbo's films. <br /> <br /> A fantastic Columbo film to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
