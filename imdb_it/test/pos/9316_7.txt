Supposed again with "Erotic Nights of the Living Dead" with the same cast and setting but for sure this has no Laura Gemser. Very mocked by everyone, I rather like this movie. Of course, the plot and dialogue are codswallop, but this is beautifully filmed in such a wonderful environment and I really like hardcore. I find it both natural and exotic at the same time, and that doesn't just mean there is a black girl and floppy penis! I find the numerous and varied sexual scenes very believable, even though two are placed on a tree trunk on the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly moving around. The creature does not deign to appear until half an hour before the end and is, it must be said, a disappointment. Yet in the time that remains he manages to kill all but two of the expedition and in case the girls have sex with them before (or later in at least one case!) And this film is not as slow as some claim. Also there are some good moments of sexploitation, not least the scientist and her need for two "natives", and the glorious ending when the two survivors descend fast on their boat, look at the island from which they fled, and find us still time for a last act of copulation.
