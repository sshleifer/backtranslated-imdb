Oscar winners: Hutton and Penn are both extraordinary in the film. The film is also occasionally funny and quite disturbing at times. David Suchet almost steals the show like the man who works for the Soviet Union. This image has a family cast in supporting roles. He was quite underrated when he was released for the first time. Despite some excellent reviews by some of the best film critics. This image is actually based on a true story. There are some flaws in the narrative, like these two protagonists, but overall, it's a film that is worth seeing. Based on a novel by Robert Lindsey. Oscar-Winner script: Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler's List). (**** / *****).
