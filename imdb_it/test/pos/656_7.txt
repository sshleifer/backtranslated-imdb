This is an interesting film, hard to find from the early 1970s played by Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't cut like a marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' clothes to humiliate them as they are sent home, failed recruits are sent by parcel. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific like a hard "Raider" marine. Gere's character is already tired and is thinking about desertion, and takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his blue child's uniform after getting drunk and beating him in an alley. The character of Vincent, whose name is Marion, takes the dress of Gere and suddenly turns into a marine "Reaper". Marion makes her way into Wyoming and stops in a small town of Norman Rockwell. In the local cafe he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches her eye. Staying with Hudkins' parents, Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the people of the city. Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a marine "Raider" can still be so innocent. The story also includes Japanese internment camps, as the people of the city hunt for 3 fugitives. Marion is accidentally hit during this hunt. But there is still a happy ending, which confused me a little. I would have preferred a little more drama! However, he captures JMV at the peak of his 70s performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70s were incredibly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heart-throb at the same time !!! He made a lot of quality films during his career, and continued to do so until the mid-1980s with the big TV show Airwolf. He does a great job in this as "Hedge", quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must have also performed some of the stunts - there is a heartbreaking river scene at the end of the film - and it seems to be the guy who gets thrown down the river for me! But really, at the height of his popularity, this film could have done much more with the talent and its appearance than JMV. Innocence can be so interesting. Evil, as explored in "Buster and Billie", is much more dramatic! However, Glynnis O'Connor is as delicious as Rose. The whole aspect of the film is like a Norman Rockwell painting. The outdoor scenes are stunning - they must have been shot in Canada.
