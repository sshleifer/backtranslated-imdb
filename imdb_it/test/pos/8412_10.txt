I didn't read the book "Scarlett" and when I saw this mini series I had a great time and I thought it shouldn't be compared to GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares that it is a movie. Also in the credits it is based on the book, it is not the book. The film is clearly underestimated by the reviews that other people write but cannot even correctly write the names of the main characters. <br /> <br /> The acting in Scarlett seemed superb to me. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and touched them. Now, as far as the others go, they compare them with the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Obviously they were fantastic, but the protagonists of this film are completely different people who have their own methods of acting and should not be put under pressure by what people have to say. If you wanted certain actors to do well, you should have directed the film, I'm sure other actors wouldn't do as well with the chemistry and intelligence that led to these roles. The supporting cast stood out for its grandeur, and Jean Smart steals the scenes that intertwine with his comedy genius. <br /> <br /> The settings of the film were very beautiful and it was great to see Scarlett go to all those places in the film as she causes problems and other things. Even the scene in which Scarlett speaks at her father's grave was very dramatic and I thought that from then on there were two GREAT actresses who brought Scarlett O'Hara to life. Not just Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The film and the book may be different, but you must not take to heart the fact that this is the sequel to one of the best films ever made, otherwise you will think that this must be like Gone With the Wind you won't like this movie. But this is an underrated classic that is different from GWTW, it's his movie. Please also note that "Tomorrow is another day" ...
