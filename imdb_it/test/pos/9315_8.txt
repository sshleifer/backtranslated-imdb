I heard a lot about Porno Holocaust and his twin movie Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and have been filmed at the same time in the same place with the same actors who change clothes for each film (and remove them). If you expect the genius of D'Amato to be shown in films like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you won't find it here. Nevertheless, this film has a fascination that exploitation fans will not be able to resist. Where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie / monster and his huge penis strangling and choking women to death? Only from D'Amato. There is a certain amount of blood in which many of the men are shot to death. The film is set on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know there is no subtitled version, so if you don't speak Italian you won't know what's going on ... but who cares right? In all honesty, Gore fans will probably jump into hardcore sex. And if someone is really looking at this just for sex, they will surely be offended instantly. I can only imagine the modern porn fans that date back to the production of D'Amato and who encounter this atrocity! Of the two I find that Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead is far superior. But don't bother watching if they are cut. The Porno Holocaust has an extremely low budget as expected. Even the monster doesn't look as good as the George Eastman character in Anthropophagus. The film deserves to be watched for laughter and to complete your cinematographic search for D'Amato.
