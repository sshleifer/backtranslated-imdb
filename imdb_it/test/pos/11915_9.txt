I recently rented this film as part of a nostalgic phase I'm going through. I was born in 1980, so film from the mid-80s to the mid-90s has a fairly important place in my growth. <br /> <br /> This particular film was one of my favorites, so I was thrilled when it became available in the UK. It hasn't gotten worse over time, it's still a very funny movie, full of emotions in its own way. Sure, it pales in the shade of bigger and bigger budget movies, but don't let it stop you from enjoying this. <br /> <br /> It is worth a rent, or even a purchase at discounted prices you will find it for.
