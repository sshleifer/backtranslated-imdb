** SPOILERS ** A shocking but true story of the horror that struck the city of Phenix, on the border between Alabama and Georgia, when it was taken over by a band of organized criminals who transformed it into the South South City. <Br / > <br /> With the skyrocketing crime and no one to turn to a group of concerned citizens get the well-respected Phenix lawyer Albert Patterson, John McIntire, to run for the district attorney's office. With the criminal element of Phenix doing everything from intimidation to definitive murder, to keep voters able to get the nomination of Patterson still wins with the other 86 counties of the state, excluding Phenix's Russell County, giving him a mention of over 1,000 votes. <br /> <br /> Terrified in what Patterson would do when he moved to the head of the Phenix Mob Rett Tanner, Edward Andrews, was a success. Patterson is killed while driving into his office but his murderers are spotted by Ellie Rhodes, Kathryn Grant, who soon becomes, through an informant in Patterson's office, Tanner's next person in line to be targeted for murder. What Tanner & Co. did not expect was that the late son of Albert Patterson, John, Richard Kiley, received the news from Ellie of her father's murder before her boys could shut her up! That big calculation mistake by Tanner will end up putting an end to both his criminal organization and his freedom! <br /> <br /> Powerful documentary-style detective film with real people involved in the events from around 15 minutes, at the beginning of the film, to tell their stories. This despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by the Tanner Mob who was still at liberty when their interviews were filmed! <br /> <br /> Finishing what his brave dad started, John Patterson alone brought the story of Phenix City to the front pages of state and national newspapers, giving Tanner the very negative publicity he sought so hard to avoid. Now that the Alabama National Guard was pouring into bloodthirsty and unconscious Phenix City, not wanting to face people with guns in hand, Tanner Mob vanished from sight like a morning mist after sunlight hit him! And with John Patterson taking the place of his father who was murdered as the state's new Attorney General's attorney, you can be sure that Patterson Mob has seen its last days push people around and kill them. The only thing they will see now in the future are the walls and bars of the gray prison that will be their home sweet home for the rest of their rotten and miserable lives! <br /> <br /> Most likely the most graphically violent The movie released by Hollywood until that time "The Phenix City Story" gave no sign of showing how a group of lawless and powerful criminals can transform a city enough American in a living hell for all inhabitants. No one was stolen by these ruthless gangsters who didn't even think twice about murdering women and children too, if that was what it took to keep them in power! As for the Phenix City Police Department, they had a better thing to do then apply the law they had sworn and paid to maintain. They were out drinking coffee and donuts while their town was burned to the ground by the gangsters like Tanner who kept them in his pocket!
