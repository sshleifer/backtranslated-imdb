I saw "I Smell the Dead" - sorry, "I SELL the Dead" - at a print screening. Glenn McQuaid, screenwriter-director and editor of the film, is an Irish thief who presented the screening announcing that - while it was in progress - he would come out for a pint. I don't drink it for a drink, but - telling ourselves - it seemed that he felt the need to certify his laziness or Irish, or both. When the credits arrived, there were, as usual at the press screenings, strong ovations for the names of all the actors or crew members who had had friends in the public, and silence for those who they did not have. McQuaid is back for a witty question and answer later. <br /> <br /> This horror film is not taken seriously, which is good because his humor is considerably stronger than his horror. Only one scene is even remotely scary, and most of the "horror" is just coarse, but I laughed for most of the film. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be set in Ireland around 1850 (from which period the sacking of the tombs was mostly dead). The story is told in flashbacks: we get flashbacks inside the flashbacks, and the narrator makes a flashback of material he couldn't know, because sometimes he wasn't present or (in one case) because the action took place at his shoulders. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a prisoner brought to the guillotine. The guillotines were not used in 19th-century Ireland, but - for once - we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence. The prisoner fights for his execution, the cleats are precise and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade at the top. (And there is a reward later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself.) <br /> <br /> The characters are apparently Irish, but one of the main characters speaks in Cockney parlance: using phrases like " the game of a cup "and" take a butcher "(to 'take a look'). For once, actors in 19th century roles show nineteenth-century dental hygiene, yet almost all clothes and hairstyles (and women's make-up) are resolutely 21st century. I'm not complaining about Heather Bullock, who is wearing a very attractive black miniskirt that appears to be PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The main actors (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most of the supporting cast has no sense of the Victorian period. The worst offender is Joel Garland as the publican, whose characterization is firmly rooted in the twenty-first century. Just when I thought Garland's performance couldn't be less Victorian, he used his fingers to do "ironic" air quotes. <br /> <br /> The sets (especially the Angus Scrimm workshop) are detailed and impressive, yet they failed to convince me that people lived and worked in these places. Almost every interior contains lit candles, but never once did I see what would have been if these were real Victorian homes or workplaces: remnants of dripping from previous candles. <br /> <br /> A scene presents an extra-terrestrial: I was annoyed by the fact that McQuaid had opted for a stereotypical alien Schwa "gray", rather than something original. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful editing sequences, but McQuaid opts for flashy effects - split screens, top-down shots - that don't serve the story. I was impressed by a recurring blue screen device that overlapped the heads of the main characters on other backgrounds. Less successful was a recurring "Creepshow" motif of camera shots that transformed the faces of the actors into designs that resembled art panels of horror comics from the 1950s. I'm a fan of EC Comics, but they don't belong to 19th-century Ireland. The money that McQuaid spent on a flashy photographic F / X - showing his editing skills without serving the plot - should have been spent in accurate costumes. <br /> <br /> GREAT SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman offers an "Oirish" performance full of school acting tics. Apparently a nineteenth-century Irish priest writes, he writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, left-handed children were punished for using "the devil's hand" and were forcibly retrained to become steeds.) But Perlman's character has a reason to hide his right hand. Elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie but does not suffer negative effects, so I knew there would be a reward later. Several scenes that will take place more logically at night are filmed in daylight, apparently only because this is easier and less expensive. (Since McQuaid is a skilled director and editor, he could easily have turned "day by night" ... but using a process-photography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his showy editing techniques.) <br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to pay tribute to those great old Hammer horror movies. But those Hammers were so great because the actors and set designers worked hard to convince us that we were seeing events in 1888 in Whitechapel, or anywhere. 'I Sell the Dead' almost completely fails to evoke the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director, screenwriter and editor, but in all three capacities he makes strange choices here ... so he largely fails to justify such choices. But I liked "I Sell the Dead". I will evaluate 7 out of 10 and look forward to your next movie.
