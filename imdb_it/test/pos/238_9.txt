Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> A story of a dancer in a nightclub that becomes a famous girl cover. The old adage applies here: happiness and fame do not always mix. <br /> <br /> The choreographies are wonderfully choreographed. What dances and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Otto Kruger is the oldest gentleman who discovers Hayworth, when he sees his picture showing a strong resemblance to the woman who left him in the hallway - Hayworth's grandmother Maribel. <br /> <br /> A jealous reaction from Kelly leads Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The image is basically the story that repeats itself at the end. <br /> <br /> To add to the glory of this beautiful film, there is always Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers, suitably named Genius in the film.
