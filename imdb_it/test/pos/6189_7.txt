Sleeper Cell tries to swim on both sides of the pool (terrorism / patriotic American Muslim), and it doesn't do much good. <br /> <br /> I postponed to watch this show for a very long time, because I had a feeling that it would be too predictable, but after a year in my Netflix queue, I finally moved it to the front. <br /> <br /> The show is about an undercover Muslim man who works for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The agent infiltrated into the show is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / resolution between his patriotism and his religious convictions. Personally I would have preferred to see a drama about an American family from Muslin living in the United States, but it is doubtful that an American television channel (by cable or network) will ever produce something that shows Muslims under a flattering light. <br /> <br /> I am not a Muslim, but I have many American Muslim friends, and I can honestly say that none of them is a terrorist and everyone loves America. <br /> <br /> Sleeper Cell approaches the chaos of Muslim stereotypes, but also focuses on the worst Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see a "homicide of honor", which is a very poor portrait of Islam, but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate Muslim scholar who teaches the viewer that the real Jihad is actually a personal struggle that does it is intended to incite violence towards others. <br /> <br /> If only the moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the show. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn a lot more about Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a little, but is unable to give the American public what they really need to know. <br /> <br /> That said, the acting in this show is superb and the drama is extremely compelling. If only they had made this show about Islam in America without terrorism, it would have been top notch.
