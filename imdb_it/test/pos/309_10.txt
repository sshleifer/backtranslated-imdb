From all the Vietnam war movies, this is probably the scariest and most frightening and this is really very significant with so many spectacular that have come up. He has this strange feeling. Everything is so chaotic in the film that scares you. It is not like showing a lot of different things than the other Vietnam war movies. What leads to such a high level is the: <br /> <br /> The direction was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his latest epic film. Unlike other directors, it makes you feel like you're at war. Most of the others show and show the horrors of war. However, Coppola makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us by a film or a story. This is something I experienced only a few times while watching a movie. Obviously the writing was also extraordinary. He took you to write in the middle of the movie. He never bored me and this movie lasts three hours. Cinematography goes hand in hand with the direction that has greatly enriched the bizarre experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm. <br /> <br /> The acting was chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last big performance playing a disappointing colonel out of his mind. When I think of a crazy soldier, I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this movie you don't want to look him in the eye. Like the movie, it was strange. For me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave to Il Padrino. Martin Sheen gave a very profound performance and probably the best of his career, making you see everything through his eyes all the madness he is experiencing and still wanting to reach his goal. It is only a miracle that these two did not receive the Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that madness with his ridiculous battle strategies, among those that play music to tell the coming enemy. Even the character of Duvall who asks one of the soldiers to sail in the middle of a battle was shocking but credible. Other great support performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who summarized the attitude of many soldiers at that time without becoming a clich√©. Also for once the cameos have been put in good light having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford that I love both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend people to watch this movie. He has a message and all those involved in making it are at their best. There is nothing else I could ask for in this film with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and fantastic ending. Look and see why it lives up to the Apocalpyse Now title.
