I'm 17 and I'm a Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, the Muppet movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It's incredibly fun, thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl, and the movie looks lovely, with some wonderfully arranged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I liked them a lot, of course I'm not the best song in the Muppet series, but they were very nice to listen to, especially in Never Before. Never Before is now one of my favorite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets were fantastic, as usual, especially the always delightful Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was fantastic. And what a brilliant human cast - from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious films like What's Up Doc?, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, all of those who made memorable guest appearances, if careful not to obscure the Muppets in a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox
