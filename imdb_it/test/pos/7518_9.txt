Anyone who goes to the Manhattan Hospital Center takes life in his own hands. This includes the staff of The Hospital. <br /> <br /> I had never seen the hospital before and I was intrigued by how the characters and the situations of the plot were similar to that other masterpiece by Paddy Chayefsky, Network. There are elements in the character of George C. Scott that have both those of Al Schumacher and those of Howard Beale. <br /> <br /> He is the administrator of The Hospital and he is crazy to die and will not make it anymore. He is completely foreign to his wife and children. It takes a Faye Dunaway character in the person of Diana Rigg to get him out of it. A roll in the hay with her and he is shocked back to reality and the fact that he can still contribute to the world. <br /> <br /> But first it has a real problem. Someone is killing hospital staff, four of them in a 48-hour period. And the good part is that their deaths can largely be attributed to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. This is where the comedy comes into play. <br /> <br /> There is a Howard Beale type character in the person of Barnard Hughes, Diana Rigg's father. Its end is not as dramatic as Beale's. <br /> <br /> In my working days it was part of my job to pay medical suppliers. Some of them could be as ugly as those you will find in The Hospital. The black satire of the comedy has had a certain bite for me. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was nominated for Best Actor, but having won and refused to accept the Oscar of the previous year for Patton, it was not about having a second chance. He lost to Gene Hackman for The French Connection. His role management is nevertheless unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try viewing the Hospital on the Net and see how many similarities you find.
