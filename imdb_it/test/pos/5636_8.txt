For me, the best and most memorable films are often the ones I don't know about at first glance. American Movie is a perfect example of a gem of the genre. Watching TV late at night, I found the only positive review among the waste - fortunately I was satisfied with a real surprise. American Movie is a documentary that follows the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard", I think), a very articulate and charismatic Wisconson boy, as he struggles to write, direct and produce "MidWestern", a gritty and low budget horror film he worked for years. In Mark we discover a young man full of contrasts. His appearance is the classic stereotype of trailer stuff: thin mustache, bum-fluff, 80s heavy metal style, braids, etc. For the camera, however, Mark reveals surprising humor and intuition while philosophizing about life, love, film and the American Way. As the film unfolds, it becomes sadly clear that Mark's lack of discipline and strong consumption are continually sabotaging his creative efforts. American Movie is a fascinating watch, full of hilarious moments and lively characters. The main of these is the amiable companion of Mark Mike Schank, a reformist stoner with a calm voice who, having gained an addiction to scratch cards, now depends on soda pop. I absolutely loved the American movie. It creates a true empathy between the viewer and the main characters, and provides laughter without feeling exploitative. I would heartily recommend it to anyone.
