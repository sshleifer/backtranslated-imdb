I like to see Linda Blair playing again in a "horror" movie. I was disappointed in her in almost everything from the movies "Exorcist" (which I loved). What happened to all those bad "B-movies" he did? <br /> <br /> David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all I could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror film actor. David needs to stick to "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> All around, this is a fantastic movie. Also for the eighties, this was a fantastic film. It has horror, action and drama. It's full of suspense and I loved the way Linda Blair came out.
