Superb silent version of the story of Francois Villon. Although redone in the 1930s as IF I WERE KING, directed by Frank Lloyd, screenplay by Preston Sturges and Ronald Colman, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a cohort of comedians, plays the crazy jester and depressed wine Villon with a verve that Colman could not match. The photography is surprising in its beauty and innovation and in the supporting cast, in particular Conrad Veidt in his American premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day, and the supporting comic strip, Slim Summerville and Hank Mann, steal every scene they find . <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Barrymore has made so few first-rate plays. Among his sound films, only his protagonist in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can be compared to this, and those stand up only for his superb voice. In this silent film, Barrymore must tell his story without the benefit of the words, and he does so, alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the King of the Fools and tenderly as Villon in love. He even goes so far as to jump into Fairbanks' bold style, very convincingly. He also lets his supporting cast have his share of glory, popping up in this ensemble work like any talented comic strip of the time. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief word about Alan Crosland, a director known today only to direct the first feature film, THE JAZZ SINGER in the same year was published. Crosland was an attentive, innovative and delightfully original director, and it is a pity that not many of his works are known. Perhaps this film, much more interesting than a film compared to his most famous work, will be your introduction to his other talents. If so, you could do a lot worse.
