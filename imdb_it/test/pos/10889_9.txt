I played it for the first time around 98 or 99 when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really great and I love it. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. In a player mode, go around like James Bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic land or a city. My favorite was the one with a tank. In the two-player mode, you and a friend choose from the characters you want and do everything to fight. in the area where you are, you will find weapons and ammunition to help you. From handguns to rifles to lasers and even fists at work. <br /> <br /> Still with the player two mode, there are plenty of places to go, and some to unlock. I find this game really fun, but also very suspenseful. Because, you never really know where your opponent is, and it's amazing to see them behind a door where you're going. <br /> <br /> This game gets **** (1/2) stars or ***** Very well! Go play sometimes!
