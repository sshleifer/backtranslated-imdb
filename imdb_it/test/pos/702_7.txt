Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaw friends together, but now the sheriff and young Ford are still taking his gun. He is hired to do a job in the bank, but is delayed to go to the city and whoever hired him gets someone else. This leads to all kinds of complications, much for a film that doesn't even last 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn both have girls here. Claire Trevor plays her usual good time with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls for the great season of Ford without realizing who he is or why he came to the city where Scott is the sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's B western, but unusual in time and for Columbia Pictures was given the complete technicolor treatment. The Desperadoes marked Glenn Ford's first film in technicolor, a process reserved only for some of the most expensive films in larger studios. Harry Cohn was certainly not one to pay. And certainly not during the war period. <br /> <br /> The plot becomes a bit complicated as both Ford and Scott are tested for friendship against opportunity / duty. The plot also involves some tacky high-class hypocriticals in the city of Randy who are the real outlaws regarding the film. <br /> <br /> The four protagonists do a great job and the best support performance is Guinn Williams as an amiable explosive lunkhead of a companion. The climax involves a stampede in the city hall and is one of the best ever made in a western movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of the four leads and westerns in general will appreciate this.
