Things I like. Steve Zahn in the role of Gus, nails the part, copying Robert Duvalls' mannerisms that make him feel at ease with Gus fans. (some of the other actors copy the style of their predecessors also in this series). Karl Urban, looks sad and hard, but he can also joke and smile, as T.L.Jones did in the original series. The equipment, the guns, the clothes, all accurate, or very close to the precise period. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in Open Range. The Comanches are actually riding bareback instead of hiding a modern saddle under a Navajo blanket. And they are not depicted as politically correct peaceful pastors, but as a people proud of warriors. There are some stupid scenes, but it is not the case for another variation in doing something stupid not to win a million dollar reality show.
