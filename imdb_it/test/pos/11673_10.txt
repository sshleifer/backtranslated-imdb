Penelope Spheeris (of "Wayne's World" fame) made her mark in the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization", on the punk scene in LA between the late 70s and early 80s. Most of the documentaries feature interviews with punks and concert shoots (which often become violent). Overall, we see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: while the hippies were natural, the punks wanted to be the most altered as possible, with spiked hair and all the rest. But also, we see how unhappy they are and sometimes they become skinheads. <br /> <br /> However, this is a really fantastic time capsule. We are not really sure if we crave that age or feel rejected by it. But this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. It is really worth seeing.
