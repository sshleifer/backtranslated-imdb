Another good animation from Disney. The sequels are not always so large and tend to follow the same plot as the original. However, Tramp's son tries to savor the world outside his family and the family he knows and learn where he actually belongs. Being a landfill dog isn't for everyone, but it's the same, but Scamp overcomes adversity. The voices of the various characters were superb and provided by many well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. Fun and a well-made family movie.
