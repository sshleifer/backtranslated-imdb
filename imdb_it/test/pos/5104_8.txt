Yes 1939 / Robert Donat-Greer Garson's version was the best ... Perfection ... Donat won the Oscar in a very difficult year ... Gable in GWTW and James Stewart in the role of Mr. Smith. were 2 of its competitors. .wow it was a difficult year .. Most NY critics hated this version. so don't see it in the theater! I finally saw this A.M. on TCM and amused..Peter O'Toole was excellent and happy to have been nominated for an Oscar for this ", and in particular the Oscar finally awarded him a special award last year ... Petula Clark was as good as Mrs. Chips but her character, I feel that it was written wrong ... Some beautiful songs esp. You & I ... sung by Ms Clark and subsequently recorded by many others including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae .... the b & w version was more authentic .. but this is a beautiful film beautifully photographed in color and in panavision ... nice to see and Bravo, again, Mr. O'Toole!
