I didn't really think this movie was bad. Of course, the detective somehow sucked what he did, and it usually happens to Captain Howdy by mistake, but he did the job. Captain Howdy himself was pretty scary. The make-up artist did a great job. I really enjoyed seeing Dee dressed all over geeks. I laughed so hard when I saw it. Personally I don't see how anyone can sit down for shit like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and call it a great movie, and then watch Strangeland, which is more disturbing because a lot could happen with the Internet that is so popular, and call it bad. I personally think that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a bunch of crap. Probably one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I liked Strangeland. It was a very disturbing film because almost everything really happens.
