Farscape rules totally! I think it's very close to Babylon 5 even though there are only 7 main characters in the series (including the spaceship). The humor is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting even if practically everything that happens on the ship. <br /> <br /> What I really love and appreciate about Farscpae is that they don't use CGI for the alien characters or if they do, it's imperceptible. They use those cute animated animatronic animated puppets very similar to those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you would definitely like to learn more about if you don't already have it.
