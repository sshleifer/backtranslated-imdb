Most of these reviews are dead, so I'll follow another pursuit and answer a couple of questions I've seen here. <br /> <br /> While the characters seem and seem young (hence the controversy), the actor / actress was 17 and 18 at the time and therefore obviously beyond the 16th barrier. Here in the United States, this is still somewhat controversial, but the simplicity and innocence of the film do much to counterbalance it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I didn't see him more from Sean; in this film at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character feels if he is angry, scared or confused. Anicee had a healthy career, whose life was unfortunately cut by cancer at the end of 2006. She was a beautiful and talented actress. <br /> <br /> FRIENDS VHS tapes can occasionally be found on Amazon.com, but usually for a significant price; I saw it starting at $ 60 or so and up to $ 152 (as of this comment, there were two for that price). The sequel video PAUL & MICHELLE is not expensive enough and can be obtained (if available) on Amazon for an average value between $ 16 and $ 70.
