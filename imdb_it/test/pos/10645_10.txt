The famous close-up of their breakfast meat, crawling with worms is still recorded by the fire in my neurons or the wind that fills the right places of the sails, the fog better than that of Carpenter THE FOG so is the true terror that springs from history human instead of ghost pirates. But I tell you one thing: not even the magnificent scene in homenage performed by Brian Di Palma with the excellent music of Ennio Morricone in The Untochables (slow motion film) can match the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd coming down stairs. We see not only the stroller but I remember the hand of a child trampled by a military boot, someone without feet running away at the last minute, someone with glasses (then a cut edition) and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that is passed through .... mini stories in a single scene.
