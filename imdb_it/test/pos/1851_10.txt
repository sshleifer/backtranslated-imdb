I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job of co-scriptwriting, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is simply hot. and Minnie Driver is cute as always. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi you have a movie worthy of the Oscars! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go and rent the DVD, watch it once and then put the directors' comments on ... Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!
