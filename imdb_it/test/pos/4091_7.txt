The film is excellent. Acting, cinematography, directing and music are fascinating. It seems to me that the reason why so many give the film a low score is due to the devotion they have to the original 1937 version with Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - has generated an incredible level of commitment. From talking to people who saw the original when it came out, I think the impact was something like the first movie "Starwars" in modern times. I saw it. It was and it is wonderful. But this does not mean that even this version is not worthy. From the first scene the 1973 version catches you. The noise and the uproar are fantastic, especially in the way they prepare you for the peace of Shangri La. And the music of Burt Bacharach is beautiful. So by all means enjoy the 1937 version. But don't let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you'll let the 1935 King Kong destroy Peter Jackson this year.
