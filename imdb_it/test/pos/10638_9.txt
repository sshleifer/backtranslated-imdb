If you think that the piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in the Michael Haneke film "THE PIANIST" is the last degree in the personification of disorder, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: the teacher of piano in the novel by Elfriede Jellinek "THE PIANIST" (on which the film was based) is twice as "repulsive", "disgusting", "unbalanced" and even more fascinating - although there may not be enough words to translate the level of artistic competence achieved by Isabelle Huppert here, above all the other deadly actresses in business today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano / dubbing plan an actor could offer? <br /> <br /> In the novel as in the film, there are two great antagonists to the "heroine" Kohut: his mother (wonderful, Annie Girardot with the shipwrecked voice, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and the Austria itself. The mother embodies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, say, Ã¼bermensch ideals that are impossible to maintain today without the danger of collapse mental. <br /> <br /> "The Pianist" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your most intimate fantasies to that (you think) you love. We tend to think that our sexual fantasies must be as exciting for others as for ourselves, which could prove to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here, Kohut learns (?) The lesson in the most painful and humiliating way. <br /> <br /> It must be said that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the most well-known and appreciated authors in Austria and Europe (well, she now has a Nobel prize!) and that the autobiographical passages can be deduced in her novel, since she herself was a pianist and had a difficult relationship to report to her mother. The novel also includes long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence, in order to understand how it turned into what it is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the film, forcing us to ask how it could be that way (don't we all know an Erika Kohut out there?). But in his film he retains much of the plot of the book: unbearable honesty, to the point where most secret, "horrendous" feelings emerge painfully: envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion, etc. . All unmistakably human. I thought "La Pianiste" was a moving film, very disturbing and challenging, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's all I ask for movies. He also made me buy and be thrilled by the book, discover a fantastic author I had never read before and listen to Schubert again and again - so thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you're looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10
