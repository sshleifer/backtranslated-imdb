"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal and incisive docudrama about what was once called the "most evil city in America". The film documents the events that led to the assassination of the criminal union of Phenix City by Albert Patterson, an Alabama lawyer who made an offer to the Attorney General's office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption afflicting his hometown. His son, John Patterson, picked up his father's mantle after his death and won the post, making the cleaning of Phenix City a primary element on his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson has created a film that has the ability to shock even today. Sadness is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch. We see that the crime syndicate beats and kills to get what they want - beatings and killings include women and children, and a particular scene, which revolves around the death of a black girl, is particularly disturbing. It is not exactly a funny film, because in the end there is a small gain to reward the spectator for having witnessed the exasperated events that preceded him, but it is a well-made film, full of intense and angry energy. <br /> <br /> A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the inhabitants of Phenix City, some of whom are portrayed by actors in the fictional part of the film. The film gives the film a quality of urgency that reverberates in the narrative, so that we feel like we're watching a documentary all the time, a feeling that was helped by Karlson's choice to film on real places. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie, but it's one of those movies that fills you with a sense of right indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
