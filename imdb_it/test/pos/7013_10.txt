Like most women, this film is the ultimate chick-flick. With her hot chemistry, sexy roaming dance and blissful songs, I mean a timeless classic like (I have Had) The Time of My Life and the wonderful She's Like The Wind makes this movie. I love Patrick Swayze in this film and he shows that he can sing and dance so hot. Sing "She's Like The Wind" in the film. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Gray is amazing. I love all the dances and everything that goes with it. But to say this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great but Patrick Swayze's scenes do it. I love songs, dances and everything related but it's not Dirty Dancing. As I said it's a fantastic film. Please, there is a third because I like to see what happens with the character of Patrick Johnny. Jennifer's character could have been sexier but hey Patrick makes up for it if you understand what I mean !!! Great movie and I'm so happy that Billy Zane didn't win the role of the film. I heard whispers about the role, but they found out he couldn't dance.
