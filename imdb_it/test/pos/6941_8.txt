As a Canadian, I didn't know much about Whitlam's dismissal. I had read the Wikipedia page about those events, but that was all about it. At the beginning of this year, when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (luckily it disappeared) that could have led to the intervention of our governor-general, Whitlam's dismissal was mentioned in the press. In an attempt to learn more, I ordered the DVD of this mini series through EBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by the interest in the account. As dramatic as the events were, this could have been a very boring political drama. However, it was a rather suspenseful mini series. I was also struck by how understandable it was, despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics. It didn't take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it is not a completely impartial account. Malcolm Fraser is certainly represented as a rather Machiavellian figure, who does not let any person or thing hinder his quest to be Prime Minister. Gough Whitlam is portrayed in a nobler, almost holy light. However, the actor who portrays Whitlam channels the nobility in such a way as to seem more pompous. I thought that Sir John Kerr was portrayed quite sympathetically. <br /> <br /> I have to warn people that the DVD is of poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 1980s, but it would seem that no effort has been made to restore image or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no extras were added. A documentary, or even some interviews with historical figures, would have improved the experience, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this mini series for anyone interested in real life events.
