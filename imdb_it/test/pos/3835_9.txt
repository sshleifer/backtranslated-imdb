When the Romulans come, they will not bring gifts; no, they bring war with them - war and conquest. As any acquaintance of this episode knows, he is a redux of the war movie "The Enemy Below" of the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a warship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer and a German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, they are two spaceships in space. In the history of Trek, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, the Earth has fought the Romulan Wars. After about 5 years of conflict, a stalemate led to a treaty and the establishment of the Neutral Zone, a border between us and the Romulan Empire. Now, on this stellar date, the treaty seems to be broken, as our outposts are attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power. Yes, the Romulans are back, testing their new war toy, and now Kirk has to earn his pay: he has to make decisions that affect this area of ​​the galaxy, how to figure out how to avoid a ... oh, I don't know - an interstellar war , perhaps? <br /> <br /> I think that what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn't avoid the sad aspects of the war, as you'd expect from a simple television episode of the sixties - especially an episode of a science fiction show. It's all very tense and compelling, like the best war movies, like when Kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a war council. Writers and actors are not kidding here: this is all the preparation for a horrible conflict, potentially the beginning of another long battlefield. In the final analysis, Kirk's goal is to maintain this battlefield only for the two ships - but even in this case it is an effort fraught with dangers and probable losses. In fact, I believe this episode holds the record for ship victims by the end of it. Right at the beginning of the episode, we see the devastation that this battle can produce, in that apparently well-protected outpost. So start the "cat and mouse" war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship: it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you don't like war movies, you should look for other things to admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What further elevates this episode is the revelation of what and who The Romulans are - it's a kind of electric shock. We now also have a further conflict between crews on the bridge of the Enterprise - the war tends to bring out the worst in some people. Due to still ugly attitudes about race in this future, the tension is further accentuated - Kirk has his hands full in this. I suppose the only weakness of history is the comfortable withdrawal of the problem of bigotry from the conclusion. On the Romulan side, the actor Lenard makes his first appearance in the Trek universe as a Romulan commander; the reverse of the Capt medal is exceptional in the role. Kirk or Capt. Pike, make your choice, made to look like Spock more than a little. Surprisingly, his character is not as hungry for war as we would expect, another forerunner for this episode. The actor would then return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so it's nothing if not versatile. He is also telling how the first appearance of characters like the Romulans is usually their best shot, as it is here. They showed up in "The Enterprise Incident".
