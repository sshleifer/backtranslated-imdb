The best screen performance by George C. Scott. The screenplay by Chayefsky, the dialogue full of irony, is almost perfect ("Just where do you train your nurses, Dachau?"). Rigg is as wonderful as the savior angel who saves Scott from fate, like the whole cast. It's a funny and serious film. It is a film from the 1960s, but it is in no way dated. What it is, the chaos and irrationality of the system with respect to the sanity of the individual, is timeless. And the monologue "We do not cure anything. We do not cure anything" (delivered, actually shouted, like no one else but Scott could) with his references to cloning and other "wonders" of modern science may have literally been written this morning. > <br />
