Like many other comments I've read, I noticed, I fell in love with this movie when I was a child. My sister and I had a copy of the Beta movie (before VHS) that we consumed. Obviously it didn't help when our parents sold BetaMax in a garage sale. Since then we have tried to find a copy. I, like another commentator, finally found a rented copy in a local video store. The owner would not be separated from the copy after any number of attempts to beg, bribe and mourn the way I own the tape. GOOD NEWS! I bought a new VHS copy of Midnight Madness, just released, for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! In the end, Disney has consolidated. Now, if they just release Song of the South ... If you love the movie, take it. If you haven't seen the movie, it's worth checking out - totally stupid but very funny humor (Stephen Furst is hilarious).
