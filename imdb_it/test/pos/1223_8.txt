Unlike most people ... I went to this movie expecting it to be not so good and it turned out to be a fantastic movie. I like the idea rather nice, but what made this film were the actors. they did an incredible job and it was nice to see the breach and the dillon work together. It's a movie where you have to think right away that you'll be able to predict what's going to happen, but it doesn't look like you expected. I don't want to reveal anything about the story, so I won't ... but I suggest giving it a chance. If you saw the movie Money Train and appreciated the fact that you liked this movie. Perhaps all that touches Lawrence Fishburn is gold?
