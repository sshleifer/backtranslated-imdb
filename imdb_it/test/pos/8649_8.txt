At the beginning, with the careful, remote location and the metallic sound, I thought of the opening scene of "Once Upon a Time in the West". When he arrives in the city, he starts to look like "Kitchen Stories", or "Drifting Clouds", maybe even "Grimm". <br /> <br /> Then it turns out that this is more like "Joe" Against the Volcano "in theme (not in style). And the film performs the same sober style from beginning to end. Let yourself be observed, admire the steel-gray-bluish tone of the suites, the clothes, the color of the wall, the furniture, the sheets, the mirrors, the cars, the music, the background sounds and even the expression of the people. there is a stroke of a completely different tone - warm yellow-orange with soft music and ocean splashes, children and laughter. <br /> <br /> But maybe the observation is too long for me, I would rather rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the final shot.
