Taking cues from the classics of Backwoods Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, does Jeff Lieberman's Just Liewnman not offer very much new in terms of plot? a crazy maniac and kills a group of campers ?? but still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the manageable use of the material by the director, the excellent use of breathtaking landscapes, the even greater use of women in hot-pants, a bad synth score by Brad Fiedel and an elegant turn towards the end (although it should be obvious to those who have paid attention). <br /> <br /> Thanks to the solid performance of its capable cast, including Oscar winner George Kennedy as forest ranger Roy McLean, there is a sense of realism for Just Before Dawn which is all too often lacking in this type of tariff. The film also features a rather terrifying maniac (who giggles like Dick Dastardly's dog Mutley and uses a macabre serrated machete to kill), and offers a couple of very imaginative sequences that help raise him above many of his contemporaries: a topless woman (free nudity well made and really blunt box) in a lake he discovers that the hand that groped her underwater does not belong to her boyfriend; and a short-sighted character does with his friend's girlfriend (as a joke), unaware that the slowly approaching person is not his friend but the killer.
