Hercules the Avenger is by far the best single voice in the muscleman genre that I can remember. The accusation made against it by critics - is a copy and paste of two previous Hercules films, with some new material added to make it look fresh - the fact that this "cut and paste" approach solves one of the central problems of the film of sword and sandals. With most of these films, the middle third goes down horribly - usually involving a corny love story or arcane political intrigues or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother plots against them, etc.). ) It is often difficult to resist this to see the exciting ending. Hercules the Avenger eliminates all those crap from the original films and adds a rather lively narrative of a Hercules imitator who makes his way to power. (It should be noted that this episode also functions as a detached but sharply critical observation of the rise of fascism in Italy). This also establishes a beautiful final battle between the real Hercules and his imitator. <br /> <br /> In a narrower focus, I might also add that further changes have improved the individual scenes borrowed from the other films. For my money, the mutineers scene here is much better than the one that first appeared on Hercules and the Captive Women, as it was tightened with the reduction of several characters and their complications in the plot. <br /> <br /> There are also floppy monsters, terrifying atmospheres of the underworld borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, an entire destroyed city, and the usual amount of adorable girls in revealing clothes. Since nobody expects one of these films to compete with The Seven Samurai - or even The Magnificent Seven - it seems a little fussy to keep the film borrowed from other films against it.
