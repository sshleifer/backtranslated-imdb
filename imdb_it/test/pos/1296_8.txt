Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family film. Salman Khan is beautiful and beautiful like never before! There is also a scene where you take off your shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is also fantastic. Pooja Batra had a few lines to say, but I'm glad she was recognized for her role because she certainly has potential. <br /> <br /> It is Prem (Salman Khan) and is a wedding singer. He is about to marry Nisha (Raveena Tandon) but stands up. Prem goes to Nisha's house and asks her why she was abandoned and why her brother is sick and has to marry an NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar), to get the money to get him treated. Prem moves and Priya arrives (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls into <br /> <br /> love with Priya but it's a shame she's going to get married with an NRI! Who could this NRI be? Priya also falls in love with Prem while Rahul is there with her. Prem gives Priya an offensive comment one day and leaves and leaves for Agra for marriage with Rahul. Will he stop her? Watch KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The film was a lot of fun! The songs were exceptional, especially the song "O Priya O Priya". It's a pity the film is flopped in India and I don't know why ?! Today every movie in India is going to flop !! This film deserved to be a success. The only problem I encountered with the film is that they had an obsession with NRIs! They think ALL NRIs are rich! The film deserves a 9/10!
