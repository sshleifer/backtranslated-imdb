This show was really nice in many ways, although certainly an atypical western with the hero (?) Riding a bike rather than a horse, due to the 1914 setting, very "late" for a westerner, which usually tends to be set between 1866 and 1890. I remember some controversy over its deletion at the time, but I didn't really look at it during its time on NBC. When I came to see him and love him it was a decade later when I was in the army stationed in Germany and was shown every week from the beginning on Armed Forces Television. At that point, Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane, but I also think of her as Nichols's girlfriend. In many ways, Nichols was very similar to Maverick; both were much more attracted to getting rich with less effort than they were fighting. It was in the small TV magazine that they distributed on the PX (not really an authorized edition of "TV Guide" but made to resemble it as closely as possible without going into copyright issues) that I learned the real story behind the deletion. I really wonder what the next season would have been with the most violent twin if they had really done as planned. Of course, by the time this show was realized, "the Western era" of TV had been in decline for about a decade; one day I hope to be able to write that the "era of reality" has been in decline for so long! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" were still running, both were approaching their ends and there had been years since a new Western really took off; I think this trend has done a lot to support "Nichols", and was the main reason why NBC executives doubted he would ever find a large audience. But for me, a good Westerner, unlike a show set in the contemporary era , is somehow timeless, as are other "period" shows; changing fashions and the like we do nothing to make them look more "dated" than they should have been, and I think watching this show, 10 years after it was produced, is really what brought this point home to me. Moreover, this show is one of the first pairings of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who is really one of the best helpers of all time, and not only in the West.
