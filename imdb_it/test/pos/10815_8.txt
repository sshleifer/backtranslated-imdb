A script / farce / farce in the shape of a fairytale ball, very fast-paced, set against the French implosion of 1939. Played with intensity of eyes wide open by a talented cast and chockablock with action, satire, social comments and authentic epoch, from brilliant hairstyles and hairstyles marinated to a fleet of Citroen "Tractions", a lively and short soundtrack but credible impersonations of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal PÃ©tain. <br /> <br /> It is simply one of the best entertainment shown recently on the screen, without presumption and "message". If the films were trains (and there is a creative recreation of a journey on a steam train that works despite there being no steam locomotive - an expensive object, no doubt) this would be a TGV.
