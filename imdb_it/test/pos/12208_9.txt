All I can say after watching the DVDs of the first season is that I can't believe that NBC has "enlightened" this show. It is so different from what is currently in vogue for Lost. Those who love X-Files may have a worthy successor. Not as mysterious or intense as Lost, I find it overall more fun. <br /> <br /> This type of extended story is difficult to accomplish. I mean that it could degenerate into a childish dribble if most of the elements do not coexist. But they do and I think the cast is excellent, the writing is clear, the location and the objects of first quality, and the special effects are very good for a television budget. Of course he pushes what is plausible, but how he does it never becomes so foolish as to insult your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Bottomline is that this is a great science fiction drama for the whole family. I doubt it will be a long-term classic like X-Files, but in the meantime I suggest you take the DVD if you missed it like I did for the first time. This fall, my must-see shows have just increased in another series! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard that he was picked up by NBC ... I hope Sci-Fi picks it up.
