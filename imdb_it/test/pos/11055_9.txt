I would say that this film is disturbing. Brutality is depicted in a very sick way, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. The scenes are fierce, starting with the slaughter of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Every emotion is exploited to the extreme, the butcher's frustration, love for his almost incestuous daughter, anger when he discovers he has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. This film offers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. The message of the film is that one's life can change in a second as a result of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's acting. I had loved the unique way of filming, simplicity and brutality accompanied by the silence in which only inner thoughts run through.
