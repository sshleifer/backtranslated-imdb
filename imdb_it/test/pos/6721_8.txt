** and 1/2 stars on **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest films I've ever seen, so ridiculous, yet at the moment it's strangely compelling and never a little boring. Whether it is due to uninterrupted nudity, the vast amount of violence and action, everything is concentrated to create 2 hours of fun. <br /> <br /> The Churchill spaceshuttle was sent to investigate Halley's comet when it detects something hiding in the gigantic rock coma. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), was sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of creatures similar to frozen bats and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings in strange crystalline containers, two males and one female (Mathilda May). They decide to bring all three back, which results in a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> When London receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what is happening. When they dock with the Churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dried up without recognition. Humanoids are still in perfect condition and take them back to London. <br /> <br /> After various tests, scientists still don't know what these beings really are. Then, late at night, a security guard in the complex feels obliged to enter the room where the woman is. He touches her shoulder, and she wakes up, stands up and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked way. He approaches him and starts kissing him, when it becomes clear that he is actually taking his life force, sucking all his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy). <br /> <br /> Run away from the compound and start leaving a trail behind. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought to track him down. Then the men discover that there is a model for the life force process. The corpse of the security guard wakes up in 2 hours and takes the life force of a doctor. It appears in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to track down the girl before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a pretty good night entertainment. It has all the elements you can look for in a movie like that, lots of nudity, blood / blood and lots of special effects. This is certainly better than a film of a similar plot, Species, thanks in large part to a more thrilling ending. <br /> <br /> Performances range from decent to terrible. Doing the worst is easily Steve Railsback, who spills over to no end. Much better are Peter Firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the beautiful Mathilda May (she is as beautiful as the French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May practically plays the entire role without wearing clothes, and there have been testimonies that it was hard for her during filming, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without getting excited and looking uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when it can be quite terrifying, to be simply seductive. Most of the film manages to work because of it. <br /> <br />
