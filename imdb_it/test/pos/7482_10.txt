I was told this movie by a friend. I had never heard of it but thought it was Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it and discovered it wasn't Christopher Lampbert, it was Thomas Jane that this movie was great. I love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. The characters were all fantastic and the script was incredible. I really wish that Skip Woods would write and direct another film. In my book Thursday is the impeccable story of this guy trying to be his wife and son after a dark past, but then his old drug dealer shows up and gets pretty Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies and shows real potential in Thomas Jane. But this film is very rare but I found it in a couple of Hollywood videos on VHS. Then dust off the old VCR and blow up Thursday because it receives the seal of approval of Pee Wee
