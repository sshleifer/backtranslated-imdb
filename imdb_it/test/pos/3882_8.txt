In one of the first scenes, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking along a street in the Chicago neighborhood, admiring bucolic architecture, when a woman, with angry discussion in French on her cell phone, passes by them, pushing James to observation, "There is nothing warmer than an angry French woman." A few blocks later, they pass by an old Filipino woman, also angry, while arguing on a cell phone, and Luke underlines, referentially, "There is nothing warmer than an angry Filipino old woman. " <br /> <br /> The humor of I Want Wantone Cheese With by Jeff Garlin is best characterized by the word everyday. The film is a conversation. We could also be eavesdropping. Rather than making jokes, the film is based on defects of character and human curiosity to offer laughter. Although it is not innovative, it is far from trivial, and although James considers himself a bit of a jejune, we know that he is rather average, and this fascinates him. <br /> <br /> Self-improvement is the main theme of the film. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is excellent as a catalyst for change; she revitalizes James, and so reminds him of living a better life. Even so, realizing an idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but rather something simpler: that they can pick up what pieces of life they love, just to keep enough for themselves to keep going. <Br /> <br /> A film about life lessons can be exaggerated, as it may forget to connect with its audience. I want someone to eat cheese. Con is subtle and appealing, and while its morality may not inspire, it is still resonant. This is a low-key comedy, but it will stay with you.
