Epic early film, directed by D.W. Griffith. Mae Marsh, her little sister and their dogs are orphans - they have to go live with an uncle. On board their trainer is the young couple Lillian Gish and Robert Harron, who is celebrating the birth of their first child. The coach arrives at Elderbush Gluch. Marsh's uncle tells her he can't keep the dogs, and they're put out. There are Indians (Native Americans) nearby; and, Indians love to eat dog meat (don't you kidding?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is sympathetic to Mrs. Marsh, eager to help her recover the fleeing dogs. During the rescue of the puppies, an Indian is shot, resulting in a clash between "Cowboys and Indians". <br /> <br /> This "saga of the American West" is certainly an important film; however, the reliable Griffith performers begin to exaggerate their hands, and the story is too invented. Many of Griffith's elements are in place: some good and some bad. "The Battle of Elderbush Gluch" prefigures the next epic, "Birth of a nation". <br /> <br /> ******* The Battle of Elderbush Gulch (3/28/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
