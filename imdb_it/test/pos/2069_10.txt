I've seen every version of this drama I think about, including many on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most beautiful voice for theatrical acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions during this game. The way he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (like Hamlet) can in an instant be loving, sweet and kind and in another moment rage against the hell that is his life. You think you're suffering, you think he's angry, you think he's not a little crazy. You believe you're Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Obviously, some thanks obviously go to Shakespeare, :) but without an excellent actor to bring the words from the page on the stage, no matter how well written a play is. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you don't like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you do, you will come back with a new appreciation for Shakespeare. The shaded performance provided by Sir Derek will leave you breathless.
