How would you feel if you only had a few weeks left to live? This film helps you know through the eyes of a boy who is faced with that situation. It is said with sympathy and without too many emotions. Some might feel it slow - but I think that increases the realism of the film. Some might see it as a love story, but I think it's secondary to see his last days through his eyes. The loves of his life are part of the end of his life and give more impact. Low key and gentle, the film brings out the story as much as life. Without clich√©s and unexpected events set in the background. If you like your gently emotionally realistic films, this could be for you.
