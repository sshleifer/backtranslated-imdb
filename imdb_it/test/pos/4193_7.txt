The Beatles had just done "Magical Mystery Tour". There was a general feeling that performance, peace and drugs came together naturally. There was a movie subculture in Los Angeles that knew there was something. Nicholson was on many of these bands. <br /> <br /> Before seriously deciding to become an actor, before "Easy Rider", before "Pink Flamingos", before "Day for Night", there were several experiments on what to do about it. is the "Manuscript of Zaragoza". This is another. <br /> <br /> Jack writes. Sounds with circular narrative, self-referentiality, cinematographic reference, self-hate performance, pain of creation, all on the periphery of the safe kiddiepop. You have to see this, if only to know something about Jack. Some actors act by digging into themselves. It is a common technique. Some dig deep, but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly superficial people. There are not just enough things to support a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> The others are rather interesting people, who seem to become more interesting over time. When they dig in the barrel, they put things back because of the pain of the excavation. Think of Sean Penn and Jack. At the end of Jack's barrel, at the end of the thread he turns, as the basis of each character is this experimental and risky writer / director. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because it took risks. Watch when a tear is wiped from Annette's cheek by the director. It's a real boon for the whole Brando thing, something I've heard of Marlon. This is one of the richest moments in the history of Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br /> There is another reason to see it. The music in the film has a strong root in dance. The revolution in the film is often based on music. Entire cultures are thus wiped out. <br /> <br /> A gigantic unknown personality in inventing how now he dances billions is Toni Basil. He was influential in pop choreography like the Beatles were in music. He was already in his career when he was called to work on this. But this is one of his first appearances on the screen. You can see her work in everything and herself in the beautiful piece of "Daddy's Girl", on one of Nilsson's best songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa's cameo.) McCartney would refer to this scene in his TeeVee years later. <br /> <br /> A third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the film: a character called "Lady Pleasure" kisses each Monkey in a long continuous shot and then leaves withdrawn. It is credited as I. J. Jefferson but it is indeed Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's lover at the time and a member of LSD. Red hair, psychedelic demeanor. Beautiful. That scene says it all for me, about how Jack feels about boys. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 3 of 3: Worth watching.
