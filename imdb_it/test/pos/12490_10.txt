First of all there is a detective novel: "légitime défense" by Belgian Stanislas André Steeman whose "assassin habite au 21" Clouzot had already moved to the screen in 1942, with Pierre Fresnay and actress Suzy Delair herself. on Clouzot's adaptation for both films. The 1942 film was excellent, but the "detective" side was maintained, so why complain? As for "Quai des orfèvres", Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. having directed "le corbeau" and was blacklisted, he had much more to say than a simple whodunit.Steeman essentially complained about the poor detective ending, which I will not reveal, of course, but Clouzot focused on the social cartoons, the characters of his psychology characters, and they don't give a damn about the Agatha Christie puzzle. Doing so, he becomes the true predecessor of Claude Chabrol, who has always been closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock, who he admires a lot though. Suzy Delair has a great stage presence and you will love the song she really sings (she was also a singer) "avec son tralala". Bernard Blier gives, as always, a saving of gestures and words, and he really does it outside. Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing: the first, Dora, the photographer: he takes pictures of female models, and Clouzot, with subtle touches, reveals that she is a lesbian. Of course, the word is never spoken (how could it be in 1947?) The police chief (fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells her: "You and I, we're not lucky with women." The portrait of this policeman is very detailed: we learn many things about him, not necessary with the Delair / Blier plot: he is a widower, with a son who adores and who encounters academic difficulties, particularly in geometry. We all know the characters in depth. One of the most important programs of post-war French cinema.
