The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler brings with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while maintaining an efficient execution time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married couple of doctors. The public is immediately transported from a hut of a medical office to a luxurious suite in the most prestigious inn in the city. This development is essential to understand the position in which the doctors were thrown. History suggests from the introduction that these two people are generally happy to provide medical practice to those less fortunate. Cut off from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation (the personal doctor of the crowd), the viewer is called to experience this sudden change of events. The Nelson (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are forcibly employed by Gurney (Bogart) without objection. This stylized notion of organized crime, being too influential and powerful to overcome, has become a standard component in every gangster image. The only aspect of this film that raised some questions for me has ironized on the rhythm of the story and the speed with which it was told. I think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not completely examined. This paradox seems to be the result of personal taste, as I think the film experience can be improved through a rigorous character development. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that rapid action helps make the film's impact more dynamic. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (of ****)
