I saw this movie when it was released in theaters. It is certainly one to remember, I had forgotten the title until recently. A friend found it through online research. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is rather unusual for the suspense / horror genre of the time as it contains no blood. It's the variety of teenagers, but the boys are respectable in their own way. It's a nice old-fashioned movie with props and scenes that reflect the times. Our hero drives a motorcycle without a brain bucket, for example. <br /> <br /> As mentioned by previous reviewers, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some reel changes are a bit rough, but this does not detract from the plot. That being said, the colors are bright and the lighting is very good. <br /> <br /> Adam West plays a rather small part in this film as RayMar's son-in-law. His role as a helpless and indifferent husband is fortunately brief. <br /> <br /> The plot develops throughout the film. Unlike many horror movies of the time, One Dark Night is a great story of suspense that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of One Dark Night are what make it so memorable. RayMar's telekinetic abilities are used to open old tombs in the mausoleum, extract the coffins, open them and move the corpses. Attention has been given to great details in the final scenes. The rotting and worm-filled corpses seem quite real.
