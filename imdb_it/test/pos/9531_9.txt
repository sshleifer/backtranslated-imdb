The Railway Children was on TV again this weekend, and I had forgotten how beautiful it was. <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly, there is little narrative to scroll from one sequence to another. The charm and beauty of the film are such that this is really unimportant. <br /> <br /> I will not revisit the comments of others, except by adding my vote for the final scene on the platform as perhaps the most exciting scene in the history of British cinema: as a cynical old idiot who is in middle age rather too quickly, I also find that I can't even think of that moment without being struck by a serious case of "I've got something in my eyes." Actually, it's not just something in my eyes, but it also moves things inside of me, with that beautiful happy pain that we sometimes feel. <br /> <br /> And Jenny Agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this film, standing with one foot in childhood and one in young femininity, and bringing both of them quality to her portrait of a girl who has to grow too fast. <br /> <br /> Also a quick applause for Bernard Cribbins. Considered primarily a light actor, he has cleverly created a Perk of great humanity.
