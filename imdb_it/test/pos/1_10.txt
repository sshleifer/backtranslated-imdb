My boyfriend and I went to see The Guardian. I didn't want to see it before, but I really liked the film. It was definitely the best movie I've ever seen. They've portrayed USCG very well, really showed me what they do and I think they should be appreciated more. Not only did he teach, but it was a really good film. The film shows what they really do and how hard the work is. I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around. I would recommend this film to anyone to see. The ending broke my heart but I know why he did it. The plot was fantastic, I gave it 2 inches up. I cried that it was very exciting, I would have given a 20 if I could!
