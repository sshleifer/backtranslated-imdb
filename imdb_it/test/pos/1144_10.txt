I saw this movie at school and loved it. Based on a true story, this is a splendid masterpiece of a film. Seriously, I didn't find anything wrong with that. Another advantage is how it was shot. Set in Morocco in 1904, Wind and the Lion is full of images as agitated as the Great Raisuli on horseback in particular. The photography was impeccable, the editing was clear, the costumes were fantastic and the view was breathtaking. And I have to mention Jerry Goldsmith's music, it was phenomenal. I used this phrase very recently, but Goldsmith is not my favorite movie composer at all. Its soundtrack is so inspiring and exciting, it shows the true musical genius of man, and this gem of a soundtrack should be up there with Goldsmith's best scores with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. <br /> <br /> The action is exhilarating and the script is intelligent and sophisticated. The management is also sensitively managed. Even the performances were astounding, with Sean Connery, always the portrait of charisma and sweetness, as magnificent as the Great Raisuli, almost dominating the whole picture on its own. He is joined by an exuberant Candice Bergen, an astute John Huston and a captivating Brian Keith in one of his most sober shows. The story is fairly accurate, perhaps inconsistent in some areas, but with acting, music and images are so good that I take care of the past. 10/10 Bethany Cox
