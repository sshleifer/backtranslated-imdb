I first saw "Signs of Life" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written production set with extraordinary performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an old shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast that includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give their characters considerable clarity and substance. <br /> <br /> Management is subtle and effective. I've seen this movie several times over the years and would highly recommend it. A beautiful piece of cinema.
