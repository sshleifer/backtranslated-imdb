For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the techno bar <br /> <br /> is incredible. I will probably also follow her to my final death! The best vampire movie of all time, but with a twist. The fighting scenes are fantastic. Wesley Snipes shows an athleticism that you don't see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very credible as an ambitious new recruit who moves up the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great 9/10 hit. Where is Blade II?
