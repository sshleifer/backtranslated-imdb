I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> It is said that Clive Barker revitalized horror with Hellraiser but this is a film that has actually blocked his career in the cinema a little. What unfortunate thing happens because, like the inhabitants of Midian, this film seems to be misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Barker has created a crossover of basic genres in this story - it starts as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fairy tale regarding the inhumanity of man. Evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at best but when the characters are visually demonic like they are in this film it becomes almost impossible (splint the child!). The human uprising practically similar to that of Klan (pitchforks and holy anger!) At the conclusion of the film it becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what happened before. As a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy, this film can be rather evocative. Too bad for those who will not see the film from this point of view and will consider it as the fantastic indulgence of Barker brought too far. We have a real gem forgotten here and before the studio and Mr. Barker make themselves beautiful and spend some time on it - the better.
