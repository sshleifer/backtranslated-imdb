Few claim that animation master Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to possess this skill. <br /> <br /> (No. Too many are focused on John Lassiter's "incredible" ability to steal other films, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be praised as a genius ... but I digress.) Miyazaki us he gave films after film that deals with important mature issues (usually with an ecological theme) and has an intelligent script that even the most tired viewer, who normally despises every animated film, could fully enjoy if he had the chance. However, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will no doubt be among the public of these films - children. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I can't think of another director with this skill. Where else are you going to have a movie in which a three-year-old boy (my nephew Link) will sit still for the whole move, fascinated, a 7-year-old boy (my niece Amber) loving him all his own (and able to appreciate the " star "power" by Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a twelve year old (my nephew Aaron) whose review was "of course was good! All that Miyazaki-san does is good!", a 32-year-old animation fan brought to tears from the powerful direction and beautiful animations (er, I'd be), and a woman of 58 (my mother) able to connect with her mother's characters (and I bet even the older characters) and love the "sweetness" of the child characters. <br /> <br /> And that is what I respect most of Miyazaki-san, who seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average director.In appearance, "Ponyo" could be seen as a simple story on a small fish girl who has a taste of the human world and he wants to join him and the friend she makes there, a little boy calls So ske (a bit like "The Little Mermaid"), but here is a completely different level. True to its form, Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters. Ponyo's mother, Soske's mother, the old ladies in a nursing home are all real characters with their own and extremely strong mind. <br /> <br /> the girl who takes the cake is the same as Ponyo. Once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her will to make her dreams come true. His father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magic fish, but young Ponyo knows what he wants and becomes human simply because of his determination. <br /> <br /> Once human, he joins his friend Soske, who loves a lot (though maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at the age of five) when his mother Lisa decides to help the people in the nursing home where she works during a typhoon that was inadvertently caused by Ponyo in her quest to become human . Frankie Jonas (yes, he is related to the Jonas brothers, can we pass on this please?) He offers, perhaps, the best interpretation of the film as a young Soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also very strong-willed, but also very respectful and friendly - features that are not likely to be found in a child character on THIS shore of the Pacific. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and extensions, his wife's desire to let her be human. He hopes Ponyo and Soske "will remember him fondly". And once again, Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical "bad boy". Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his films magical and yet recognizable. No one in real life is completely a "bad person". All humans are various shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there's the animation itself. At a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects in this film, especially water, Miyazaki chose to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand-drawn animation was colored with digital media, but every film in this was hand-drawn and I, for example, was extremely grateful for it. The character's animation was extremely fluid, and there also seemed to be a lip-synching (rather unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with a colored pencil and had an effect all on the public. This is what the animation used to look like and what it should have looked like. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found Ponyo extremely pleasant. Surely it is not the best of Miyazaki (in my opinion, that honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but it is still a fun 10-star film for the FAMILY family.
