In the film, "The Hawk and the Snowman", when Christopher Boyce was projecting around the complex, the satellite in the background was the current Ryholite satellite that is now in space. TRW allowed internal shots. TRW has also made it possible to shoot both internal and external for one of the original Star Trek series. (The episode is one in which Spock goes blind when a series of satellite lights are activated to kill the aliens). Christopher escaped from prison (Lompock) and appeared in America's Most Wanted. He was drinking in a bar when the show aired. He said, "Hey, it's me." Needless to say, he was captured and transferred to a maximum security prison.
