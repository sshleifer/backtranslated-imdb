I'm very surprised that so many people don't like this movie. I think it's much better than most teen movies that have come out recently - Ten things I hate about you (can we say teeny bopper movies and what was with the principle of writing those porn novels?), Cruel Intentions (where character renounces virginity due to a fun car ride), and She's All That (mediocre). If you're looking for something that's just fun, I say go with Never Been Kissed. My mother loved it and hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a great fantasy about what you would do differently if you could go back to high school. People who have been marginalized in high schools will probably like this film better. It reminds me of "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion". And the ending puts me in the best mood. Of course, the plot was made, but how many recent films can you honestly say were not made in one form or another. The cast is also fascinating. And for those who think Drew can't be a genius - it just does great. Another good teenage comedy that I recommend recently is ELECTION but it is more a satire on school and politics.
