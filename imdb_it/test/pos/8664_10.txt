Den Brysomme Mannen is one of the best films of all time and talks about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth and certainly no freedom. A world in which people get scared when someone speaks their mind, expresses or shows affection, a world in which no one is free and no one has any idea what the meaning of this is. Just like the world we live in, the world of Den Brysomme Mannen is a world of lost souls that seek to realize themselves, but focus on the opposite of what satisfies them, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions. <br /> <br /> Den Brysomme Mannen deserves the utmost attention from every human soul, because we could all use a new call Wake Up.
