What Bergman got is "What if all those bad things happened here in Sweden, to nice people like us?" And what gives us, in Swedish language, with Swedish actors, in Swedish places (and using what appear to be authentic Swedish military vehicles) is what was familiar to war movies set in almost all other European countries: all that confuses invasions and counter-invasions, political lies, internment camps, fake confessions, summary executions, torture, rebels, "collaborators" and so on. As in a modern story, it is done in the abstract, without real names, cities or countries used. But the strongest faction is the "Nazis": they show off in importance, and some wear shiny knee-high boots. He even whips things with a crop riding (ok, it's actually a stick). The victim couple is called Rosenberg. Apart from the shame they feel about finding more dirty ways to survive - and who wouldn't do what they did? - What all the above suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to the de facto complicity of Stockholm with the Nazis. In fact, what we are shown is how Sweden would have been if Germany had asked for something more than mining concessions. <br /> <br /> The first half plays like a black comedy. We see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a comically passive couple ignoring the troops all around, the long convoys, the bombed buildings, the news, etc. They don't even bother to find a working radio. I'm the top in "Not in my backyard". They talk about wine and cranberries; meanwhile friends are mysteriously enlisted and an increasing number of troops show up in the city. They show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years. <br /> <br /> The man (Von Sydow) is cultured, sulky and an explorer of the navel; the woman (Ullman) is a little more impulsive, passionate and outward-looking. There is a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the producer, he says casually, fought in the Napoleonic wars, but his own interest stops with the cultural artifact in his hand ... or, more precisely, what are his warm feelings about owning it and the security that this property takes. Not in my yard! But when the war finally breaks into their bucolic idyll, the shyness of man, an irritation in the good times, becomes a responsibility, one that ends up over-compensating - as often happens - as Bergman subtly and beautifully demonstrates. Definitely worth seeing.
