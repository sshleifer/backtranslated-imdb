There is not much to say about this film ... the plot is quite simple: two policemen (who are also lovers) use a brothel as a reference point to capture a criminal, with the help of the "lady of the house" , played by hardcore porn star Chloe. As anyone can imagine, there are some twists and some blurry alliances, but the writing was simply horrible, even for a softcore movie. <br /> <br /> I read some previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent (she plays the female cop). Yes, it is difficult to understand what he sometimes says, but I think I have inserted it. I did some sniffing ... I think it's German, so its weird accent. It makes an impression even without speaking, however ... it has a very beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of sex scenes "from behind" in this film that were pretty graphic for a softcore movie. ... great job there. Even the threesome towards the end was not bad. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> I knew the cop would turn into a girl called part-time at the end. He enjoyed his three-way WAY too. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER END * <br /> <br /> I have no intention of exposing the story too much, as this is a low budget, soft-to direct-to-video flick. However, it seems that I have seen too many films of this genre with a similar type of plot. <br /> <br /> Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were okay as a wink) Sex: B + (the scenes were pretty short, but good) Story: C (a recycled storyline, but whatever works, huh? ) Overall: B-
