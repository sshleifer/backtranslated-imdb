(This review contains a huge spoiler, but I don't know how to explain how good it is without giving it away.) I saw "Pinoccio's Revenge" some time ago. <br /> <br /> Now, you may think it's just a rip-off of the children's game. Indeed there are similarities. <br /> <br /> However, Chucky was a possessed doll that works independently of the child. It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio is possessed by a demon or cursed or something. however, the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. The KID is crazy and THE KID is the one that kills people! Everyone, including the public, the survivors and the Kid himself thinks it's the doll. But it is the KID. <br /> <br /> Nudity is almost a sin, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it, because it's really an interesting horror movie.
