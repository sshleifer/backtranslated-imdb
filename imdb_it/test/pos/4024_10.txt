The portrait of Valeria di Barbora Bobulova in this story was entirely captivating and heartbreaking at the same time. It's been a long time since I saw so much hidden and mystical passion presented by any actor simply using his facial features and the use of his eyes and mouth as Barbora does with this character. It was completely credible given that Valeria and I were overwhelmed by her characterization of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the intelligent use of that limited dialogue left me spellbound. I was forced to read between the lines and each of the key characters used the art of body language and the emotional intent to convey a strong storyline. In particular, Barbora was visually stimulating in an almost sexless way and at the same time in a sexy way. This comment can easily relate to each of the many emotions reported by his performance. Understated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence. I was captured by this delivery of actresses and I will eagerly look for much more than his work.
