Rush in Rio is simply a fantastic DVD. This concert is one of the highlights of Rush's story and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to actually be in this concert, and not only that, I was in the front row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage !! It is the first and only time I saw a live Rush concert and it was a dream that came true for me. I have no words to accurately describe this experience, but I can tell you that it is one of the highlights of my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD saying it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you hear is real, true to how it was in the concert. It is raw, powerful and so authentic that every time I look at it I return and relive that beautiful moment. Many artists record live shows and then do a lot of tweaks, so the final product is far from what the real concert actually was. Of course, it is possible to get a very sophisticated and refined sound in this way, but you don't get the real thing. This is not the case with Rush in Rio, this is the real deal !! I admit I like those fantastic sounding concert DVDs, I love music and sound is very important, but it's nice to hear such an honest concert. Listen to Rush just like they play in a live performance, without tricks, without retouching. This is a real live concert DVD. I highly recommend Rush in Rio, the set-list is fantastic and the performances of Geddy, Alex and Neil are amazing. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing along with each song, even YYZ which is an instrument !! Actually I seem to sing twice; in Tom Sawyer I sing "always full of hope but unhappy" and in Earthshine I sing "just reflect". It's only a few seconds but I simply couldn't believe my eyes when I saw myself on a fast DVD !! Awesome!! I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert of the biggest band on Earth.
