Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: these are the two couples whose lives of dependency, crime and squalor are brilliantly captured in this crude and honest HBO documentary. They are in turn petulant, charming, repulsive, surprisingly stupid and addicted: to drugs and to each other. They are also very different from each other: Matt is a working class boy who clearly enjoys his wickedness, while the Tracy school dropout supports the couple with Western Union money from the father of his sack of money, which makes a surprisingly nice cameo near the end of the film. Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose husband died of an OD) earns her daily bread by pretending to be a NYPD deputy cop willing to cut off her would-be Johns to avoid prison time, and the sad sack companion Sebastian lives off the proceeds . You will be attracted to their stories and you will want the film to last twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this type, there is no queue to give us an update on their progress (can Matt and Tracy really keep that Brooklyn apartment?) Will Michelle return to Bellevue for more detox? And can Sebastian become more pathetic? As a result, the film seems incomplete, but it may have been the point. Essential visualization, as long as you are not completely opposed to the scenes of people approaching.
