It took me about a year after seeing this movie to write about it. The Lord knows that I wanted, after seeing him, I knew I had seen something I had never seen before, but I wasn't sure why. Now, after thinking about it for a while, I know, it's these characters that I still can't think of even now. <br /> <br /> Briefly and slowly, it tells the story of a relative (Yusuf) who comes from the coasts to live briefly with a wealthy photographer (Mahmut) in the city hoping to find a job. However it becomes clear that after Yusuf hypothesizes the idea of ​​being a sailor and his dark employment prospects, which is really looking for something else, a kind of purpose in his life. <br /> <br /> Throughout this quest for souls we are taken through seasonal environments that are exquisitely photographed. The context in which they occur makes the scenes more powerful in 2 details when a girl whom Yusuf has suddenly followed meets her significant other, and the expression on Yusuf's face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and the light that reflects his tortured face. That scene itself must be one of the most beautifully filmed pieces I've seen in I don't know for how long. <br /> <br /> In the end Mahmut has his own demons, but ends up facing his relative who is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of a real broken heart. <br /> <br /> What the viewer has left is a lot of thinking and meditating on these 2 people where everyone can see a piece of themselves. You should not be discouraged by the rhythm of this film, it is really worth every breathtaking second. <br /> <br /> Evaluation 10 out of 10.
