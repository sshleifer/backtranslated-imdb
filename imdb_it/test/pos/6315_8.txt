The consequences of love: there is really something special about this film, but it is very difficult to point the finger. It's a kind of love story, but not quite the one I saw before. He has several love themes that run throughout the film. One is love for a younger woman, a younger love for the older brother, love for the money mafias at all costs, these are just some who intertwine in a story that has guessed, or rather not knowing where and how it will end. The cast is all superb from Sophia, the unfortunate waitress, to the direct face of Titta, the protagonist of the film. With a simple but effective photographic work, it bounces on a continuously changing soundtrack that mixes the low-fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces. The style of the film changes beautifully using different styles without ever becoming cluttered. Love has never been as varied and powerful as the stories we are told towards various conclusions. The director has married old and new in a rich Italian classic.
