OK, maybe it's because I come from the north east of Scotland and I talk just like the guys in this movie, but I found this great fun. Fun to say the least safe, but many efforts have been made to make the film magnificent and the actors certainly give it all. Actually I was quite impressed when they died. Particularly when the Captain eventually fell. The script? Well, it's a 2-half game. The opening half of the film is well written and clear. The last half hour is not so great, with many questions left unanswered. This will no doubt bother others as it has bothered me. But anyway, have fun and a very smart first feature from Sturton.
