I don't usually comment on movies or TV shows, but I had to post a comment on Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Of course here in the UK we are about 2/3 to the 3rd season and although I managed to watch the last series of the third season (by other means) I am still glued every Friday at 9.00pm. <br /> <br /> Since the first episode of season 1 I've been a big fan of this show and all 3 seasons on DVD, yes, I can't wait for season 4 to start in October. <br /> <br /> So why I love this show so much, well, I have to agree with the last poster .... James Caan, I know a person can't form a team, but Big Ed Deline is was created for Caan or maybe it was the other way around, I read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Deline ... It's not possible !! ! I also agree that Caan's character is getting very soft, I also preferred the hard take no sh * t Big Bad Eddy D we saw in season 1 and 2, it seems to have softened. <br /> <br /> As I said that no one creates the team alone and, of course, the other cast members Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda all contribute well, even outside cast members like Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch, who can present 6 or 7 times during a season, as if they had been in every single episode from day one. <br /> <br /> This show has it all, drama, action, suspense, laughter, romance, pageantry, glamor and very successful celebrities who often play by themselves. <br /> <br /> Many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and I hope it will continue long after season 4.
