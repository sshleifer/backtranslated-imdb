I have always loved the Muppets. Although most entertainment for children was not so pleasant, the Muppet was. The Muppets are very, very funny. They are probably the characters of the nicest children ever. <br /> <br /> The Muppets don't just have their show. They also starred in many films. from the Christmas song of the Muppet to the Muppet's treasure island. Muppet's first film, The Muppet Movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent. <br /> <br /> The film Muppet tells how they were started. Kermit, the frog, lived in a swamp. Until one day a film executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit leaves for Hollywood. Along the way he meets many people like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the great and Miss Piggy. Furthermore, an evil man is trying to capture Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppet movies are extremely fun. I mean they are all very funny. This film has many cinematic appearances. Like Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. Muppet movies are all very funny. I heard that Jason Segel will play one soon. I can't wait to see it.
