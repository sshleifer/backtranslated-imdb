I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas, and it was completely turned on in the opening five minutes. Thank goodness for a film that ignores all the junk we often see in Australian films that seem to be around a) race b) genre and c) class, in favor of ... dare I say .... good cinema. The producer, a shy, somewhat eccentric boy named Alex Frayne presented his film, made with a group of his companions near the city that spent most of his childhood. Apparently he spent most of last year traveling the world with the film, especially in Europe. The world that the film creates is brilliant and artistic, not least because of a strange and disconcerting editing style, gothic characters and the surreal sense of time and place that attracts viewers into its nightmare realm. <br /> <br /> manufacturer returned for the Q + A after. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - "South Australia" replied. Feel feel! Another asked him what a "day in Alex's life" entailed. He replied that he is driving an old Ute, who is eating breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant where he has been eating well for the last 8 years! and that plays the plan that helps him think. He does not drink alcohol and plays cricket once a week. So the Q and A session stopped abruptly due to the next screening of the film - so my thoughts are that for the next festival, they need to extend the post-film sessions.
