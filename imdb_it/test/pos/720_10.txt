If you like riddles and suspense, you'll like this movie. To tell the truth, it was above all the part of Adrian Paul that made me take it in hand, I knew almost nothing about the film in advance. The plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a philosophy and metaphysics student, starts playing a mysterious puzzle game trying to understand "the reason" and get involved in the "game" by solving puzzles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, he is also a fan of the enigma and gets caught up in the game. The myth says that if the game is solved, the meaning of existence is revealed (referred to as "The Design"). Brendan Fehr's character is an "idiot village" type who wanders around the store and turns out to be more than it looks. All in all, I thought the film was pretty well done. And it is certainly an original concept, a rare discovery these days! I personally like riddles and puns, so even though most of them weren't very difficult, it was still a fun movie. It is worth the rental. <br /> <br /> So, if you haven't seen it, take it! :-D <br /> <br />
