I saw this film for the first time as a teenager (I'm now in my 40s) and for a long time I thought it was my favorite movie. The story is enormously moving, without being sentimental. The acting, especially of March and Loy, is uninterrupted. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not detract from the credibility of her love affair with Theresa Wright (which I think is the only main character in the film still alive). This may have become another post-war melodrama, but the script and cast are simply too good for this to happen.
