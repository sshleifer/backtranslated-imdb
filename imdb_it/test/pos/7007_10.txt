From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was captured. I had entered this film thinking it would be just another poor science fiction movie. Instead I found it very funny, on the edge of your seat, an action movie that stimulated thought. The film goes beyond your basic special effects shot. The actors are fantastic, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and other ..) because Fry is really a joy to watch on the screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you're dying just to hear him talk again. > <br /> The appearance of the film is breathtaking, the contrast between blue, yellow and orange due to the three different suns is surprising. Followed by the complete darkness of the night. I would really recommend any lover of the ALIEN or Radha Mitchell movies (which is why I went to see it) to take a look at this movie. I am sure that in the end you will look at the darkness in a completely new way.
