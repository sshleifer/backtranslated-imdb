Malcolm McDowell diagnoses Megan Gallagher's daughter and her as a form of illness, when they believe they see "The Huldre", troll-like creatures living with "rocks and roots" (to quote the film). > <br /> Basically a family moves into a bigger house, which has a small dollhouse in the back yard. The daughter (well played by Sofia Vassiliova) begins to make friends with the creatures, until they become vindictive. Even the family cat disappears. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes with Megan Gallagher ("Millennium") and Malcolm McDowell as a psychiatrist. There is also something strange that happened to one of McDowell's patients. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of story, you might also like "Bad Ronald", which had a similar strange theme, and the house is haunted by bad Ronald (Scott Jacoby) only the movie is 70's. 7/10.
