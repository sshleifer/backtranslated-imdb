I saw it for the first time in black and white, around Christmas in the early 1960s, when it was shown on British television. I was absolutely passionate and watched it again every time it was repeated on TV (maybe just two or three times, as it happens - if only we had video recorders then!). <br /> <br /> As outlined by other contributors, the plot describes the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper, after a time spent far away, in an American city of the 1940s. He discovers that not everything is as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the "plains" just outside the garden belonging to a singer-songwriter and his wife) are now threatened by "humans", who are trampling the fence that precedes the property, using it as a shortcut. <br /> <br /> Insect houses are flattened by their feet, and are often burned by cigars and matches. Old Mr. Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity's beloved childhood) are in grave danger of losing their Honey Shop for this threat. <br /> <br /> To compound their problems, sneaky 'C. Bagley Beetle property magnate has romantic designs on Honey Bee itself, and hopes, with the help of its henchmen Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito, to force Bumble to give him his hand in marriage. <br /> <br /> The heroic and fearless victory of Hoppity the day, and can you save the insect community from their vile fate, and in particular its precious treasure from his? Enjoy classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy Did not" is a superb example, fluctuating and optimistic) and colorful images, while the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Time has not blunted my fascination with this masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and I was very pleased to discover that it was released on video, even though I later discovered that it was in PAL NTSC format . No matter, I immediately sent the video and only then did I purchase a portable TV / video combination (complete with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> Since then I have enjoyed many nostalgic views and have even discovered that the TV rights have gone from the BBC (which informed me that they probably would never show the film on any of their stations) at FilmFour, which (finally!) showed it on their digital stations in early 2007. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (three years old) was absolutely enchanted while we watched her together - and this is a child that is been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer-generated productions! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this film for all ages, especially the younger ones. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a posthumous Oscar!
