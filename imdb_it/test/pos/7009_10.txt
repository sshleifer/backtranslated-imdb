I am 15 years old, usually not children whose age usually looks at these old classic movies. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. It's really nice if you think about the technology and the movies of the time, the music is fantastic, the plot is OK, the choreography is great, you have to see it. I don't know why there is a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classic love movies, they are much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and let you start dancing. The music is absolutely captivating and beautiful. I didn't see Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel), the prequel was supposed to play the original actors, that's what I hate prequels, they ruin the original. No one wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a movie - the original, the sequel and the 3rd is enough. Besides that, people won't bother watching it. Who remembers the film about St Benard Beethoven? I think there are 5 films in total.
