This is one of the best science fiction series. It involves character development, some really tense moments and scripts of reasonable episodes. As another commentator said here, it looked like it was a mini series, not a full-blown series with low fill and budget episodes. <br /> <br /> The problem with the show, which in short is a Godzilla series, started too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, so it all boils down to local Americans doing things. Then, the show ended too soon, as the Olympics were coming and hey! a science fiction show is a science fiction show, but half of the athletes running aimlessly are far more important. So they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22. The audience was also small, as people didn't understand it at 20:00. In the end the seeds did it. Trust a marketing plan to destroy everything that seems remotely original and promising. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: you have a show with good special effects, stuff like huge monsters that kill people or destroy boats, then go into genetic engineering, transforming people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. Furthermore, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people who are killed for their stupidity. The downside is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. No real ending, no closing, just a bitter taste of cloth in the mouth, as if he had swallowed a piece of dress.
