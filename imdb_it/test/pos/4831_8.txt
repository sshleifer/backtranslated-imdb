Wicked Little things was a really nice movie. In some parts I will say that it seemed really incredible, and others it seemed that there was not enough thought in the actions of the characters, but overall it was exciting and fun. I don't understand why the evaluation of this film is so low. I don't understand why all the charts in the Afterdark Horrorfest movie are so low. These are the people of B-Movies and nothing more. They offer great entertainment and most of them don't have many flaws. It is certainly worth it, because you will not be disappointed. Wicked Little Things is one of the best annual films of Afterdark Horrorfest, and compared to many other films in the series, this is one of the best ever.
