In a nutshell - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the beautiful single mother of three little kittens. When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which she will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass away. Edgar feels this and is deeply offended by the idea that cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy Duchess and her puppies; he drops sleeping pills into their dinner one evening and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, Duchess and her puppies make friends with a street stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who made the voice of the great bear Balloo in the jungle book); after making a move to the Duchess, unaware of being a single mother, O'Malley decides to escort them home, with Duchess falling in love with O'Malley as the usual family bond develops; chaos and chaos follow one another, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brothers cats from the streets and Edgar. It also features appearances of British geese, southern American hounds (what they were doing in France is someone who guesses), a mouse that sounds very similar to the rabbit in "Alice In Wonderland" (it was actually voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the slow pace, but still fun, has ventured into Disney. It contains the memorable music track "Everyone wants to be a cat" sung by the last Scatman Crothers (better known by the fans of the 80s as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if it had been done now, it would probably be an obscure social comment on the class division represented by the division between the well-nourished and well-fed Duchess and the way O'Malley was born.
