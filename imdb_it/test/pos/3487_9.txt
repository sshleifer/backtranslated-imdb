A highly suspicious mystery of the director of "The Antichrist" (1974), this begins with a brilliantly managed sequence involving a priest, a little girl and a broken doll. to kill her for her money. The plot, although not original, is really full of suspense, the acting is good and there are several skillful and bloody murders. The soundtrack by Francesco de Massi is quite effective, some of which can also be heard in "The New York Ripper" by Lucio Fulci (1982). Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!
