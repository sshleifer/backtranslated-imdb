De Gr√∏nne slagtere or The Green Butchers, as it is called in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers working for a popular butcher. They are fed up with the criticism of their bosses and decide to start their own business. Their shop is expensive and doesn't even have electricity everywhere. And to make matters worse, they have no customers (as their former boss predicted). When the man makes them visit in their shop, he challenges them to supply the meat for a dinner he organizes. <br /> <br /> Of a tragic accident. One of the butchers blocks the electrician in the freezing chamber when he closes the shop. The man dies and the neurotic of the two butchers decides to cut the fillets from the thigh of the electrician and serves him at dinner instead of calling the police. It's an incredible success. All at once every person in the village wants to taste that incredible "chicken". Overwhelmed by his sudden success, the butcher sees no choice but to kill more people, who can sell like chicken. I imagine that the cannibalism subject cannot be appreciated by everyone, especially not because it is shown with much humor. I liked it very much. It shows perfectly to what extent some people would go for some social acceptance and get out of their isolation. It may seem a bit far-fetched, but I'm sure you'd be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act. <br /> <br /> Next to the original subject, I was also happy with the actors shows and humor. There is nothing exaggerated, as one might expect in this type of film, it's all very sober and realistic (I think it's typical of Scandinavians and Scandinavian films). The same for humor. I'm sure I wouldn't have liked it as much as I did now if the humor was over the top, or with a lot of fart, vomit, ... as often seen in American movies. I loved this movie and gave it an 8/10.
