This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many scenes take place in the same set - in the apartment of Frances Austen (the character of Sandy Dennis). But the film develops in a disturbing climax. <br /> <br /> The characters create an atmosphere full of sexual tension and psychological tricks. It is very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. However, the audio style of the Altman brand is evident here and there. I think what really makes this movie work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis. He is certainly one of his most obscure characters, but he plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it is scary. Michael Burns does a good job as the "dumb" youth. The regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small part. The solemn and moody set fits the content of the story very well. In short, this film is a powerful study of solitude, sexual repression and despair. Be patient, immerse yourself in the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script. <br /> <br /> I praise Robert Altman. This is one of his many films that deals with unconventional and fascinating subjects. This film is disturbing, but it is sincere and it will certainly arouse a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to see an unusual movie - some might even say bizarre - it's worth doing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find it in video stores. You may need to buy it from the internet.
