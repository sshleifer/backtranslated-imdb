This is a very unusual film that starts with a rich guy getting a brand new sports car for graduation and decides to take him for a ride in the local city. The rich guy meets the poor girl in "Mabels Diner", who is a waitress and the local guy gets very angry and starts a fight. There is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the rich guy and the poor guy end up doing a community service as ordered by the city judge. The rich boy and the poor boy don't get along and the rich boy ends up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There are many walks in the woods and poetry is mentioned and some very profound thoughts on life. The poor girl says, "Some people go through life and never find love, I can say I found love and hold on to it." You will need some fabric if you are sensitive, there are a lot of romantic scenes and I doubt very much if you guess how this photo will end. The producer and director had a good idea and eventually ended a movie. If you like real stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, this is your movie.
