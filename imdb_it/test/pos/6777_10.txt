Many Americans are lazy and this has also occurred during our DVD viewing. Many of us do not like to take the time to read an hour and a half (or more) of subtitles, so we chose not to see many foreign films. A film that is TOTALLY worthy of your time, no matter how trivial the task of thinking that subtitle reading is, in any case, "The Green Butchers". It is by far the best foreign film I've ever seen and on top of many American films I've seen even recently. It is a complex situation told in an extraordinarily simple and amusing dialogue. The depth of the character derived in this film is INCREDIBLE. The way Svend and Eigel (sorry if they're wrong) feed each other, it's definitely spectacular! The actors were well expressed, and I very much hope that a sequel is under consideration ... he needs very little of Bjorne and what his face is ... give me only Svend and Eigel in a sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing! To the author of this beautiful script, I say: write more! The story itself is pretty distorted, but you'll find yourself cheering on the villain anyway ... without remorse. PLEASE check this movie!
