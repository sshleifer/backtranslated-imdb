It's a horror story, all right. But maybe not as you know it. The real monsters in this movie are human. While the monsters are human and prey. Strange as it may seem, I see it as "Monsters Inc" for horror movie fans. <br /> <br /> Of course, the effects are of a horror movie, the monsters are like in any monster-based movie, there's blood too, there's even a slasher in the shape of Dr Decker (played by David Cronenberg, I see Cillian Murphy's flash as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here - or is it the other way around?). And it's Decker & c who the bad guys are. Monsters primarily want to take care of their own business, pushing away the more or less misguided intrusive humans, wanting to join the company. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film you actually grow up like the little monsters (and the dog) - maybe that's not what you expected from the first scenes ....
