It is not difficult, after seeing this film, to see why post-silent Soviet cinema is held in so little critical esteem. Do not get me wrong. THE CRANES ARE VOLY is, at least for the first half, extremely entertaining, boasting a completely unexpected tactile lightness from its country of origin; a fresh, lively and spacious technique that ultimately irritates as much as it initially fascinates; two fantastic subjective piece sets; and a romantic verve with which Lelouch territory flirts, but never completely in ruins. It's just that, in its succession of vast social events, national and global, to a love story, it's not substantially different from a conventional Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, in an Soviet Union that emphasized the state above all else, and in an era (World War II) that suppressed individualism and freedom to support homicidal symbolism, this close-up of two attractive young lovers is a relief. And the thematic similarities - all of which consume love rented separately from the war - with two of the most wonderful films (SEVENTH HEAVEN, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) are also added to its potential amiability. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough. Boris, a young worker from a brilliant medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, lead a breezy night-time relationship, their only free time. Boris's cousin, Mark, a composer, also has his eyes on Veronika. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris secretly volunteers, displeased with his family and lover. He promises to write to Veronika, but he never does, thinking that maybe he didn't bother to see it, or maybe the mail is simply unreliable. Veronika's parents die during an air raid, and she moves in with Boris's family, helping the hospital where her father tends to injured soldiers. <br /> <br /> Afflicted by the silence of Boris, Veronika is also attacked by the attentions of Marco, who obtained an exemption from military service by corrupting a local official. In the end it is worn out and marries the disapproval of his adoptive family. Boris, meanwhile, is killed in action. Veronika, disgusted with herself and an adulterous Marco, refuses to believe it and waits for her return, encouraging a young orphan who bears his name. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the birds that the couple sees at the peak of their love, symbolic perhaps of its transcendent and epiphanic power. But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V-formation, and this form pervades the entire film, through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groupings of people, composition, camera angles, the name of the heroine - or by changing where the feet that walk south-west in one story are joined by feet that walk south-east into another. <br /> <br /> This serves to fatally trap lovers who have no control over their destiny, and also suggests the Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film. Although the couple seems to be free in space, literally in an unpopulated environment, or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironized, minimized, torn to pieces - by circumstances, by families, by crowds (see the brilliant, if taken for granted, sequences in which Veronika is swallowed up by tanks, or the couple cannot meet in a huge crowd), or simply from the structure of the film, which is constantly moving away, through paralellism, their proximity. Although at first, the lightness and brightness of the style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly interrupted by strange changes or angles of shooting distracting pieces of music. <br /> <br /> What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romanticism are obtained by abstracting rather than emphasizing historical forces. The entire film, but above all the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamlike, we are never shown its harsh, brutal topicality, only its effects on lovers. In reality, it turns into a majestic spectacle, devoid of bad Germans. <br /> <br /> On the home front, aerial bombardments create delightful light and shadow effects, or ruins of almost Gothic decay. In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than the indifference perceived by Boris. The empty and dreamlike Moscow initially distances lovers, compared to Veronika with her mother, but on foot they are less real places than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to impose himself on Veronika, the air raid is a less destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. This is a brilliant sequence, filmed with silences, expressionistic terror, in which the screen seems to explode with hysteria and violence, all the more compelling for the melancholy sweetness of the previous scenes. <br /> <br /> It is not very different to even the front, where the fighting on the honor of the girls are more urgent than the tactics, the Nazis or the desperation. The movement of Boris and his wounded companion in a final space is a further abstraction of the experience of war, its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and Boris' final pre-death flashback is an extraordinary blend of satisfaction of the desires of dreams and intense anxiety, in which what you want becomes threatening and grotesque. <br /> <br /> From this point on the film becomes a little less interesting, slightly more obvious. Another trick for the expressionist overload - Veronika's attempted suicide and her child rescue - is handled awkwardly; and his dark guilt casts a paralyzing shadow over the entire film. The use of deep focus, at first compelling, soon becomes wearable, devoid of any moral force or meaning that Welles led to its use in CITIZEN KANE. After what appears to be a cruel criticism of totalitarianism in favor of the individual, in the end it is cruelly betrayed, when individual suffering, as often in Russian art, is transformed into symbolic hope (that is, without sex, dehumanized). A shame.
