It would be nice if a discussion of this medium-length film began with a brief story about the hypocrisy of the Hollywood people. It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris saw this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a foolish remark stating that the senseless killing depicted in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than the murders that were filmed in his Hollywood films with him as a powerful action star. He was talking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who hits him. There is absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society. This is why Chuck Norris's statement appears as a cruel joke that defends violent means in a society that is becoming increasingly restless. An honest reviewer would not make a mistake if he claimed that Kieslowski's movie "Dekalog: Dekalog, Piec (# 1.5)" has universal connotations. This is because the events depicted in Dekalog 5 can happen anywhere in the world. The best lesson Kielowski offers us is about acceptable levels of violence in a just society. This is why the brutal killing of an innocent taxi driver can cause a feeling of repugnance in us. We would not feel the same hatred for murder when it appears in the films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme how they look too artificial. You can easily catch those special effects and modern studio techniques can only enchant the little ones, but it doesn't make sense for movie fans. Kieslowski also supports the impotence of human beings in freeing other human beings from the clutches of death and misery. This is particularly interesting as it has been shown that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent murder.
