Progeny speaks of a husband and wife who suffer loss of time while making love. Completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they are trying to get on with their lives. The hubby begins to question the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist. He comes to believe that the aliens are responsible for this time frame and that the unborn child he once thought was his and his wife actually belongs to the aliens. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, this is a great scifi / horror story. Taking a very questionable scenario of real life involving alien abductions and hybridization is a hallmark of this guy. I love all things related to aliens and this story has certainly brought good ideas. So if you also share an interest in extraterrestrial things, you should be happy with Progeny. At least as far as the plot is concerned. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film as a whole is rather average. With average acting of all the actors. Yes, even for the always fantastic Mr. Dourif, who continues to offer the best performance. Even if the black doctor offers his lines very well. There are some points in the movie where some of the deliveries are shivering or laugh worthy, which is fine in my book. I like cheese and it has a bit of a nice smelly cheese, and I say it in a good way. <br /> <br /> However, with a less than stellar script, you can't really blame all the actors. Above all, I wasn't interested in the hysteria of the mother for whom the film was going. He wanted a child so bad that he would have neglected and dismissed all his loving husband (who is a doctor !!) he said. She has almost reached a point where you really don't care what happened to her. <br /> <br /> The Progeny is another film by Brian Yuzna of the movie icky-sticky, Society. Again it offers some slimy effects, and again offers a truly unique horror story. If you like scifi / horror or you're a fan of Dourif or Yuzna movies, there's no real reason not to take a look at this movie if you get the chance. A generous 7 outta 10.
