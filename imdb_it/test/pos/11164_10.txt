I have just watched this movie and can only recommend watching it. It was about 90 minutes long and when it was over I felt like I could go on for hours. The stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you really feel at home. The film essentially consists of dialogues but I didn't get bored for a minute. 18 people of really different characters and each one plays so well. I had to laugh, I felt embarrassing, he was sad and I still felt happiness. All in all it is a film that shows the different types of people in our society, the way they communicate and how love has changed and nowadays it is managed as an economic thing. Dating becomes something that is similar to an audition. The whole audience loved it. So please see if there's a chance. You will like it!
