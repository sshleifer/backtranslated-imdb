I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. Photography is so elegant and beautiful, and history is not just your mediocre film about the mafia, in reality that plot is practically in the background. It is more the personal journey of a middle-aged man who is trapped in an existence that he was forced to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is superb, he excels this "quiet man". The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the niece of the Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family surname. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting your typical Italian movie where everyone is screaming at each other in big families, this is NOT your movie. There are no clich√©s in the media and it is certainly worth seeing.
