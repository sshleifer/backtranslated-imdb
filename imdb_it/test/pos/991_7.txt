Since Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry, I expected a film that was prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary, the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a liar and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course it could be argued that all these things are an advantage when someone is an artist and especially a poet because one of the aims of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality, but I don't know what a positive role model could be from such a bundle of personality traits. Anyway, I found the other male hero of the story, Captain Cillic, a more captivating character. The two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were truly fascinating, especially the first when he sang songs in thin clothes to inspire the Londoners bombed during World War II. Another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays in even relatively progressive environments that think secular conventions can easily be overcome. The atmosphere of the Blitz was also convincing as the description of the distinct perspectives among the people who lived through the war as opposed to those who talk about it theorize its possible political results. I think we can recommend a film like that.
