Battleship Potemkin is a masterpiece of celluloid. The management of <br /> <br /> Eisenstein is truly a spectacle. The film tells of a ship of dissatisfied sailors <br /> <br /> who are tired of being abused by their senior officers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the sailors have had enough of the abuse and send the <br /> <br /> packing of the officers. During this time, there was a shortage of stock <br /> films in the Soviet Union. The government wanted to send its message <br /> to the people, so they founded a National Film Company and one of the members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were shot on tiny budgets <br /> <br /> and the shortage of film titles forced Eisentein to be careful <br /> <br /> and selective with the filming he shot. In the end, Eisenstein had to <br /> <br /> re-use the footage to make a feature film. <br /> <br /> The most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the <br /> <br /> talked about massacre on the steps. This scene was forged in Bananas <br /> <br /> and more recently in The Untouchables by Brian De Palma. If you want to <br /> <br /> learn the cinema, I strongly recommend you to see the battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It is one of the essential elements. <br /> <br /> A +
