Being a Russian myself, it is sometimes difficult for me to get reference jokes about American TV personalities or celebrities. Apart from that, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest and politically incorrect show seen on earth. The dubbing is excellent and it seems clear enough for a non-English speaker like myself to understand. Even the animations are good, maybe even too good for a TV show. Here we have the equivalent of Adult Swim Channel, but nothing is simply comparable to this gem. Not even Simpson or South Park. I hope the creators will continue to entertain and have fun. I don't want to see the whole thing fall into mediocre entertainment.
