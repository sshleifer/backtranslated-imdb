What is the point of these messages if not to discuss and share thoughts on the next season ... Here is my prediction: 1. The hatch had really jumped, but somehow everyone inside survived. But see you on this. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation group that monitors the tracking device installed on Penny's Desmonds boat. Now that the magnetic shield around the island has been raised, the signal has been detected by the observation station and is about to send a rescue mission. 3. After the destruction of the door, the island is no longer isolated and other ships / airplanes will arrive 4. The others are finally sharing their secret with us poor observers <br /> <br /> actually confirmed that there will be 4 seasons of LOST? <br /> <br /> Cheers Mike
