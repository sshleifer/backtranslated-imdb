After many, many years I saw this beautiful love story, thinking about how I would react, half a century later, to a film that made so many girls cry and sigh at that moment, when I was just a male teenager trying to understand women's behavior in a small city in Brazil. <br /> <br /> This time, however, what caught my attention in the film was something very different, namely the insistence with which Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) clarified to journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) his ethically special condition of Eurasian. In fact, he constantly puts emphasis on this point in their relationship, repeating that he is willing to take his love for him and carry it on in a "Western way", provided that, by doing so, he is not betraying his Chinese side . . It seems to the viewer that Suyin is making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, as they will immediately open an open conflict in her mind to the slightest failure in her attempts to control them. <br /> <br /> So, does Suyin's attitude always leave poor Elliott ?? a determined, courageous and extremely practical man ?? anxious and perplexed, without knowing how much importance to give to his words. For him, whose love for her is simple and clear, the situation is totally clear: if we love each other, we make a couple and immediately start a life together. "Not so fast", is what it seems, verbally and non-verbally, to answer him all the time. <br /> <br /> Actually, the Chinese portion of Suyin would never allow such a level of pragmatism. And, while he continues to reinforce this very focused balance between those two worlds within himself, he often also tells him that a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in his mind, namely the continuous "incursions" on the real world by beings invisible from a spiritual or non-physical world. Per Suyin is always alerting Elliott about how dangerous life is, not because of any objective and concrete threat (as would be the perpetuation of English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but because of the threats of many cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor, frightened and vulnerable human beings. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it seems that a whole group of Chinese gods is constantly under control to make people's lives totally unhappy. For this reason, mothers must dress their precious male children with female clothes, so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away, to prevent them from covering the view of the moon; peasants are warned that they should shout loudly "Rice is bad! Rice is bad!" to protect their crops from being stolen by gods; and, in a funeral, it is recommended that the family of the dead be isolated from other people by means of tents, so that the gods do not take advantage of their pain and their fragility. <br /> <br /> In other words, Suyin introduces us into a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of evil and sadistic gods were always on the verge of interfering negatively with the most acts trivial in anyone's daily life. <br /> <br /> As the story takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China was really, at that time, almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which Elliott came was not yet dominated from the fierce capitalism that, launched by the United States after the first oil shock in 1973, took on the whole world. Therefore, at least in one respect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today. <br /> <br /> Much of history was born from those times. As for China, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country has finally reached, in the last two decades, the condition of a very aggressive economy, described much more correctly as state capitalism. And what happened to that old spirituality that so fascinated Suyin in Hong Kong, in 1949, and with which she used to impress so much a passionate Elliott, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? He's gone, completely gone! In short, if that story had taken place today, Elliott would not have considered it necessary to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and his entire family. In fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to each other, in their enormous pragmatism, speaking as usual!
