This year's Royal Rumble was not bad, but last year was much better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- SHAWN MICHAELS VS. EDGE Although this game took a little too long, it was still good. Edge wins after using the ropes to nail Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH - UNDERTAKER VS. HEIDENREICH IN A CASKET GAME Now I don't like Casket games, this game was boring and sloppy but in the end it took the pace with the Undertaker who nailed Tombstone and then pulled Heidenreich into the coffin for the win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH - JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. GREAT SHOW IN A TRIPLE-THREAT GAME FOR THE WOMEN CHAMPIONSHIP WWE It is not a bad triple threat game. Too bad JBL wins again to keep the title after nailing a Clothesline From Hell on Angle for the win. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH - RANDY ORTON VS. TRIPLE H FOR THE HEAVYWEIGHT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP Excellent match by these two men, the game was a bit sloppy but it was still good and it was beautiful towards the end. Although Orton lost the game it was fast and fantastic towards the end. HHH nails Pedigree on Orton for the win to keep his world title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH- ROYAL RUMBLE This was a beautiful Rumble Real {Each Royal Rumble is good}. After all 30 men entered, the last four superstars left in Rumble were Cena, Edge, Mysterio and Batista. Edge was able to launch Mysterio, then Batista & Cena broke Edge off together. Now it was up to Cena and Batista. First after reversing an F-U, Batista went to the Batista Bomb but suddenly both men crumbled outside at the same time. After a controversial decision, Mr. McMahon made his way into the ring to settle the matter. The match was resumed again when Batista and Cena fought, but Batista got the best of Cena, nailed a spine and threw Cena to win the 2005 Royal Rumble and go to Wrestlemania 21 to face the champion in the mainevent. 10/10 This was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year it would always be in first place among all the Royal Rumble in history. <br /> <br /> Overall: I will give it 8/10 and B +
