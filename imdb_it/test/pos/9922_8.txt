This is the standard rate for a director who has long been a favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> Although it's very flat compared to many of his other works, but his Silver and this could be prevented, but I'm going to give him a good review anyway. <br /> <br /> It contains many good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. Needles under the eyes. Bloody and disquieting death. And the clich√© flashback of Argento. <br /> <br /> The negative aspects include the heavy metal soundtrack, the acting and the ending. <br /> <br /> The whole film is made for the birds in the theater sequence next to the fine film. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie from Argento, but how he did better. Much better!
