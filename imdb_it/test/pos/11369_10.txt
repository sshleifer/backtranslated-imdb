This series has recently been brought to light and can be seen extracts, at least within Great Britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html Presumably there is some hope that the series may become more widely available. The problem is that this series was followed by THE WARS OF THE ROSES series that had a similar stellar cast and was available for cable TV, or at least crowding the market. <br /> <br /> The two series are quite different in dramaturgy; THE WARS consolidates the theatrical works through a wide rewriting and moving of the scenes; The age of the kings follows Shakespeare more closely. Both series benefit from integral fusion.
