It worked! Director Christian Duguay has created a very clever action / espionage thriller. Actors Donald Sutherland and, in particular, Aidan Quinn gave an exceptional performance. Too bad we couldn't see Aidan Quinn in other films like this until now. He was simply the best in the role of Ramirez / Carlos for what he should have deserved the Oscar. The photo was very beautiful. The scenes are fast from beginning to end and the story doesn't let you get bored. The film is too undervalued and I recommend it to anyone else or you will miss something big. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. That's why I give him 9/10.
