Later in the day, I was one of the RNs in emergency rooms, these skaters occasionally landed. They weren't treated well, and some of them were caused by their antisocial personalities, but we all knew they were a talented group of "wonderkids" even then. They deserved better care than those they received, I'm afraid. They had "attitude" to swords. <br /> <br /> I am so happy to have captured this documentary on IFC tonight, it will be back at one and I will be watching again! <br /> <br /> Little attention was given to them until the rich dying child was able to talk to his parents about draining the pool - and the film really emphasizes that as the starting point ... it was a fantastic moment, and deserved to be registered. All the praise is due to Stacy Peralta, and for a long time the Z-Boys will be able to appreciate their memories and their contribution to the true sport of skateboarding. As for the few "harsh grape" reviews contained here, there have always been and there will always be "wannabees" and brawlers who never do more than dream ... the Z-boys lived it, they breathed, it was so. <br /> <br /> Nice to see vintage movies and even the lonely girl, "Peggy", who has been described as the only female to win their respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to IFC I get to really make the occasional drug-free trip of my youth and relive the heart that beats excitement again.
