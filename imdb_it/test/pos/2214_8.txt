The Brighton has a traumatic drama within their family: 20-year-old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is delayed due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her for the accident . Seventeen-year-old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his train and railroad models. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for several rejected universities and teaches her poems to Emily. When Martha hears Emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to the English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes that Emily had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend, James (Fran Kranz), reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of the poems. But when Martha becomes aware, she finds the reality of Evie, triggering a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama about the needy of love and the complex guilty. The performances are stunning, and this is Lauren Ambrose's first work, from "Six Feet Under", which I see and she is fantastic. This independent film is an excellent choice for viewers looking for a refreshing story based on cast acting. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
