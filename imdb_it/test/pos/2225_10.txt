I'm having a lot of fun reading user comments while watching the movie! It seems this is the classic movie "Love it" or "Hate it". And I must say that not only are they on the side of "Love it", but I go on a limb to say that this is my FAVORITE film, NEVER! Thank goodness I found it in the first place. Almost impossible to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it on a UHF channel late at night. Of course, my appreciation for the sellers could make me a bit biased, but I can't see how anyone with a pale, dry sense of humor (like me), can't be in love with this movie. The plot is great (but perhaps as a previous poster said, perhaps the reason why it is not a widely known film ... disrupts the medical field?) The acting is great (I see why some might say that the acting was horrible. "But that's what made this movie so great ... it's total bad taste and humor is falling apart. I'm proud to say that I've seen this movie no less than 20 times and I've pretty much memorized every line. This movie is brilliant !!
