I was really starting to enjoy this show. It started slowly and was not given the chance it deserved. It's summer that so many people are not at home watching television. I know there are some talents and singing contests, but I like them like many others. believe it or not when the American idol is made for the year I miss it. Although this was not an American idol, I thought it had potential. I'm sorry for the show singers who really start growing with me. I would like them to reconsider and hang up the show. I think it was a hasty move to cancel. My only complaint about the show is that I didn't care much for the judges.
