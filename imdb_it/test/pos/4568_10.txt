I LOVE this movie .... one of my all-time favorites !!! This was the first movie on the big screen that my mom took me to see when I was 9 years old. I highly recommend it to all African Americans. This story is about love, trust, challenges and the daily life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I wish it was on video, but for now it's not available that I know of. I took it on television a few years ago and recorded it, so every time I want to see it ... I have it! Even the soundtrack is fantastic! Not to be missed!
