If I had seen the poster only for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after hearing a positive buzz, and knowing it was making noise in Cannes, I decided to try it. What I got is a really nice movie based on a very funny storyline. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as "nurse" Betty, a woman who is sent on a delirious psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by the comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film continually bounces between comedy, drama, romance and thriller. And yet, despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. I found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end, always waiting for the next turning point in history. The whole cast is strong, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the impressive and obscure "In the Company of Men") relied too much on many Hollywood conventions . The musical effects that created the moods that filled our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! And he did the old standard "let's take some of the minor characters and finally mate them in an illusionistic and illogical trick of love", to be absolutely certain that everyone returns home with a smile on their face. Why must directors and writers treat their audience like idiots ?? <br /> <br /> But the film is still too pleasant to be dragged far away from these annoying irritations. In a very bad year for movies, "Nurse Betty" is one of the most pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.
