I remember when this NBC mini series aired when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I'd take a look at some adaptations. I didn't expect much from a TV miniseries, but now I might have to check them again. This is really excellent and the best film version possible. The writer Simon Moore, who wrote the teleplay for the original Traffic mini-series, on which Soderberg's film is based, has developed a brilliant narrative conception that helps the story to flow very well: it frames Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks, with the real story beginning as Gulliver returns home first (everything happened on a trip). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, is kind of crazy looking when his wife, Mary Steenburgen, welcomes him back to his home. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor, James Fox, who designed on Steenburgen. At first Gulliver simply seems disturbed, but when he starts telling stories about tiny people, this is all proof that Fox needs to throw him into an asylum. All four of Gulliver's travels are related in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time this was done on the film). I love the way his current situation reflects his flashbacks. Gulliver's little son, whom he never met before, reminds him of Lilliputians. The doctors who observe him in his cell from a loft above him and remind him of the Brogdingnagians, and the scientific investigations of the doctors remind him of the crazy scientific experiments and theories of the Laputans and the professors of the Academy. Finally, when he is tried, he is reminded of the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The cast of this is surprising and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest flaw of the mini series is that the acting is really irregular. You all have these good actors, but the minor characters are often played by actors who were probably doing well in episodes of L.A. Law, but don't behave well in a costume drama. Ted Danson is not particularly good, even though he has some sequences in which he excels. It's probably better that he didn't try, but all the other characters in the film speak in an English accent. Steenburgen is pretty good at it, and it's pretty good overall. Another shortcoming of the series is that the adventures happen a little too quickly. It is not credible that Gulliver spent eight years away from home, as stated. But, in general, it captures Swift's tone and purpose very well, while, with its structure, it adds a new emotional level.
