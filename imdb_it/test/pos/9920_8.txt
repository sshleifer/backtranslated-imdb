The work opens with a close-up of a bird's evergreen eye and thus begins one of the most bizarre and amusing traits of Argento (my second favorite, in fact, behind Deep Red). Of course, sometimes, the film is quite absurd (the lack of real concern after the murders, the bird attack, the burned mannequin, which ends ??) but this is the fantastic world of Argento and once you've done it the accounts, you will find it works That I do not want to completely dismiss these defects, rather than the artistic talent of the film compensates them. For example, the above bird attack is completely over the top in theory, but look at the wonderful execution of it; crows flying in chaos, adding their furious shudder to the rock beat, the panicked crowd, seen through the viewfinder, the bird's-eye camera, and then the focused attack; air of terror indeed. Argento's extraordinary and fluent cinematography is on display at Opera, and clearly one of the highlights of the film. I also liked the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music, a nice contrast of music with each used effectively (rock starts with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very hectic feel). Even the sound effects deserve a nod, stabs, scissors, beaks and all. <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "I have seen many of your films. Yes, you really are an expert in this field. I would be very interested to hear your opinion." <br /> <br /> Marco: "I think it is not wise to use films as a guide to reality, are you not an inspector?" <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "It depends on what you mean by reality." <br /> <br /> Being that this is a thriller, fashionable murders are a must and Dario does not disappoint (the "bullet through the door" scene) is probably one of the biggest deaths ever fired, if you forgive the word pun). The black glove killer, with a deep and pulsating voice (cool shots!) Is cold and brutal, and having the pins in the eyes of our heroine so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch. All this said, like a mystery, that Opera has no mystery as it should. The killer is kept secret from the public quite well, but little effort has been made in the film to solve the murders. This, and the strange ending, could have used more work. Despite these problems, however, Opera still manages to be an interesting and satisfying horror film. <br /> <br /> One last note: it was nice to see a movie, for once, show the correct view through binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together)! Beautiful eye for detail, Dario!
