Imagine you were on a plane for 18 hours. You have been on a business trip to South Africa. You are a highly paid professional. You have lived in the United States for 20 years. You are thirty, you have a wife, a child and another baby on the way. One thing, even if you have a green card, you're still Egyptian. During the transit you are asked to come with 2 security guards, the next thing you know you are overwhelmed, hooded and chained and after a short (but still reasonably civil) interrogation you have to render! This is what happens to Anwar el Ibrahimi at the beginning of the film. His is a story of pain and (literally) torture. It's one of many stories. One follows his wife's attempts to get more information. One follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind surrender. Another story concerns the family of the man who leads the interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are also other stories and eventually they come together neatly. Although the most famous actors like Reese Witherspoon (like the desperate pregnant wife) Jake Gyllenhaal (like the CIA debutant forced to watch the interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (like the CIA star Corine Whitman) are really the actors more strangers who bring history and give him his heart. For me the actor who plays the unfortunate Mr. El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this film. His portrait of a man in distress was incredibly well done. It's almost like he's been tortured for real! Israeli actor Yigal Naor was also very impressive, as the party was worried about the family man and partly extremely cruel torture. Difficult to look at and not exactly fun, but still very useful.
