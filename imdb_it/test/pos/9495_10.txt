I loved this movie. He manages to make the characters funny (well, many of them) about the problems they have with their relationship. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty wedding with a husband who barely notices his presence (even though he notices her absence). The film shows very well why she is tired of married life and why she is susceptible to a swindler who speaks sweetly, without making herself selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction shots at the table for her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late at dinner) eats savory shallots and pushes the bride and groom dolls off her plate, they are perfect. <Br /> <br /> The show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - from Elliott Dexter as Jim, Leila's negligent husband. After losing Leila to another man, Jim literally cleans his act by removing his mustache, working to lose his middle age spread and dressing neatly. There are several shots of Jim at home, solitary and thinking of Leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of his old clothes in the closet. The film offers the public the advantage of observing Jim's transformation with Leila. It is not only the exterior that is more attractive; we learn a lot more about the kind of person Jim really is, and we see how completely different he is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines like the first and after Jim, who is determined, after discovering the true character of Schuyler, to recapture Leila, if possible. The most moving moment of the film comes when Jim and Leila discover they are under the mistletoe, and Jim talks about what he has lost. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth looking at.
