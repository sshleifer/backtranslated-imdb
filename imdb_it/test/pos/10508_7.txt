It would be so easy to reject a film about alien abductions before you even see it - like I did - but it's worth a look. If you think about it, it is not an easy topic to manage, but this film succeeds in suspending the disbelief that in itself is an undertaking for such a distant subject. Choosing the main character as a doctor was a sensible move that gives credit to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. Vosloo involves us in a very sensitive way in his pain and in his confusion due to the strange events that happen to him and his wife. The special effects are used sparingly but with shocking effects and sometimes the film is totally addictive, but unfortunately there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. Furthermore, after reaching a tense climax, the ending is a kind of disappointment. The supporting characters were needlessly weak (the alien hunter) or threatening (the psychiatrist) who also served to belittle. <br /> <br /> But all in all it raised some interesting questions among which there was an eloquent line "How to think animals feel when we experiment on them". <br /> <br /> The concept of "lost time" was also stimulating.
