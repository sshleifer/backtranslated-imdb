Goldie Hawn's depiction of a simple young woman taken in a love triangle with an old man, a dentist, played with so much pleasure by Walter Matthau, who won the Oscar for best supporting actress for 1969. <br /> <br /> the film, however, is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely, have we ever seen her in a play and she literally kicks here as a dedicated dentist nurse who is pushed into a scheme for Matthau to tell Hawn that they are married. <br /> <br /> such joy to see Matthau and Bergman fall in love with each other. Theirs is an accidental love story under construction. <br /> <br /> As a friend of Matthau, Jack Weston is as fabulous as his partner in the scheme. Rick Lenz gives broad support as Hawn's new boyfriend.
