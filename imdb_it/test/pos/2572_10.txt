I suppose this is what's called Southern Gothic. <br /> <br /> It features Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and even Justin Timberlake. Timberlake does a good job, to my surprise, I didn't expect it from him. <br /> <br /> When you get lost and can't find your way home - it's the groan of the black snake. <br /> <br /> The people in this film are permanently lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trust and love and are full of much pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician - whose wife messed with his brother and now left him for his brother, along with aborting a child he hoped to have with her. <br /> <br /> The character of Christina Ricci is a woman victim of sexual abuse as a young man - this has turned her into a self-destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to treat her badly. <br /> <br /> The story lies in the intersection of these two lives of characters. It is a love story, but not a sexual love story between them - the old black man and the young white woman. <br /> <br /> It is different from most Hollywood movies. <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> 10 stars
