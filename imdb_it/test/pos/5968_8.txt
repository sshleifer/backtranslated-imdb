During World War II, two Belarusian soldiers (Soviet Russians) try to avoid being captured by occupying the Nazis as they walk through the snow-covered terrain in search of food and safety. If you don't like "foreign" movies in black and white, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye" (retouched in English "The Ascent"). Director Larisa Shepitko travels the film extraordinarily well, despite being a largely introspective work. His untimely death in a car accident unfortunately made Ms. Shepitko's last film. <br /> <br /> After the opening mission has been declared, there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods, but Shepitko and a changing environment make it unexpectedly exciting. The protagonists Vladimir Gostyukhin (like the "Rybak" spiritually wounded) and Boris Plotnikov (like the physically wounded "Sotnikov") successfully avoid being crushed by the ever-increasing symbolism and their allegorical performances, under Shepitko's marked direction, provide a memorable provoking take on a family history. <br /> <br /> ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoli Solonitsyn
