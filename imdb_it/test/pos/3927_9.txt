I've never seen the original "House Of Wax", so I didn't really know what to expect when I went to preview the new movie. After a wobbly start by introducing our young characters, "House Of Wax" moves gears and becomes an extremely effective horror adventure. <br /> <br /> The plot doesn't really matter here - I think most people know this seeing this, these stuck kids will meet a nasty killer and find some horrible things in the wax house. It's about special effects here, and they're top notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with a lot of blood will be satisfied here, but there are also other grisly effects. Production design and set design are excellent, and the cast takes full advantage of their unwritten roles. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people are probably wondering what Paris Hilton's performance is like. To be honest, Hilton authorizes herself quite well, and she doesn't represent "herself", as many people predict. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work can change many people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good at passing from her previous film, the atrocious "The Girl Next Door". His character is very interpreted and Cuthbert turns out to be a gritty heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is nice to watch, but unfortunately he's not as convincing as the "bad guy" in the group. <br /> <br /> I foresee good things for "House Of Wax", while the audience at the screening I attended screamed, screamed and clapped my hands on many parts of the film. Congratulations to the cast and crew for a job well done. <br /> <br /> And a congress at Paris Hilton to prove that many people are wrong. As she always says: "It's hot".
