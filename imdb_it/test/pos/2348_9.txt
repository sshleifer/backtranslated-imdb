I liked this movie, Naruto's second feature. I liked it a little better on the snow, even though I found the story here a bit disjointed, since I wasn't sure where certain things should have happened or when. Still, like the first film, this one also lasts an hour and a half, a lot of time for a good, well-developed film with some really fantastic fights. The story begins with the village ninja hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants. Then he sells to Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru chasing a ferret for what they think will be an easy task. Soon they will find out otherwise why they are also being attacked and Naruto is separated from his friends after arguing with a strange young warrior dressed in armor. Both are injured and greeted by a caravan and immediately afterwards Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wants to create a utopia. Of course, not everything is as it seems and there are a lot of fights to go around. My favorite was the one that involves Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes it very lightly, which is a big mistake. The final fight is pretty good, also involving Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than anyone in the previous film.
