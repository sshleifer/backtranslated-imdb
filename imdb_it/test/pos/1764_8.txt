Like all older films, this "movie" is very, very short - it takes about a minute! Therefore, due to its brevity, it is not really possible to compare it with more modern films. But for the moment it is a truly remarkable film. Much of this is due to the fact that the prints were hand painted - making Annabelle appear red and other colors while doing her incredible dance. Actually I saw two different versions, one in which it is red and another in which it changes color. I think the red one depicted on the DVD "The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and very similar to a piece of extraordinary artistic performance. And, unlike other films of a minute (or less) of the day, this is one that I could see repeatedly - it's just visually compelling and strange. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it online, there is a 36 second version on Google Video (type "serpentine dance").
