i love this show I hate when it goes to the season finale, because it seems like it lasts until the current season !! I followed this show by his pilot and then from where the rusty college started and I see Casey, her sister, where she is dating Dana .. I love this show I can't wait until Monday night !! I'm so happy too that the caps and Casey are finally back together that was driving me crazy !!! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope they come back together that looks like the end. I just watched the main part of the cast and I'm SO STRANGER that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey Grammar !!! which surprises me so much and the other thing that is a huge SHOCKER is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born to my little brother's birth date with my year and I watched her all the time and no clue!!
