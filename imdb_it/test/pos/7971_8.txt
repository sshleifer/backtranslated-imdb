A tremendous action movie I've ever seen. It was the first expression I uttered after having watched it twice on local TV in my country, Indonesia. A combination of a constant shot and a great combative choreography, well done by David Bradley. He was good here besides "American Samurai". His skill in martial art was performed above average. He managed to make the fighting scenes pleasant to watch. Not just punches and kicks like the one most martial artists show in their films. David Bradley could use all the martial arts techniques like throwing, destroying and kicking. Very recommended for action fans. I tried searching for the DVD, but I still can't get it particularly in my city. Could anyone help me?
