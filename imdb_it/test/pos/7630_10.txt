Get ready to meet your Messiah - they call him Masten Thrust. Male role models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. On alternate days an apparent role model is forced to apologize in tears for a youthful indiscretion or innocently gets some young drunk on his ranch. The Last Dinosaur is the story of the last great fighter of Masten Thrust, an old grizzled game hunter who serves as the supreme model. Despite her distorted features and bulbous nose, females, including Joan Van Ark, are attracted to him like the Meatloaf for cheese texts. Thrust is openly sexist and does not apologize for his elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red scarf and a private jet with a working fireplace. <br /> <br /> Thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when ironically, after a rich and rich life, it really is the last dinosaur. Despite his propensity to scream at anyone in his presence, his employees and friends are steadfastly loyal to him. He could behave as if he were perpetually drunk, but make no mistake, if he calls you a 'Ding Dong' you are a 'Ding Dong'. <br /> <br /> There's no denying his ballad, Thrust's song without shame praises him and his manhood. A sample book includes: "Few men have ever done, what they did, or even dreamed of, what they dreamed / Few men have even tried, what they have experienced, most men have failed, where they prevailed / The world holds nothing new in store for him, and things that scare you and me, are just boring to him / Few men have ever lived, how he lived, or even walked, where he walked. "Even the artist banned by BMTG Clay Aiken could check these texts and become a soccer machine. <br /> <br /> Thrust and his crew of scientists bind to the 'Polar Borer' wearing mini bike helmets, although Thrust offers the luxury of the red scarf around The gigantic human drill fills the earth and ice for come out in a lagoon.The dinosaurs from the air and from the earth soon descend on the scientists forcing Thrust and the crew to escape to save their lives. , Masten lays down and makes a good laugh, not so much to celebrate them but to recognize "the game is in progress". Shortly thereafter, it is not surprising that there are some slightly hunched cavemen who sneak peek at their visitors. The push, not content to simply kill a dinosaur, then decides to make his mission to plunder a large cave. Throughout the film, the solitary T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a peanut-sized brain. Despite its enormous size, the local T-Rex is able to approach its victims practically without being noticed. With the element of surprise, T-Rex simply crushes a scientist or two and loots the campsite. Every now and then the Thrust is seen shouting at someone, shooting at something or flirting with a primitive J-Lo in a virile way. <br /> <br /> Thrust is like James Tiberius Kirk, not only in his addiction to love, but also when it comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time. The thrust and the remaining crew members build an extremely accurate catapult that launches a large boulder into the clever T-Rex's skull. After realizing that he too, Masten Thrust, cannot complete this addition to his trophy case, Thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric environment. The crew, always in decline, leaves Thrust to live his days with his lovable, though somewhat cavernous, and presents her to his personal collection of MST. This is just a brief synopsis of a movie so complicated and rich in BMTG tradition that it takes several visualizations to absorb its message and realize that Masten Thrust is the answer. The press conference, complete with screams, mumbling reporters and the introduction of the great Bunta, is a classic moment. He also looks for a body, similar to a dead Ricky Schroeder, lying on some registers, and the most powerful use of someone called "Ding-Dong" in the history of cinema.
