To answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked for the name of the US official mentioned in "Lumumba", the character's name is "Mr. Carlucci". Frank Carlucci was reported at that time as second secretary at the US embassy in Congo. Subsequently, among other tasks, he was appointed US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense and is now President of the Carlyle Group. Not surprisingly, Carlucci's biographical sketch on his website www.carlylegroup.com does not credit his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name had been deliberately censored by the HBO version of "Lumumba", he could have avoided the possibility of HBO being denounced in US courts. The name of Carlucci, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatrical version of "Lumumba" that I saw recently. In that case, I expect you to deny any involvement in Lumumba's murder. <br /> <br /> Others have commented on the seriousness with which the film "Lumumba" treats the interested parties: the supporters of Lumumba, other Congolese, even Belgian. In my opinion, a slightly more sinister vision emerges from the BBC documentary "Who Killed Lumumba?", Based on the book "The Murder of Lumumba" by the Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. If examined carefully, these films show that the fate of Lumumba and the history of the Congo is not just a matter of black and white. Only the murderers of Lumumba believe it.
