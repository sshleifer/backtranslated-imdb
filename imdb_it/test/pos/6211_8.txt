When I first saw Colleen Moore it was the excellent series of silent films entitled "Hollywood". Here it was in 1980, her hair moved in a provocative way as in the 1920s, a crisp, witty and charismatic elderly woman - the very definition of "presence". Then I saw his fabulous comedy silent in films like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine". Then the sadly gloomy talkie "The Scarlet Letter". And now here she is in "The Power and the Glory" giving an incredible power performance, working skillfully together with one of the best actors in talking cinema - Spencer Tracy. <br /> <br /> I found the film a little lackluster with regards to the plot, but Moore and Tracy offer such brilliant performances that the story doesn't seem to matter. Both actors age from youth to old age during the film - and this is mainly done by acting alone with minimal makeup and hair changes. Moore is almost unrecognizable as the old wife and the scene where she discovers that her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently represented scenes I've ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her the advantage, even on Tracy. Compare it to her delicious comic strip that plays in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and Tracy is struggling to propose her. Amazing! What this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that Hollywood lets this extraordinary actress slip through her fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.
