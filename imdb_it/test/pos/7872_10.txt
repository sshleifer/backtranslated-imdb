I saw this at Sundance one of the first years I attended the festival - it shocked me ... <br /> <br /> It passed too quickly and I never managed to find it again. I thought he would appear on a compilation somewhere, but still no joy. My memory is foggy about the details - I just remember being caught over and over again, and on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Who reads this has contacts? Online, DVD, VHS copy - I'll try to make it worthwhile ... <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've probably seen over 200 short films (used to living near Aspen where they have an incredible Shorts Fest in April ). This is definitely one of my favorites, and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Many thanks to anyone who has any suggestions on how to view it :)
