I had never heard of this Australian horror before the enthusiastic review by Michael Elliott; in fact, after reading it, I decided to check if the DVD was available at my local store and it was (even if in German, that is without the extra R1), so I decided to check the film immediately. <br /> <br /> Even if I didn't get that far to give it top marks ?? only a small number of titles get them from me, not to mention an obscure modern film? I must say that I was very impressed with BLACK WATER. Rather than looking back at previous crocodile films, such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it evokes the memory of two who saw a small group of people making a journey, getting lost and finding themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures that inhabit the place ?? namely LONG WEEKEND (1978), in turn an Australian production that is little known but impressive, and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> The compact and simply plotted film involves a couple and the younger sister of the woman who decides to go fishing in a remote and hostile part of Australian nature, known as the crocodile territory; very soon (in fact, before 15 minutes have passed!), is their boat upside down and the guide killed by an alligator ?? so our unfortunate adventurers take refuge in a tree. Does DVD Talk reviewer believe the film suffers from spending too much time in this unique location ?? with the three discussing what they should do, the attempts to recover the boat, look for a way out of the jungle through the trees (only to encounter nothing but water) and the occasional attack of the monster. However, I think that the producers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into nothing: this is due to the palpable suspense and, as Michael said, to the credibility of the characters (in particular the two women), but also to the fact that the crocodile here represents one of the scariest and most memorable of recent memory (I wonder how they managed to "perform")! <br /> <br /> Do I also agree with Mike that the film contains really effective moments of shock ?? the alligator leaping out of the water to bite the petrified heroes; his head suddenly emerges in front of the women while they are doing the boat; even if one of them reaches the vehicle, the monster can lift his enormous weight and get on the boat with her! towards the end, as the same girl manages to find a gun (on the mutilated body of their guide), she loads and is waiting for the alligator to appear, the latter creeps up from behind her (incidentally, the creature is granted with the shark's cunning in JAWS [1975]). With this in mind, the ending is equally pleasing to the crowd (even if on an obviously smaller scale) than that of Spielberg's classic blockbuster? even if it has a follow-up downbeat. Another strength is the poor score of the film ?? which in general is quite adorable, but is becoming unnerving at the right times. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, BLACK WATER emerges as a breath of fresh air in front of the demoralizing collapse in which horror cinema has recently fallen; for this reason alone, does it deserve greater exposure in order to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real need to resort to the make-up of a CLOVERFIELD [2008] to attract attention) ??
