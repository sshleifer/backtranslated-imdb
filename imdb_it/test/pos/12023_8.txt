Note: I tried not to give away important twists (or the ending), but if you are worried about this, please think about seeing the movie before reading further - Thanks! <br /> <br /> This was obviously a fairly high budget production, published by Paramount. The story follows the (presumably true) feats of Jack Shepard, a hiway man in 1700 in London. He was a blacksmith who was blackmailed into a life of crime by the evil "thief-murderer" to save his brother's life. After being traversed by the Thief-Taker, we turn into a sort of Robin Hood character and gain the support of ordinary people. He proceeds to escape from several prisons (including the infamous Newgate) and has time to "entertain" numerous noblewomen. <br /> <br /> I really liked the film, even if the plot was a bit predictable. The film was shot in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the sets were very well done and seemed realistic. I think Clavell captured the frenetic atmosphere of London in the 1700s quite well and I liked his creative use of camera angles. And, unlike many films depicting this period, Clavell does not punch us in showing us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived (in one scene several people argue over a meat pie that has rolled in the dirt of the street). <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and the underlying political commentary that Clavell's next film The Last Valley has (a parable of the Vietnam War), but still deserves a vision or two. It is regrettable that it was never (to my knowledge) published on video or DVD.
