Anyone who correctly identifies the opening images while God kills himself without reading the credits surely deserves a free ticket for a retirement home in Transylvania. I imagine this is a favorite movie to the "Twin Peaks" dark lodge on the night of the cinema, if time existed there. I thought a better title could have been: "How much can you have fun with someone who almost died in the forest with only Neolithic technology?" The answer, it would seem, is quite a bit. So, despite the stupid "God who kills himself", the uber-pretentiousness (an appropriate phrase taken from a previous letter), more clearly "Alistair Crowley - Hi, I'm the Beast, face it!" of Christian cosmology (I can't believe that another viewer had the stubbornness to see the Judeo-Christian Bible in this) ... despite everything ... this is a bold and important job that most people shouldn't see . I am both impressed and scared that it was created.
