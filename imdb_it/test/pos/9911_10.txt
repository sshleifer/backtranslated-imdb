This may not be the most exciting or incredible episode they have done, but I think it remains one of the most original episodes of Star Trek and the Sci-Fi genre. Most of the ideas in the science fiction series, especially Star Trek, have been reused several times, but this remains for the most part a triumph. This is one of the episodes that struck me most towards the end. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this episode is how it helped create such a fascinating and compelling story with so few special effects. Now, without criticizing the episode, I must admit that the effects are very dated, but then what can you expect from a 1967 television program? But the creature ("Horta") in this episode is basically just a carpet with colored rubber. Yet you forget about it after about 1 minute and start thinking about it just like it should be. Even the caves don't seem exactly rocks, but again you forget about them after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof of how good acting and a good story can make you ignore the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The acting of the main cast is exceptional as usual. This episode features Spock's second mental fusion series and is one of my favorites. So to say that Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene thief here, and his acting is excellent. Not that Kirk or Bones don't have their part of the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing in this. I like the fact that the episode is not about a specific character but evolves around the trio that handles an alien problem. Also, it's nice to see an episode that doesn't just happen on the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> Like most episodes of Star Trek, this episode tells us to have an open mind. I don't want to ruin the story, but it evolves around what at first seems like a typical monster story. He killed several humans and therefore must be killed. But is that really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation will not disappoint you in the end. This is still my favorite Star Trek TOS episode and I give it a 10/10.
