The first thing I noticed about this film was the success of it all. A quality film in the round. <br /> <br /> I suppose you could love this movie just for its action, but I liked it a lot more. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a more complete writing than most horror movies. I thought, at least the American version, it ended brilliantly, and it was fantastic. The story was honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent and narrow script that keeps the action moving, with believable characters in largely credible situations.
