Actually I thought that Black Snake Moan was a great movie set in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus, whose wife throws him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten by the roadside. Lazarus discovers that Rae is a drug addict and was abused as a child, so he decides to take the situation in hand by tying Rae with a chain to cure her of his wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have a great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and the search for redemption, Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed by Sam's ability to play an electric guitar and to be able to sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is as big as Lazarus Angela's love interest, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's boyfriend Ronnie, who is underutilized in the film, but does his best to offer an excellent performance.
