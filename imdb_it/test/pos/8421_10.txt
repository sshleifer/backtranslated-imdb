This is a film about a six-year-old boy from a village in Maharashtra (a state of India) and his grandfather who comes to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. here the grandfather discovers that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they must be removed to save the child's life. the film is about the main characters and their feelings and actions until the operation. <br /> <br /> The film is not a typical Indian film clich√©, so expect to see songs or romance or melodrama. this is an extremely elaborate sensitive film that uses silent expressions rather than top dialogues to get the result. witness the scene in which the grandfather is told of the need to remove the child's eyes. the acting is superb, the dialogues broken. your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and the mother about the operation. <br /> <br /> subject management was excellent. the film was made with great difficulty by the director Sandeep Sawant who had to beat many doors to collect the Rs. six million (about $ 130,000) in budget. even then the final product looks shiny and has decent production values. also witness the contrast of the thin town village shown by the director incorporating some random blows of the boy's life in the village. It seems that Sawant prefers village life. <br /> <br /> Everyone's interpretation is excellent. Amruta Subhash as a social worker is competent adding the necessary human touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as the doctor is great, showing a doctor's perfect mannerisms. Ashwin Chitale as the child is natural. he doesn't seem to act. everything about him is natural and does not seem forced. <br /> <br /> But above all, Arun Nalawade is as towering as his grandfather. he is stunning in his role. simple words cannot describe his work. it's a show to love forever. <br /> <br /> Shwaas is a sincere effort to make good cinema. it should not be ignored just because it shows that if things are kept simple, the results can be really surprising. 10/10.
