In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I have heard that "the Greeks do not get no freek". It's right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" in the final scenes. Really a full movie, but with lots of laughs and puns, gag sight and slapstick. Mrs. Woo-Woo's quarters recalled some places I visited by myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other things that is really surprising. He looks very different in the film we're talking about, but his maturity didn't hurt her a bit. Mark Blankfield somehow recalls Gene Wilder. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and kept her beauty for a long time.
