He also has numerous cameos by actors such as Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second part, the story was also pretty good. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner film, and almost made it dramatic. He takes the drug situation in the United States and instead of giving it a comedy face like in "Half Baked" he has a true image of life lesson as "Traffic". So watch this movie, if you are an addict it will give you an idea of ​​something you love, if you don't use drugs it will give you a more realistic view of the drug than both sides want to see.
