He gave life to Philip Larkin in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time, and not just of those that are measured by popularity. He shows a clear portrait of Larkin's life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his time - which is exactly how he wanted it, as well as his disdain for cancers and medallions. He dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of Philips's observations on our relationship with our own mortality, and puts it in a way that seems to have lost even the great philosophers. for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life, love and death this is a must.
