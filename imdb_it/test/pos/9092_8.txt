I am going to write a review of this film for a while, but only now have I managed to put my thoughts into reading others. <br /> <br /> I have never had the pleasure of seeing it on the 'big screen' film which is a pity, as it is often visually stunning, but I have revisited it many times over the years, enjoying it immensely whenever. Surely it is in my personal list of favorite movies, and what's more, with Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my "actors to watch". <br /> <br /> Perhaps I appreciate this film so much because it appeals to my somewhat disconcerting taste in entertainment. I like my films a little off-center, unpredictable and fresh. And whether or not you believe the plot of the movie, you have to admit it, it's different! <br /> <br /> Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some of the film's negative reviews is that viewers have never seen beyond the superficial level of this film. They were involved in technicalities, "Why would there be green lighting in a subway?" or "Why would medical students do such a stupid stunt?" and I could not see the art and psychological depth of the piece. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that make no logical sense, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief just a little, this can be a very engaging movie. <br /> <br /> First, a note on the artistic quality of the film. Some complained about the murky lighting and illogical nature of the sets - but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, plastic sets and drapes, unusual settings in old buildings and damp and dripping tunnels, the use of the statuary, rain and billowing curtains - everything adds a poetic touch to this film, a bewitching beauty that adapts to the dark nature of the questions asked about life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus on just two examples; in an alley scene, a change in lighting allows certain elements of the set to come dramatically into focus, only to vanish once the lighting returns to normal. It is an innovative means of transmitting a shift in the "reality" of the moment and works beautifully. We also have the opportunity to see the interior of the character's apartments - contrasting the warm wood, the bright colors, the golden lighting and the confused comfort of Labraccio's rooms with Nelson's empty white. Both are reflective of the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of "objects" reflects our lack of knowledge of his past. and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions away. His past, we come to learn, is one of chaos and conflict. He decided to leave it behind in favor of a non-trivial void. unfortunately, the void also reflects his relationships with others, a realization that he reaches in his personal journey of self-discovery in this film. Flatliner is not the typical horror movie. Nor is it a typical drama or suspense film. It is rather more than a fusion of all, with the best elements of all genres woven into a complex and suspenseful plot. <br /> <br /> This is an ensemble piece, and the cast does a great job of breathing life into their individual characters. Your immediate impression is that the characters each represent a well-defined stereotype: the female ice queen, the neurotic "doctor", the socially conscious playboy and the "good boy" etc. However, as the film progresses and the characters are further enriched, they take on multiple dimensions and depths. <br /> <br /> The most interesting of all is the character of Nelson of Sutherland. Nelson is not an easy character to love - in fact he is a bit of a bard, a master manipulator who definitely places personal interest above all else. Still, Sutherland interprets it with a hint of insecurity that gives it a certain charm. As the events develop, you realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask behind which a very uncertain and vulnerable young man hides, burdened with a terrible secret. <br /> <br /> Revealing fragments of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film, writers, directors and cast gradually lead you towards greater understanding and sympathy for him. The character who started as a "jerk" becomes important and valued in his full right - as he learns to "forgive" his previous behavior in light of new information. Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the journeys of the characters towards self-understanding, since they too realize that everyone has value and "everything that matters". <br /> <br /> Which leads to my final comment. Although many of the posters here have taken up the theme of challenging death .. few seem to have touched on what I see as the main premise of the film - the importance of forgiveness and the need to be aware of everything you do, because "it matters ". <br /> <br />
