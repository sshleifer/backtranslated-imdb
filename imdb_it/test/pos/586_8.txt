A delight from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> If you don't like the Muppets, then I just have to feel sorry for you. This exceptional film does not just collect the popularity of the Muppets: it is a well-conceived and well-written film. He has great songs and has that melancholy melancholy that was always present in the creations of Jim Henson and that is more personified in the character of Kermit the Frog. I have always responded to this as a child, and that is what makes the Muppets still pleasant to me as an adult when other material for children makes me mad. <br /> <br /> A cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film look like a children's version of "Around the World in 80 Days", except it's about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Vote: A
