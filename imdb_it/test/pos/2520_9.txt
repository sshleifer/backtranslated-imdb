A direct X file that shows that the action is always equal to intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is sharp and clear, the episode seems just as fresh now as it was almost a decade ago. Both David and Gillian perform very well and both seem to savor the lack of baggage - it's an autonomous X file that even non-fans could happen and have fun. Junior Brown gives both players a run for their money during his scene with them, it's so convincing that you can believe that the crew arrived in the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they arrived at. Bryan Cranston is as intense and energetic as Patrick Crump, then admitted in interviews that he knew almost nothing about the X Files preceding this role, a fact that makes his hit-the-floor performance even more incredible. A brilliantly stupid episode.
