I had the chance to see this film in a first screening on Brea and since then I've been crazy about it. The film is based on the twelfth night of Shakespeare I read, loved and seen on stage a few times, so I certainly appreciated the references. But if you like Shakespeare or not, it doesn't matter - the movie is on. He's super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious, as is David Cross. Actually the whole cast is fantastic - I happen to be a big David Cross fan. The cast is hot and the soundtrack by a lot of nice bands and some I've never heard before, but I know they have a CD coming out so I'll definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from beginning to end - all age groups. !!!!
