I saw this film on TV in the UK about 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest was recently rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island from "Yamacraw" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent "Water is Wide". With the advantage of knowledge, I have re-evaluated Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with a certain accuracy: a Hollywood rarity. <br /> <br /> Three things still strike me in this story: 1. The questions of educating the poor and disinherited and being inclusive remain the same. 2. Education is more than reading and writing. 3 .. These guys were my age, I was 6 in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent his year in Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why hasn't this been released on DVD yet?
