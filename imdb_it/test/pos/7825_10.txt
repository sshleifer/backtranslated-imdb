It is typical of people who complain about something when they do nothing about it ... So it is a homosexual who falls in love with a heterosexual woman. First of all ... This is a true story, so you can't say that it's not credible According to his writing by a gay man, then everything about this being against gays is simply stupid. Personally, I think this was the best love story I've ever seen. And I'm very pro gay. I think this shows that true love is about personality, not just the look and sex. And it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or different from so many other shows. Maybe we in Europe think about it more, most TVs here are a little deeper and make you think more about American TV ... Also we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things. <br /> <br /> If you want something fun with one of the best Englands (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a credible and decent love story without too much weakness for you. I know I love it
