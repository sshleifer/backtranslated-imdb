"Here On Earth" is a surprising and romantic fable about Samantha who has both boy problems and health problems. While his love for his current boyfriend, Jasper, vanishes, his love for Kelley blossoms like a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this film very touching, very warm, very romantic and touching. I loved every single piece of this movie ... and it's pretty rare! I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is a movie not to be missed !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you are a very sentimental person who cries easily while watching movies, BRING FABRICS !!! On the other hand, it was a really good movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
