This film moved me to 39 years in the same way that all of the Dogtown footage and coverage hit me when I was 13. For all those who have criticized the self-promotion of the interviewed Z guys, they have the last laugh about you. This was their real deal, "we are better than all of you and that's why .... (insert footage of the smoother sculpting pool imaginable)" This was a movie to tell their story and that was their story, which you like it or not. It was THEIR opinion of their skating that counted ... not yours or mine. I thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as I remembered it in the 1970s. The reality is that they have revolutionized skateboarding, they have been the impetus of extreme sports and have injected a cultural paradigm that has reached every corner of the American. This film gave a renaissance to the images of Bertleman on a wave and Alva and Jay Adams who tore the coping that was the California dream to a whole culture of young American teenagers who just wanted to have fun and have fun! As I watched this movie I realized that these were the images I lived with every day until I was old enough to go and go back to So Cal after my family moved to Nor Cal when I was five. Until I was able to go back, my friends and I built and beat one ramp after another, searched every empty pool and imitated all that Stecyk covered of these guys. We are all polite and we have family and careers now, but this film reminds me of who I was at that age and why I keep surfing. This is an inspired film that anyone with an interest in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70s or even just a good documentary production, will enjoy it altogether. Whenever it arrives by cable I can't change channels. Congratulations to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful work of art!
