And a perfect movie to watch during the Christmas holidays, as the winter / Christmas atmosphere created by Burton for Gotham City is definitely cool. It is strange that Warner has decided to publish it as a summer film. It is not suitable. <br /> <br /> But what is even more strange, considering the content of this film, is that it was intended for families. A middle-class family throws the mutant child into the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dresses in leather like a flying rodent, a lone secretary dresses in leather like a feline and a maniac for the political office. And S & M and bondage are presented in a very perverse way. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this film is at its best. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic book character. True, the animated series was the closest to the original material, but compared to Batman Forever and the no longer renamable, Batman Returns is the best of the four. <br /> <br /> Dark and more violent than the first film, the sense of gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was very fond of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (I didn't even start with George Clooney!), He showed the right balance between weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is as fantastic as Catwoman (much sexier and more "realistic" as a kitten), she wears that leather dress better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was as convincing as the penguin that his scenes were disturbing to watch. And Christopher Walken is as brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek, he's nothing but a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is even better than the first time the round was. His powerful and engaging themes are definitely better than the slag that followed in Schumacher's next 2 films. This film is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and follow the animated series after this. We hope that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale can bring some integrity back to the live action of Batman with their film next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first DVDs ever released by Warner (almost 7 years ago! !!) and consequently there are no functions and the case is a snapper. Pick it up as cheap as I did and hope for an SE in the future.
