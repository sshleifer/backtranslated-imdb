This was a romantic, simple and fun movie. I liked it a lot and I would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it, Will Smith was fun, smoky, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy who was struck by Love. It was nice to see him fall in love with someone and be so nervous and lost about what to do or say. It was great. It was great, fun as usual. Eva Mendes was better than I expected it to be, I thought there were moments in the movie where Will took the stick, he was doing everything that could be a good guy and still treated badly. The ending was romantic and happy and it was great. I've seen it several times and would look at it again. A funny movie, a movie, something you don't see much anymore. He had the feeling of the old time with a new look.
