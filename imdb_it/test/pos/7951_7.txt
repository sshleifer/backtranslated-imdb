I watched this movie with great expectations but I was a little disappointed. Although I like this movie and have been absorbed in the story, I didn't find it touching and I think the ending falls to nothing. <br /> <br /> The story consists of a friendship between a man who runs a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic cop. The location is a quaint Korean village. <br /> <br /> This film is somewhat realistic because there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. However in the end I was not touched by a film that portrays a man who is so loved by a woman, but does not even give her the chance to enter his life. In my mind he is a sweet, noble loser. <br /> <br /> Positive aspects - Excellent acting by the two main protagonists, a pleasant snapshot of village life <br /> <br /> Cons - Flat end <br /> <br /> Overall - Good but I prefer films before dawn and after sunset (or is before sunset and after dawn)
