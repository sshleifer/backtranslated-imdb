This interesting film noir presents three excellent performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly exceptional. Unfortunately, Demming is not as good as a detective. He lacks the intelligence, strength and cynical vision of the world of a Bogart. If Humphrey had played this part, we could have had a classic. <br /> <br /> Peace, location (a library) and the atmosphere are all good. But there are some holes in the plot. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless (Nazi) organization he represents. And yet, after he accidentally killed Blackmer, Sanders seems to have no anxiety or remorse. Sanders then kidnaps the library and its occupants using the trick that he and his men are investigators investigating the murder. However, Sanders' assassin later tries to kill Demming by shooting him (without a silencer), although it could have been expected that many other detainees would hear, and be alarmed, about the noise. Finally, Sanders' assassin tries to kill Roberts, who discovered the truth, but when he faints, he inexplicably does not. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me most, however, is that the possibility of a grand and unexpected conclusion has been wasted. Throughout the film, Patrick is interpreted as an intelligent sociopath, hard as a nail who fears nothing. Yet in the end, he escapes the panic of the last surviving Nazi, a brutal thug. When the cops find him, he killed her. And she ends up being just another weak, stereotypical victim. What should have happened is this: the cops find the Nazi thug, but he is dead. He cleverly killed him, and then vanished - to continue his bad ways.
