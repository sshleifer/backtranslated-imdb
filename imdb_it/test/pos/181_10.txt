While Boris (Aleksey Batalov) leaves to fight in the war against the Germans for his Mother Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries his conniving cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) in a moment of weakness shortly after his parents are were killed in the air raid on Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals, Veronika will wait for words or letters from Boris, no matter how long it takes, with the hope that it will come back to her. <br /> <br /> Powerful piece of film simply boasts an incredible photographic work by cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many beautifully framed moving shots include the scene where the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones who greet each other as he rushes through the crowd of bodies to say goodbye to Boris ... and doesn't quite reach him even while we watch Boris looking impatiently at the swarm without luck. The sequence after the air raid in which Veronika climbs the standing stairs that circulate on the destroyed building that once called home and the scene where Mark makes his lusty move on Veronika while another aerial bombardment continues just outside the building while the wind rustles the curtains and the flashes of light emanating inside are just two of the MANY examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius in framing images that will last forever on the film. But, without the power and the tragedy of history on how war can always shape the destiny of a deeply loving couple, this film could not stand the beauty of vision alone. Together, however, we remain with an incredible film ... an obsessive masterpiece from the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed his last breath. I feel honored to have seen such a beautiful film.
