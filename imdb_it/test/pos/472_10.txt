They are a nightmare for film directors ... especially for the mega buck and multiplex variety. Although I am not an art student, I still have a high threshold to suspend disbelief and buy the director's vision, if I can find it. That's why a gem like 'You Are Alone' is such an exciting discovery. Intimacy and rhythm attracted me and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage carefully interpret the nuances and the director Gorman Bechard shows a skillful hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people. <br /> <br /> Spoiler under <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD version and shared it with several people. The reactions were varied, from disbelief in Daphne's ability to complete the task for which Buddy paid her to the inability to watch the entire movie because it was too real and emotionally devastating. As a compulsively skeptical spectator, I must be grabbed by the collars and transported for the journey, or approached and seduced by the director. This film took the next path for me and in the end I was so involved that I felt Daphne's horror and pain in her role in Buddy's disappearance. My reaction to this film reminded me of Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, the Thief, the Wife, and His Lover" many, many years ago. In the end I was fascinated, rejected and absolutely unable to take my eyes off that movie. I have seen this film several times and I really appreciate the eye and ear that the director has shown. I'm familiar with other works he has done including a couple of cheeky movies, 'Galactic Gigolo' and 'Attack of the Killer Bimbos' and a jumble 'The Kiss' that I recently learned was killed in the crib by the producer and actually does not represent the director's vision. Too bad, because I loved the previous two films and I also found "The Kiss" interesting but I hope "The Kiss" was available in a director's cut with all the original vision and intact music. I look forward to the future work of this interesting director and the protagonists Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
