This is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts from films from the late sixties and early seventies that were a countermove to the great Studio Films of the late sixties. Directed by Ted Demme, it is obviously a labor of love for the films of the period, but it gives little importance to the masterpieces of the times. <br /> <br /> Many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by Truffaut, Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman and, of course, John Cassavetes. Unfortunately the documentary that is recorded at 138 minutes is too short! The film is full of interviews and directors' opinions. Some of the people interviewed are: Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdonovich, Ellen Burstyn and Roger Corman, Bruce Dern, Sydney Pollack, Dennis Hopper and Jon Voight. <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and Jack Nicholson may not have been as beautiful as the other stars that came before them but were "interesting". This summarizes the other areas of this period of film production in American history. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers had to deal with a lack of funding from studies because they expressed unconventional attitudes about politics, sex, drugs, gender and race problems, and involving the Americas in overseas conflicts like the War of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> There is a nice interview with Francis Coppola who says he had the chance to do "The Conversation" because the producers knew he had been trained by Roger Corman to make a film with nothing, so they have financed his film. <br /> <br /> Another interview is with Jon Voight, directed by Hal Ashby in "Coming Home", a clear anti-war film about a paralyzed soldier who dives back into society after his battle in front . Voight talks about how his working methods helped him reach an emotional point when Ashby said they were doing a "dress rehearsal" and that it was eventually used in the movie - it was better because he was so untested and not dried up by its freshness trying too much. <br /> <br /> There are also many good songs from Al Pacino's break-through movie "The Panic in Needle Park", and interviews with Dennis Hopper on the making of "Easy Rider", and interviews with Sydney Pollack on the making of film. <br /> <br /> All in all the documentary is a nice starting point for any movie lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in the film were like in the 70s. Many of the Sundance Folks, where this film has made a great success, are not aware of how much the Independent Film Maker today owes to the films of John Cassavetes, Milos Foreman, William Friedkin and Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> Rent it from your favorite store. At the very least, it will revive some movies that you may not have seen before and can enjoy today. Amazon.com has it for as little as $ 11.50, if you want to buy now.
