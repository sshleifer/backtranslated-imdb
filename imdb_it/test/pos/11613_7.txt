I finally got the excellent Sazuma DVD of this movie which is loaded with interesting extras. I've read a lot about it, and unfortunately I missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It doesn't offer exactly as I thought, but it's still worth looking at if you like strange and unique movies. I much prefer to see it again than all the recent so-called horror movies spewed out by Hollywood these days. What distracts the experience for me are some musical clues that sound dated and rely too heavily on synthetic economic sounds. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could have been removed and replaced by the excellent sound design by David Kristians. But it's just my opinion. Otherwise it is a bold and angry image with welcome meditative and poetic parts, like the fading of the beautiful photographic sequence. I look forward to meeting Ascension and applauding Mitch and Karim for their efforts in non-mainstream cinema production. They are a great source of inspiration when I get started early in my short film production.
