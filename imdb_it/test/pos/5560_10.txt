Farscape is the best science fiction show, for one main reason, all the show tries, it does it very well. From a technical point of view, the music is original and perfectly adapted to the show. The special effects are the abundance and the highest quality of anything else you will see on your TV. Even acting is great, too many shows nowadays only use the American market of actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw the Matrix and you said, wow where does that agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling you get when you look at Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey, and especially Wayne Pygram. These Australians are fantastic and come to this great show. <br /> <br /> The plot is second to none. The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during the episodes of shadow wars, but this surpasses even that. It is a real pleasure to see again all the sequential episodes, the complexity of the interpersonal relationships of the characters is well written and interpreted. The general plot is original and very funny. I always try the itch for the next show. <br /> <br /> Comic episodes are fun, dramatic episodes are moving and action sequences are strained. The start of the second season has had some great comedy episodes that made me laugh out loud, something that rarely happens when watching television that is not South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even more difficult, whether Crichton encounters his mother or that the characters face their mortality, everything is done with heart and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that the action is at its maximum. This is sci-fi. <br /> <br /> If you are a science fiction fan, if you like good television, if you like serialized plot, you have to do it to Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns.
