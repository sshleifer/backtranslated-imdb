I've been waiting to see this movie for years and finally I have! As soon as I heard the title, I knew this film would be my absolute favorite movie and when I saw it I was not disappointed! <br /> <br /> This movie had everything to dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and dealt with important issues, (which were in the 1960s), such as abortion. <br /> <br /> The dance in this film was fantastic, just like the acting was! Swayze was brilliant, just like Gray was! <br /> <br /> Although this film was absolutely fantastic, you can't say you saw it if you didn't see the last scene. It takes your breath away because the whole choreography of the last dance was performed brilliantly, you danced at the end of the film and it wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to dance! <br /> <br /> Overall Dirty Dancing is a film not to be missed and even if half of the actors are in: "Where am I now?" period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!
