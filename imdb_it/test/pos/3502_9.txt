Ali G has earned his fame on the small screen, even if the big screen hasn't lost him either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious fun party per second, just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or his stupidity, and behind all this - none of the films is even mindless. A human side of Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of ​​Ali G running for the PM is brilliant, fresh and fun - and the incessant stupidity of the Staines gangster is mixed well with the harsh and hard world that is policy. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of an interview after another, we get a suitable comedy film that never becomes repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give him ten stars? Well, the ending was fun, but also failed and failed - none of this made sense. And in part, the film has become offensive in trying to be funny - but this is Ali G for you - if it's not offensive, it's not itself, and it's totally and totally ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have entered the average rating range 6-7 on IMDb. But it could even get worse, and people are destined to have conflicting opinions, especially on a film like this. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and more fun and smarter. A great job! 9/10
