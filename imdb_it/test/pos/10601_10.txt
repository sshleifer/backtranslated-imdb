I loved this movie and watch it every day. I think that even though acting isn't that good, it's just a bunch of guys having fun with a script. I had been searching for this movie everywhere for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I had to do it. Now it's by far my favorite movie of all time. It deals with the failure of the relationship, and at the same time makes a joke. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one in which Valo asks him for a grape when they are sitting on the porch, and tells him to eat what he rolls down the porch. It really portrays him as he really is. The part of the "Making Of" really touched me, when they faced Brandon Novak's heroin addiction, and how much his friends and family were trying to help him. A new film is being produced, called "Dreamseller", which deals with the story of Novak's dreams, destroyed by his addiction.
