Set in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreign citizens who were trying to leave the country at the time of the revolt. <br /> <br /> Once the airport is closed, the main journey begins with a bus that takes them to Austria. As would be obvious, they stopped on their way, where they clash with the almost impeccable Yul Brynner, whose military power as a major of the Red Army is marked by loneliness, his internal struggle between good and evil, his search for truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings. He was saddened that his work had alienated him from his friends and enemies and he wanted to have social contacts. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley interprets typically English English with the high head par excellence that, regardless of how much role, manages to maintain an almost carefree logical vision of life while Jason Robards has a surprising film debut that reinforces why he had so many roles during his career. Deborah Kerr, as the protagonist, shows the grace and femininity that we have come to associate with her, but manages to bring the strength and determination necessary for her character. <br /> <br /> The film faces a very stormy moment in European history but never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and that one can never completely judge a book by its cover. A fabulous screenplay ensures that, despite all the seriousness of the subject, there may also be large one-liners and comic instances that they add, rather than belittle the film. The chemistry of the cat-and-mouse game between Kerr and Brynner shows you why they have appeared in more than one film together. <br /> <br /> All in all, a truly compelling film that I would definitely like to review. 8/10
