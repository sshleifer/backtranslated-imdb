This film was made only 48 years after the end of the civil war, most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreations of battles and people of the time that seem quite impressive and realistic. It also offers a different and more balanced view than its contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION - a manifestly absurd and racist film. For this reason, this short film would be excellent to use in class to discuss the war and tell the story of a young man who flees to enlist as a drummer. The boy makes himself good and is a hero, even if the film ends in a rather melodramatic way - a definite convention of the day. Not a great film, but a decent plot, decent acting and some of the exaggerated acting you've seen often in other films of the day. <br /> <br /> An annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of the title card to describe or set the stage for things that were really obvious. From time to time it became boring.
