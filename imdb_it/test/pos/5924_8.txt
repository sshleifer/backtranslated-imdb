1st seen 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular interpretation of James Stewart's famous Lindbergh flight as Lindbergh and director Billy Wilder. There's really not a lot of background in this story, but that's okay, because Wilder makes the event truly remarkable because it comes directly from Lindbergh's perspective, since he used his book as the basis of the film. This first film about the flight must be one of the best of the same act. Stewart talks and thinks about himself during the flight and gives you an idea of ​​what Lindbergh has been through on this 33-hour solitary flight across the Atlantic. And he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before - which is unbelievable !! There is a bit of backstory on how he bought the plane and got the funding, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight, but the film is mostly about flying. The story is also well done and photographed and is a joy to look at despite his age. I appreciate the fact that they didn't throw a lot of lint and let the story be told. Well done in everything This is a classic movie that should be seen by everyone.
