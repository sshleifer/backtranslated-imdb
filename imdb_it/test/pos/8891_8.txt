Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him, he has a new budding romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), he doesn't know how starting his book and his students in his scriptwriter class are stranger than most. However, a student (Danny DeVito) is very strange. He lives with his evil Momma (Anne Ramsey) and fails to have the courage to kill her. So he goes to Larry for help, making his life go from normal madness to extra madness! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver should have done more! The dialogue, the characters, the whole script are almost perfect! And Danny DeVito showed me that he is more than a great actor: he is a great director! His son Matilda's film is one of my favorite family films and now this is one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> It's a black comedy, most of the lines are about murder, but it's damn funny! All the actors are making their full potential, whether they are main characters (Billy Crystal) or just minor characters (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (Who doesn't?) than you will like it! 8/10 stars.
