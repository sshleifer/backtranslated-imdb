Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what else can I say can ruin a future story. But, I believe that what I have to say is for everyone; just for one particular episode: The Soldier and Death. <br /> <br /> Okay ... of all the stories that what stands out for me is "The Soldier and Death" because it was the point of my life I realized that life was terminal. I'm not kidding. The air was my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I will always remember it. I didn't remember the title until tonight, but I have a new synopsis. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am a living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults ... <br /> <br /> I write it with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor of my age - died today. It reminded me of many lessons I learned in my life. So I write this as a reminder to Young and Old ... no one is immune to all that is in store for us. <br /> <br /> I hate to say that death is about to happen, but this story was the first time I saw death was not a bad thing; but a part of life, it was literally in this story. I can not do anything about it. It was a life changing moment for me and it will always be. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love you Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your work in life until the day you died, and your memorable Muppet Show) and thank you Brian Henson for keeping the Workshop alive !!! Honestly, I thank you, all your collaborators, editors and interns. <br /> <br /> The stage is just a stage / And a show is just a show / But the imagination will create Magic / That Forever the world will know. <br /> <br /> Thanks !!! <br /> <br /> (And for all those who doubt me ... Dance, Magic Dance)
