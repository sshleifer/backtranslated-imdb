I've never been so impressed with Night Gallery, but this episode stands out. <br /> <br /> A TV network executive auditioned - a nerdy young guy making predictions. The manager dismisses the whole thing as a trail of useless time until both predictions come true the next morning. <br /> <br /> What once seemed a living room act becomes a successful show when the child's predictions always prove accurate. <Br /> <br /> Then, one day, he refuses to do the show. Facing the upcoming show, everyone is at its end, even threatening him with legal action if he does not fulfill his contract and makes his daily predictions. <br /> <br /> The young boy gives in and predicts a seemingly utopian tomorrow. br /> <br /> After the show, the confused executive asks for an explanation, only to know why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal.
