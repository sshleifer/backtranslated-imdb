Julie Brown exhilaratingly demolishes the attempt by Madonna of a rockumentary with tearing humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival those of Madonna. Cinematography and sets are top notch. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedy injections that enhance and complete this film. The appearances of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale, like them, are an additional advantage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to tell if Brown's performance is meant to insult or joke with Madonna, though I think the Material Girl won't find humor in it. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Why don't you come here (to the Philippines), everything they eat is a dog and I'm a vegetarian".
