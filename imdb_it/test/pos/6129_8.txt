Like those who have heard radio broadcasts on the attack on Pearl Harbor, anyone who has ever seen PINK FENICOTTERS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it - and about thirty years later the film is still one of the most untold, vile, unpleasant, repellent and witty fun films never made in celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the most fun hardest bones. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a near-zero budget and some of the most sloppy cinemas around, ROSA FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families competing for the scandalous title of "The Filthiest People Alive". How disgusting can they be? Abundance: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable demonstration of rectal control to huge help of doggie, and I guarantee you will not want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it. <br /> <br /> The cast is wonderful, atrocious or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. The star, of course, is Divine ... and to describe Divine as the greatest drag queen on the planet would be the euphemism of the year. It's a mammoth creature given to BIG, BIG orange and BIG expressions - it's the Charleton Heston of resistance, and if it's almost running down for a jogger, stopping to use someone's bathroom on the lawn, or surprising real life shoppers by doing a walk along a sidewalk in Baltimore is both unspeakable and unspeakably fun. The cast also includes Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills and the always scary Edith Massey as members of the Divine family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the pair of white avengers who defy Divine status. <br /> <br /> It should be fairly obvious that Pink Flamingos are not exactly a film that everyone will like, and viewers who know the director John Waters only through subsequent films like HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will get a big shock. But if you want to see something completely different that even Monty Python could imagine, this is the movie for you. Make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won't want to eat in the future - and you might want to keep a luggage bag handy. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon reviewer
