Kevin Spacey again chooses a winner with K-PAX, a captivating film that expresses profound revelations about human existence through the naive point of view of the character Prot, but at the same time wisely. <br /> <br /> It's fun to try "if it is or not" as the plot expands and the character of Robert Porter gets richer. However, some may find the ending somewhat unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> My few problems with the film revolve around the rather picturesque and simplified representation of mental patients. I was surprised because the film's plot shows a great deal of intelligence and I don't think it would have lost anything by being more honest about how people with mental health problems behave. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I realize this was a film and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitely filmed and the story takes place at a pleasant pace. <br /> <br /> Bridges is fantastic and Spacey offers a languid and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that will have you talking to your friends.
