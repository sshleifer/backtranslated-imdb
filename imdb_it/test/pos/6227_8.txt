I must admit that thanks to this film I am afraid of mannequins. hahaha. <br /> <br /> but yes, first of all the acting in this film, at least for my standard, is very beautiful. most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles. even the script seems to be pretty good, certainly some mischievous things in there, but also a decently written character and some damn scary scenes. STILL shivers me thinking about that scene with the guy and the mannequins. brrr. <br /> <br /> yes, I will say that you should check this movie is quite good and very funny. a good 8/10 clock
