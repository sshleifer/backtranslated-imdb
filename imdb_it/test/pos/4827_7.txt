May contain spoilers !!! In no way, shape or form, this film breaks the mold of the horror film. Not by a long shot. However, it offers a creepy atmosphere, quite credible characters and gore. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and does not bother to explain itself more than necessary. A group of children is killed in a mining accident in the early 1900s. Since then, they have persecuted and killed the residence of their small town sleeping in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Simple: they want revenge on the man who caused their death years and years ago. Of course, his big, great grandson is in town and he's a real whore. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, a mother and her two daughters inherit an old house after her husband died. The eldest daughter is rebellious, hateful ... a typical teenager. The youngest is curious, has bright eyes and goes in with the ghost children. The most disturbing part of this film is the absolute absence of children's emotions and make their way between victim and victim. Excellent acting. It was so spooky! I mean, the Children of the Corn movies are one thing ... but this has surpassed any of these (like creepy kids). <br /> <br /> Worht a look. I bought it before I saw it and I wasn't unhappy. But I am a horror fan all around.
