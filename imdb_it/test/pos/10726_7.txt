I remember going to drive the inn with my parents and my sister. I was in the fifth year, and still a child, and the unit closed 4 years later, but the film still remains in my memory. A movie for adults, which a child finds fun. This is a mark of excellence. Hoffman is one of the best actors in Hollywood, and this film proves it. I like the fact that Billy shot down the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version in the movie I factory. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please send me an email if you like the SCTV scene. It's not a bad movie at all, it's a story about a father and his son. Touching and entertaining, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets change. A second watch is worth it. 7/10
