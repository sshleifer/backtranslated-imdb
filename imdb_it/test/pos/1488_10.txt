Mr. Bean has shaped the face of British television comedy. He has shown that he does not need bad words or wit, a huge budget, a great deal of intelligence or any intelligence to do something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters you can't forget. Some of these episodes have come up with me: yes, they are not realistic at all and they are all rather stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers that Bean broke on its way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. Can you always come up with some interesting new ideas - and new hilarious gags - remember when Mr. Bean drove his Mini Green while sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never weaken - the film was not as good as this, but Bean introduced a new sense of humor to the world, and both children and adults will be amazed by its immense fun . "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be damned: this is British comedy at its best and most original. These escapades never grow old! 10/10
