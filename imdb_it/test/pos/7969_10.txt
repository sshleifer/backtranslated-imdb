Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is nothing but shooting and fighting! For people who say they don't do shooters as they are used. Well, this is really hard-core! David Bradley is really good and his character takes a turn in the film. He is hit by the stick more than a dozen times, is stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again, is beaten, recovers and is ready for more action! His character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was very good and probably steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and unaccredited role in Hard Justice! As for the action, it's really cool with all the gun fights and the huge stand-off as the scene at the beginning has cars that inflate and rise in mid-air! There is so much that happens in the 95 minutes of execution. For action fans you will be captivated by all the power of fire and the fighting that this film has to offer! Hard Justice is a film that is not easy to locate and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale buy it because this film is a great keeper and the box is beautiful! There is a lot of action that must be seen to be believed! See and see if you can find some good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! I highly recommend all action movie fans who like to shoot and fight movies and have been disappointed by other films that look like a real action movie without pause, but can't deliver it to get Hard Justice !
