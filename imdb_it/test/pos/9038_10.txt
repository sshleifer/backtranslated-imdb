This film was set, filmed and premiered at Oxford, Miss., The hometown of W. Faulkner, setting of the 1948 book. Most of the extras were local. I have been to Oxford, and it has changed a lot. This film presents Will Geer as the sheriff, he was later blacklisted. Writers and actors of social dramas like this film, and Grapes Of Wrath, who were targets of the HUAC a few years later. I don't remember if the actor who plays the young Mallison (Claude Jarman Jr) did something after the TV series Centennial (1978), but it was exceptional in this previous film. And don't miss out on Elizabeth Patterson, who later played in Little Women.
