This film did not talk about stereotypes, dance movements or shooting lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play a convincing role, which Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such an elaborate film could have succeeded that way. I don't mean to sound overly appealing with this film - it wasn't "revolutionary" in any way - but it was a movie worth seeing. Was it credible? No. New York could not be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of humanity who has Hitch's "hutzpah". Of course, there are the bartenders, but not those who can have a chick, at any time - excluding those who are raking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its real focus on the dramatic side of things, not just comedy. It was two hours of fun, no doubt. But it also took two hours for you to sit in your seat, immerse yourself in the characters and smile.
