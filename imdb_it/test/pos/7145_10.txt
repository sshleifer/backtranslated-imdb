This version did not touch me as deeply as the next version of Hollywood with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully filmed and superbly interpreted, the BBC version was richer in dialogues that conveyed information I found fascinating. He gave me a detailed picture of the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not as visually stunning or visceral. However, while I did not leave a crowded kleenex theater soaked in the theater, I used one at frequent intervals. I enjoyed this film as much as the Hollywood version, and I was grateful for the greater understanding I gained.
