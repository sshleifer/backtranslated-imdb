This film surprised me. The box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the movie are misleading. The film is quite gory, well acted and beautifully filmed. The special effects are high level and seem to be ahead of their time, until they realize that this film was released in 1979, not in 1963 as the tone would suggest. It is a unique version of Dr. Moreau's story and one of the best turned versions. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film never breaks. Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic classics in costume / horror and blood.
