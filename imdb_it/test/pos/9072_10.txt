The crowd of big box office stars is phenomenal in this movie !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This film was also made in one of my favorite years, 1990 !! I am a Chicago, and the setting in Chicago was very identifiable and artistically accelerated !! I liked this movie, and the excitement that motivated the climax in this photo was a powerful element for the plot that was absolutely sensational !! /> <br /> "Flatliner" focuses on a group of premature and presumptuous students who want to be aligned as a way to achieve some sort of corporate vindication !! When life makes no sense, it would seem very illogical to pry into apocalyptic nightmares !! At the same time, once their desperate curiosity has prevailed over them, you can't go back !! The king of the hill, (so to speak) is the one that shouts vehemently: I DO 'TWO MINUTES !! WHO ELSE IS GOING TO DO THIS !! WHOEVER YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR TWO AND A HALF !! In the end, all these newly arrived and very unwelcome recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in the lives of these re-bates !! The fulfillment of their justified or unjustified path required a 360-degree perspective on the problems they were suffering from !! Whatever the purpose of all this tiring reckless and academic, it is definitely an original approach to affirming your personality !! I liked this movie, 1990 was a good year for me too, things seemed to go right that year !! When I saw this movie, some evenings in November, during the year 1990, I was very happy to have done it !!
