Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> Although this is a deeply flawed (and in some ways idiotic) film, the way it continually defies expectations makes it a decent vision for the adventurous hardcore fan. <br /> <br /> Meet yuppie college student Kevin and his band of lovely friends from the frat friend. In what begins as a particularly striking sex comedy for adolescents, we follow this group of balls and their antics, which involve, among other things, the making of pawns linked to their genitals. The film changes abruptly when Kevin's high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a gang of motorcyclists who apparently have nothing better to do. When he dies in the hospital, Kevin promises revenge, much to the displeasure of his father detective. <br /> <br /> So far, we've gone from Porky's-lite, through the territory of Last House On The Left, to what apparently looks like the typical revenge urban revenge movie. However, Kevin and the portrait of his band go from vaguely understanding until they become crazy fools. It is thanks to the film that it does not fascinate the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that Kevin continually launches, while making it understandable that he would feel like him. <br /> <br /> The mood goes from carefree to filthy and reckless very quickly, and in the end is so exaggerated and exploitative that it will leave you incredulous. And this is the strength of this film. You never know what to expect next. <br /> <br /> At over 100 minutes, it's a bit long for this kind of fare, but you won't get bored. For the most part recited, with cardboard cutouts for characters and particularly ridiculous situations and rather stupid dialogues, this will not be at the top of the list of all forgotten classics. Anyway, I got a kick, and I'm sure anyone reading this knows if they agree.
