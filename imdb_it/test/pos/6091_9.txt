as you can read in many reviews here is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. I for one think it's a good sign. I have always enjoyed this film, although the genre is not my typical style (I have never watched Titanic for example, and I have no intention of doing so). <br /> <br /> The English patient's grips because he shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment than when they are "at home" (Katherine), shows how destructive love can be in one way slow, strong and absolutely painful, it excites for the extremely passionate affair, the pain of those who leave themselves behind, how useless one can feel to go on. <br /> <br /> Photography is simply stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and this does justice to the book, the timeline and the depth / development of the characters. Putting this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amplify the multi-layered nature of this film. People tend to have difficulty with the rhythm of the movies ... as if they were in a hurry to get to work .. hey - take a life! ;-) have fun ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
