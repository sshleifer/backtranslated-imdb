Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it is simply too long and varied and cerebral to be completely perfect across the board, especially with regard to the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue. In each scene, there are certain moments, scenes or intonations with which one does not agree. I have seen many productions of films by Hamlet: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi. In terms of faithful productions, at full length, this ranking is placed there with the best. <br /> <br /> Most of Hamlet's productions are drastically reduced, because to run the entire show takes four to five hours. This production seems to be complete - that is, ALL of Shakespeare's original dialogue is intact - and therefore it is essential for Shakespeare scholars and lovers. And although the lines seemed hasty on rare occasions (for those less familiar with the text), mostly the script is well acted, well pronounced and well executed. Subtitles are available and very useful, although sometimes they are slightly behind. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a rather admirable job with the longer and more impossible role of the theater. Actually I cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I did it before. Patrick Stewart (like Claudius) and Claire Bloom (like Gertrude) are excellent, like Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the cast. The sets are minimal, so we can conceptually focus on the game without distraction or attention to the non-essentials. <br /> <br /> At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long journey to follow, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if it's necessary take a break for yourself. I highly recommend this production to all lovers and scholars of Shakespeare.
