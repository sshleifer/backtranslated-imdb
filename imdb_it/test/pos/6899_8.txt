I saw it at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and loved it. It worked for me like a rather strange comedy, because I don't like horror, but there were only a couple of minutes I had to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, the costumes and settings were not far from the quality of the BBC, which is surprising for an independent film. I liked the way twists and even meanders surprised me positively. I even warmed up with the character of Willy Grimes, which I didn't like at first. It would have been better if there had been some motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island: it seemed like a plot device to me. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Dominic Monaghan, and have done a good job at pratfalls, horror and the most attentive moments. Beautiful voice even in the narration. <br /> <br /> This would be a funny and unusual film.
