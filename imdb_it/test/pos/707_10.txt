I read on the web that this film has been redone in a movie. Long last!!!!! It's time for Hollywood to go around together. Big studios have always disapproved of sharp material, with Oscar written everywhere. Go figure it out !! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was made ahead of time. It's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael Mann, a true visionary, has found a way to engage an audience without excessive indulgences. Peter Strauss' Emmy award performance is probably the best role I've ever seen in my life of watching the movie. Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an Academy Award is already on their mantle). <br /> <br /> The gritty multi-ethnic ensemble, a background for THE JERICHO MILE makes us understand the delicate dynamics of our world. It concerns redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit that overcomes all barriers. Imagine a prisoner imprisoned since he was a teenager for life without the possibility of probation, who does not know that he is perhaps the fastest rider in the world. ... what would you do ?? <br /> <br /> This movie makes you go away feeling that you have not been cheated on any level. Totally electrifying, engaging, exciting, and a "Rolling Stones" soundtrack that cradles !!! <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be made for the big screen ... I can't wait ...! !! In the meantime I will have to continue to review my altered VHS copy that I had for many years.
