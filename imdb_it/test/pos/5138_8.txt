I read the book in a summer book club, and we all enjoyed it. My friends at that club agreed not to watch the movie, for fear that the book would be ruined. I didn't agree, and I watched him recently with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very faithful to the book, without losing its spirit. The 'new kid' theme was shown just enough to give it an idea, but it is not what the story is about. <br /> <br /> Acting was not the best I've ever seen, but it was still good, and especially children had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting and the plot was pretty and not too exaggerated. It was a children's film that works well for adults or kids. <br /> <br /> I would like there to have been a somewhat harder attitude from Beatrice, but she was still an exceptional character. Mullet Fingers was a bit like I had imagined, except that his hair was obviously a little dyed, with blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as the little boy and the new baby, especially the interactions with his parents and friends. <br /> <br /> The message and the ending (of which I will not discuss if I did not like it) joined together to make a great film of joy for a rainy day. All in all, this was a great movie that you can watch again and again whenever you need to remember that the world is not a horrible place after all.
