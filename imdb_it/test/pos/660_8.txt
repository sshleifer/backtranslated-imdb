I just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. I still find it a pleasant and romantic film that captures a time that has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of a time long gone is probably captured in this little film. The acting is above average and the brief appearance of Richard Gere as a Raider Marine war hero shocked by the shell has a keen interest for any movie fan or Gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is in his utmost expression and behaves like the "All-American" boy. The late Bruno Kirby (who was announced as B. Kirby, Jr.) has a meaty role as "Pop", a rejected of Marine Corp, a lover of peace, who dreams of returning home to his wife. If you are looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. The same applies to those seeking action and adventure. However, if you want to resume a period of innocence, honor, romance and love in America, then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
