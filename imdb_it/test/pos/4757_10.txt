"The Seven-Ups" looks like a replica of "The French Connection", published two years earlier. Both the late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco make appearances, as does stuntman Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we are not dealing with the French drug villains; instead, we are dealing with a war against assorted criminals and hoods after a policeman was brutally killed by a thug. We see unpleasant and a New York of the 90s. <br /> <br /> I like watching this movie because it's exciting to watch the action, and it's a memory of a cooler time. That being said, when comparing car chases, Mr. Hickman participated in the three most compared: this film, Bullitt and The French Connection. Every chase scene has its qualities, and this is simply superb. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad this title has seen the light of day on DVD.
