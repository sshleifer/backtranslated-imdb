American expatriate Jules Dassin is an award-winning French gangster film. The plot involves Tony the Stephanois, a thug who has just been released from prison, who brings his gang of thieves into a $ 240 million jewel shot. Unfortunately, his ex-wife's relationship with an infamous gangster named Grutter, an Italian cracker named Cesar with a weakness for women, and the missteps of his friend Jo cause the fluke to turn into a bloody race against time while Grutter holds Jo's son hostage to money in typical "crime never pays" the fashion of tragedy. <br /> <br /> The "rififi" in the title is explained in a song that basically means jargon for violence and sex, and the complete title, "Du rififi chez les hommes" means roughly "Some villains in the house of men ", which is practically the point where the fatal defect of the characters occurs. Leave it to a gangster movie to put most of the emphasis on missteps on women, but this time Jo's wife gets the last laugh (if you can call it a laugh) when she predicts "All of you will kill everyone else." The characters are not the nicest and the women are mostly weak, but Dassin still builds an extremely well made suspense film while they pull out a robbery that requires the utmost tranquility, hides assets and then tries to survive what in practice becomes a cat and cross country mouse game. In the mix there are some incredible photographs and a good attention to details in the montage, which lead to a stimulation and a visual experience that overestimates the otherwise generic texture. It is not only easy to understand why this is considered a classic, it is also easy to understand why it is among the top 250 in IMDb: it is full of suspense, visually magnificent, full of sex and violence, and maintains that attitude of classy gangsters like so much .
