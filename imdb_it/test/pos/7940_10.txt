A splendid work of art. You can watch every image of the film and see its beauty. First I would like to say that "when I saw the helmets of German soldiers I realized that it was from here that" Star Wars "was inspired. The scene in which they killed the child is terrifying and when I saw it I didn't like it. But when the film ended I thought about that scene and changed my mind and thought that in the Second World War that was exactly what the Germans did. <br /> <br /> The Ice-battle scene is among the best scenes of war I've seen (if not the BEST). The way this film combines music and so amazingly stunning the visual images are really excellent, so the Prokofiev score is one of the most famous soundtracks in history and I thought it was among the best. <br /> <br /> what can you say more than a work of art.Eisenstein has created an extraordinary masterpiece, a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art, I am very happy because I have just received the Eisenstein criteria collection.
