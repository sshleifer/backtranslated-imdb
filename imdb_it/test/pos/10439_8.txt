I don't think I'll include any spoilers, but if I do, I can cover my ass. "The Last American Virgin" arrived at a time when the teenage adolescent age / high school games were the rave. Movies like "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's" (1981) were making a lot of money. And yet it is the "Last American Virgin" that actually has a more serious storyline in the midst of nudity and sexual situations. It is the often told story of three high school classmates who want to lose their virginity. The wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous ones (the elderly woman with the jealous boyfriend) and the convenient ones (which attract their female high school counterparts). The film has many funny moments, and even though the cast hasn't produced a single movie star, it's worth remembering for a fantastic 1980s soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. For today the standards are vulgar and may have caught an NC-17 score, but it's a well-told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain, while love could be right in front of us. It's a small piece of 80s Americana and worth having in your movie collection.
