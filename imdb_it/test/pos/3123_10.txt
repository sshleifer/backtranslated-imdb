I don't think I really have any spoilers here but as I describe a couple of funny scenes, I'll check the box saying "it might contain spoilers" just to be safe. Now ... <br /> <br /> I don't know where to start. By now we know the basic pattern of the story - horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take on the task of driving a Western Mormon train to their 'promised land' and encounter a variety of tests and interesting characters, especially the outlawed Clegg family. <br /> <br /> Anyone can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a fan of Westerners to appreciate this. First off, Johnson and Carey are two of the fastest-moving characters you'll see in every movie. Carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a kid - while Johnson is a little calmer and wiser, a bit like an older brother figure. I take a kick from the scene where the sheriff sells one of their "gentle horses" for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you could say failures" ... Travis elbows Sandy freeing himself with a high-pitched whistle, sending the new horse of the sheriff on a wild hold in the saddle with him in the saddle. The look on his face when the horse finally unloads and gallops away is priceless. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the music ... even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the Pioneer Children, listen to "Shadows in the dust" as the wagon train is shown moving with some of the people who they walk among the carts. It's a really beautiful song, too bad for only half a minute in the film. I want to hear the whole thing sometimes. <br /> <br /> One thing that really impressed me about this film is that much of it must have been almost as difficult to accomplish as the real situation it portrays. Teams of six horses that dragged the carts on steep mountain paths, striving to do the maximum - this was not a simple and easy film. It must have been risky for the actors, the stuntmen and even the animals. Even in rivers, this film has a lot of authentic looking actions that involve the movement of the wagon. It must be said that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, both experienced many years in the saddle, roping and doing all sorts of things like cowboys. Carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many Navaho Indians and in fact learned to speak Navaho before he learned to speak English. No rhinestone cowboys in this film - "Travis" and "Sandy" were the real thing. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene when Miss Denver throws the pan of water out of her wagon, hitting Travis's horse in the face ... the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing it away. Look at the expression on Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis "I'm sorry you fell off your horse." Another favorite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets a little tiff with one of the Mormons. They are working backwards to prepare their equipment, and after Sandy is disgusted with the other, they enter a bounce game that quickly turns into a fist fight spinning on the ground. . Even after the Elder (Ward Bond) raises and separates them, the two fighters continue to try to reach each other. The Mormon (called "Jackson" in the film) gets one last kick to Sandy so high that he gets behind him. It's a really fun scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else I can say about this film except that it has a nice story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and lots of balanced action with humor and a bit of drama. Oh, it was colored, at least in the version I saw; it's not the most beautiful color film you've ever seen, but I think I prefer it to black and white. I give this one to ten and I don't give much to 10. One of my favorite movies, no doubt. And judging by the other comments, I have a lot of company in this evaluation.
