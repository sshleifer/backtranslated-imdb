If you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, chances are you'll like it too. Although I think some of the English jokes (like calling two London characters Dixon and Winterburn, after Arsenal soccer players) could be lost in some, this is still entertainment cracking, which probably exudes vitality. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two protagonists is always well judged. In fact, Scott's direction is very reassuring, considering that this is his first feature film, and shows that he has the talent of his father to put us at ease in an unknown environment. <br /> <br /> Hell, I'm convinced. I'll see him again!
