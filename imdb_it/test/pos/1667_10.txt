To do a job like this caper in Rififi (for example, the score and its opines), you need to have nerves of steel. This apparently requires it and commands it. Jules Dassin is the master. <br /> <br /> I was on the edge of my seat all the time. It deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, supposedly, to the director being on the black list of the hypocritical Hollywood of his time. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who does not have the pleasure of seeing it. <br /> <br /> I can't give you enough stars.
