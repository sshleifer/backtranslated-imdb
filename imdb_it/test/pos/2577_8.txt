(My synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school nympho slut who links up with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to satisfy her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leave Rae alone. Rae has not been alone for a long time, because he is the vagabond of the city with a strong need to connect with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her in the middle and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and takes her home. Lazarus gives medical assistance to Rae, and believes he can save her even from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat, so Lazarus puts a 40-pound chain around her and her radiator to keep her from going out in search of men. Lazarus has his own problems, because his wife just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to ease his pain. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The film has a profound meaning after overcoming sex and violence. The film looks different. The plot is raw and puts you almost into the movie like you're there. The 40-pound chain is a good and symbolic metaphor for a chastity belt. You don't give love to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. The chain could also be a parallel with a wife who is chained to the kitchen, but Rae has not cooked. Rae just wanted to have sex all the time while a wife didn't. I think Craig Brewer (writer and director) made an extraordinary film, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a mediocre blues song. The plot is emotionally charged, addressing all topics of race, religion, music and sex in one. (Paramount Classics, Run time 1:56, Rated R) (8/10)
