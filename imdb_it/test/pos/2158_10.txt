Yes, in fact we have a winner - a winner in the best stupid action movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I chose to vote for a 10 for this film is because it's so incredibly bad that it gets really fun. <br /> <br /> "Night Hunter" is basically about Jack Cutter, a vampire hunter (vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, being that he must kill the last remained Vampires. <br /> <br /> This film contains one of the happiest scenes I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the terrible shooting scenes. When people are shot in this film, the blood splatter - thick like ketchup everywhere, makes the film so cheap and lame to lose interest. A constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me most during the fight scenes. This is, I suppose, done to create an "action-effect", although in my opinion it doesn't give any effect. It's completely ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All acrobatic scenes are very badly done. There is a scene where the dead vampire leader is knocked off a roof. When the corpse hits the ground, it bounces like a rickety rubber doll. A scene in which Jack sniffs the ground, getting a vision was so lame that it made me laugh hysterically. <br /> <br /> The limping music, the distasteful scenes, the bad actions and the simple shooting techniques are obviously the functions that make this film so a malfunction. To say that this is a good film would be the same as saying that nuclear bombs are good for humans. Clearly, those of you who say this is one of the best action movies have not seen many in your life. <br /> <br /> This is basically a class B vampire action movie that deserves 0/10 but I'll give it to 10/10, only for his skill (being the most amiable action movie I have never seen) to make me laugh and because I really can't help it.
