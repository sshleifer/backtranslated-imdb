This is probably the best image that many will not see. He presented a culture in a real non-oligonized way. A must see for all those who love Indies and those who do not love it. I think this film will attract more in the Indie scene. The acting was top notch! Alice's character has been brought so well. With perfect delicacy. This film should be brought to the mainstream! I think it would be phenomenal! ALICE is the most real aspect of an element of our culture that I have seen since ASK ALICE. A look that is not touched by the hand of Hollywood. Movies like this show young people that these things are not glamorous but that they are real and compelling. If you liked PIECES OF APRIL you will like this!
