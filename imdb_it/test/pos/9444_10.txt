This was one of the best Doctor Who episodes I've seen since he returned last year. There is a brilliant mix of fun, fear and tenderness, all mixed which is equivalent to an incredible episode. The mood has been brilliantly designed and I'm pretty sure there will be lots of jokes in the last few weeks. I have already been guilty of this. I particularly liked the way we saw a different perspective on the relationship between Rose and the Doctor and the ending: well, it's the first time I've been hiding behind a pillow! I can't wait until next week's episode to find out how they get out of this mess.
