Two years after its initial release, Goldeneye is still at the top of the field of first-person shooters for the Nintendo 64. The Quake and Turok series also did not have the combination of graphic details, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and general fun that bring back this game again and again. The missions have specific objectives that force you to think like Bond, not only to shoot all the bad guys that appear on the screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, save hostages, protect Bond's girlfriend and so on . Q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous watch. The game is loosely based on the film's plot, including all the main characters and the best scenes from the film, from the bungee jumping dam to the plane flight to the tank race through St. Petersburg. The layout is also kept where possible, so you'll recognize various situations if you've seen the movie. More levels are added to challenge the player and put the scenes together a little more. With each difficulty level the mission objectives are more difficult, smarter enemies and more lethal bullets. I have not yet reached 00-Agent levels. Cheats can be opened by not entering codes or pressing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain period of time, and other characters can be opened for multiplayer. Multiplayer is still the best first-person shooter. It's not as clear as Turok, but it almost doesn't slow down ... a lot of options that give your friends the reason to blow each other repeatedly and once more just for the kicks. There are better games for the N64, like Zelda and all the things in Star Wars, but Rare has continued the exceptional game series with a first person shooter that has not been passed and will not be passed until they are completed in 2000 with Perfect Dark.
