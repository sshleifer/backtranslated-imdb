This film always strikes me emotionally in the end. Although the film's problems - interracial love and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film goes far beyond those narrow parameters of revolutionary novelty and unique uniqueness. Here we have a true love story, written by the woman involved in this love story, told in a brilliant and aggressive style that enhances the virtues and glory of a mad passionate love. I love "this support for the one emotion that makes life truly worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter. A wonderful film that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand, and for those who have not yet been in love, even the hope that one day lightning can strike for you makes life worth living - because love is worth having even if for a short term - even if you lose - because love is the "stuff" - the essence - of life, this film works for me, a warm experience!
