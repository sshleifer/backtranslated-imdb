A light, uplifting and engaging film. Watching Irene Dunne is a treat! As you look at her, she ceases to be Irene Dunne and becomes Paula Wharton anyway. <br /> <br /> I liked Irene Dunne in every movie I saw and that would be almost all of them. What a pity that most of his films need such a serious restoration. I hope Irene Dunne's film is restored before it's too late and it's such treasures. Thank God it's not the case with Over 21. <br /> <br /> It's a must see if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious nuances. I agree with a previous comment on the speech "The World and Apple Pie" was one of the many highlights of the film. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped me write that speech with director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and certainly seems to show it in her films!
