One of my favorite non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps off the screen. Gene Kelly showcases his dancing skills and introduces musicals to his innovative and cutting choreography that would eventually change the way musicals are choreographed. Phil Silvers is the second perfect banana, and Eve Arden injects this film with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era when the big Broadway shows come from the movie, Cover Girl was not adapted to the theater.
