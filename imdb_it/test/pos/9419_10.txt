A brilliant adventure by Sherlock Holmes interpreted by the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Although many other actors play Holmes and Watson brilliantly and do a great job of it - Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two. <br /> <br /> Holmes brings a Tobell professor from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by the Nazis. He has a bomb that could win World War II. His bomb site was divided into four parts, each hidden in books. Tobell agrees to give his bomb site to the British government. On the night of his arrival, Tobell goes to his girlfriend's house. He drew some figures of men, if Tobell were to disappear, the lady would give the drawings to Holmes. On his journey home he is attacked, but a policeman stops him and the attacker flees. Tobell is happy that the British government uses its bomb site but refuses to give it to them, Tobell wants to take care of it. The bomb site is divided into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. Give a part of this bomb site to one of his scientist friends. Then the biggest fear of Holmes happens, Tobell disappears. Holmes visits the girl Tobell was with the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings have been stolen. He says that only one man came in during the time Tobell left to repair the light bulb. The man he describes is Professor Moriarty. He's working for the Nazis. Seen as he has the drawings, Holmes is made for. But find the notepad he used and use Science, he can see what Tobell drew by looking at the next page on the block. He sees his code. He sees that it is the name of four scientists. The first three solves the code, but fails to calculate the fourth. The three scientists who elaborated were murdered and the place of the bomb was taken. Holmes cannot elaborate the fourth scientist, but neither can Moriarty. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes manages to enter Moriarty's office. Moriarty immediately sees that he is Holmes, puts him in a box and has him thrown overboard. But Watson and Lestrade insist on finding the box and finding Holmes in it. Now it is obvious that Moriarty is at liberty. Holmes manages to develop the fourth code, Frederick Hoffner. Holmes arrives immediately at his house and brings Hoffner and the decisive fourth part to safety. Holmes now needs to get Moriarty in charge of working with the Nazis. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty solves the fourth code and gets two men to fetch Hoffner. They take it back and come face to face with Moriarty. Meanwhile Tobell is not in a good way, he was tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty had it with Holmes now, he took it and his death must be long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in his vein and see him die of blood loss, drop by drop. Watson runs in and saves the day though. Moriarty manages to escape, but Holmes was just careless enough to leave Moriarty's trap open. Moriarty dives at sixty feet. <br /> <br /> So, Moriarty is dead. No. He makes his last release in the movie 'The Woman in Green' but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps off his roof. It was the second of Moriarty's three appearances in the Rathbone series, a different actor who played it every time. His first appearance in "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" was played by George Zucco, his second in this film was played by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels plays it in his last release in "The Woman in Green". Holmes films made by Universal were put to war as Holmes triumphs over the Nazi. "The Voice of Terror" was the first, then this film and then "Sherlock Holmes in Washington". He then returned to Victorian times, with precise relations with Edwardian and Georgian (George the fifth and sixth) times. This film had a close connection with the Sherlock Holmes story "The Dancing Men" which can be found in "The Return of Sherlock Holmes". A great film, although obviously propagandistic, was a brilliant release from Holmes.
