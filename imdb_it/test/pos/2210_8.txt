I've been surprised to appreciate this film since I came from the "film school to control the brain at the door and have fun". However, this film touched my heart. I have friends like Emily mentally retarded. I have friends like Evie who are not socialized. And I was in Evie's shoes, running away from the opportunity out of fear and devotion to others. <br /> <br /> The disappointment of Amy Madigan in her daughters was almost palpable on the screen and in the embarrassing moments in which she tried to overcome the gap with Evie was raw and painful to watch. And maybe I'm thicker than most, but I've never seen the turning point with Evie's father. I usually deal with these things pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> My bookings are similar to others posted here. I thought that the wonderful and nice character of Christopher Lloyd (a very different role for him, I thought) was underutilized. What happened to him after he understood what was happening with the poem? He, like James, will try again ??? Secondly, the ending, as it was, did not seem to resolve or accomplish anything. I did not expect the pieces to be collected and all the extremes tied in an orderly fashion, but I felt that I disagreed with the characters, that there was no real healing here or any real healing effort. <br /> Otherwise, exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and, for some, very, very true.
