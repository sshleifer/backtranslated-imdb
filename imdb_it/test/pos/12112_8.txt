"Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West" Mario Costa's disgusting Spaghetti western "The Beast" with Klaus Kinski could only be produced in Europe. Hollywood would never have dared to do a western on a sexual predator in search of prey as the protagonist of a film. It doesn't matter that Kinski adapts perfectly to Johnny's "crazy" role. He plays an individual entirely devoid of sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, trousers and hat. This low-budget oater has nothing appetizing about it. The typically stunning Spanish landscape around Almeria has never been highlighted. Instead, Costa and his director of photography Luciano Trasatti, who shot another Kinski western "And God said to Cain", photographed this work on horseback in rather mundane settings around Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and Monte Gelato Falls, Treja River, Lazio, Italy. However, "The Beast" qualifies as a continental western because it deals with characters totally unscrupulous and the action could be classified as a film noir because the hero and the heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that force them to resort to criminal activities . Predictably, their well-demoted plans owed largely to the character of Kinski. Indeed, Kinski's licentious character resembles a Wily E. Coyote type character. Consistently, he strives to have sex with several beautiful women, but both lawyers and outlaws frustrate each of his efforts. Ultimately, "The Beast" is equivalent to a study of the tragic character full of irony. The soundtrack of the Stelvio Cipriani seems to be raised by the Tony Anthony western "The Stranger Returns". Mario Costa's screenplay takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, terrified by a notorious Mexican bandit called Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino of "We Still Kill the Old Way") and by his band. Prey the diligence and no one is safe from their depredations. The first time we see Johnny Laster "crazy", he stops to cool off in a stream and sees a beautiful woman washing clothes. He sneaks up behind her and attacks her, but an older man armed with a rifle intervenes and has to flee. He shows up in a nearby town and a snorting gunslinger recruits him to help ambush a rich man, Mr. Powers, on the runway and steal him. They end up killing him and not getting money. Mr. Snuff-sniffer accidentally leaves his snuffbox at the crime scene and the sheriff arrests on a murder charge. 'Crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so he doesn't have to worry about being involved in the crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young couple in love is having trouble making their way into the world. Riccardo (Steven Tedd of "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives a Mexican couple on their ranch and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village, Riccardo's delightful girlfriend, Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli of "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the cellar. Riccardo and Juanita are going to get married, but the last place Juanita wants to settle on is a dusty ranch. He dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than Riccardo or her. They join with the name of a blond outlaw Glen (Paolo Casella of "Shoot the living and pray for the dead") and plan to kidnap Mr. Power's daughter, Nancy, when she comes to get her inheritance. Glen makes the fatal mistake of enlisting Johnny "Crazy" to help them because Glen knows that Johnny needs money to have women. <br /> <br /> Kidnap Powers daughter and keep her in a remote cabin with Johnny guarding her. Meanwhile, Juanita masquerades as Powers 'daughter and shows up in town to get money from Powers' lawyer Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli of "Blood and Black Lace"), but becomes suspicious because Juanita looks nothing like she remembered Nancy. Riccardo wields his six-shot gun and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can only get his hands on $ 50,000 because Machete has caused so much fear in the hearts of all that the total legacy of Powers cannot be sent across the diligent territory. Meanwhile, back in the cabin, Johnny tries to rape Nancy, but she overtakes him, knows him with a chair with the excuse of having to be alone while she undresses. After she has made him unconscious, she steals a buggy and takes him back to the city. Johnny recovers, pursues her and kills her at the same time that Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton meet him on the trail. They inform Johnny of the complications created by Machete's reign of terror and give him $ 12,000 as a cut in his money. Pinkerton is horrified by the sight of Nancy's bloody corpse and threatens Johnny. Of course, Johnny kills him in cold blood on the spot. <br /> <br /> Things are really starting to deteriorate when the San Diego law is about to capture Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico while Johnny attacks two women on a ranch and manages to escape secretly. He rides in Mexico, finds a whore in the cellar and is knocking her down when a size pushes a gun in his face. Johnny confesses to knowing where they can find more money if they release it. Machete's men follow Johnny's tip and capture Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Machete and Johnny saves Juanita, but she dies later after a major shootout. Riccardo has been standing alone now. Machete and his men retaliated against his step parents, not only killing them but also little Juan. All that Riccardo and Juanita imagined to have come out in clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending. 'Crazy' Johnny dies and never fails to appease his lust. If you think about Costa's uncompromising assayer, "The Beast" emerges as an interesting study of the character and a noir film exercise in a Western environment where everyone is punished.
