I can't understand why the evaluation here for this film is so low. This was one of the best films I've seen this year. He really hit a deal with me. I have been waiting for this film for several months and I thought to myself, it is not possible that it could meet the expectations I had for this ... given how I built it in my head as much as I did. Needless to say, it not only met my expectations, but exceeded them by far. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. Their acting was by far superb. They were both in their element and completely natural in their roles. The premises were absolutely beautiful. Every shot shot has been perfectly captured and adapts perfectly to mood and atmosphere. I found this film very touching and I took it very close to the heart. I would also like to say that this could be one of my all-time favorites. At the very least, I could certainly see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I couldn't find a flaw in this movie. It's hard to say on any film. I highly recommend this. It is moving, meaningful, and says a lot about human nature and the family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Well done by everyone.
