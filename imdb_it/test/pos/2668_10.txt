Sometimes reading user comments on IMDB fills me with despair about the species. For anyone to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as "boring", they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of cinema. I finally understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and empty - they understand their audience. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, those who do not like the realization of Kubrick are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and pure virtuosity that contributed to the realization of this epic. This is the film that put science into "science fiction", and its description of space travel and the future of humanity remains unsurpassed to this day. It was far ahead of the times that humanity has not yet reached. <br /> <br /> 2001 is mainly a technical film. The reason it is slow and full of minutes is because the goal was to realistically predict the future of technology (and the past, in the opening scenes that inspire awe). The major strength of the film is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, the man had not yet arrived at the moon ... but it is there in 2001, and this is only the beginning of the journey. Creating a vision of the future so incredibly detailed that 35 years later is still the best we have is incredible: I still can't understand how some shots have been made. The film's only major mistake was the optimism with which it envisaged the technological (and social) development of humanity. It is a pity that the year 2001 did not resemble the 2001 film, not Kubrick's. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible special effects, the camera work and the set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food to think about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is strange and difficult to understand, but this is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have begun the task of imagining it, now it's up to the public to continue. There is no precise solution, no definitive fixed point, because then the public could stop thinking after the final reel. I know that's what most people seem to want these days, but Kubrick won't let us go so lightly. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that this film is one of the best 100 IMDB films, and I just wish it were even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers the world has ever known and 2001 is his best result. 10/10.
