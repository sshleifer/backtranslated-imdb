This program was active for a short time when I was a kid, I remember seeing him eating fish and chips. <br /> <br /> Riding on the back of the Tron hype this series was very much in the style of streethawk, manimal and the like, except for more computer. There was a geeky kid that the computer somehow created this guy - automan. He went around solving crimes and everything. <br /> <br /> All I really remember was his luxury car and the small flashy thing about the cursor that used to draw the car and help it in general. <br /> <br /> When I talk about it to anyone they can also remember very little. Was it real or maybe a dream?
