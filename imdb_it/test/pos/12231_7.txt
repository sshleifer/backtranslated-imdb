Most Christmas movies have a "redemption" theme, but most are a variation on a very similar plot. This film is extravagant and has an unusual plot. You may need to stay there for the first half where events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as incredible as in real life). Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he never invented anything in any of his cartoons - they're all based on real-life stories told by his fans. The second part begins to adapt to the plot together. I liked it. <br /> <br /> BTW, one reviewer noted that the idea of ​​someone who has no money available is not credible in these days of ATMs, but it is perfectly credible if you lost your wallet - who brings ATM cards elsewhere on a business trip?
