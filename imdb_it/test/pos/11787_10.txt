after my daughter was born in 1983, I needed to lose weight. I tried the 20 minute workout and was hooked. I lost about 50 pounds. it was the most weight I've ever lost in my life. I can't believe this show is forgotten. it would be a blessing if I had started a cable channel exclusively for the exercise and included 20 minutes training. I think this was the best training video ever made. I wish I could buy it somehow and somewhere. the routine was easy to learn and you worked very well. The workouts they have today are too complicated and too difficult to learn. please do your best to get this video back in circulation. I pray that it will be a blessing for all those who see and use.
