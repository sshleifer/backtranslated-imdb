(Possible spoilers included, but nothing decisive given away.) I just watched this classic low-budget movie on video, and it was eliminated from the energy level on the screen. All the actors are proud, especially John Daniels, they have to see another of his films. Not only does this film boast great performance, but it manages style sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see fragments of glass falling into a pool that erupts from the impact of the fallen man, I love the slow way it was used in the cinema of the 70s, dreamy and hypnotic. Imaginative and witty black boys bring out big lining while shabby and dingy lumps of white waste come to unpleasant ends. I love it, my vote 10 / 10. If this ever happens on DVD, count me for a purchase.
