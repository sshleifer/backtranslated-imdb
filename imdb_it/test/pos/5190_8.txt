Naked City: JWAB does a good job of balancing its two A-B stories, although I'm not very fond of many plot films. And Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance make a great double screen. However, I'm not sure of the kind of message a movie sends when two flat foot country girls can run away for free with a murder, a gold theft and, to top it all, win a flight back home (in first class not less - at least from the appearance of their clothing in any case). Damn, I guess that blue wall of silence is still pretty to think of! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
