This is an excellent James Bond film. Although it is not part of the original and most famous series, and is an independent film, it is very well done. Attracting Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as the film was titled in a way that refers to his past vow of not playing Bond anymore. Connery was as good as he was in his first appearances on 007. The script is exceptional, as are photography and performances. It is the first film I remember with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this film; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to the aging of Bond and to the changing times and attitudes of the British secret services were very amusing. The 007 gadgets have matched those of the other James Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which obviously could not be used by this competing production. It was rather surprising for me to see two excellent James Bond films released in the same year, this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 1980s were the first pinnacle of these things and their use in this film made it a very contemporary film. The film is actually a different version of Thunderball, updated with the latest technology. Regardless of the repeated theme, there are enough differences to make it more fun. I will watch it frequently.
