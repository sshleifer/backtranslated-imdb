Lackawanna Blues is a moving story of a boy who grew up in a house with some rather unusual people. <br /> <br /> The editing and the soundtrack involve you in history and allow you to experience the film in the way the writer really wanted it to be seen. <br /> <br /> Music is really tied to the story, which made the characters come to life. The editing made the story more progressive and appealing. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the cast's performances, particularly from S. Epatha Merkerson. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see the one-man show of this film writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
