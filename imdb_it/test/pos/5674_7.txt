"Black Water" is a film that in a sense surprised me and definitely exceeded my initial expectations. "Black Water" is really a very well-structured, unpredictable, electrifying, well-directed and disturbing film. The plot is somehow original and will surely keep you curious. One thing I love about this film is directing, mainly because of how it exceeded my initial expectations. My original expectations about "Black Water" were that it was a poorly made, acted, directed, stimulated and boring film. He really wasn't. Well, acting is nothing to praise for there were moments when I felt I didn't show enough emotions, and there are some phrases that seem so scripted. Anyway, I love the direction because all the shots look predictable, but they're not. Like when you watch him say that the camera makes a slow shot of water, and that's enough, you're as if the croc was about to attack. However the croc's attacks are very unpredictable (which was bad for me as it doesn't take much into films like this), and this makes you jump. Besides, I like it to be one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden sound explosion to make you jump, but instead on the actual movie. I also like the way the story talks about people who are trapped in these trees, they made it very real and it certainly kept their eyes on the screen. I must say that I didn't think the opening 20 was done so well, and I think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life. I also don't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters' situation look completely hopeless when it really wasn't. Also, again, I don't think some of the characters' actions were realistic. For example, I wouldn't go anywhere near the water knowing it was a crocodile, not to mention a murderer. However, these problems are not that important, and I was still able to enjoy the film. Overall, as far as movies go, I've seen better, but for horror movies about animal attacks (a genre that is easily scarred to me) it's one of the best you'll see. And it's definitely not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth shooting.
