I'm not sure if I like this movie or not. I think it's creepy and completely weird. Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but I don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves' performance was really good, and I really felt his character. All in all I think the whole cast gave great performances as if the characters were real. I didn't like it a bit, but honestly I felt sorry for the others (Keanu Reeves). I'd like to know if that was the original ending that the film should have had, since it wasn't finished as I expected. I was disappointed with the ending and I don't think it did justice to the rest of the film. If you like bizarre, bizarre and really different films, choose this one. If you like normal things, please stay away.
