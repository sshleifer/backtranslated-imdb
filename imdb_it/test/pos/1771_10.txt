I saw this movie when I was very young in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing it in this movie. He sent me a signed photo. This film was directed by Jacques Tourneur, and in addition to Jean Peters in the lead role. He also presents Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. He also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar to play the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando played by Zapata) (1952). And he also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then I have tried to find a place where it is available, but so far I have not been successful. Does anyone have any suggestions on where I can find and buy this movie? This comment contains spoilers, I'm not aware of it.
