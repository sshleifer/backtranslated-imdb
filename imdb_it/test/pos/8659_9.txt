first real movie in this year. fantastic long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so specific for Nordic cinema (left by Dogma). I find a real auteur film. Athmospherique :-) He simply delighted all my senses and keep in mind how the image becomes violent and painful during the scenes in which he is trying to kill himself. This is the point that I do not believe holds up throughout the plot. Why, if this were an ideal world, could you not die but kept your conscience? Either it was the real world with "made-to-measure" rules or it was a "fantastic" world but in this case no incident like the people who remembered what it was like before can happen. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Kafka and perhaps more, of Huxley's Brave New World, especially in that part where sex was actually available to everyone, since it was considered a right to pleasure. A plot was missing, but I think it was better this way, since you understood and perceived the whole strange behavior of all, the absurdity and the lack of real sensations in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I also think the end was brilliant. the real world is really a homo homini lupus, you are eaten if you are not strong enough.
