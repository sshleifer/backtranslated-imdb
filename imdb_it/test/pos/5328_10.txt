I was looking at external reviews (Ebert, etc.) For this film and they were all rather negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that everyone made the same point. Critics were worried that the film focused on what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child. Of course, this is a disturbing image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story to find out why the murder happened and blame the culprits. They want the guilt to be cultured and resolved. Well, the status quo theme is what the film is parodying. Just like the company, the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic work. Maybe there isn't a simple question to answer here? There is much more to what happened then on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what is happening, but rather to understand why. What bothers me so much about these inane reviews is that all they look at in terms of performance is Spacey and Cheadle, which were both fantastic (and in general they are). But there are other great performances at work here besides the only two Hollywood icons. Gosling offers an incredible performance that really only someone of his extreme talent could offer. Somehow, Gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child fun. This irritates many, I'm sure. However, if you watch the movie, they see what Leeland's motivation is, it's wrong, but it's not bad. Malone is also at the top of his game as another confused young character. Basically, the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the film. The main theme is life itself and how people deal with the problem, the ups and downs and how they sometimes try to help others face their lives (which doesn't seem to work very well). There is a lot of good and bad in this world and the way we handle each has a direct impact on how much more good and bad they will occur, and sometimes a confusing attempt to do good can lead to a lot of others bad. I think this is one of the most memorable films in some time and has an ending that is as touching as anything in the history of recent cinema. I firmly believe that people should see this movie with an open mind.
