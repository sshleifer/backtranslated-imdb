The Merchant of the Four Seasons is not at all what I would call a happy film, or even one that struck me to the point of praising him to heaven (there are other Fassbinder films for this, like Veronika Voss and the underrated Satan Brew). But certainly it is no less a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those of a society that you and I and others that we possibly know could know, or not really want to know. I imagine that in the early 1970s a generation from the Second World War in Germany had a stigma to live with, but did its best just to get by. This is a stigma that floats throughout this film, and in many cases in Fassbinder's work in general, but mainly because with the Four Seasons takes the middle class, and a particular married couple into consideration - the Hans, distant, depressed An angry fruit seller and his long-suffering wife - it's nothing less than looking for realism in the guise of melodrama. If Cassavetes were a crazy German he could make this film, maybe even just like a lark. <br /> <br /> The story seems simple enough, in which Hans's drinking loses control, he beats his wife (this scene is one of the most difficult to take, perhaps in any film, like Fassbinder's camera she lingers without a cut while his wife is left helpless and her daughter tries to stop him in his frenzy) and then she is ready to leave him. While in the room, his family holds him, makes a divorce request and gets a heart attack right there. He resumes, his activity suddenly begins to roar again with the help of some good (or less) employees - yet this continues only with his desire, another woman and his despair in general. <br /> <br /> And yet it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder seeks, and manages for the most part, to reach a state of mind of terror, of a tense atmosphere in a kitchen or bedroom or for road that you can cut with a knife and bleed. The weakest part of all this could be acting ... at least that was my initial impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, can be a made-up presence, with only the slightest movements on his face and eyes, and for a while he doesn't seem to be a very good actor. The actress who plays his wife, Irm Hermann, and his sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) are better off, but only because he is given more to do conventionally, like crying or looking worried. It takes some time to adapt to what is essentially a void in his boyfriend Hans, something of his own psychological torment or self-pity that pervades himself and those around him who just want to move forward with a sense of normalcy , especially once Hans was successful. <br /> <br /> Not everything snaps together in The Merchant of Four Seasons, but enough to make it recommend to those looking for a different slice of life than you could use with more modern American movies. The world of Fassbinder here is a battle between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the hard and overwhelming sense of humanism that he personally feels and places in characters that, for better or for worse, we identify ourselves in some way. Are Epps a family you know? Or could you even be them? Who says It is a methodical study of the tragic void in the human spirit, and its objectives are all achieved.
