This movie shouldn't be fun, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Not designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through a number of cartoons. <br /> <br /> It is not written as an action adventure, but my wrist worked more than once. <br /> <br /> Just like life, this film does not manipulate your emotions and tells you how to feel. It is simply, and you react. <br /> <br /> If you don't find it funny, sad or moving, I suspect you say more about the movie than you do. <br /> <br /> It is incredible and refreshing to see a director celebrate with all his heart that we are all human, and embrace that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing, over and over again all the time that we must. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day
