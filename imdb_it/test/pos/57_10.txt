I gave this film my rare 10 stars. <br /> <br /> When I started watching it for the first time and realized that it wouldn't be a film with a very strong plot, I almost turned it off. I'm very glad I didn't. <br /> <br /> This is a movie based on the character, a true story, which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, beautiful girl (inside and out). The black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of Lackawanna. <br /> <br /> Very interesting not only his strong characterizations of Tata and the people who lived in his retirement, but also gives us an aspect of what life was like and the community for African Americans in the 1950s, before integration, the positive and negative sides of segregation and how it ultimately influenced and changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent performances by all the cast members, there are some beautiful songs and dances of that era.
