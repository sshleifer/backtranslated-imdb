One day a red cat is sick of being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if it were a skunk. Then he paints black with a white stripe along his back and adds some Limburger cheese to make it smell. At first life could not be better for him, the dog runs away and the butcher leaves his shop letting the cat go with a pile of meat. Just as he thinks that everything is perfect, he is noticed by a real skunk, not only by a skunk, but by the eccentric Pepé Le Pew. Pepé misses the poor cat for a female skunk and chases him thinking that his protests are just shyness. Our poor cat thinks he escaped when he threw a skunk skin from a tall building so that Pepé thought he died, at first it seems to work but, as he creeps in, Pepé sees him and instantly forgets the dead skunk. Eventually the cat realizes that it would have been better to be kicked and attacked than to be coveted by a mischievous skunk ... there is also a nice finish for the skunk when her wife finds out what she's done. <br /> <br /> This was a pretty funny introduction to Pepé Le Pew, who at the time was simply too loving, but now he looks like a stupid sexually harassing molester, even though he was eventually punished for his behavior .
