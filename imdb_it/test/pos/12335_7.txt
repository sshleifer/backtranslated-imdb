I also saw it in the cinema in the 80s and I never forgot it, even though I've never seen it anywhere. <br /> <br /> I don't know if if I had seen it now it would seem dated, but remembering the plot and comparing it with some of the terrible modern films I saw on Zone Horror I should think it would be very good. <br /> <br /> I still remember his coffin opening and opening and all the corpses were reviving, and the blue flash. Having seen hundreds of horror films and still remembering this, it must be good.
