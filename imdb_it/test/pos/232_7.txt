Although the Cover Girl plot is very fragile and tired, it serves quite well as an anchor for the musical numbers of Kern and Gershwin. After her starring role in Gilda, Hayworth chose to star in this musical that seems tailor-made for her. Besides looking more beautiful than ever, she also impresses with her dance. Gene Kelly, who has been on loan at Columbia from MGM, combines it with dance and the sequence in which she is enchanted with her shadow has been well done. The supporting characters also acted competently. Personally, I didn't like Cover Girl as much as the Hayworth musicals made with Fred Astaire. However, Cover Girl is still very fun and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
