This image has no major explosions or expensive sequences of chases. However, it has really wonderful performances and an exceptional script that places it at the top of my "indie-must-see list". Taylor Nichols and James Remar are fantastic together. The young cast surprised me with a very consistent acting. Usually, indie images have a weak connection, but there are no weak links here. Impressive. Go get this.
