Like most people out there who have seen James Bond 007 movies. Most people never knew that Thunderball was originally the FIRST 007 movie, but after Ian Fleming, he wrote the story with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham . The other 2 authors brought Ian Fleming to court and WON THE CASE providing evidence that ian fleming had taken the ideas of SPECTER (Special Executive In CounterIntelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion). So instead of creating Thunderball, they (fleming, broccoli, saltzman) continued to do Dr. NO. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best, from getting sean connery to returning again, it was paid over 5,000,000 for NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery have had problems on the set, so much so. But overall this movie was up there, I think with (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr No) those are my favorites of the bond series. David Dryer was hired for special photographic effects, he was currently working on Bladerunner before never repeating. The $ 100 million yacht makes the flying saucer similar to a canoe. This film played the best Villian in a film about bonds right behind dr. Klaus Maria Brandeau has held this neurotic business together as peaceful ways, with a little wit about his authority over the bond. Barbara Carrera was excellent as a fatima blush. <br /> <br /> The music was better than any soundtrack that did not contain John Barry in backround music in most film bonds. Michel Legrand is not great in the United States compared to most in Europe, he played with the davis miles and many other great jazz musicians over the years. It's a bit bland at times, but the 007 theme that happens about 3 or 4 times in the movie NEVER SAYS IT AGAIN Is so beautiful, I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is back One More Time <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton explained that I thought, WANT TO SING ON A SUPERMAN OR A SUPERHERO, he or she must be human and have feelings. It was by far the BEST TRUE SERIOUS OF BOND'S FLEMING. But Sean Connery shows that he can still do the role he and others follow, I bet at 75 now that he could still play a Villian role in a MCCLORY 007 movie if he ever emerges. <br /> <br />
