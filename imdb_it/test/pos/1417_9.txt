Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel stupid. But it's a great movie. Not very funny, but very very intriguing. The film revolves around wheelchair-bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein seem average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy and black holes. Everyone, at one time or another, in a very intense moment, comes to a moment when they think they have understood the universe and the cosmos and swear that as soon as they are disposed of, they will write everything. Well, here's a man who actually kept that feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who despite having suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease has become the greatest mind the world has ever seen. Look at this and hear how he formulated theories about black holes. Awesome. You will not be the same after seeing it.
