I entered the cinema, without expectations for the film I was about to testify, "Everything is Illuminated". I came out with a joy that I just heard in American movies. The actor's directorial debut, Leiv Schreiber, the film follows a man on his journey into the past, accompanied by an eccentric group that includes a punk dancer who barely speaks English from Eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog. The first half of the film is fun and intelligent with an extremely European flavor in the use of small but wonderful characters, while the second part of the film descends into a dark story of discovery and holocaust. This little film brings out so many emotions and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and it is more than a simple story of lighting, but also of relationships and connections. Acting is incredibly powerful, the story is mysterious and interesting, and the artistic attraction of cinematography, to die for. With some brilliant and absolutely moving scenes "Everything is Illuminated" managed to capture my heart.
