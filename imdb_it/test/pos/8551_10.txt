I was wrapped up in seeing that even many other people liked this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was in my early teens and then again several times late at night a few times later. So unfortunately, no more. Now I am almost 49 years old so I would like it to be made available on DVD. Why not? The best role of Anthony Quinn, no one could have been more suitable for the part or parts he plays - I mentioned it to other film lovers of similar age and alas, nobody I know remembers. As the daughter of a generation that went through the Second World War and its consequences (and myself deeply fascinated by what the generation endured), I imagine that this film gave me a wonderful cinematic vision of some of the harrowing questions of the day. For the classic final scenes this film is a slice.
