Never published anything here before, but after seeing Noroi I felt I had to write my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First of all, don't compare this to Blair Witch, this film definitely deserves better! In a nutshell, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen many!). I really liked the way the film looks not like a standard horror movie, but a documentary shot by a journalist (I think?) Called Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without ruining much on the plot, I can say that it starts with Kobayashi doing research on a series of apparently unrelated events, which turns out to be connected to something much more obscure and sinister. <br /> <br /> While the story may not be so original in itself, what really fascinated me with Noroi was the incredibly disturbing atmosphere. If you're looking for financial fright and jumping scenes, this movie may not be right for you. This film focuses on the mood it presents, with disturbing images and a general feeling of predictive suspense. Filming in a documentary style makes it even more credible. <br /> <br /> Also this is helped a lot by acting, which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the film! Much better than in most other films in this genre. <br /> <br /> Good enough from me, I highly recommend Noroi to everyone, it's full of suspense, creepy, well acted and the first film that scared me for centuries.
