I was so happy to know that Hari Om will finally be released in cinemas in 2007. I saw this movie three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and waited for its release since then, so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India .... colorful, magical, stimulating. Apart from a rather strange Hollywood rickshaw hunting scene, this film is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood-style song and a dance film, but it also has drama, romance and humor. The interactions between the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist are a good reflection of the fundamental differences between oriental and western lifestyles and philosophy. The characters are a bit generic but the acting was very good. Visually this film is a blast since you really have an idea of ​​how to drive through Rajasthan is like ... dreamlike. Sometimes it's hard to believe that everything you're seeing and experiencing is real ... the film has the same quality. Great soundtrack too!
