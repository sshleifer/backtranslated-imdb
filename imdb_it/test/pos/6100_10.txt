Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra in this TV Lifetime movie (shot in Seattle). It's really interesting when you take part in the production of a film, because I'm usually still in the process of writing parts again (as was the case here) or making important changes and modifications to the final parts. <Br /> <br /> Both my husband and I worked as extras in this film, and I remember them discussing on the set how it was still to be determined whether the child died or not. Frankly, I never thought that the character of Margaret Colin really had adequate punishment for her crime of hitting and running, lying to the police, covering up, etc. You could imagine how the ending would have to change if it ended up killing the blow and escaping the victim instead of her coming out of her coma, okay? Just something to think about. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play a police detective you can see for a fraction of a second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often (we counted four times). Margaret Colin was very good at working and down to earth, even though Lisa Vidal (now a regular life) was detached. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film turned out to be a 7/10, but like another the poster commented, it's still a real tear-jerker and makes a fantastic movie on Saturday afternoon.
