As I write these comments I watch a DVD of this movie that I just received from a mail order retailer, and I find it holds up very well, with strong characterizations, credible situations and well-organized action scenes. <br /> <br /> It's been 45 years, maybe 50, since I saw HELL BELOW, but the only scene that deeply impressed me was the scene of the death of Sterling Holloway, which many other commentators have mentioned here . I have not yet arrived at that scene in this vision, but I can guarantee what other comments have said: once you see the scene of the death of Sterling Holloway in this film, you will never, ever forget it. Judging by how strong the film is until now, I expect the scene to live up to its memory - unquestionably one of the greatest scenes of death in the history of cinema. The film is worth seeing for just an instant, but even without it, it would be a first-class underwater drama.
