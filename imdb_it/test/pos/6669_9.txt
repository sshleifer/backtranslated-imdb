finally, a film that manages the probability of alien visits with the right depth and loving warmth. In the event that we are not alone, I believe that these visitors are too touristy to take care of us or give that bunch of anthropocentric goofs a stable proof of their existence. we would not even interfere in the battle rites of some troubled desert tribes, unless we are willing to play tricks with our travel insurance, eh? <br /> <br /> however, the film describes the transitional investment of a tired mind and the body from a superior entity. this happens in a non-spectacular and rather unrecognized way, but here we are dealing with a movie, right? therefore the hospitalization of prot is only a triggering factor of the plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff's bridges are great as usual, but the space is exhilarating. the role seems to be tailored for him, convincing and lovingly "crazy". eating banana with peel, sitting on a tree, giving your doctor a bad experience with speed, wisdom and (above all!) amazing quotes. they made me think and philosophize for hours. <br /> <br /> is an encouraging film, to say the least, and the edward shearmur soundtrack is simply beautiful. go and get a copy, take a ray of light. now.
