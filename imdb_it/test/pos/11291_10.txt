I heard about Begotten for the first time when a girl of mine got it in a "cult classics" section of my local video retailer. He knew I liked obscure art films, so I rented and brought them home. He sat on my TV for a couple of days and then put it in the VCR just before going to bed. I thought that maybe I will see how it is before and then I will devote more time to it the next day. What followed was that he actually woke me up. I sat through the whole movie and loved it. After passing the credits I looked at it again. Only after seeing the closing credits do you have an idea of ​​who is who. After knowing that you can watch it again with renewed appreciation. Don't listen to the people who break up this movie. It is not for everyone. If you are someone who does not like to read the subtitles of this film is not for you (not that there are subtitles, there is no dialogue at all). If you are someone who owns Rush Hour 2, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This film is truly original and inspiring. Does what other movies have never done. It doesn't look anything else and is bolder than anything else out there - from 1989 to the current date. You can say that all those involved in making this film really love the art of what they do and understand what can be captured in cinematic form. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to be "entertained", then the film is not for you. However, it is pure escape in some extreme form and in the form of a movie. It is as if someone had strings attached to my head and recorded one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you are really sitting looking at the images, dissecting the actors' action, and not sitting there playing the guitar passively, but looking and not blinking. <br /> <br /> People compare it to Eraserhead but Begotten is much more. I'm not kidding when I say it's my favorite movie. It is an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically stimulating and hypnotic. A review I read about it is very true, however: "no one will go through Begotten without being marked".
