My family watches this movie over and over again. Our 3 year old also loves it. I like the "goodness" of the film. Give the foreigner a chance ... to show goodwill to those who obviously need unconditional consent. The film gives a feeling of benevolence and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes it so attractive are the personalities of the Velvet brothers. The bird lover. The insect lover The boy's lover! Very cute and happy movie. There is one thing, however it is irritating. That's how Mrs. Brown often makes Mr. Brown look silly or unwise. She sometimes comes out as a true acquaintance, and he as an idiot, who is not. Too bad to put it in such a beautiful story. However, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful old movie!
