I was a little worried about the actors and the acting in Italy, then came "The consequences of love" and Toni Servillo. It had been so long since I had seen such a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino wrote a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in films in recent years. The film is not completely perfect but "Titta Di Girolamo" will stay with you for a long time after watching the film. Toni continues to act in films, you are certainly the coolest actor today (and not only in Italy, his interpretation deserves international acclaim). I consider this film 9/10.
