This is one of Marion Davies best talkies - and one of the few to allow her to show off her skill as a physical comedian who was so endearing in her silent films. OK, so it makes a heavy tap number, but even Ruby Keeler's dances of the era don't hold up for younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls into an incredible melodrama in the last reel. It's pretty theatrical, and it's obviously adapted from a game ... but not quite as good. However, there are snappy dialogues and slapstick. It's worth a look.
