Lubitsch's Touch is more than ever in this film. Humor at any time and very subtle. The plot is simple but delightfully transformed by the director. The cut of the film is very intelligent and adds to the comic effect. A true piece of comedy that is not becoming so old for a 21st century viewer. The character is played by Gary Cooper and in particular Claudette Colbert so intelligent and mean with this poor Michael in the film. Avoid all the traps of her husband and turn the situation to her advantage, a lot of fun. And no problem, with Lubitsch, there is always a happy end. A film for men too confident with women. Don't let your girlfriend watch this movie ...
