Totally different, with a lot of understatement and black comedy, this is a film that few can see, but those who do will remember it. This film creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way. What is it? Estrangement, I believe. Probably up to the viewer, but I discovered that this film tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the design furniture and perfect facades. I don't know if I'm right. But this film really struck me. Watch it. I really hope that the team behind this movie will make more films, and that they will continue to do it themselves, somehow a bizarre style. And I forgot: The Casting here are superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g perfecting himself as Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he's doing and why. The recognition of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city) is what makes it annoying. All the others do as they are told and pretend (?) To be happy. This film is a good and fun commentary on life in 2006.
