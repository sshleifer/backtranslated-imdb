This is a film worthy of note for what is not shown as much as what it is. What is shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily when the nineteenth century gave way to the 20th, a lifestyle that made the "New" American world dream. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a village, just a stone cottage set among the hard and inflexible stones of a country that cannot offer even a blade of green grass. An opening sequence sees Mancuso's males climbing barefoot on a steep hill, stones in their mouth to offer in a sanctuary at the top in exchange for a "sign" that they should leave for the New World or stay where they are. It further shows the life aboard the transatlantic, the masses piled up, anxious to breathe free, and the conditions in Ellis Island where, their journey is not yet finished, they are interrogated and examined to prove their 'suitability' to enter America. What is NOT shown is the ship in Longshot, or ANY any shot that will identify it as a large ocean liner; what is not shown is all that could identify America, no clich√© views of New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, so that Ellis Island can be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most notable shot is that of a Crane Camera that looks down on hundreds of people jammed together; slowly, almost imperceptibly, two-thirds of Screen Left people begin to separate from the third to Screen Right and we realize that those on the left are actually on board the ship and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful affirmation of society is fragmented . There is a strong documentary sense throughout the world, as if we were following a real ship full of immigrants, even though it was scrupulously written and is clearly an amalgamation of families / conditions typical of the era. With almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it is not for the popcorn brigade at the Multiplex but for the rest of us it is a really good movie.
