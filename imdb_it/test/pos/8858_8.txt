The Thing must be one of the great films of all time. Obviously the revolutionary special effects at the time of its release struck me so much, in 1982 my mind came to me, I had never seen anything like it! However, although the effects themselves made the film more horrible, it was the story itself, the soundtrack, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarchist and the interaction and tension between the research station members condemned to make it a classic. <br /> <br /> Movies are not better than this! In the initial scene with the helicopter chasing this husky, it is assumed that some scientists were bored by some station that left some steam. Yet when you see them continue their hunt for the American base, then you think the Norwegians suffer from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. Yet this is compensated by the threatening musical score that opens up the time! You just know that something is not right! At this point it is a mystery until "the thing" is revealed. <br /> <br /> However, the mystery returns because it becomes a kind of sci-fi style of Agatha Christie "che dunnit" (ie ten little Indians) because the members don't know which of their teams is really an alien. The suspects continue to go back and forth between them all as one at a time are finally thrown down or revealed as aliens. Distrust among the station crew absorbs as the film progresses to the final showdown. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of progress in computer graphics and film production, the special effects in the "What" do not carry the same weight it had in 1982, but apart from that it holds very well in the round with some great cast performances.
