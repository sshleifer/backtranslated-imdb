I remember seeing him as a child as part of the Children's Film Foundations Friday Film Specials on CBBC and recently came across a copy. <br /> <br /> In the twenty years since my last vision this film has lost nothing. <br /> <br /> It is a striking story that attracts with Cornish folklore and adds elements of truly gruesome images of the ghost of young miner Billy. <br /> <br /> Filmed in a wonderfully scenic way The area of ​​Port Loe in Cornwall, the film uses the combination of jagged coastlines and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to do in this CFF drama, something that has long been lost on children's television and is worth a look if you can find a copy.
