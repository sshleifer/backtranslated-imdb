After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a pack of two with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favorites. <br /> <br /> Aristocats is a classic, certainly. It may not be a five-star classic, but it's a fun movie and makes evening entertainment. It's a bit of a light refreshment from the darkest, most serious Disney classics. Aristocats try to be a light musical comedy, and I think it succeeds. <br /> <br /> The plot doesn't make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it's certainly not weak. The animation and the backgrounds are a bit scratchy in the places, typical of the Disney movies of the 70s, but they have a rustic, old-fashioned charm. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats are the strengths, the characters, the music and humor. Music is really memorable - try to get rid of 'Everybody wants to be a cat' in a hurry! The songs were written by Sherman Brothers, who also made music for The Jungle Book. There was a song called "She Never Felt Alone" that would have been in the film, but unfortunately it didn't reach the final feature film. It's a pity, because I think it would have adapted very well. <br /> <br /> The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris, and is basically Baloo in a feline form. Eva Gabor gives Duchessa this warm and maternal feeling and the kitten's voices actually sound like children, and not an actor who imitates a child's voice. The secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you end up understanding their personality. Edgar, the 'bad' butler plays a role similar to Cruella De Vil, but is more comical than scary, often ending up in fun situations. Even if he is the villain, he is still lovable. <br /> <br /> The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really took me to pieces, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs, who tend to argue about who is "the leader". I could go on, but I won't ruin it. But I can tell you, The Aristocats is fun and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary humor. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line - The Aristogats may not be the goal of Disney, or even their strongest film from the 70s (that award is a link between The Rescuers and Whinnie the Pooh). But it's a fun enjoyment and it's sure to entertain. If you are looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off watching Bambi. But if you want to spend a fun evening, The Aristocats is the way to go. It is a fascinating and lovable film and it is impossible not to love. To enjoy! (And besides, it's nice to have a movie where cats aren't seen as bad guys).
