This is a film that I always come back to, for a variety of reasons. As a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the eastern front in World War II, he is a powerful one. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film that help capture the horror of war, such as the battle of tanks. Moreover, from what I can see, the experiences documented in the film are largely "true" - if you read the book by A. Beevor "Stalingrad" you will understand what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it does not allow the character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a survival story, which attempts to represent the battle primarily from the point of view of the ordinary soldier (German). I read somewhere that the original script had to be softened, which doesn't surprise me at all - if they tried to really show what the battle was like, it would be almost impossible to make it safe. Even so, there are still some hard times to watch - this was done before Private Ryan, but maybe it's even harder to hit in some places. Just a word of caution: don't buy the dubbed "English" version, it's pretty horrible and ruin the film - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's much more powerful. You may need to buy a DVD from region 1 of the film in this case, as I did.
