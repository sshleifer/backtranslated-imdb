This film must have been quietly released in some other corner of the world, perhaps even in English. I hope no one has understood a word, there is still nothing to understand in this film! Haahaa! Call me a fool, but I think this is one of the best movies ever. Why should I reach this conclusion? Because it's my national past sabotaging horrible movies and this begs him every two minutes! Once I became a fan of the Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it somewhere and use it. Pretty sure! The version they acquired was called "Cave Dwellers" using some strange introductory images, not even from the film itself (apparently they were ashamed to use the filming of their movie!). I can't say I recommend buying this movie. Rather, I highly recommend getting the MST3K version. Sure to find it more wherever MST3K DVDs are sold, don't miss out!
