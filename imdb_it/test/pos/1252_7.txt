As a word of explanation, Disney "The Kid" has absolutely nothing in common with the classic Charlie Chaplin of 1921 of the same name. What we have is pleasant enough, even if unbelievable, to feel a good family comedy as only Disney people can provide. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays an egocentric padded shirt of an "image consultant". It degrades, not only its customers, but also those close to it. You know he will have to change before the final credits. <br /> <br /> In his life comes a chapter of his past in the form of the character of Willis as an 8-year-old nerd played with the cutesy pie conviction of Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these children somewhere). This forces Willis to come to terms with his past and well ... you know the rest. <br /> <br /> It appears that Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his executive assistant. Both have little to do as most of the film involves the interaction between the characters of Willis and Breslin. <br /> <br /> "The Kid", although not the biggest of the Disney movies, but you can still sit down and watch with your family and come away with a feeling of warmth.
