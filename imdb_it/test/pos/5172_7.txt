Even if I had never seen or heard Georgetown, CO, this would be a sweet little film. But my father was born and raised there, and those are my uncle's horses that you see pulling the sled! So this film is very special to me. Many of the interiors are shot in the buildings and houses I recognize and are very realistic. The story is a bit chaotic, but Georgetown is the kind of magical place where things like that could happen. John Denver was a better actor than a lot of people who give him credit. Mary Wickes plays the kind of "savvy lady with a lot of sass", she has played so well in many other films, in particular "White Christmas". I usually can't go out there in winter, so I like to watch this movie over the Christmas season to "lead" me to my next trip!
