I've been waiting for years for a new DVD issue of this wonderful film. I have a max beta recording with FRENCH language. Unfortunately, MGM omits the French track of its recent DVD ... Only English spoke a subtitle in French ... I don't know how to recommend MGM: I wrote e-mails to them but, of course, no reply. If I insist, it is because exceptionally, the dubbing track in French was spectacular, fun, well written etc ... George C. Scott acting is always exceptional and, for people born like me during the 50s, Diana Rigg represents something of very different from Madonna (for example). Thanks for the help ... Best regards ...
