I've only seen three episodes of Hack, with David Morse, and he seems to have lost 37 episodes! well this if ITV 3 is showing them in chronological order. I just saw 'Misty Blue' (episode 38). I really liked the 3 episodes, but then I'm a fan of David Morse, (esp St. Elsewhere). For those who read this, Hack is excellent. Too bad it's broadcasted on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can't get used to the idea that David plays a bent policeman, but we all know he is the good boy wrongly accused. I see that Gary Cole has guest stars, what happened to "Midnight Caller"? I just wonder if Hack is available on DVD (yet). Lovin it. Greetings.
