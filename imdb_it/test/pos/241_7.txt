Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, fun and delightful musical with Gene Kelly. Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker who dreams of becoming a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, his career does not get anywhere in Danny McGuire's nightclub. When one of his fellow dancers says he is about to participate in a Cover Girl competition, he decides to follow his dreams and enters. He reminds his grandmother's publisher, of which he was deeply in love many years ago. But when he finds this success, his boyfriend is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> I had never seen Rita before, and I'm so glad I did! She has such a stage presence and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers here, not the best of any musical, but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I didn't like was the character of Gene Kelly. He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway, this is perhaps the only criticism I have about this film. Cover Girl is a glorious and soft film: perfect escape. It's not everyone's ideal film, but it's still a wonderful film, thanks to the power of Rita Hayworth. Great movie, really hit.
