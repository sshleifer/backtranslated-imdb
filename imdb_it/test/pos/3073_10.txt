If you don't like Mel Brooks, you won't like this movie. This is a given. Because someone wouldn't like his films to be unknown to me, but for those who can't see the light, just avoid them. <br /> <br /> All the others: this is a classic. The whole cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a brilliant, intelligent English Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck behaves properly like Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual distracted and irritated self, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence like "Mervyn" The Rottingham Sheriff and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and the sadly underused Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men. <br /> <br /> There are similarities with Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles ... and every other Mel Film by Brooks. But why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn? References to pop culture in this film are old enough to be funny again ... from the point of view of a 16-year-old boy at least. It is a complete and complete parody, a game for a laugh every second. Some of them do not work, but most do, and well. I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the movie! <br /> <br /> Of course, if being hampered by continuous visual and verbal gags is not your style, you wouldn't like this. This is not an Academy Award winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what happens when you're trying. If you want an uninterrupted laugh, surprisingly well-developed characters and striking phrases for a lifetime, look at this.
