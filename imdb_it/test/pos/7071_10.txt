Excuse me if I'm wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most aggressive films in the history of Mexican cinema for many reasons. We can have lots of ingredients for a perfect bourgeois Mexican family breakfast: a cup of Buñuel's surreal motifs with a small drop of Ripstenian's desolate scenery; a kilo of phallic symbols around the film and a complex psychological complexity, more than the films of Happiness and the Dogma by Todd Solondz. There is a lot of deafness, black humor, repressed dreams (Teodoro's dream of flying), lack of incestuous control (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), meaningless parallel stories, discreet violence, anachronisms and <br /> <br /> a small sign of hope (highlighted in Luzma, the return home of her husband and "Un poco Mas" used for leit-motif). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a fascinating character (I think so Bukoskian), the king without a crown who does not expect anything but a broken nose. Luzma (Maria Rojo), the amiable wife, made a lot of faces, but the only thing that worried her was that her children had breakfast; she is a loser in many ways and sensual in a few moments, but you fall in love with her. The dragging of the soundtrack (too many woods) feeds the lack of technical, intentional merits, of course: out of focus shots, overexposed close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzying pans and sudden cuts in the versions. "Crónica" is something difficult to digest, it gets stuck in the throat and everything helps to do it. It tastes bitter, like a rotten and sour orange juice like expired milk, but you want to enjoy it. So I suggest you get some Melox before the show, because after all you won't be hungry.
