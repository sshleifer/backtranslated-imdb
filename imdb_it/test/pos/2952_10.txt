For those who still prefer films focused on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see. <br /> <br /> By putting the spotlight on your family, Block covers terrain is off-limits to most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does it without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Besides taking a look at a family - and, by extension, each family - Block has also described a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if it was intentional, but inevitable because of the archived content. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
