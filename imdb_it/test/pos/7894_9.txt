I was surprised by the way I invested emotionally in this film. Peter Boyle is a tour de force as the socially conservative bigot of the working class, Joe. I actually sympathized with some of his complaints. Of course he does not mention the historical socio-economic reasons underlying many of his prejudices. The film also offers interesting information on the rapid change that American society was going through at the time. Recreational drugs, casual sex and the challenge of parental authority became fashionable and replaced the most honored traditions of respect for God, the country and old age. Susan Sarandon fans will be happy. Joe is his film debut. It also offers viewers a visual treatment near the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
