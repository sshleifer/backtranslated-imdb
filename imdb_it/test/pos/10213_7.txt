I saw it years ago, and it's fun, but not profound. The basic story is about a young man who dreams of Midian, although he is not sure where he is or even if he really exists. <br /> <br /> Follow Spoilers: Eventually he visits it, he is turned into a Nightbreed creature to be bitten by another So, he must help the other members of Nightbreed because they are attacked by Canadians. (Save for accents, they all behave like Good Ol 'Boys. Not very sympathetic to the Canadian psyche, eh?) Someone remarked for "monsters" or "Nightbreed", "Jewish" substitutes and for Canadians / humans , substitute, "Nazis", and you are supposed to have an idea of ​​the monsters' struggle against humans. Well, maybe. <br /> <br /> One of the main objections I had was that, while the underground city was interesting, it was rather ramshackle and, frankly, dirty. This must be a convention for films with underground settlements. You might think that if the monsters were the good guys, some would have at least a minimum of furniture. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit thin, but this is to introduce the characters. But it's fun enough for repeated viewing.
