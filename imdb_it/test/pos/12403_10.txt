This film is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City". He has a plot after another with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman and James Remar offering really great performances. However, this film is not for everyone. If you don't like films that "go all the way" to violence, then don't look at the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This is a really gritty and realistic teenage drama. I can't believe he came from the B-Movie king Roger Corman. This film is a must for those who are not weak at heart. Highly recommended.
