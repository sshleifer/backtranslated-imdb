It is a pity that iameracing wants to deny the reality of the purpose of Faulkner and Clarence Brown in the creation of the story and the movie of "Intruder In The Dust". I suppose the weight of a history of racism is hard to bear for any southern and I can understand it. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to borrow your capitalization) iameracing, there are many many places where blacks and whites in the South get along pretty well. But to deny the way blacks were and sometimes are forced to live, the conditions and injustices they had to endure are not imaginary. Sometimes black and white people got along for genuine affection and understanding. Sometimes it was just the time that blacks "knew their place". The point of making the character of Juano Hernandez (in the film and in the press) a somewhat thorny type, not hot and indistinct, was to emphasize the fact that bigotry is wrong in itself and that human rights are just that for all, regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. <br /> <br /> It would do well to stop denying the existence of racism and the serious damage it has done to Americans of all colors. The fact is that blacks (and others), as a rule, are no exception, receive the benefits of the judicial system in an impartial manner like whites. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like iameracing could say that these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. It would be a wonderful thing if the southern iameracing ancestors (if any) had never participated in any of the horrific racist actions that ruined the history of this country and I hope they didn't. If so, congratulations to them, but this fact, if true, does not cancel the fact that others did it. And even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the South (and in other areas, let's not forget the Civil War Era Revolts Project) were only half of them, just a third, making them less horrible? The murder of ten children, the hanging of ten men, the sexual assault of ten women is less horrible than the same things that happen to a hundred? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to remove the "Mississippi Burning" chip from our backs before seeing "Intruder In The Dust", well, I ask you, did the murders of civil rights activists happen or not? Why should it be forgotten? Forgiven? Could be. But in order to prevent their recurrence they cannot be forgotten or modified in minor occurrences. The racism that is displayed in "Intruder In The Dust" is displayed there quite intentionally. It's there to make a point. <br /> <br /> Cinematographically, it is also ridiculous that iameracing reduces the racial angle. Any viewer of films that were shot before the 1960s know that black actors / characters / actors were usually cast. Judging from our history of cinema; wars were always fought by middle-aged white men; There were no black people in the old West; it was possible to walk down a street in a big city and never meet a black person; there were no black ordinaries, taxi drivers, salesmen, salesmen, etc. Blacks had almost never been cast for a role unless the race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) had wanted to tell a simple story of murder, he probably wouldn't have turned Hernandez's character black. <br /> <br /> Racism exists iameracing. I am sure that, for different reasons, we both hope that this is not the case, but it does. Wanting things to be like we probably can't be helped, but it still doesn't make them that way.
