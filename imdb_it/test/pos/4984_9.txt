This was a very nice 1950s western, one of the best I've seen in a decade that featured that genre on screen and on TV. Surely there were three great actors on the pavilion: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in secondary roles. Ford had most of the dialogue. He was also the "good boy" while Robinson was the "bad guy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. He played the most important part of this film and the character he played was a little too contradictory sometimes. <br /> <br /> Ford handled his actor status very skilfully, as usual, especially in westerns. He played a good guy who didn't want to fight, he was a peaceful man ...... but if you pushed him ..... beware! <br /> <br /> History has had a beautiful mixture of action and calm, not exaggerating either. It had a vast Western setting that was put to good use with the CineamaScope widescreen. It also presents realistic people in a realistic environment. That credibility with the characters, especially with the support players, was really impressive. The men brought out the women in this film, acting and character. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only negatives of production. It is easy to understand why these two actresses never became stars. <br /> <br /> Even if you are over 50, this western is one that you will still find fast enough to have fun, no matter how old you are or what you are used to seeing. For classic cinema fans, this is almost a must with this cast and a good story. Highly recommended.
