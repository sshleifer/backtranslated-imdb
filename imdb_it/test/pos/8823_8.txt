Much of my childhood was spent in front of the wireless listening to Round the Horne or Hancock's Half Hour or watching Carry On movies. Probably the most famous line in the comedy "Infamy! Infamy! They've all had infamy!" it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a rare intuition of the man behind the comic figure and the entire production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy until the final summons of the coroner's court read in four different voices by Michael Sheen. He was brilliant in the role. Most of the other members of the Carry On team were so-so and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen brought the show and there should be a prize for him. <br /> <br /> He let me feel "wow". To quote Kenneth Williams, to the cynic who says "life is a joke", the only answer can be "Yes, well, let's do a good example".
