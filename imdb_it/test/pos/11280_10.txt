Sui generis. People, I'm not going to lie to you; Merhige is one or two wonder hits, but what a movie (almost sorry SUSPECT ZERO). I'm not going to pretend to understand it completely; half of what makes it is to try to guess what the hell they're doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro. <br /> <br /> Richard Corliss says, "It is as if a Druid cult had actually played three biblical stories: the creation, the Nativity and the torture and death of Jesus on Golgotha." This is not a bad description, but there seems to be more to it than the apparently one-to-one religious correspondences. <br /> <br /> There is an environmental theme right next to the surface - note that towards the end (after the sterility of the landscape) there are large pipes not unlike those of a construction site. Oh no, it's going to say look how people are raping Mother Nature. You rarely see a dead metaphor in action, and with this huge hyperbola, but seeing it act is bigger than the language implies. <br /> <br /> And yes, if you just want something to sync with a soundtrack death metal, it has the required atrocities. But as for myself and others like me, it's an important art film that should deserve a version of Criterion. It aligns right there with the FAUST from Murnau. <br /> <br /> ~ Ray
