I have just returned from the vision of this academic candidate for the academic award, and I was deeply touched and interested in exploring the works of this type that I had never heard of before. Of course, I'm a person fascinated by beautiful architecture, so I realize that others don't care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine if there were a couple of other visionaries in Philadelphia in the late 1960s, when Kahn's plans were a possibility, what a wonderful city center would be. If you wonder if you'll see something more about the Bangladesh building at the beginning of the film, be patient, because there it will provide the climax of the film at the end. <br /> <br /> His son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching and even funny at times. There is one of the funniest anti-visionary jokes ever captured on the camera. <br /> <br /> Completing the positive points of this doc is a moving soundtrack with excellent expressive string music. And expressiveness is an important point that can be found in Kahn's architecture. The considerations made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter and how Kahn's buildings put it together connect the overall experience of this film.
