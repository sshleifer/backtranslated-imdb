I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl in the heart. There are no films for children. I loved this because the worst thing was when one of the guys said "stupid". I applaud them for coming out and making a real family film. I rented it the first time we saw it and we know we want to buy it to add to our collection. My daughter can't stop talking about it. It goes hand in hand with our lifestyle. We live in eastern Texas. I hope to see other films for families like this. He even named one of our "Hokey Pokey Keen" calves !!! I can't say enough about this movie. I look forward to many other films like this one.
