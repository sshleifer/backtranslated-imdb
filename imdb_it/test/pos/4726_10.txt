This is one of the most undervalued films of the 90s. If you allow yourself to identify with the character of Patricia Arquette, you will find that it is a moving story of a woman who recovers a sense of purpose for her life and finds a new will to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's performance is courageous because it is deliberately "wooden" - it is a way of defining the spiritual death of her character, her complete lack of desire to be alive. He moves through life like a zombie because his family has been killed and he can't see the meaning of life. What moves is how, throughout history, it is awakened - by the Burmese landscape, by the beauty of its people and its landscapes, and by the primary choices that it is forced to confront. <br /> <br /> Boorman supports him visually (and Hans Zimmer supports him with one of his most beautiful and haunting scores) with a camera often static and with the propensity to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. We are looking outside, just like Arquette .... until he finds himself immersed in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for his life. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the 1954 film THE PURPLE PLAIN. It is a similar story in a similar environment and offers a fascinating comparison.
