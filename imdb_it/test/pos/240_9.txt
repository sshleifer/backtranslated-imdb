In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes when he participates and wins a contest as a Vanity magazine cover. She is invited to work in a large theater on Broadway, whose owner proposes it. He loses his happiness and starts drinking in his new lifestyle, losing the love of Danny and his old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and with magnificent parts, like the beautiful and talented Rita Hayworth who dances, sings and performs; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost bad with his chauvinist behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her wonderful in "Gilda", but she is stunning in "Cover Girl". According to the information on the VHS cover, "Cover Girl" was the first musical in which the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of simply being "thrown" into the film. My sixteen year old saw this movie with a friend of the same age at a recent Gene Kelly festival and loved "Cover Girl", so I have the courage to say that this classic is recommended to all movie fans and not only to old generations. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Modelos' ('Models')
