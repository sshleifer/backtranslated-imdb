-ha Carla Gugino * yay * and a lousy ending * boo * <br /> <br /> - "Jaded" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a city trying to escape from her past. While he meets us with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have fun. But one of the girls takes things a little too far and rapes her while the second girl blocks her. It is discovered on the beach where the accident occurs the next day and is taken to the hospital. After that, we spend the rest of the movie looking at it as it tries to knock down the two girls and at the same time learn some new information about who it is and where it comes from and a little bit about its past. <br /> <br /> - The director and co-writer Caryn Krooth does an excellent job with this film considering his low budget. Freehand and sometimes it looks 16mm but fits the movie as the story requires a severe look to it. Actors do all the right jobs with what is given to them and there is really nothing to complain about. The main feature of the film is obviously Carla Gugino who reveals everything in this film. In this film he is more naked than he is in "Sin City". Even Christopher McDonald is in the film, but his character is really a bit useless, but it's fun to watch. I didn't pay much attention to the music, since it doesn't really draw attention to itself, but does the work with what it has. The film is rated R and this is for good reason. it's very sexual and very graphic at times. Sometimes it's essentially confines with the soft core, but the sex scenes are necessary for the film, so it doesn't seem like it's just there for the sake of being there. Although there is an unnecessary scene in which we see Chris McDonald doing it, that scene was a bit pointless, but it's not really a big deal, I guess. The only flaw in the film is that we don't see the trial in court after everything we face in the film. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or anything like that <br /> <br /> - It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film since it came out. This gifted woman can do great things on a limited budget. I really hope you come back soon because you're a fantastic director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, but what we have is a funny film that shows a great director under construction. <br /> <br /> - Hide the children and close the curtains, you don't want people to think you're watching porn while you watch this movie.
