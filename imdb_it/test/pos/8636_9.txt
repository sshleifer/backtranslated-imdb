There is a lot of movies that we say must be seen twice. In most cases this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing and watching it for the second time helps you catch the twists and turns you haven't noticed. However, for Mulholland Dr. this is different. The sequence that worked for me was: watch it for the first time - spend a day on the Internet trying to figure out what it was - and then review it the second time. Otherwise you will most likely not be able to enjoy this movie to its full extent. So you start to understand that this piece is brilliant, the camera work is stunning and the aftertaste follows you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
