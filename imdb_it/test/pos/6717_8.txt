LIFEFORCE was one of Cannon Films' biggest flops. He received mostly negative reviews and did nothing to help the career of director Tobe Hooper in the wake of the Spielberg / POLTERGEIST controversy. All this is unfortunate, because LIFEFORCE is really a fantastic film. It's extremely fun, moves at a fast pace and presents some of the most exaggerated direction, production, performance and special effects ever exploded across the screen! It must have seemed bizarre on paper: THE DELTA FORCE producers, ALIEN screenwriter, THE Texas director CHAINSAW MASSACRE, BREAKFAST AT composer TIFFANY'S, the special effects wizards of STAR WARS ... The audience wasn't ready for this demented exercise in strangeness. <br /> <br /> What else do you want ??? We have an alien spaceship full of giant bats! We have a sexy and naked vampire that sucks people's souls! We have bodies that explode! We have zombies! We have taken possession! We got an S & M interrogation! We have set fire to the entire city of London! It's Dracula meets THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY WINDS meets QUARTERMASS and THE PIT meets the EARTHQUAKE. It is probably the single most outrageous horror / science fiction / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic epic ever unleashed, that is, if there are others out there. <br /> <br /> Try watching this film while chemically altered. Maybe then you'll understand. A genuinely fucking experience and one of the most undervalued films by director Tobe Hooper. Perhaps one day he will find his audience.
