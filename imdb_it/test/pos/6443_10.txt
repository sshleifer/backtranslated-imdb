An orphan boy named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a pair of dark chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing from the villa where he works at Mr. Grimes (James Mason) - the real thief - and goes on to run. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the villa's owners (Samantha Gates, a slim, blue-eyed blonde with long wavy hair, which is certainly the main reason why I repeatedly observed him as a boy). He and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into cartoon characters who breathe water! While under water, he makes friends and saves a group of children who breathe water, known as children of water from a shark. <br /> <br /> A very interesting and always fascinating fairy tale, set in 1850, which should interest all children. The animation (42 minutes of 85 minute HBO VHS printing) is only average, but is preferable to most modern-day animations - even computer animation! My only complaint is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of "High Cockalorum", the film cuts a scene with octopus swimming, followed by the meeting of Tom and Jacque with Terence. This leads to a scene where the killer shark (voiced by Mason) takes our heroes into a trap. The shark greets Tom with, "Young Tom, it's so good to see your bad cup again" - but this is the first time in the HBO press that Tom meets the shark! Most reference books list execution time as 92 or 93 minutes, and were previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it is very likely that the HBO print is modified and / or proven over time. Adding insult to injury, MGM released a full-screen 76-minute DVD copy in 2002! We hope that a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyright Ariadne Films from 1978. "Arianna" is the child of the water voiced by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's partner in crime, is also the voice of the electric eel. Also known as Slip Slide Adventures.
