In a minute to pray, a second to die for, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unhappy outlaw with a size of ten thousand dollars on his head and a degenerative epilepsy. <br /> <br /> Realizing his days as an outlaw are numbered, he desperately wants (albeit somewhat reluctantly) to take advantage of an amnesty granted by the rough territorial governor Robert Ryan, (excellent performance) who badly wants McCord to renounce his ways and accept amnesty as an example for others, while in the bandit of Escondito bandit, the outlaw Mario Brega intends to kill McCord to prevent this from happening. <br /> <br /> With Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and a large number of other familiar European faces, this is co-written and produced by (American) the pioneer of the spaghetti westerns Albert Band, also responsible for the pre-film Lion Gunfight At Red Sands. <br /> <br /> Although the solution to the main character's epilepsy is raised directly by Howard Hawks' El Dorado, the script is solid, rather fresh and unpretentious us. This has a great balance of action and history and Alex Cord is exceptional. It really had to be a bigger star. <br /> <br /> In defense of the shorter English version (well nicknamed): personally I passed that age in which the longer version is always the best version and the ending in which McCord is ironically killed by bounty hunters dirty after his forgiveness, he is uselessly nihilist and completely destroys the message of the film about hope and redemption. <br /> <br /> Call me old-fashioned, but I've been cheering for McCord and I felt I gained a happy ending!
