I just received this message in the mail and was positively surprised. As a big movie fan of the 70s, it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to this type of film. Despite the obvious low budget of this film, acting is overall good and you can already understand why Pisces has become one of the greatest actors of all time. I'm not sure how authentic this film is, but it's certainly a good contribution to the mob genre ...
