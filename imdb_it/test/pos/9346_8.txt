'Thriller' remains the biggest pop music promo to have a plot, excellent graphics and a tip-top song to wrap the movie. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at the time (and he wasn't as upset about his plastic surgery regime as it was important). Here she is in good shape - the song is fantastic, she leads the zombies in dance like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays the girl who looks in disbelief while her sweet boyfriend (Jackson, natch) turns into a werewolf! Then at the pulsating rhythms of the opening line "It's almost midnight", trample the cemetery with the other zombies and the creatures of the night. <br /> <br /> The crowning glory of all this is the fruity voice of the great horror star, Vincent Price, who speaks in the middle of the record. Terrific.
