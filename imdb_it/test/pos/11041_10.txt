I saw this GREAT classic Greta Garbo movie and thought her performance was excellent. However, the German film version with English captions was his greatest interpretation. Greta Garbo also mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite, in which she had to switch to the sound of silent films. Greta had a high voice and had to take lessons to lower her voice for her future roles in the movies. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", 39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as captain of a barge of coal . There were many scenes from Old New York, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and the Manhattan Sky line. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine & Roses", a classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.
