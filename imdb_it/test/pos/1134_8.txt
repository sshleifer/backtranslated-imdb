So when I saw Greek commercials for the first time, I had some questions about how they would face Greek life, if they gave away the sacred secrets of the brotherhood and sisterhood, if they focused on the brother and sisterhood of a brotherhood or sisterhood brings, or what most college kids think of Greek life as a big party. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it covered everything. The plot of the story was great, it gave you a character to love, to hate, someone you want to be, someone you don't want to be, and of course a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> It was one of my first glimpses into what the writers believed was Greek life, and I can honestly say that they hit the rather dead nail. <br /> <br /> I like how one of the most important things they covered during the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's quite difficult to move from home, and being forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know, then come and find out ... you have nothing in common. Probably all the university students win the worst worst nightmare. <br /> <br /> Rustys sister, Casey, was practically the typical campus girl EVERYONE is jealous of. What did he not have? Oh well ... Evan all for himself. Rebecca and Evan had a "deal" at the start of the season, which made you feel pretty sympathetic to Casey. His character has evolved and his relationship with Rusty has become increasingly loving and outgoing. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the most lovable and utterly insane characters. One of my favorite episodes included him being completely destroyed in a strip club, and Rusty had to call Casey to save them. I like how they dealt with the issue of homosexuals in Greek homes, Calvin was a very sensitive character, and I really respected him because he was true to his standards. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but she really liked Rusty. It was amazing and I kept questioning it from the beginning, but of course I wanted it to work out for her and Rusty. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the Greek to come back. It takes you into the truth of Greek life, something that many people look beyond. One of the most important things for which the friar and the sororities are known are the feasts and the drinking. Greek is a great show and the characters are easily identifiable.
