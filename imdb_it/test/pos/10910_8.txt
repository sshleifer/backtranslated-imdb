Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches high school English in a small town in Indiana. Eventually he married Emily (Joan Cusack), much to the delight of his parents. The city is also in turmoil, because one of his, Cameron (Matt Dillon) was nominated for an acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, is watching the Academy Awards on television when Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay soldier, in part, because of the lessons learned from a gay teacher he was attending in high school. You guessed it, his Howard! But Howard never "got out"; in fact, he believes he is straight! With the whole city, and members of the media, waiting and watching the events, Howard and Emily will go ahead and get married? Or is Howard really gay and realizes he can't pass the ceremony? This is a wonderful, funny and humane film about a gay man and his situation. Like the gay-not-realized-man, Kline is excellent and moving. The rest of the cast is just as beautiful, with Cusack a point like mixed boyfriend and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and others available to delight the public. The costumes are very beautiful and the setting in the enchanting heart of Indiana is beautiful. Furthermore, the script, direction and production are very, very beautiful. But the insightful, humorous and reflective vision of the gay population is without doubt the film's best asset. For those who would be offended by a homosexual movie, yes, just skip this. But, for all those who want to laugh heartily and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best film around.
