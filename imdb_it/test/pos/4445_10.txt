"Do not Torture a Duckling" is one of the coolest Italian horror movies I've ever seen and I've seen my part. Calling it a yellow is a little misleading because it is not a typical mystery of murder. It's more like a direct horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete this old one with one of the most brutal and bloody scenes in a film, Fulci's tormented film exudes a gruesome atmosphere and an old-school Italian atmosphere. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The finish is authentic and original. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Do not Torture an Duckling" you really have to wonder how Fulci's next things got so out of time. I like all his things, but he has moved away. Maybe he thought he had already done it ... Because with this film, he hits the target. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who thinks that Dario Argento owns the yellow genre. Fulci beats him with this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, children.
