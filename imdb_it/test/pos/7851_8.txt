I was amazed by this first Clint Eastwood performance. I hadn't read a summary of the film when I decided to watch it on TV. Because of Mr. Eastwood, I expected some good shootings and no deep story. I was quite wrong. I found a couple of unusually explicit topics addressed and, until the end, I could not decide who was good and who was bad. This film is not absolutely typical of Eastwood, but certainly worth watching.
