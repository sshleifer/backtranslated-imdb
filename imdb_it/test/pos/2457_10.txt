This film is powerful. I watched this movie at 3:00 am and had to be at work at 6:00 am, needless to say I was late for work. I couldn't get out of bed to go to work. This is the most powerful film I've seen in a long time. And this made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a great job directing this film. I agree with previous comments from other points of view on the fact that this is the only film I saw that brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, what a veteran went through. It's almost unbelievable to think that at that time people thought they could come home from a life-changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a sense. I think he really showed how women felt and acted then. I am surprised that this film was not awarded with other awards.
