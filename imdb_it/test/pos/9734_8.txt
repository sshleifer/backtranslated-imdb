Six-shooter, Tunnel Sergeant, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops and Blade help young Andre Toulon capture Sutek's Egyption henchman in the best sequel in this series. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is atmospheric with many sets, acting qualities and some fun FX puppets. What lacks blood, compensates with an interesting and stimulating plot. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Dr. Death: "Don't you know, my friends? Smell the sulfur, look at the smoke ..." <br /> <br /> This is easily Dave's best film DeCoteau I've ever seen. The actors do a more than credible job: Jack Donner as "Azfel" turns into an inspired performance, and the young Toulon does well with puppets. Oh, and the circular needle is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack by John Massari is a beautiful symphonic interpretation of the original pieces by Richard Band's Puppet Master, keeping the film playful and disturbing. It's rare for a Full Moon score to add anything to a movie, and yes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dave Allen didn't seem affordable enough for Band and Co. in the late 1990s and beyond, so all the puppet action is done with the rod and the rope. There is no stop motion like the famous and fun scene of the original in which Pinhead is looking for his pinhead. And, of course, as with all Full Moon dishes from this period, RPM was shot around Castel Studios in Bucharest, so most parts were broadcast to Romanians: hearing their "Parisian" accents was a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is probably one of the 10 best Full Moon movies. It is certainly the most inventive of the Puppet Master sequels.
