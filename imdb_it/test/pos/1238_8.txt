(ATTENTION - CONTAINS SPOILER MILD) A film almost designed to make you pause and check your memory of it - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard looks like a circus and the rooms seem like temporary retreat points rather than shelters; as the characters become more and more worried about the past, the present falls more and more, until the last incendiary appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes marks the fusion between reality and fantasy. Whether their stories are true or not, and that Stanton is really the father or just an old fool who is entering their stories, it seems impossible to determine. The theme seems to be like the love of an extreme and reckless nature messes with stability to the point where reality itself breaks; where the exotic and misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel - a symbol of displacement besieged by destruction - is an appropriately strange ending to this strange but effective, surprisingly imaginative film.
