If only I were allowed to watch a program in my entire life, I would definitely have to choose "The Chaser's War on Everything". Of all the satirical shows that were broadcast on Australian television, I found "Chaser" the funniest of all. It's just great, kids aren't afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether it's dressing like Hitler to join a Polish club, or pushing a massive string pack around Melbourne to try out the tourism or rock up commercial for the Coca-Cola factory naked in a bathroom with $ 2.40 to buy some water. The Chaser boys will go there. <br /> <br /> According to the comments above (and / or below) "The Chaser's War on Everything" is more popular than their previous "CNNNN" program. But CNNNN was just as fun. Some unforgettable moments from that show ... Clean Cambodia !!! Classic. <br /> <br /> So, in any case, to stop further from Ranting, I STRONGLY suggest you at least give Chaser a chance, you'll probably find HILARIOUS !!!!
