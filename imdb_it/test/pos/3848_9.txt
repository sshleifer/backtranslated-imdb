Aristocats are really very fascinating and are classified too low on IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as those in the Jungle Book, but they were not bad at all. The animation is really beautiful, the best sequence is the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation, I think, and as another reviewer rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great animation was O 'Malley who looked into Duchess's eyes, since their love story was so believable while it was not obvious. (A good thing) The plot (on an avid butler and a fortune, Bailey's Billions reminds me) was a bit unoriginal, but it worked very well, and the script was really fun, especially the kitten fights. They remind me of me, my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favorite scene was Edgar's chase with the two dogs, who always fought over who the boss was. The talents of the voice were a delight, particularly Phil Harris, whom I recognized from the jungle book, and Eva Gabor, from rescuers. Even the supporting characters, namely Scat Cat, were well made. In conclusion, a really nice film, which is definitely undervalued. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
