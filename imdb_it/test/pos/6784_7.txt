No matter if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a bit banal and occasionally unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is a captivating and very nice story with good morals. After obtaining modest success with her appearance in "Lassie Come Home (1943)", young Elizabeth Taylor, 12, got her first starring role as Velvet Brown, a passionate student with an obsession for horses . Although filmed in California, the plot - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small town in the English countryside, and technicolor photography is fully exploited to present the vivid and beautiful landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes the lead as Mi Taylor, an ex-jockey misled with ambiguous intentions, whose relationship with the young Velvet awakens his sense of dignity and opens a new optimistic chapter in his life. Although he struggles visibly in a sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is as fun as the gruff but passionate young man who must prove his worth. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those eye-catching violet eyes, because her acting skills at this young age were rather limited. His most exciting sequences, in which he shows courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike a rather empty person, and the touching-naive notion that simply "believing" will realize everything is one that has since been repeated to nausea by practically every non-memorable inspirational sports film ever made. However, Taylor has bright and enthusiastic eyes, and works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child. Anne Revere plays a very important role as the mother of Velvet, once a famous athlete, who not only swam in the English Channel, but was lovingly trained by none other than Mi Taylor's father. I liked that nothing was said to me until the last seconds of the film, with Mrs. Brown correctly deciding that the young man should first develop his sense of decency, rather than exploit the memory of his late father for a financial gain, as no doubt he would have done at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The film reaches its peak at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet decided, at the last minute, to ride his horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition. In the guise of a Latvian male, he continues, as expected, to win the race, but is then disqualified - either because he is a girl, or because he fell from the horse before being allowed to go down (what a stupid rule!). This extensive race sequence is extremely well done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds and the confusion of the event that puts us in the same position as Rooney's character, stuck behind high spectators and anxiously waiting for someone to provide an accurate update. No matter that we know that this is a stand-in who does most of the difficult riding - in different scenes, we can clearly see a disturbing looking man with a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I bet "National Velvet" has fed the imagination of millions of girls over the last sixty years, and the power to inspire has diminished little over time.
