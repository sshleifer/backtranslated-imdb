It occurred to me as the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of Buddy Holly's death that there are still people alive today who were in that place in Clearlake, Iowa, who vividly remember him. This must be a disturbing memory, given even more intensity by the texts of "American Pie", as it pays homage to the day when the music died. The world lost an incredible talent that day, lives were cut before their success, and one can only wonder what would have happened if the trio of musicians who had died that day had survived to create an even more musical heritage great. <br /> <br /> I saw the film today about thirty years after its release in the original rooms. Thirty years, I have some problems that surround my mind. I had forgotten a lot, remembering some of the little things, like cricket in the wall that became immortalized with the name of the group. But above all, I remember the music. It's hard to just sit there and not start beating to the beat of "Oh Boy" or "That Be Be The Day", and one has to wonder where the threat to our morals with those songs actually came from. At least I'm with Buddy on this point, how could the jungle rhythms be if you invented them? Strange how each successive decade has brought its own threat to the social fabric: the Beatles, the Motown, the Disco and a whole series of other musical forms. We're still listening and dancing to the beat, so I guess it couldn't have been so bad. <br /> <br /> There was another take away from the movie I had forgotten. This is where I learned to slam a phone on the table when the person on the other side didn't see things my way. I've done it a number of times over the years, but by now I had forgotten the source. Well, I should be good for another thirty years or so. <br /> <br /> You must certainly give credit to Gary Busey for his portrait of Buddy Holly. Seeing it today, one could never imagine it as the rocker slimmed down with horn-rimmed glasses, but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned Busey an Oscar. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as members of Buddy's group, although their characters take second place to most of the story. I liked the subtle ways in which other musical legends have been followed in the picture, names like Sam Cooke and King Curtis, without ever dwelling on their presence. <br /> <br /> I will always be a fan and follower of the music of the Fifties and Sixties, the "old" that they now call. I guess this also makes me a little old, but you can't replace the experience of growing up with the history of music that is now coming to the big screen. Which just goes to reinforce the idea that I will continue to enjoy the music until, well, the day I die.
