Driving lessons From the writer of critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a moving sorrowful drama with the OscarsÂ® Julie Walters and Laura Linney and the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint), a seventeen-year-old boy held captive in the heart of his neurotic religious mother Laura (Laura Linney). After the end of the school year, he decides to take a job with an intelligent retired actress, free-spirited and "heavy on the bottle", Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The couple undertakes wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to simple conversations about life. Challenging the dominant mother and each other along the way, the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their lives. <br /> <br /> The comic elements are impeccable and precise, especially by the British veteran Julie Walters. Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream of. Directing is natural for Brock as he builds incredible images that break surfaces and immerse the viewer into an overabundance of adoration and creation. Even the subtle soundtrack of unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuate the tone and ways in which Brock had no problem generating. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is always asserting herself in films as she does with "Laura". The overbearing and overbearing mother is sometimes unbearable and with Linney at the helm we are swallowed up in that person. The complexity of his character could not have been impeccably interpreted by anyone else. Rupert Grint moves away from "Ron Weasley" and tries someone again. His performance is more reactive than talkative, but Grint gives us someone brand new for a child's performance and the viewer can enjoy it. But the standout comes from Oscar-nominated actress Julie Walters who gives "Evie" a life of her own. Although the role is clearly one of the protagonists, Walters does better in the support category where I believe he can simply take the prize home. "Evie" is a mix of "Clementine Kruczynski" and "Mrs Laura Henderson" with her free spirit and her lovable character. We hope his role will not go unnoticed in this season of prizes. <br /> <br /> Driving lessons are not an "out of this world" experience, but pleasant and enjoyable that any spectator could simply give us to do and learn something about the life, love and friendship that come in the most beautiful colors and shapes. <br /> <br /> Vote: *** / ****
