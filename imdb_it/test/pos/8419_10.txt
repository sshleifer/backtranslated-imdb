Shwaas is great! considering that the producers had a small budget, they did an excellent job. It is a watch not to be missed The small child has done a great job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes. Grandpa is at his best. Photography is superb. Technically correct and very creative. It helps to add many emotions to traditional content. The film will keep you absorbed and you won't be surprised if you are shaken by the film and the story lingers for a few days. I sincerely hope that they will be nominated for the final Oscar <br /> <br /> Have fun and not to be missed
