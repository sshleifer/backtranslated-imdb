The director is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (although I would have liked to see a little more of Aaron Lustig (of the fame of Y & R), who played Paul Shaffer). I only have two secondary lines on the film, however subtle they are. One-Roebuck's Leno is excellent, but his stage presence (ie during what appears to be the recording of one of his last episodes) is a bit overwhelming. Two: the distribution of vulgar language. I am willing to tolerate foul language, provided it is not used for free and, to some extent, the film is free. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce Kushnick's pathos, otherwise well depicted by Bates, with its frequent use, and served to make Roebuck's Leno a good man for his lack of use of it (obviously, if characters have really behaved this way, congratulations to all). Nevertheless, the piece is excellent as far as television and video are concerned. The film, I believe, had potential for the big screen, but I would have required re-casting for the bits, and probably also a different director (the aesthetic aspect is that of the Larry Sanders show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematographic purposes).
