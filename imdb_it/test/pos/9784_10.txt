Critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever. Even the observers claim the same. But there is a downside to it. They are wrong, very bad. It's the smartest movie I've seen in years ... <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end we see a story that is unrealistic. A story that reflects the real world. This film is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way that people see you. To really understand the directors' point of view, you have to see it again ... <br /> <br /> When you see this movie ... Try to understand the story (and look at the background) ... Listen to music lyrics ... And smell the industrial complexes ... <br /> <br /> This film is one of a kind. He will hate it (most people know it), or you will love it (and you will understand it completely) <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemmingway once said: "the world is a beautiful place, and it's worth fighting for" . I agree with the second part.
