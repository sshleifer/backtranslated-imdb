This film is similar to "Better Off Dead" as it has some of the same stars. But this is not as good. Sure, it's pretty funny and fun, there's something in "Better ... I like it, much better." These guys go to Nantucket to spend their summer vacation, while they meet this girl who is trying to save the house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant, this guy doesn't really like lobsters, because in a scene he shoves in boiling water and puts it in a stethoscope so you can hear it scream. divided between this girl and the girl of the boy's son who wants to make the restaurant. In one way or another this leads to a big showdown of the boat race, a bit like in "Summer Rental" although it works a little better here and fits the plot is a little better, although in this Is this the deal with the regattas? Was there a certain charm for them? For the most part this movie offers a good clip of laughter, but "Better Off Dead" was even better because it was the first and the lines worked better.
