Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the fantastic girls of their high school. The non-cool and ugly girls had two options, to be a mole or a fool! Debbie and Sue imitate them using their cheating practices in an exam. Two of the handsome boys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) ask them their answers and they are all caught. After screaming from the headmaster (Bud Tingwell) the cool girls met them outside on the playground and compared them with their "dobbing" on all of them. As Debbie and Sue didn't have fantastic girls, they invited them to "dunni" to smoke. Then they start to stay with them on the weekends at the beach, watching all the kids surfing. Sue ends up dating Danny and Debbie with Garry. Many of the usual teenage actions take place between sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has a possible heroin overdose that makes Debbie face life inequalities and decides to learn to surf instead of just looking at boys. They are not happy but look at her, calling names, and finally Debbie dominates the board. A beautiful Australian film from the 1980s.
