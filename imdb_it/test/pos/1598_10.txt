His music, especially the one we hear here, is very slow. From the time of Bach's death, composers had devised ways to advance music at a slow and slow pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are as slow as possible for music. -Of course, you can cheat by writing a 4/4 gear and then specify a time of, for example, semiquaver = 1, but that time would not be the correct time. Wagner and Mahler have written music that is PROPERLY performed at a snail's pace. Since slowness in no sense sounds too slow, "the step of the snail" is the wrong expression. A critic wrote of a famous Wagner conductor: "It doesn't beat time, it beats eternity". As far as I know, this was intended as a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that around the beginning of the 70s the directors had elaborated the slowest possible film: there is "Death in Venice", and there is "Solyaris" ". first, the first, "Solyaris" exceeds the line, or some line, and becomes soporific; "Death in Venice" is compelling from beginning to end. Not much happens, but everything happens in the right sequence, at the right pace , with photography you can get lost in <br /> <br /> Another way of cheating with music, by the way, is to write something that you don't really have a time in. This music sounds slow, but it's really not very musical, just like many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and shape. "Death in Venice" is not one of these. Beautiful in every respect, it will remind you of timelessness and the absence of a context of quality. You don't need theoretical knowledge to answer to the mastery of Visconti, as you do to respond to the incompetence of a minor director big work.
