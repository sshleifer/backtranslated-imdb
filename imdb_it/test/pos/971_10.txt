I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called "big liar". Even if this guy escapes to Hollywood, he doesn't give children the idea that they can do it. Moreover, it does not do it just for fun or to escape anything, it does it to regain confidence. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was just a big commercial for Universal Studios, because I liked the way it gave an insight into what it means for kids who don't know how cool it is to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It has good music and funny characters. This family / comedy is totally fun for children and parents. He has humor, excitement and difficulty in real life like lying. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Big Fat Liar" issues a moral: don't expect that lying is easy.
