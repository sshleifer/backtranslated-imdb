Three of the things you can say about Spalding Gray are: he certainly marched to the beat of his own "drummer"; he was never short of words; and obviously he felt that those who looked at him and listened to him would be interested in every aspect of his life, his experiences and his thoughts - no matter how trivial sometimes. <br /> <br /> Most of us are not so far off the wall "as it was. Most of us are not interested in sharing the smallest parts of ourselves with others - even one by one or in small groups, let alone on stage. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't make it any less interesting to watch and listen to this erudite and unusual man.And after seeing one of his shows, reflecting, we can find that many of his articulate reflections are perhaps more relevant to our lives and our thoughts than we might have thought before. <br /> <br /> Of course, he was a "New York / avant-garde" personality type, and undeniably a little "weird" (There are those who would maintain the description of someone as "strange New York" was unnecessarily redundant.) <br /> <br /> I give him a "10" for the talent he has in this genre which is his specialty.
