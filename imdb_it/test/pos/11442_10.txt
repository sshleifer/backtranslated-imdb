This film probably gave me the nicest surprise I have ever seen. It was not a big budget production and its premise, middle-aged amateur jazz musicians have an unexpected professional commitment in a resort similar to Catskills, it seems rather modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. This is a small film about the slice of life that is the most fun ever. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and is full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> Actors are real workers who do a solid job. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired for a member of the band in difficulty. His attitude immediately clashes with the others. While they see it as an opportunity for great fun and once in a lifetime, she regards it as her job and not particularly interesting. This leads to conflict but when the group gets into trouble, it leads them through. Little, who died too young, really showed me that he was a good actor with this film. <br /> <br /> This film is a true sleeper, the kind a movie fan always hopes to discover. I recommend it wholeheartedly.
