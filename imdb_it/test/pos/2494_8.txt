Some time ago I bought the Chinese Fist of the North Star box set, which included Fist of the North Star, Fist of the North Star 2, New Fist of the North Star and Fist of the North Star movie. While there is an American version and some European versions, they end up halfway between Fist of the North Star, which is approaching the film. <br /> <br /> The series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short. There is only one successor each generation. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where martial arts are the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken as my version calls it. Nanto is really more styles but they are all the same since they allow a person to cut someone into pieces. There are six Nanto masters and everyone has their own star. Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage / kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body. Each art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro goes around saving the world from evil by persecuting his two brothers and three of the masters of Nanto and their armies. Every army captain has his own way of fighting that makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. In addition, Kenshiro is looking for his girlfriend Yuria who was stolen by master Nanto Shin. During the journey, Kenshiro is joined by his brother Toki after rescuing him from his brother Rao who calls himself Kenou or King of boxing. He is also joined by two masters from Nanto, Rei, who is looking for his sister who was taken by Ken's brother, Jagi, and Shu. Both they and Toki die along the way. Other characters joining Ken are two children Rin and Batto who don't do much. This is the most I can say for the story since it is so long and full of details. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show great is combat. Normally, Ken goes against a group of people who think they are hard and then get killed in one go. Which is fun and bullshit, but it makes for quick fights. Another big part is comedy / evil. Ken hits someone, and they think it's nothing. Ken says they are already dead. Then other parts die when they hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live. Then a counter will appear. Or when he tells them that they are not worthy of knowing his name. Then there is when he makes a quick fire or a punch and goes dada da da da da etc. Eventually you might find yourself doing it with him. A big part was when a villain thought he knew Hokuto. He went up to Ken and hit him. Ken stayed there and said he was dead in a few seconds. The villain counted and then died. It's not limited to Ken, everyone else kills just as fast. There has never been such a fantastic character as Ken and they probably never will. <br /> <br /> There are some problems though. One is the repetitive nature. Some flashbacks mainly those with Yuria are taken too often, and there are also too many episodes of recapitulation especially in the fourth part of the series. In fact, the last episode is a summary of the whole thing. Another problem is the ending. The final battle with Rao was not so impressive. Ken and Rao fought and then talked, etc., until Rao realized and killed himself instead of killing him. But it's better than the American and European versions that have just cut in half. <br /> <br /> To whom would I recommend this? This is for older teenagers and adults who love action. Since styles make people explode or are cut into pieces, violence is very graphic and there are many, but they don't show much blood because they usually make death just a shape that still looks like the person but less colorful. was made to avoid censorship. If you don't like the action, rent the American version. If you like the action, then I tell you to import since you can see all the series, but they don't have the best translation in English since it is subtitled by the Chinese. Note: my import came with everything I said at the beginning, some imported versions don't, but you still have to import to see all the series and Fist of the North Star 2. If you don't think you can manage subtitles for any reason they go to get the American version. Another note: in the version I didn't have subtitles on the last record of New Fist of the North Star; although, New Fist of the North Star is not very good to start with. <br /> <br /> I offer an 8/10 show for its high amount of action, good story and the grandeur of Kenshiro. <br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation has released an English subtitled version. You can download the episodes and Hokuto no Ken 2 from IG2 Direct2Drive or watch them for free on the FUNimation website.
