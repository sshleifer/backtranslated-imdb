Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to play the comedy just needs to look at "The Bells of Santa Maria". OK, so it's a nun with TB who is probably in love with p. O'Malley, (think about what Luis Bunuel could have done with that), but he also showed a wonderful sense of fun that made you want the directors to choose you in the comedies more often. In "Cactus Flower" she is a nurse starched by the dentist, (Walter Matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss but keeping her buttoned. When she is forced to act like his "wife" to deceive her mistress, (don't ask), she lets go and the buttons burst. And it's a joy to see. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a harder translation than usual on the screen of a Broadway hit, (you can see are three acts). It is a French farce (it was originally, it is taken from the play "Fleur de Cactas" by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy), and it hits all the right points. Matthau uses his great hang-jowl expression with a marvelous effect and a very new blonde, as it was then called, Goldie Hawn almost steals the movie as the dizzy lover who decides to give up his meal because she feels sorry for "his wife" even if "the wife" is having a ball. Hawn had such an impression in the role that what he stole was the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
