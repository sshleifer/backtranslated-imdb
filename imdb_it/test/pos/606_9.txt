MINOR SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The misunderstood classic remains one of Henson's most beautiful and personal films. It may seem strange to define a film as loved as this "misunderstood", but people seem to remember it above all for the lively screenplay by Jerry Juhl and for the direct elimination songs of Paul Williams. Now, while these things are really great, as well as the formal playfulness of the film (script within the script, film break, etc.), what distinguishes "The Muppet Movie" from the other Muppet films is the serious and melancholy thread running through the image. It's a road movie, okay, but like most street movies, the pleasure is in going there, and achieving the characters' goals is mitigated by the uncertainty and awareness that they will never be able to go back. Throughout the film, we are shown the negative side of the show, even before the Muppets have "done": Piggy abandons Kermit without thinking about a phone call from his agent, Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of an artist's life the way in his haunting 'I'm Going to Go Back There Someday', and worst of all, Kermit is continually tortured and tested by Doc Hopper, who wants him to market his art for the most sacred purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would do with the direction of his family company after his death.) Kermit himself torments himself for his choices in the desert conversation scene, and the final issue of the "Magic Store" wonders if he it was worth it before concluding that it probably doesn't matter either way. All this is punctuated by the expected chaos and satire of Muppet and deliciously horrible jokes, and of course serious things would not work if it were not. But "The Muppet Movie" is not just another joke, since the rest of the Muppet movies that will be going back to decline would have become. No, it's a beautiful and delicate metaphor about the relationship between art, entertainment and business, and it's just as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
