Ok, it was just brilliant. I wish the rest of season 1 had been so strong. He really needed more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> The cast worked perfectly, even though they were all nobodies throughout the day. Writing was fantastic, as was editing. Excellent work in all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was electrifying, full of suspense and kept you guessing until the end. This is what most MOTW episodes have tried, but failed until now. <br /> <br /> The first five-star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember it being so good. I think it's even better than the big horror movie called "The Thing".
