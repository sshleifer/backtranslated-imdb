I love meatballs! Terrifying characters and moving situations make this loved one. Bill Murray is hysterical and you must love that 4-mile trail run at the end! A total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. He brings back good memories of the camp and copes well with the experience of being rejected by the mad peers and the empowerment brought him to the aid of a nice adult. Tons of great one-liners and a nice assortment of wacko consultants. This is the kind of film in which you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterwards. Nothing too rough and what a sweet 70's soundtrack brings to the right dose of nostalgia. I can't say enough about meatballs; it's a classic. Be warned! All the sequels are stinky putrids who simply bought the marketing rights. They have no connection with Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
