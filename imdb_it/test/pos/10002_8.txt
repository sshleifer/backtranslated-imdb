I saw this movie in preview, and it's delicious. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good and the story is fabulous. If this film doesn't work well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve. Before this film, I didn't realize how fascinating Shia Lebouf could be. It does a wonderful, autonomous job as a guide. There is something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the film even better. The other actors also do a good job and the film contains moments of great suspense, more than one might expect from a golf movie. There are a dozen sports films, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one I would recommend to anyone.
