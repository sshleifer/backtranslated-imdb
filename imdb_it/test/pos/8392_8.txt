It's not your daily Tom and Jerry short for many reasons. One, there is a narrative voice of Jerry, which is strange, because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, the two are friends, which was also rare and rarely works as well as contradictory short films. Third, and above all, the cartoon is rarely humorous (design) and the jokes here are dry giggles with a small cough and a blood bubble at the end. Think of a cartoon by Tom and Jerry directed by Tim Burton. Not entirely successful, but largely it works. The most disturbing ending for a short MGM that I can remember. Not for everyone and proof that these shorts have never been designed exclusively with children as a target. Worth watching. Recommended with the caveats mentioned above.
