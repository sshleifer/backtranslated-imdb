In short, if you want to see the best Burt Reynolds movies, you have to include it. If you don't like Burt you might still like this. If you love Burt, this could become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta hits home, but it's also nice to see a cop / action / drama taking place in a place other than New York City, Chicago, Miami or Los Angeles. The film is funny in points with a good plot and good performances by a supportive cast (each character is real and the bad guys are not so one-sided are really well thought out) A nice novel unusual in the second half and has some good shootout and old fashion fistfights (no CGI thanks God REAL ACTION!) <br /> <br /> If Clint Eastwood made his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with "Every Which Way But Loose" and "Any Which Way You He can "then Burt responded with his best Clint-type movie with this, and it comes off great!
