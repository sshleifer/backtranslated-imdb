If you watched this movie for nudity (as I did) you will not be disappointed. However, I could have done without cheaters or the bear. Some bottomless nudity could be shown, but for what I thought, H.O.T.S. it must be the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> It is not the kind of film that could have been made today that is a shame because it is the kind of film that is worth looking at these times. br /> <br /> I would like to take carefree nudity on key plot points every day. <br /> <br /> It's a shame the DVD doesn't have extras, but since they didn't have DVDs when it was shot it's understandable. I would like to know more about the filming of the film, especially where they shot the soccer game at the end.
