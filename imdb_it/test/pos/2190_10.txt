Join the Sweeney Todd fable ... The weirdest, most shocking, but wonderful Broadway musical. It's chilling, fun, and moving all at once through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and high performance. George Hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and an imitation of the legendary demon barber, while Angela Lansbury provides comic relief as she cheerfully grinds her victims in meat pies. If you just let yourself have fun, "Sweeney Todd" is a real surprise.
