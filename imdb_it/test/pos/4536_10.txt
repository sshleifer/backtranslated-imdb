This is one of my favorite comic films. Chris Farley is hilarious as the accident-prone idiot and David Spade is perfect for playing the man straight at Farley. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between them is brilliant. The scene where two of them are in the car singing along with The Carpenters Superstar is a classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comedian who had incredible potential - it will be sadly missed. /> <br />
