Miyazaki has been doing his job since the 1970s and it was only recently that his films made the American coasts through Disney and fans who loved his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other films have been somewhat more accessible to the American public, some may find this somewhat on the fence as a sort of "Japanese" in his presentation. For the same reason, Pom Poko is VERY "Japanese" and does not make much sense to the American public, as are * some * elements of Ponyo. This should not distract you from watching this funny film of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What manages to surprise is the animation and the magical and elaborate story of Miyazaki who has elements of wonder and fantasy. This is accompanied by its characteristic use of character development and often uses girls and women as main characters. He walks away from his area with Ponyo while the main character is a boy who lives in a small village near the sea with his mother while his father is away at work on the high seas. Although not alone, Sosuke is just like any other curious guy who likes adventure and the charm of the sea. Similar to Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of humans and sea creatures and I feel that Miyazaki is trying to draw the attention of viewers to the vast and unexplored nature of the things that live under the sea and our acceptance of them and of what They are different. <br /> <br /> I was able to see the subtitled version of this last year and I was happy with the plot and the plot. Miyazaki said that "this is my last film" for many years, but shortly afterwards Spirited Away gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo is certainly proof that Miyazaki has not hung his spurs and continues to delight, innovate and pioneer the most creative animated films of all time. Watch Ponyo with an open mind and a hat tip for the imagination and imagination of childhood and you will be transported back when you catch fireflies and secret hiding places are more important than boring adult things and eating your vegetables.
