This program was quite interesting. The way the program was viewed made it even more interesting. String theory is also very interesting to listen to. The total three hours in my opinion were worth it. I enjoyed listening to the ideas provided by physicists. The extra dimensions upset the mind. If you have the chance, watch this extraordinary documentary.
