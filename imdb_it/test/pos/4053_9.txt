As with so many modern American films, there must be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you let it go, this is a story with a lot of charm and a kind heart set in a grenade. <br /> <br /> We are presented with a scene of a city in an economically depressed area struggling to find something to be happy about. The character of Beau Bridges is really against it with a rising family, a zero bank account and a brother-in-law who is sold to a large chain of activities he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose. D'Onofrio finds his Bubba lifestyle rather superficial, forced to take care of his "blessed" little brother, Joey, and is looking forward to escaping the chains of this dead city. Their boss's affairs are closing (much against his will) due to the lack of new clients and he is obsessed with his father's memories as he builds the tension towards his own self-destruction attempt. <br /> <br /> Joey, who seemed to have personified the curse of their lives, is lost at sea - believed drowned - in a bizarre accident. His miraculous restoration work by Portuguese fishing boats, whose boat had just built and launched (perhaps the symbol of an angelic crew), is the sign they were waiting for and all of them decide to give life to the last dice roll. br /> <br /> There is a beautiful dark mood in all this work that has excelled in keeping our attention as brilliant as "The Shipping News". There are also other parallels with the subsequent work, which lead to suspect a touch of a remake. I like "Signs of Life" for its simpler and less elaborate story and its interpretations by actors working on their craft rather than being noticed as a star.
