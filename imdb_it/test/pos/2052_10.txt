I thought it was a great action movie. A great role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites next to Angelina Jolie. Actually I saw The Long Kiss Goodnight right after seeing the new Tomb Raider movie. Did you make me think, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight ??? However, both women are very strong and intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they kick ass. I just hope to see Geena soon in another movie. Looks like she's been out of the spotlight a little too long. It would be especially nice to see her in another film with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they form a great duo. Watch this movie if you didn't. You will not be disappointed.
