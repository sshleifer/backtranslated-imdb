Overall I found this film good: exceptional acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, some useless) and a weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILER The film is divided into 2 parts. I thought the first half of the pianist was exceptional. We meet Erika Kohut (the wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and we introduce ourselves to her world. He is single, struggling to find his space against an overly protective and borderline tyrannical mother. We understand that he has lost or rarely experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry: he protects himself from being acute and offensive to people, releases his sexual tension in sex shops, like a voyeur or in sadistic self-mutilation. This first semester is very clinical and creates an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by Benoit Magimel). Even if at the beginning he feels the coldness of Erika at the beginning, he seduces her and slowly makes Erika's fortress explode. He loves her deeply but needs him to satisfy his sadistic desires. Then, when he is about to fall in love with him, he is disgusted by his world and in the end we discover that Erika is not able to love or feel any feelings (especially since Walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). This is the second part of the film, very touching since Erika's inability / inexperience led her to self-destruction. This second half seemed less mastered by Haneke, and sometimes had unbelievable (that is, too shocking) scenes that paradoxically mitigated the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a rough film, at least in the French version: see porn sequences from the sex shop, bold mutilations and sex scenes. The much-discussed scene of the fellatio between Magimel and Huppert was pretty good, I thought, and it's essential to understand Erika's sick relationship with love. As for the actors, Huppert is wonderful throughout the film, Magimel is getting better and better and Girardot (the mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
