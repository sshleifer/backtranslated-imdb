I love it! I love Pauly Shore. It seems that some people disagree. It's humor and it's not like everyone else. The film is fantastic. I love the plot and most of the people in the film. It's fun since he first met him at school. I like the fact that she chooses him for the boy at home. I like that Tiffani Theissan is not a bad girl at the end. All the secrets are released. In the end only the people you want to see remain. (except for those of you who don't like Pauly Shore.) Even if you don't like it, there are fun parts, and his family tortures him through most of the movie. She's a crazy country girl and needs to be heard. Finally make it. It has the right amount of love and romance. I give him an 8 out of 10.
