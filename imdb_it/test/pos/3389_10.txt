I agree with the messages here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a sophomore in Sumter SC high school. I immediately fell in love with the book and looked forward to the release of the mini series. As much as I liked the movie and thought it was very well done, I was disappointed that the film didn't follow the book. I was glad that Orry wasn't killed like he was in Love and War or N & S II. Having grown up in SC and graduating from SC University, I fell in love with southern history for this mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes in a symposium in 1988 at USC. I stayed around and met Mr.Jakes. Unfortunately, I couldn't ask him a question. But meeting him was honor enough. I specialized in accounting, but I had my child in Southern Studies. Also, I modeled many of my mannerisms after Orry Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel I was born 150 years too late. I am a southern gentleman and very proud of this. <br /> <br /> Well, I fell in love with 2 women in the film .... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Dude, I got Wendy's ass !!!! I could never find a real life version of her. I also hope one day !!!
