hi i'm john and i would like to tell you everything that my dog ​​has been in this movie to the trigger screen he was the well like one, who was about to bite the chained man. my dog ​​was named Colin and he didn't go to film for a week for this movie. it was also in other things like crime watch uk and some other small parts. he won some dog shows but he died now I miss him he was a big, faithful and loyal dog and we had a good time together but he had a cancer that couldn't be cured so I had to get him down which was the worst day of my life I hope this gives you a certain thing to look for in the movie if you look at it again. <br /> <br /> thanks everyone
