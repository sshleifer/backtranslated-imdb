It may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes have not failed. I saw it many times when I was younger and again on DVD I think, and every time I laughed. Humor is simple and fun, this film was just one of the many little movies that Disney was throwing out at the time. I found the parts where people outside the invisible circuit saw invisible people. The expressions were priceless. Great movie, if the chance to ever see it, I recommend seeing it for a good fashion laugh. My favorite character in the entire Dexter series should definitely be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and feel him getting angry especially seeing that his expression was simply hysterical for me in the end.
