Okay, Paris Hilton sucks (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I saw the movie last night and it completely prevented me from leaving the entire movie. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he is just an ace actor. Total hero The main girl who is nick's sister (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumb up. I think it's so different from movies out there these days, most of them go with psychopaths, possessions, ghosts but here you have a wax theme! I took the vines completely from the wax models in the house, even though they looked so real. I haven't had the twins story yet, I'm just waiting to get the DVD and then watch it again. Congratulations on such a beautiful movie! 11/10. To all those people who don't like it, please don't bother 2 criticize my opinion because mostly everyone thinks it's nice to do it. I also think that the Paris scene when undressing in underwear is totally inappropriate. Why not make a dog fuck a cat ... be more fun then. When the scene of death arrived in Paris, I thought it was poor while still running even though a knife just lifted one foot. Hmm .. interesting. <br /> <br />! HI EVERYTHING THE WAY!
