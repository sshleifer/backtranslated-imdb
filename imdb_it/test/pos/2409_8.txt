I'm not sure how it's possible to get ten lines from this question, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the dance, they were dancing to slow down the music. What was the name of the song he was playing and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love that song! And I watch the movie over and over again just to hear that song. <br /> <br /> I did several searches online and even searched for the soundtrack, but I can't find the song. <br /> <br /> It could be because the song they were dancing to was not a complete song, only a partial one. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate if someone out there knows what the name of the song and the group that sang it is. <br /> <br /> Thanks. <br /> <br /> Frank
