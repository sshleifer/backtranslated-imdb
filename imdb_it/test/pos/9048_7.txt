Okay, I immediately admit that Loony Tunes' Inki cartoons are pretty offensive and I can see why Warner Brothers took them out of business. Seen today, the huge lips and very stereotyped Inki are not politically correct. However, the cartoons have been well done and it is a pity that they are not released with a sort of explanatory prologue (like the one with Leonard Maltin that included some recent politically incorrect cartoons by Donald Duck recently released on DVD). In other words, throwing out the cartoons completely is forgetting our story. Also, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are out there - especially on the internet. <br /> <br /> This cartoon Inki has our little hero out hunting. In the beginning, he is chasing a nice caterpillar, but later accidentally he comes across a lion - a lion who is more than happy to make Inki his dinner. However, through all this, a strange Minah appears again and again ... and eventually you will understand why this bird is so important to the story. <br /> <br /> Cute, well made and smart. I like Inki cartoons. Besides, I enjoy showing them to liberal friends with extremely thin skin just to watch them have apoplectic attacks or even heart attacks. Lots of fun, folks!
