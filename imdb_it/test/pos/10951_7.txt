A vampire prince falls for a human girl, unaware that his brother is a famous vampire hunter. This is the main theme of this martial arts game that borrows ideas from "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer", but manages to maintain a style all its own. I got confused by the British title "The Twins Effect" in Hong Kong and Hong Kong because there are no twins involved in the story. It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars who perform as "The Twins". Don't let this deter you. These girls can act (at least fairly well for this type of film) and add a lot of charm to the process. Jackie Chan shows up for a couple of cameo appearances by adding a dash of his slapstick chaos mark in the process. All in all, this is great fun for those who like their vampires served with the help of ironic humor.
