I would like to start by saying that I can only hope that the creators of this film and its sister film The Intruder (directed by the great and inimitable stylist who is Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts how much pleasure they brought me and my friends in the sleepy northern town - Oriental of Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the opening sequence of the pre credit which manages to drag a little slightly despite the fact of containing a man who crashes into a window on a motorcycle, the ruthless destruction of a silence lab, the introduction of one of the most boring and annoying villains in the history of cinema and costume that Jean Paul Gautier could have found around. Don't make mistakes; this is a truly unique experience. It highlights in advance: an explosion (get used to it, much more where it comes from!) Followed by a close-up of our plump heroine and the most exhilarating reading of the word "dad" in the living memory. And then ... the theme theme ... <br /> <br /> Yes, this deserves your paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who should really want to remain anonymous, makes songs written for Rocky films like Schubert. This is the narcissism of the hero of the shit of the 80s at an all-time level, with texts chosen as "it's just you and me, came down to the thread" and many talk about having to "cut the line" (will have sense in time - our hero cares little about the boundaries of bona fida police work - he is very rich. Not to mention the Indonesian Supremes who interpret the title of the film in a seductive way. At this point anyone who wants to shut down officially has no pulse. <br /> <br /> Our hero is the Semitic policeman Peter Goldson (brilliantly played by Intruder star Peter O'Brien), the "stabilizer" of the title. The man's bull in a porcelain shop is approaching the fight against crime and in particular his less showy hidden work really leaves a lot to be desired, but it is undoubtedly a fun guide through the streets of central Jakarta, with the local connection of sleaze ball Captain Johnny in tow, as well as the same waste of space partner Peter in the fashion crime Sylvia Nash, who does little. So many highlights, so little time - the "please slip" Peter's arrogance not too convincingly argued case against the evil boss Greg Rainmaker (Intruder fans will know the slimy bastard Craig Gavin as the monstrous John White - helluva name eh ? No! Oh well ...), the x marks the stupidity of the position map, our hero takes horribly advantage from the heroine Tina Probost during a moment of weakness in her favor, the latter presenting herself in an operation sting dressed as a member of a particularly flamboyant troops dance. And believe me it barely covers it. <br /> <br /> There was not even time to enter the plot that revolved around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride. Or our hero shows up at a funeral dressed as an extra on Boogie Nights. Or the absolutely hysterical craic between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two boys have never done the heavier time than a friend who is a friend of those clowns. The trowel was perhaps too thin for me. <br /> <br /> Ah, it is in pieces, and you never thought that scenes of unbridled destruction and general chaos could be so incredibly boring, but the interaction between the characters is wonderful, the dialogue really priceless and the incompetence shown in some appealing way. Oh and people's shoes - watch out for shoes!
