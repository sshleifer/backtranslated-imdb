Many accuse Rod Steiger of exaggerating, and anyone who has seen the Amityville Horror and the "fly" section would have struggled to say otherwise. That being said, it is brilliant in this. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, you can't buy it on DVD (legitimately). In 1988, when Channel 4 still had a recipe for innovation, they showed it between a small amalgam of films from the 1960s, Privilege etc. - and I remember an essentially theatrical experience, well transposed into the cinema. The beauty of theater is that it is enclosed - how do you make it available and interesting on the screen? PH pulls it out. Since this kind of film is never even on cable or Sky TV, it is difficult to get a debate, but for all those who have seen or can remember, my memories are of a frank, almost strident performance of Sally Geeson all taken care di '(which avoids the almost wary general performances of her and her brother in many offers of the early 70s), says the conception of ref. There are several: key lines that you remember years, decades ahead. This is the power of a film like this. <br /> <br /> PS I just saw it again and it's just as nice. One day even the TV will be illuminated.
