Fellowe's drama about the marriage of a couple who is threatened by a younger third party interested in the wife of the house (Watson). Wilkinson plays the role very well as the tormented husband who can't control his wife's scam and takes care of the matter. I also like Rupert very much in the role of William Bule, the man with whom Watson has an affair. Even though I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had a little trouble with the way her character was written, it doesn't make her too funny (I know a cheater shouldn't be nice, but some of her actions and things she had no reasoning behind them). The script was perhaps the weaker part of this drama, although Fellowes' direction was good and the performances were pretty good too. This film is better than Unfaithful, but not a masterpiece by any means. --- IMDB Rating: 6.7, my vote: 8/10
