If I rate the movie maybe a little high, you can blame the feeling. This is one of the first films I remember seeing and totally loving. I saw it at the drive-ins here in California in the late 1970s. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV, so I was ready for the film, and the film didn't disappoint me. Basically it takes the whole absurd ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville to a road movie. Kermit the Frog is looking to become famous; not because he wants to bathe in champagne and go in a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions of people happy". Sure. <br /> <br /> Along the way he collects all his beloved muppet friends, the cutest Fonzie Bear he meets in a seedy bar doing the stand-up. They sing "Movin Right Right", a song that has always fascinated me with its cheerful melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also meets enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer film, including comic luminaries like Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle and Mel Brooks. Brooks, in particular, got a little boring, and you have the feeling that Henson may have cut some of these cameos if he hadn't been afraid of offending the stars. However, as befits a road movie like this, the first person he meets is Dom DeLuise. <br /> <br /> The ending is one of the strangest examples of literally tearing down the 4th wall you'll find in any "children's" movie. The Hollywood dream seems to collapse all over them, when a true rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this had to refer to some of Jim Henson's personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie with Muppets in a long time. If you or someone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular in the 1970s, considering how poor the films have been in the last few decades, I think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue.
