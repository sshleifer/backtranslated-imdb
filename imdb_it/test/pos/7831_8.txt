Ladies and gentlemen, we have really won ourselves here. Actually we don't do it, but the boy is often a hilarious and always funny, horrible, braggart of a stinker. Poor Alma (who recovers Julia Ruiz) suffers from an ancient Mayan curse that causes the death of poisonous snakes in her body. Alma and her deranged husband shaman Brujo (Alby Castro, who feverishly twists with an intense intensity of rolling eyes) clandestine on a train bound for Los Angeles. Of course, a group of deadly vipers is lost because they can terrorize the diverse assortment of passengers. The Mallachi brothers, working on an absurd script by Eric Fosberg, deal with the ridiculous premise, thus creating a deliciously miserable piece of deliriously campy cheese. The raw CGI effects, the pathetically unprejudiced common variety of Gardner's snakes (there are alleged rattle snake noises being added to the soundtrack to give it a weak sense of otherwise non-existent threat), the slow rhythm, the total lack of tension or of momentum, the obvious and ramshackle train of trains set, and above all the simply amazing "you're kidding me!" the exaggerated exaggerated ending is absolutely marvelous in their terrible horror. Even better, we also have the game (if lame) that reads from a no-name cast, a nice pinch of tasty free female nudity, a humorous hum'n'shiver score, and a lot of extremely coarse and grotesque makeup f / x . Bonus points for the fact that the token, an irritating little dog, is eaten by a large reptile and for the stoner engineer who is caught smoking they break it from an empty light bulb (!?). An absolute gutting of a kitchch howler.
