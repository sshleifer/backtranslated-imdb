John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupine. While no one knows for sure that this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure, but he cannot prove it. So Lionel spends much of the film after John - hoping to capture this brilliant and elusive thief. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the movie, I really think I have higher expectations and I thought it would be better than just a good passerby. This is because he combined John and Lionel Barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I would have expected sparks and magic, but instead I only saw them from time to time. Now, this doesn't mean that this is a bad movie - it certainly isn't. It simply did not grow to the level of being unforgettable or a film that I highly recommend seeing. Thanks to a proper script, the film is pretty good, but I was surprised to hear the French accents in the film, even if they were supposed to relate to the French! Also, there wasn't much life in the film until it was almost complete. The ending was really excellent and fun - so nice to elevate the film from 6 to 7. It's nice to see it finish with a high note.
