The writers of Lost have surpassed themselves. The finale of the second season is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale of the first season. Locke's lack of faith led not only to spiritual consequences for himself, but to tragic physical consequences for the lives of other castaways. Michael's betrayal was a success for him, but can he escape from the island? He will have to do it if he wants to stay alive. I do not doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him for revenge. This ending left more questions than the previous ending; and I'm looking forward to autumn. <br /> <br /> A side note: what's the point of posting a review just to write all the spoilers? Where is the pleasure of ruining the surprise for everyone else? The current review on this page is nothing more than a big spoiler party, poorly constructed in barely readable English with the express purpose of angering someone. Good job.
