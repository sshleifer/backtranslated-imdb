This must be one of the most entertaining Danish films ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious as they travel through Sweden. I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he manages to go crazy in a very healthy way. BUT if you don't understand Danish (I don't mean your pastry shop here) don't waste your time with this ?? I don't think it would work with subtitles.
