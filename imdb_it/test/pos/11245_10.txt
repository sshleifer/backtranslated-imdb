The show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth; celebrating and collecting chicks is the common goal of the weekend in clubs. People disapprove of the show because of its "perverse" idea of ​​gathering girls using the technique and strategic characterization, but actually, pretty much every guy is out doing it at the club. Overall, the show really attracts the younger population, as we like to see the result of a "player" performance at the club, as the show offers a comic approach made possible by the jury. <br /> <br /> 10/10; an interesting, fun and exciting series that allows the public to really interact. Good work guys.
