This film, with only two characters, brings you closer to these two people, the inquisitor and the prisoner, that most films take you to any character, however well done. <br /> <br /> The sheer confusion, terror and pain that the character of Madeleine Stowe undergo is deeply disturbing, as is the sadistic and fascinating interrogator of Alan Rickman. <br /> <br /> This film is all too possible and is based on a shocking climax, the effect of the film as a whole that leaves you sitting silently at the end. It will haunt you for a long time.
