When I read the synopsis - 3 people lost in the wild battle against a huge crocodile - I wasn't exactly attracted. It looked like the typical horror yawning formula of a group of people haunted by a monster - except in this case there are only three, so we wouldn't even have the macabre 'joy' of seeing them caught one by one. <br /> <br /> However, I looked at it (I couldn't sleep, nothing else to do) and it turned out much better than expected. Acting is great, the atmosphere is tense and you really have the rare sense of a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> Horror as it should be done. First-rate film production. It's not perfect but it's worth seeing. I give him a 7.
