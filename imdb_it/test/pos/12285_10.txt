It is clear that the value of this film far exceeds the cost with which the format (mini-dv) implies. In fact, the filmmaker embraces the format and incorporates it so skillfully into the plot that I forgot the fact that I wasn't seeing the typical 35mm film. It has the main charm of indie films like Clerks and the work of Robert Rodriguez combined with a fantastic "new image" on the romantic comedy genre. "This Is Not A Film" is an honest film with honest portraits and, it is a superbly traveled narrative. There is no point in this film where I felt that a scene could (or should be) omitted. On the contrary, the director brings out incredible performances from truly gifted actors and does so in extremely limiting circumstances. From the page to the screen, this film is a worthy and relevant story that strikes on many levels (creative, technical or not). I highly recommend it to anyone who loves cinema or those looking for a little charm in an otherwise unattractive medium.
