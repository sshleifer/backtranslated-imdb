There are films that make a career. For George Romero it was the night of the living dead; for Kevin Smith, CLERKS; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to that list Onur Tukel's absolutely amazing DING-A-LING-LESS. Impeccable filmmaking, safe and professional like that of the films mentioned above. I haven't laughed so much since I saw THE FULL MONTY. (And, even then, I don't think I laughed so much ... so to speak.) Tukel's talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of double meanings that you should sit down with a copy of this script and take a review line by line to fully appreciate its breadth and width. Every shot is beautifully composed (a clear sign of a certain director), and the performances around are solid (there is none of the most striking scenarios imaginable from a film like this). DING-A-LING-LESS is a film whose time has come.
