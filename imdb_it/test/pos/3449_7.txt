This film has a lot to recommend. David Hewlett's paintings, music and bare back are all beautiful! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and moving - and it's not predictable, which is saying a lot about a movie these days and ages. But the acting is mediocre, the direction is confused and the script is strange. He often felt like he was trying to be a parody, but I never understood what he was trying to be a parody * of *. And if it is not a parody, well, it remains a film with great potential that is not up to par.
