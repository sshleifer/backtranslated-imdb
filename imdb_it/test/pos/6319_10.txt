Although this movie may not be the next Evil Dead (hell who knows, it only came out for a year) It's worth a look. Don't expect a $ 10 million movie. because you will be disappointed. Expect to have fun, to laugh and to enjoy the experience. All in all this film is MUCH better than most if not all of the low budget horror films out there. I have seen films that have spent more than 10 or 20 times what this movie has cost to make and have been worse than 10000000000 times. The effort that has been put into this film far outweighs the backlog that it faces having a limited budget. The films are meant to entertain and this film certainly does. In fact, this film could even open new doors for movie viewing. It is available on Netflix if it is not your local video rental store. So watch it and then decide.
