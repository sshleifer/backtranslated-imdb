People surprise me, after these bad movies became in the top 250 or just entered 7.0, I thought more people would kick out of "Throw Momma from the Train". This was a great comedy by two fantastic comic actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of madness and obsession. Billy is a man who has just lost his million-dollar story for his ex-wife and who longs for his death, Danny has a crazy old senile mother who abuses him. When Billy gives Danny some "misunderstood" advice, Danny offers Billy a proposal, if he kills his ex-wife, Billy must kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always have a good laugh. Please sit down and enjoy this movie, folks! It's good! <br /> <br /> 7/10
