The director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film I had seen "Dil Se", which led me to buy well over 122 Hindi DVDs over the course of four months. <br /> <br /> I can say I understood the total attraction, I was somehow confused as to why the film would stop for "music videos". It was an excellent film, I didn't know what to do with the dance and the female voice was a bit shrill for my western ears, but somehow I found the AR Rahmen score hypnotic. I bought the soundtrack the following day and then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and with the exception of "Ichi the <br /> killer" some other Korean films, I can't be bothered for look at much more. A bit strange for someone who has only watched a strict Hong Kong diet, Horror and action movies / Sci-Fi over the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> But I should go back to Kannathil Muthamittal, it's one of Mani Ratman's last efforts and I laughed, cried, I'm completely crazy, terrified and above all I didn't feel manipulated. The acting was superb, the photography was beautiful, I think you could stop the film at any time and notice that every frame would be worthy of painting. The music fits the movie perfectly and after the <br /> <br /> were shot, I wanted to watch again ... so I did. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you might lose the pleasure of observing the events as the characters develop. This is the great movie! I got up and applauded in my home theater when it was finished! <br /> <br /> My wife is watching now, and I can't wait for her reaction, I can't expect her to be anything less than mine.
