Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters is an art biography of Yukio Mishima, famous Japanese writer, who resembles the character of Paul Schrader, Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver): both are lonely people who seek their place in their society and when they understand that the world does not need them, they try to destroy their surrounding universe. <br /> <br /> If you want to know the life of Mishima, you will not find much information here, because it shows that he has not lived a very interesting life (except for his last day), but if you want to understand his personality, then it is the best film of its kind, since most of the film is the adaptation of his novels and also provides a guide to his thoughts. This film shows that Mishima was a person, a witness to the fall of Japanese culture, to whom he was very fond and with his final act he tried to save traditions and prove to himself that he was a true warrior, but he understood what a person he was just a man without the power to change events.
