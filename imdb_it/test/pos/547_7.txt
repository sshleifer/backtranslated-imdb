The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance by Natalie Portman. He gave his rather ungrateful character a lot of appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a beautiful actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was credible, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more engaging script. I'm not saying the script was bad in any way, I'm just saying that sometimes it seemed underdeveloped. I don't think it was the scriptwriter's fault. The film suffered from being too long, and sometimes became blurred in the longer scenes. The film looks beautiful, with good direction and excellent performance. All in all, certainly watchable, but perhaps more so for an older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
