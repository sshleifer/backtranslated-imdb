Back in China for 20 years, a young missionary refuses to become THE CAT'S-PAW for a gang of hooligans from his hometown. <br /> <br /> This film was a bit different from the previous Harold Lloyd films. The comedy derived more from dialogue, often quite serious, predominates here, rather than the elaborate gags of sight that fed Harold's classics of the past. There are some splendid moments, however, that are pure visual entertainment, such as when Harold attempts to follow a convertible in a crowded street, or when he tries desperately to prevent a stripper from losing his clothes. There is also the culminating scene, set in a Chinatown basement, where Harold happily jumps into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor comes from Harold's refusal to be the patsy of the criminals who have run his city for years. <br /> <br /> And it is rather a collection of dishonest politicians and thugs Harold finds himself, plays from a crowd of good actors: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer and Fuzzy stuttering Knight. Pert Una Merkel is at hand like the tobacco girl who captures Harold's gaze and intrigues him with his absurd vision of life. <br /> <br /> Movie stars will recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's missionary father; Charles Sellon as an elderly priest Stockport; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - all uncredited. Also, appearing only for a few seconds as an attempted kidnapper, there is Noah Young, a familiar face of Harold's silent films, who makes his final appearance here in a Lloyd film. <br /> <br /> Fox gave the film an excellent production of values, especially in the opening scenes set in China.
