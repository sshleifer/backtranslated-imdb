Little Dieter needs to fly is another in the remarkable body of filmic work of Werner Herzog that is unparalleled. After rewinding it recently on DVD, almost a decade after its first release in the United States in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and its influence can be seen on different documentaries such as Herzog's recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris Oscar The Fog Of war. Like the first, he details the life of an interesting American in his very short 74 minutes. Like the latter, he gives a sneak peek at one side of the war that few see. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but since The Fog Of War reminded us of one of the hottest warmongers of the last century, this film allows us to take a peek into the life of a grunt captured by the enemy, tortured, and in the end triumphs. Except, in any way, form or form, the film is as simplistic or optimistic as my brief description of it. Neither Little Dieter needs to fly the titular subject, Dieter Dengler, and the German immigrant survived the Nazis' depredations (we find, for example, that in his hometown, Wildburg, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was the only man not to vote for Hitler, and suffered brutally for that position) after the Second World War in Germany, and his own imprisonment in the hands of the Vietcong, when his Air Force jet was shot down on Laos on 1 February 1966 ?? While the title of the film, and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion for becoming a pilot, awakened by the impression of allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his city as a child, you make believe that Dengler is the central subject of the film, this is not true. The argument is Dengler's survival, or, more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and represent an interesting aspect for Herzog. Nor is the fact that he won a Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, the D.F.C. and the Navy Cross. That thing that prompted Dengler to survive so much, and remain a relatively optimistic man (although there are glimpses of dark sides), is what is at the center of this film and all of Herzog's canon. Dieter Dengler's "distant barbaric dream" is fully matured in the country of Herzog, and the use of a Malagasy song, Oay Lahy And, during many scenes in the jungle, among other excellent touches in the soundtrack, shows that Herzog is, perhaps together with Martin Scorsese, the best image and music manipulator in the film. For a long time you can join!
