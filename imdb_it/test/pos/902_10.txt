Now I'm on vacation in Hong Kong, and I've just seen cops at the movies ... what can I say ... it was really cool !! <br /> <br /> Everything you could wish for was inside! Basically ... just look at it if you can ... I'll make my friend send me the video when it comes out .... <br /> <br /> The only negative thing was the shy American style of talking to some of hl actors ... like Edison ... "What's up my man ?!" but added even more humor to you ... hhehe <br /> <br /> Look at it ... especially if you like the following geners: HKfilm, action, comedy, sci fi! SEEITMAN !! Edison has made a good song for this ... so download it ... Edison Tse - Heroes
