I saw this movie at the Galway Film Fleadh the year he won the best short film. I must say that I thought the direction was fantastic and that the performances of the cast members were memorable. Both main casts are definitely the names to watch out for. <br /> <br /> The last shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and I for one would like to be there if I waited for the end of the world to happen. The kiss was certainly a great success, done with great enthusiasm !! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was shot on film, and I heard that the DOP won a prize at the Tribeca Film Festival for its work on this film and I must say ... well deserved. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. He brought back some good memories and some scary ones.
