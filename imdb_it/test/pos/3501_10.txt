The thing with Ali G is that it takes the nose away from himself and his character. <br /> <br /> Humor is very similar to a "like it or love it" brand that is totally politically incorrect, irreverent and shy. <br /> <br /> Personally I totally love this film, and so I met all those who saw it. You can watch it several times and collect new gags every time. Humor is both acoustic and visual and timing is impeccable. Humor is probably very English, and London in particular, so it's possible that non-English viewers don't have a bit of humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and you'll love it - especially if you like it Kevin & Perry Go Large!
