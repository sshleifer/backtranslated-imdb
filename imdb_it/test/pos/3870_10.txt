The animation is still the slightly crude style of the first episode, Simpsons Roasting on a Open Fire, but already, with this first regular episode, Bart the Genius, humor is starting to be more "layered", more fast and greater depth of characterization is already appearing. <br /> <br /> This episode firmly establishes Bart's "slacker" personality, and more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family. Although this is the main theme of the whole episode (there is also a nice secondary theme of the relationship between Bart and Homer's father and son), it was given to us first in brief as the episode opens with the Simpsons they play Scrabble. Lisa says "id" for her word - short, but something you need to be well educated to know. He must read the definition of the rest of the family from the dictionary, which was used as a means of supporting the sofa. Marge can only come with "him". Homer has "oxidized" already sitting on his tray in order, but does not recognize that it is a word, so instead presents "doing". Bart comes with "kwyjibo", which he insists is a word. Similarly, in the main plot of the episode, Bart tricks his IQ test, which leads to his putting into a special school full of gifted children. We know it's not likely to last long. <br /> <br /> "The Simpsons" has always had a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through his characters and, more importantly, the way people with varying degrees of intellectual abilities they adapt (or not), are accepted (or not) and are perceived in society. Apart from the beginning to the present of Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge in this context, this episode already respectfully starts having fun with nerds and geeks outside the Simpson family. Through some special school student dialogues, as well as some of the other references, including purely visual ones, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" has no intention of punching through writing or speaking down to his audience. It might just be a cartoon, but it's a cartoon that intellectuals, geeks and nerds will understand more than anyone else. And this fact, apart from the fact that it's just a very entertaining show, is the key to the show's longevity.
