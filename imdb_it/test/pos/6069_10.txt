I chose "The English Patient" for an extraordinary assignment in history. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It represents life in the Second World War quite accurately, and the romance is surprising. The love story made the film so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling of passion or something. It made me want to watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are fantastic actors and the way they played their characters is amazing. The wonderful look together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity or an assignment.
