'Heaven's Gate' is not a masterpiece, which apparently was what it must have been on its first release to justify its great cost, and, even more importantly, the continuous, uncomfortable reliance of Hollywood on the Auteur model of cinema. Yet "Heaven's Gate", seen today finally on DVD in a cut of 229 minutes, is a superb film. It's a touch of lethargy in rhythm. But at least it is stimulated. Apart from the incompetence of the construction that characterizes many films today, there have been many films that, deliberately in form, have been badly damaged by being torn to pieces without any care for the rhythm, so the films become shapeless and confused. In addition, the criticism of the film has become quite retrospective. If the good guys and the bad guys are too clearly pronounced for a serious film, and yes, Sam Waterston's moustached and showy rascal is an opera (and not in the multilevel way of Bill The Butcher of "Gangs of New York"), and yes, citizens seem a bit 'Fiddler On The Roof' on some occasions, then a few dozen serious films made since then, including 'Titanic' and the awkward 'Cold Mountain' (which has some similarities and is a remarkable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film) can be chastised for exactly the same reason. <br /> <br /> Despite the accusations, the film has a plot, a fairly well documented plot. He simply does not bow to the "epic" quality of the standard form, providing Titan heroes, sub-plot rafts and confusion. She tries to tell in a way more similar to smaller, more modest films, moments of well-anticipated interaction of the character and explosions of well-structured collective action, such as the opening of Harvard and, above all, the wonderful scene where the people of the county of Johnson, following the guidance of a brilliantly physical violinist, celebrates on roller skates. <br /> <br /> 'The Deer Hunter' was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the mosaic inspired by the first half - like the accumulation of details, and I think in a similar way to the criticism of Robert Penn's novel Warren " All The King's Men "and his Jacobin acrobatics dictionary, if Cimino had not had such a mastery of the Hollywood epic conventions, he could have made a special rare artwork based on the honest display of people in their environment . On the contrary, 'Heaven's Gate' succeeds in fucking its narrative momentum and upward tension in a slowly expanding arc, until the ending explodes, while not abandoning the mosaic approach. <br /> <br /> The central romantic triangle, for example, resists standard inflections; a decent, intelligent but psychologically defeated man, James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) competes with a young hot-shot gunslinger with identity problems Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) for the hand of a young Madame, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); there is no self-awareness by bed, no slapping in the face, recriminations, or typical sad moments, but more a sad and distant decision by Ella to choose the younger man who loves less because he is ready to make the commitment. She emerges as the true hero of the film (Huppert's performance, although initially embarrassing, is really excellent, balancing a dewy emotion with a hammered spirit), first trying to save Nate and then gathering the resistance of immigrants in an enterprising defense. Subsequently, Averill is put into action when friends die. In fact, in the process of overcoming so many traps of clich√©s and style, "Heaven's Gate" successfully and voluntarily throws the note of grace of the outsider-heroes defeated by so many westerners of the 70s and portrays a possible, vigorous, exultant rally hero to a compromised victory but still satisfied. <br /> <br /> The social conflict of so many Westerners in the 1970s finally hardens into a full-fledged war; where capital attempts an overwhelming final victory over the unbelievers who stand in their way, they suddenly find an army of massive and more powerful people, led by the man who played Billy the Kid, completely destroyed, a decade earlier. This is what led the film to be described as the first Western Marxist, but in reality it simply deflowers such a theme that existed well before the 1960s. These various classic old school works such as "The Westerner" by William Wyler, and even "Shane" tell terribly similar stories. It is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the popular revolt. In a spectacular, exciting, but realistic and chaotic end, the marauding Catholic camp is attacked, surrounded by clouds of dust dotted with fallen horses, twisted bodies and gunshots. Averill finally puts his classical education to work by stealing a Roman trick and bringing the Cattlei to the brink of annihilation before being saved by Cavalry (another decidedly seditious touch, but certainly not so offensive after the inexorable representation of Little Niger Man Native American massacres). In reality, it is difficult to think of a more heroically American view of basic resistance. The only real dead point of the film is a useless tail that indicates the final recurrence of Averill, a rather potted piece of tragedy. <br /> <br /> Despite some shortcomings and a slow central part, "Heaven's Gate" is a supreme work, a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new type of epic. If you still have to join the chorus that calculates Cimino it was absurd in his behavior on the set and on the expenses, he is sorry. When, today, flops like "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" and "K-19 - The Widowmaker" see almost a hundred million dollars wasted, yet an infamous tag still hangs on this film, one reflects on what exactly deadly death is meant. The attempt at original style, the obscure sexuality, the hard-won sense of detail, the breathtaking rigor of film production and what is filmed contrast what is seriously lacking in so many contemporary Hollywood productions.
