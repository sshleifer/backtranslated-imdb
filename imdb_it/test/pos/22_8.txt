What is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews I read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behavior of gays in the era portrayed in the film. While the character of Courtenay is obviously gay, he is not the only one: we often talk about Mr. Davenport-Scott is the other, and the reason he is never seen, the reason he disappeared seems to be that he has was stopped by police for homosexual activity - a crime in England at the time. <br /> <br /> We can read on the surface that this recent event has destabilized Norman, the character of Courtenay: and we can also see in a comment by Oxenby, the character of Edward Fox, the rapid renunciation of any connection with a person of the genre when the law is involved: the fear of the association affects many of the characters, and is part of the portrait that the film paints of the past and the people who inhabit it The abandonment of Courtenay by Sir was eventually anticipated to the end, if this subtext is included: it also includes the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he thanks. The sparkling combination with the fear of exposure produces the combination of desire and fear that Courtenay should "step into the limelight", as it does when it announces the imminent air raid, a scene that would otherwise be free, but which is both a representation symbolic and literal of the inner torment of man. <br /> <br /> So while the drama is of the decline of Finney's Sir, much of the film and game tragedy comes from the "fatal flaw" of Courtenay's gayness, and makes this a movie about him, as the title suggests. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction, the rhythm and the cinematographic style of this film seem to come from another era, farther back than the eighties and, in some way, even compared to the Second World War. The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an old moral order, and the sympathy of the tormented character ruined by the cruelty of that order, of necessity trapped in the closed world of the theater; and the knowledge we have of how much of this would be wiped out after the war makes this film even more moving, for all its flaws.
