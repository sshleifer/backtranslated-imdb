This small elegant film shows the solid virtues of the past, a place and a kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or do not aspire to have. The Saint is a paladin with only the best reasons, not to mention a refined vocabulary and a diction. No need to turn up the volume or read the dialog box. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, intelligence, physical presence and, above all, masculinity, seem, well, almost normal. A little normal! George Clooney can't start mastering the scene like Mr. Sanders does (and he does without Mr. Clooney's assaults). He could play laughing (witness The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebecca) but when he was good, he was very, very good. Truly a man for all reasons and seasons.
