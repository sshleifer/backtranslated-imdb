Yes, I imagine this film is a bit boring compared to other Pam Grier films. The plot is overly familiar, the dialogue is skipped, and part of the acting is not too good. But it's worth seeing for the long stretch towards the end of the film, where we see Mrs Grier in a sexy blue wetsuit, with the half-unzipped zipper. Yes, it seems a frivolous point when talking about an actress of Pam Grier's talent, but she is also an extremely gorgeous woman, and during the day she had a body that she didn't want to stop. It's nice to see it exhibited in a snug fit. Rent the DVD and tell me I'm wrong. I can't, can you? This is because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I really gave a 10 just for the silent scenes! ;-)
