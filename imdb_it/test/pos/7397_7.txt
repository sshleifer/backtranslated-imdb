The problem with so many people watching this movie is the mentality in which they watch it. People are looking for a B-level horror movie or "So Bad It's Good" movie. Jack Frost 2 is none of these. <br /> <br /> It is, to put it simply, a great film cleverly hidden in a very ugly one. Considering it as something other than a wrapped-up comedy (easily more entertaining than all three absolutely deserving "Scary Movies" put together) is tantamount to misinterpreting the film to a basic level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple; the characters of the first film, obsessed by the memories of Jack Frost, go on vacation to a tropical island. An improved new Jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of Hydro-Man from Spider-Man; in essence, it can easily and quickly pass from water to snow, divide, multiply and, worse still, managed to grow an immunity to its only previous weakness ... AntiFreeze. <br /> <br /> What is sad about this film is that the dead fans of the first Jack Frost (a simply HORRIBLE movie) cannot appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. Just as Alien was a horror movie and Aliens was all about action, Jack Frost was a weak horror attempt and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the horror gimmick genre. <br /> <br /> Most of the fun comes from the live actors, who serve admirably. Particularly amusing among them are Ray Tooney (who plays a caricature of a retired British colonel of the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (who offers an exhilarating scare for his wooden performance of the first film), and David Allen Brooks (taking once in earnest the role of manners towards new whimsical heights. <br /> <br /> The lack of "memorable quotes" bothers me. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman, evaluate a zero, but you must understand, IT IS NOT A HORROR FILM.
