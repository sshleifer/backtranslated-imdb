WOW I love this movie. This is definitely added to my Ghetto Movies list. <br /> <br /> Juice - Starring Tupac 'I do not giva F ***' Menace II Society - O-Dawg 'I will smoke Anyone, just not giva F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hey, steal cars in broad daylight that obviously don't screw *** <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is the best hood film ever. It's at the top of the list, the threat II is in second place, and the juice is third, Clockers is really stupid. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of New Jersey Drive is also Pwnage Mac Mall & Young Lay - Everything about my faces is heard through the film. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen of the underworld - Burn the rubber, another good song, and so too Ill & Al Scratch - don't close the player <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of GTA-SA , this movie will drive you crazy, and the incredible soundtrack. The soundtrack is basically Rap on car theft ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
