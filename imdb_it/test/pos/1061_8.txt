This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when movies are just fun and funny they become a bad thing? No, this film is definitely "A Good Thing" as Martha Stewart would say (appropriately)! Barbara Stanwyck is so attractive in this film and Dennis Morgan complicates it perfectly. Both have charm and warmth to sell. They are assisted by a crew of those incredible actors who seem to have disappeared from the 40s and 50s - Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor among them. Where are characters like this today? Not a role could have been a better cast. Bette Davis has fortunately rejected this role as under her and was right to reject it. She would have tried to roll it all around her and completely destroyed the movie. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but he had the wisdom to interpret it lightly. It has rarely been more attractive and is perfect. Morgan is the essence of the good guy. Since his part is the least splash, there is a tendency to neglect his ability. Only the fact of being able to hold one's own surrounded by actors with such a distinct character is a result in itself, but he too is absolutely perfect as Jefferson Jones. Skip the sick (and useless) remake of 1992 and watch this bright and sparkling gift!
