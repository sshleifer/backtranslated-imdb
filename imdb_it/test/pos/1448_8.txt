Frank Sinatra took this role, chewed it with the rest of the scenery and spit it out. TMWTGA is a stage, the ending is trivial, some scenes require a bit more cuts, but that's all. It's a great show from beginning to end, and as you watch it you realize that Sinatra, the crooner MOR long dead, had junkies, gangster card games and the whole urban thing in the United States in his blood - he didn't learned from an acting coach. There are all kinds of directing touches to keep you entertained, and the soundtrack (undated) cooks to the hilt. The marathon card game beat Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. Forty years! So he wasn't faithful to the book? What movie is it? And I can't imagine being remembered if Brando was left free on it; the cold scenes of the turkey would have been embarrassing, instead of angular, convincing and moving with Sinatra. No one else mentioned the scruffy, lazy and cynical cops - absolutely spot on! And Eleanor Parker would lead * me * to slap.
