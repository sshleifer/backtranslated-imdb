I'm doing a thesis on boundary obfuscation: the feminine cross dresser and I'm using Tipping the Velvet as main text, comments on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, genre as performance, genre as fiction, genre images, cross -dressing as an erotic fantasy and as a revolution, the effect of male costume etc. etc. would be much appreciated! But has anyone seen the 1987 Sergio Toledo film, Vera, a little off the pitch? This is a young lesbian maybe transsexual who wears a cross ... I'm dying to see him because I think it would really help ... Does anyone know where I could get a copy? I tried Amazon and a few other sites but with no luck ...
