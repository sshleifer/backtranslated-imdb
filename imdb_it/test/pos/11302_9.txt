For a children's movie, it's great. As an adult and mother, I enjoyed watching the film with my daughter. There is a lot to do in this film. The following * could * be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie. He also learns not to give up hope and dominate his anger. I loved the sense of teamwork that is achieved by watching Barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. There is nothing in the film that I found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I felt that the moral messages of the film were superb and well made. <br /> <br /> The entertainment was pretty good. I really like ice skating scenes and I think they did very well. There's a lot of action in this movie, so I suspect most kids will have fun ... not just those who are really in Barbie. My daughter actually chose it because of Pegasus. She loves horses. But she really liked the movie. My daughter is autistic and has been able to sit down and enjoy the whole movie. She really likes the action scenes and the parts involved in horses. <br /> <br /> One thing I was thinking about was that many people oppose Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. Still, I think children, just like adults love to look at people and beautiful things. It's natural. As adults, we also like watching movie stars. It's nice though that the character of Barbie and her "boy" have a lot of personality. While it is fun to look at nice people, it gets old if there is no substance behind the beautiful face. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this is a fantastic film for children and even parents will have fun. :)
