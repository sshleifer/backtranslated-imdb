This film brings me so many memories! I was very young when it came out, but I remember the first time I saw it! My father and I always looked at "Ernest Movies" together. We hadn't seen them for several years and I found a couple of them really cheap. We watched them and couldn't stop laughing. I love all the "Ernest Movies", but this is my favorite part. <br /> <br /> Spoilers! <br /> <br /> The part I remember most is the "magnet" part. My father still does the electric chair scene! <br /> <br /> End Spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is a very poor movie ... but great! It's perfect for families (it's not like a lot of trash out there) but at the same time adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (like facial expressions and the way people move), this is the movie for you!
