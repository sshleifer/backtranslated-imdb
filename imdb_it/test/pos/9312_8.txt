The first time I saw this movie was on a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a blast and made the trip pass with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight. I tried to find a copy without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. Having looked at it twice now, I recommend it as good entertainment. My only real criticisms are that the choice of English translation words for subtitles is sub par, even for normal standards. Furthermore, the subtitles are small and small, they mix too often with the film and often travel too fast to read well.
