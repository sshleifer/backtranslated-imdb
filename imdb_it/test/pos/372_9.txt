While watching this movie again, I think it belongs to the greatest Hitchcock movies. The first time I saw it I was simply swept away by suspense, action and images. It has the compelling end, the unbalanced murderer, the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances, some great shots on the spot, eg. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. He also has great supporting actors with Hitch Patricia's daughter in the role of Ruth Roman's younger sister and brave Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The episode of the carousel towards the end is one of the most shocking in Hitchcock's work. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker in the role of Bruno Anthony (his latest complete film) gives a great performance as the crazy foreigner on the train, who insinuates himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haines ). Granger plays the good guy who is involved in a messy divorce. The film opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to get on the train. In the end, they meet and the story takes over. The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the film continues, the stranger becomes a stalker. The action shifts from place to place, including Washington, the imaginary town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship, and a passenger train that transports the two main men back and forth on separate missions. Towards the end, the rhythm of a tennis match is woven into the plot as they race against time. The camera cuts the faces of the athletes while performing the volley and they serve in a remarkable series of shots. When the closely fought race is over, the culminating chase takes place. Hitchcock has a love for trains and it's nice to see Penn Station long since gone. Trains are present in the 39 Steps, in Lady Vanishes, Shadow of Doubt, Spellbound, North by Northwest and this film. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the beginning of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 50s and I am convinced that one day his debut will be given in the hall of fame by Hitchcock.
