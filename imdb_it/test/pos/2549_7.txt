I liked Ramin Bahrani's push cart and this film is equally valid. This piece of life is almost a documentary about how life is lived on the margins. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who lives in a small room above a car shop. There are no parents; they survived alone. Ali completes his income by stealing auto parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Izzie completes her income by working on a food truck selling herself. They are trying to make money but their truck. <br /> <br /> It is tempting to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left to fend for themselves, and certainly one can be very upset that Izzie sells her body to volunteer truckers, but is that this exists today in the richest country in the world, not in an underdeveloped land. Save the indignation and do something.
