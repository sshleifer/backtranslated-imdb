I was wandering around my local library, flipping through VHS tapes, when I saw a movie that made my mouth come - Waterbabies. I was hoping to see this movie again - more than 22 years have passed since I saw it (cable movie channel around 78-79). I had recalled a good number of details - Grimes in particular. I saw my son, who is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was "Not Beautiful", and the best way to describe it was that he didn't like Tom. He accepted it. It was great that I still remembered some of the songs too! They've been stuck in my head for 22 years - which means they had to have a memorable memory, eh? <br /> <br /> It is a film for good children, with parents' guidance in case of questions about what the children had to go through that were not the nobility / society in the time frame. This is what all children face daily (except for some lucky ones), and while we look for Disney-coat films, making them more PCs for children these days, it doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist - or it still isn't. I liked the animation. It wasn't Disney, no. I don't think Don Bluth touched a brush on this film. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot to do. David T plays two roles! (I really like it!) Even James M. The waterbabies are cute. You're sorry for Tom, and you're rooting for him. So Billie herself is extraordinary in the multi-role part she plays - it's as if her eyes were magical! I'm a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW and company (AND LOOKING AHEAD OF HP!), And I filed this along with that kind of movie. Yes, jump into the water, but not because of suicide. He jumped because he trusted the woman in black - he was always appearing. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, take a copy of the rental. If you find an affordable copy, let me know where! Ian liked it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
