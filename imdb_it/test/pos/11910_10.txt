I don't understand how people can't like this movie. Hai Gossit Jr., the guy who played the main character in Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. A lot of action and fun that you no longer see in today's movies. It's really a pity. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film which is among other great films like Let's Get Harry. The 80s and early 90s have created such great films that they will never be surpassed by today's standards. <br /> <br /> They tried to somehow recreate this movie in Masterminds, but they came up with some really bad acting. The only thing the film was going was Patrick Stewart, but obviously it wasn't enough.
