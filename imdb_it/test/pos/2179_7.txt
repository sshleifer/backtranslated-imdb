Well, I've just seen Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's Butcher, and despite the crude way that everything seems to happen for almost no logical reason, I found it a lot to laugh. Like when Buster orders the molasses from the butcher Fatty, Fatty returns Buster to pay, Buster says he put him in the molasses bucket, the Fat unloads the molasses in Buster's hat and takes the money, Buster takes the hat in head as it gets blocked, Grasso tries to remove it while the molasses falls to the ground, Buster's feet are now stuck on the floor and so on. Probably this did not read in a funny way but on the screen it was fun, as were other jokes with the thrown flour and a subsequent sequence that takes place in the college of Fatty's girl with Fatty dressed as a drag and Buster that helps the rival of Fatty even in drag. As I said, many scenes don't make a lick of common sense, but the images, particularly those concerning Arbuckle and Keaton, are making people laugh even today. Recommended view for completed Keatons.
