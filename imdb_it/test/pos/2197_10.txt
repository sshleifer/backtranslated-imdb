I own this video and the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book as are Angela Lansbury and the composer, Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operatic and shows a lot of ingenuity in the composition. I really hope this VHS is available on DVD !! Hearn's performance is ghostly and comprehensive. The only annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of Joanna. I think this show was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than at a Broadway stage and I'm not sure if the minimalist set was used in New York, as in this production. But I found the scaffolding dragged onto the stage to be quite effective in "portraying" the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.
