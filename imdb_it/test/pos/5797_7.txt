In Russia, the normal teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) lives a quiet life with her drunken father and simple mother, without working and waiting for a call for a technical telephone operator course. His brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his family and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, always being a cause for discussion. When Vera meets the student of the university Sergei (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love with each other and decide to get married. Sergei moves to Vera's house, but lives in conflict with his father. This relationship brings the family into a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I just saw "Malenkaya Vera" and I really enjoyed this family drama. I have not become familiar with the lifestyle of the former USSR, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first, when Victor tells Vera that she wasn't conceived because her parents wanted her, but because they wanted to move to a bigger apartment. Another, when the family goes to the beach on a truck. Many difficulties in Vera's family and her friends, repression in the park and other situations illustrated in the film are common in Third World countries. This low-budget film is very well directed and the plot is very deep and real. The cast has great shows and actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. On the cover of the Brazilian VHS, distributed by the Sagres distributor, there is information on the fact that Natalya Negoda was the center of Playboy magazine. I'm not sure how precise the Portuguese subtitles are, since many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to a short translation in a few words. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera" ("Little Vera")
