<br /> <br /> The kind of film that requires too much from the public, but that disappoints most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican films or willing to see a film that processes the best Mexican stars) saw it, half of the people came out of the theater when I went to see it, it's definitely not the kind of film that you do could wait. I also think of people from other countries who have dared to spend 2 hours watching it until the end, "what a piece of shit". To understand Cronica de un desayuno, one must be a Mexican, and one must be familiar with the lower middle classes (or even better, be part of it). There is nothing accidental in this film, the family is and has what many families, at least in Mexico, share. You have to see it with an open mind to accept it entirely, it's not the kind of film you fully understand after looking at it. The older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his ROSSO couch, the sister stays, no matter how much she wants to leave, the younger brother is going on a hike, and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother must prepare breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father returned after who knows for how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be temporary, and ends up repeating all the attitudes of her children ... The stories around the house are surreal (and so is the movie), a transvestite looking for his penis, a worker and his suicide attempt, subtly with the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding his bicycle after an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother? ... The music does not claim too much but reaches a lot, not more than a snare drum, a cymbal, some strings. Thank you, a film like this has been made and published. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican films ever! And one of the least known, even by the Mexicans themselves, no matter how identified they should have felt. <br /> <br />
