I haven't seen it since 1998 and yet I still can't get it out of my mind or stop advising people to find it so that it shows what impression it made. <br /> <br /> Just a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> I just hope to see the stairs at least once in person ... <br /> <br /> I didn't know much about Mr. Petersen before this film as I hadn't seen his previous works but his subtle acting in this impressed me and I think his portrait of Grissom on CSI shows more the same. He knows enough to make the character shine, rather than the shining actor who makes it much better than an actor. <br /> <br /> I don't remember enough of the "poor accents" to comment, but I must say that I've always liked Barbara Hershey in all her roles and I thought she did a phenomenal job in this movie too.
