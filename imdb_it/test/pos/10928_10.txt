I had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the Miami festival last Saturday and let me say that I was amazed. It was the only film of the entire program I loved. It is well filmed, composed, modified, recited and written. After the screening I saw the director at a party and asked him what he would do next. He said he was working to find funding for the version of the short. He described some scenes to me. It looked like the kind of first film that launches the big ones in the industry. If you ever have the chance to see this short, I highly recommend taking it. A lot of crossed-star hat.
