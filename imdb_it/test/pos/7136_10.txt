I'd like to order this film for women in treatment. I feel this is a fantastic movie for them to watch. I can't very well not have been on eBay and all the other sites to order this movie. now I'm asking you for help to clarify where I can see this movie or what to do to get one. I'd really like to show this movie. Yes, I was like this movie and a lot of people here in therapy to see how people can change lives and move on. I think Markie Post played this move very well, she's a great actress who loves her movies. and if you have any other films about addiction, I'd like to order them from the treatment center for women and men so that they can watch other people go through what they go through in life.
