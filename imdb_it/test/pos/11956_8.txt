If I ever write movies or make them, I'd like one of them to be like this. I like the sense of humor and the jokes inside. This movie does stupid things without looking like this. The names of the places and the characters are priceless, the generic New York High School, Calimari (George's sister), calamari etc ... brilliant. I saw this movie so many times because it was a cable TV cable while I was growing up, obviously I didn't get all the jokes back but it was still fun. This film is a timeless classic.
