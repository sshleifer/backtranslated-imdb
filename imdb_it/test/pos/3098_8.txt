One of the funniest comedies of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short "Chess Fever", a crazy story of how a strictly intellectual board game can break even the most carefully planned central economies. A comic subject as unpromising as chess has found an earlier outlet in this delicious short. Two young men play seriously against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to previous Lumi√®re short films such as "L'Arrosseur Arrosse" or "Repas du bebe", in which human activity was deliberately framed by a natural environment. The difference in activity (natural = feeding of the child, irrigated garden, artificial = chess) is probably significant. <br /> <br /> The main contrast in this film is between this immutable background and the placid, serene game of chess, and the fierce passions that the latter provokes, while accusations of cheating lead to a more unworthy melee. Intellectual play becomes a gross physical wreck, just as the claims of artistic filmmakers are forever deflated by the "rawest" demands of the public. <br /> <br /> What is more entertaining than the film is not necessarily this slapstick descent, but the way it is filmed, its prolongation long after the initial joke was made; the way the camera refuses to ennoble the fight with something like attention, focusing instead on the set, as we see glimpses of thrown feet and dislocated clothes. The refusal of the film to modify is bold, so that humor seems to derive from something other than struggle, which reflects our need for physical contact beyond intellectual stimulation, our reluctance to let go. <br /> <br /> What is above all genius is the ending, given that these upper-class insults are captured by the waiter, who picks them up like two schoolboys in difficulty, as if he were about to close his ears. If the masters cannot be expected to keep their place with decorum, then someone will have to do it for them.
