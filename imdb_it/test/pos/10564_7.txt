I'm not exactly sure why I ordered "Fingersmith" from Netflix - probably, because I like BBC dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. I had no idea what I was about to see. The plot, which I will describe in general only so as not to ruin it for those who will see it after reading my review, has more turns and turns than a mountain road in the Rocky Mountains, of the type that usually appears in "caper" film. They are very unusual in a period drama. Not having read the novel (and I do not intend to do so), I was totally unprepared for the surprise that concludes the first segment on the DVD and equally surprised by the subsequent turns. Nevertheless, he is very well played by the two young executives (from Sally Hawkins, in particular, as Sue and Elaine Cassidy in the role of Maud) and, in key roles, by Imelda Staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by Charles Dance is the rich uncle who collects pornographic material and saves the young Maud from the mad house where his mother lived to be his secretary. The lesbian relationship between Maud and Sue is the "big news" of the film, but in reality it is not its fulcrum. The fulcrum is a plot to steal the fortune that Maud is due for her 21st birthday. The twists and turns in the plot add tension, though not much credibility, to the film. However, no viewer is able to doubt that Maud and Sue will somehow end up together - unlikely - while the closing credits come out. Although one was raised as an ady and serves a pornography collector, and the other is a pickpocket posing as a waitress, the author obviously intends for them to live together in the end. It's a little hard to digest, as everyone has conspired to cheat the other. Despite these reservations, I really liked the film. It absolutely doesn't deserve the praise that others have lavished on it. The scariest and most interesting scenes take place inside the asylum where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to London to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress, able to convey the sagging and changing emotions of her character with her facial expressions and her eyes. No doubt we will see more of her. I hope so for sure.
