(ATTENTION: SPOILERS!) <br /> <br /> Five young men ignore the warnings of the ranger George Kennedy and climb the foggy mountains of Oregon, where they are chased and massacred by a pair of huge, deformed, in-bred twins hillbilly. When only two are left, Warren and his girlfriend, Connie, resort to their animal instincts to survive. The film ends with Connie pushing half her arm into one of the assassins' throats, choking him to death. A powerful shot, even if a little overrated, of the backwoods that makes effective use of lighting, sound and photography that make it a cut above the usual Friday 13th. Led by an attractive and likeable cast, in particular Deborah Benson (where is she now?) And Gregg Henry, this elegant complement for director Jeff Lieberman SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) should not be missed.
