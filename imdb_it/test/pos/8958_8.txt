A beautiful cinematic story of a former gay and bitter adolescent teenager, now waiting for a table. Sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically and with a true human face. This, and launches a serial killer in the wild, and you have LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS. A well portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The script is fluid and credible. Performance is well above average, and the twists of history are clear. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the ideal concept for everyone in a film, but for those who appreciate something different and written brilliantly, it is very worthy of your time. Highly recommended.
