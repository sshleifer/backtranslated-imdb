I'm usually wary of movies that are around 6/10 of IMDb. I like to think that people know what they are talking about and know what they want. I guess the trick with the review is to take an "Hey, if I liked the types of movies like these - approach - I'd like to give a higher score than what I'm going to give it now since I don't like these types of movies" again people judge differently, giving more value to acting, or perhaps to history or directing. Anyway, landing the plane here - I had already rented this movie before and I hadn't had time to watch it, I did it this morning. <br /> <br /> Wow! See this movie. I am personally interested in the paranormal / I read a little bit about pre-death experiences, so I was automatically caught. I'm not sure some of the comments here saying that a quality cast was wasted here - I disagree - the acting here was superb by everyone - I think this is the only time I didn't mind Julia Roberts, it's It was nice to see the 24 Kiefer Sutherland (currently at the time of this review, serving a prison sentence for DUI), and Kevin Bacon sports an interesting hair style. <br /> <br /> Overall I liked the direction, the atmosphere, the acting and the plot most of all - especially the idea of ​​karma, and, to quote Nelson Wright "All that matters". So true. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
