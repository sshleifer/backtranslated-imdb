The story of Renoir on Paris, the Cancan, a washerwoman and the Moulin Rouge. A more subdued but very funny version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge. Jean Gabin gives his usual excellent performance. The technicolor photography in the print that I saw was exquisite. An easy serene view. chris w galla
