This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I took myself to a new time and place. It was as if I were right there with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx has turned into Ray. During the film it was Ray. Furthermore, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were superb. The film was well made and directed, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I saw the film four (4) times with different people and the last time was just as enjoyable as the first time. I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. This is a film that will be seen several times in the years to come. <br /> <br /> Thanks for the great experience.
