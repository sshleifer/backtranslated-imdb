Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are exceptional as duo of young submarines stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is very funny, and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "Ptomaine". The character of Walter Huston is inspiring as the captain of the submarine, a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the level of technology shown in the battle scenes. I was surprised how much the technology of the First World War was similar to the technology shown 25 years later in the Second World War. Basic human nature has been described as very similar to modern times and far from the conservatism that I thought existed in the so-called "innocent" past. All in all I felt that the cast, the characters, the action scenes and the vision of the story represented in this film were top notch.
