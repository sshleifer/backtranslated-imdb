I just saw the hair after an interval of 20 years. He hit home. For those of us who have tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the domain of privileges and power; those who resisted the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of the civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every day until the beast of the United States died and fled; for all those who have said no in many different ways - it is amazing how unsatisfactory we have been. How big was the royal table on which Treat danced. How he led the wizard behind the curtain. We had 20, 22, 24. We didn't know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster that for the next thirty years and the count would continue to eat the world. How could we? Even with the smoke and the bat (the bat!) In our hand, like Treat, we were too young, too middle class, too invested, too much of the actions we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment there As Andre Gregory observes in My dinner with. . . , there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60s and early 70s, when maybe we could find something besides the yellow brick road. Something not fed by Bechtel, prisons, Enron and Dick. Something collaborative. Something innocent and critical at the same time. Something with dance. <br /> <br /> But we got lost. Like Kong bending a beam, the "revolution" turned on itself. In racism sexism. Homophobia. And overwhelming class politics. Until we arrived at "W". The treat would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in that movie. Then. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Complete incompetence riding drunken and infuriated bulls in estuaries, children's lives and Chinese shops. <br /> <br /> We should have done something more. Something better. But clearly we didn't know what. <br /> <br /> Now what?
