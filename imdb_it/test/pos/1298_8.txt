I really enjoyed this movie. One thing I've noticed is that Korean TV drama is definitely better, as far as giving the whole story is concerned. I watch movies when I don't have the time or I feel like going through 16-30 episodes. The films seem to be in a hurry and if you don't watch carefully, you may lose something. <br /> <br /> I feel that this was rushed and I had to rewind some parts to try to find what I was missing, especially towards the end. If you like beautiful love stories, I still think it's cute, and if you have the extra time, I still think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It's always nice to come back to follow the actors in different films as we don't follow them since they started, as we are producers and directors actors in our countries.
