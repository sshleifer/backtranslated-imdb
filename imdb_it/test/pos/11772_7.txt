This is the kind of movie that could give you a nightmare, besides being a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Hardware Wars is the only good parody of Star Wars, other films like Spaceballs have failed. This is the only good parody I've ever seen, it doesn't rip Star Wars, it makes fun of it, and that's what swear words should be.
