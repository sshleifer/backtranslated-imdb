I really enjoyed this movie. Great realistic-looking combat movies for one thing and also a touching and genuine story. The calm and sober way of the main character, Franta, makes him very nice. Human relationships in history seemed so typical and possible of what you could expect in times of war. The link between Franta and Carel shows the loyalties war mates can have for one another and which is often described in books and interviews with veterans. Subtitles in no way detract from the story and serve to highlight the problems of Czech pilots in the RAF. The post-war plot recalls that for many the suffering of the Second World War did not end in 1945, especially in the occupied Russian countries. The photograph was also very good. I wish I had seen it on the big screen.
