It is risky to shoot such a lavish production of "The Merchant of Venice". It could be a sturdy vintage piece of wood, or it could be ridiculous for its excesses. This version is neither nor is it completely sold by Al Pancino's Shylock, which is very discreet, giving a competent and honorable performance. Antonio by Jeremy Iron, is as always with his roles of self tortured, compelling. Some of the minor roles seemed to be a little too much in the spirit of loud entertainment, "the story of a Venetian boy's adventure", but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically carried forward in the film. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the locations, costumes and interiors of the location were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> One thing I don't want to comment on is the anti-Semitic content of the game. The film is in tune with the plight of the Jews, while it portrays Shylock as the instrument of his self-destruction. It is a sad comment that four centuries later, the director of this film felt it necessary to comment on his nuanced vision before the preview at the Toronto festival. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful film, and I look forward to different views.
