pretty good, don't expect anything of high culture ....... the acting is bad, the plot fails, but it's still a pretty good movie to watch. why? because it's dark, a little stupid, as unpredictable and just fun and fun to watch. don't expect anything, as I said, just look at it for yourself and understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> is a film, without a memorable plot or acting, but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh, cry or at least make you feel compelled to watch it until the end ... <br /> < br /> this is all i wanted to say .... <br /> <br /> 7/10
