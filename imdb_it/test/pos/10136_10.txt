This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! How anyone can beat this movie is just a little confused with my imagination! First of all, Gooding and Harris performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. This is the only way I can describe acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play such a character and pull it out; then see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it was based on a real person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. For all the action buffs, it might be a bit slow, but then it's not an action movie. I definitely give this movie a 10. It deserves nothing less!
