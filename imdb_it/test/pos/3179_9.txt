This was a great show ... I don't remember much about this, but remember to watch it and love it. I remember the mother and the father. I really like my grandmother. He was like a grandmother you really couldn't appreciate until you became an adult. She was very competent and makes no sense. My favorite song on the show was Sardines in the Morning. (which might not be the title) I remember after seeing that show and listening to that song I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousins ​​and my sister and I sang that song so much that when we left all my little cousins ​​were singing this too. I would also like to find this on DVD.
