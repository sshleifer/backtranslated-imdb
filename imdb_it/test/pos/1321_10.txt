Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forgotten on Sunday morning. Moving images are works of art that stay with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the kind of thing that should win the Academy Awards, a brilliant visual film of depressing and uplifting film. Instead of taking a direct look at Yukio Mishima's life, director Paul Schrader weaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and last day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the Japanese army into rebellion in the name of the emperor. Failing to do so, he commits ritual suicide in a finale that hits you like a ton of bricks. The three adaptations of short stories allow us to take a look at what led to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear as theatrical representations. Ken Ogata is as magnificent as Mishima. Despite his eccentricities, he is very nice, a man who is ready to die for his beliefs and does so. This makes the ending much more devastating and the sense of loss more significant. Of the three adaptations in history, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House and Runaway Horses, is the last to be the strongest and the most exciting. It is also the story that comes closest to Mishima's mood in his later years and illustrates what really brought him to the events of November 1970. This review cannot be complete without mentioning the impressive soundtrack of Philip Glass. Not since 2001 a soundtrack has been such a perfect compliment to its graphics. Paul Schrader has made one of the most beautiful films of the 80s or any other decade. Have the bundles ready because the finish will leave you in tears. Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters reminds you that sometimes cinema can still be an art form and how art is brilliant.
