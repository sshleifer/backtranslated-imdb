tell you what was excellent. Dylan Moran is simply the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage) and with Micheal Caine as your partner is not so bad, both are great to watch in a really fun movie. true, not all gags come off, but it's worth stopping for those who do, but come and get micheal caine in a suit (admission fees are worth it all) and whenever dylan moran on screen is more like Bernard black films. the story is composed of two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by reciting different characters to deceive them, but to get away with it is a different matter. basically "the actors" is a great British comedy that somehow escaped many, seriously if you are a fan of Moran (or want to see Micheal Caine in a suit) surely see this
