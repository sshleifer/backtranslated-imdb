Whenever this film was re-aired on TV late at night in the late 70s and early 80s, I would always have found the time to sit in front of the TV and watch it. To see the beautiful Kate Jackson, the handsome Richard Long, the "great" Polly Bergen that I have never seen anywhere else except for this TV movie, the captivating Tom Bosley and another "big" that I never have seen outside of this film, Celeste Holme. This is really the boat of love on a cruise for murder and chaos and the boy was always nice !! And every time I looked at him I always forgot who the real murderer was. <br /> <br /> As expected, someone here is already criticizing the film as if it really was of great help to anyone. This is a great TV movie and it's worth watching it every time. I can't say that about half of the movies I've seen this month. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch it on TV one day, which is not likely, watch it. In light of "The Girl Most Likely To" which will finally be released on DVD this year, perhaps there is hope for a "Death Cruise" DVD.
