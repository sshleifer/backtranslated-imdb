What a fantastic mini series. The original TRAFFIK took me completely away from everything there was. Much more engaging than the American remake, the original TRAFFIK boasts an extraordinary cast of lesser-known actors for the North American public. Juliette Binoche is the mainly recognizable actress who plays a teenage daughter dependent on a government official. But it is not the stellar power that this film brings (although I liked the American version, I heard it was obscured by the famous Americans in the photo). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before finding the original BBC miniseries. Obviously there were no image filters, lush venues and the big name stars / director. However, the grit and the dirt of Europe (through the world of drugs) perfectly complete the imminent sense of danger that permeates this whole film. The problems, like getting drug addicts giving them more, the poor anti-drug campaign and the resistance of foreign governments to help destroy their drug growers from within, make TRAFFIK bold, engaging and horrible all on the same level. time! <br /> <br /> The truly incredible parts of the film all come from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how bad the problem really was in Europe ... even everywhere! For a true education on drug problems, besides how they affect the human body, you have to look at both this and the American version. Each shows a very clear and undeniable fact. Those countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to death and suffering for many. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. The dark secrets of every "successful" society work in the shadows.
