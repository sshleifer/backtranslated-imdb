Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller act in the story of two women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is the love boyfriend of Thomas who lives again during the Blitz. Meeting in a bar they reconnect, but things get complicated when Thomas' brings his wife (Miller) the next time he meets her. The women hit him and things proceed in rhythm until the trio is reached by the man who will become Knightly's husband. This further complicates things when jealousy begins to show its face. <br /> <br /> Beautiful to look at, extraordinarily written and wonderfully performed (all disappear completely in their roles) this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and ears. It's so nice to see a movie about adults who are adults. On a purely visceral level, I really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing. I have rarely seen a film that is beautifully made. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that I'm not completely sure of everything that happened. Something seemed to be missing and a couple of times I had to repeat the movie to see if I was missing something. It's not bad, but it's not completely satisfying as a result. (I tried to take a look online to see how much of the movie is true but I didn't find anything). However I think this is a film that is worth seeing. It's a great movie for adults with the best acting they have done.
