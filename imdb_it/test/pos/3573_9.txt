Actually I went to see this movie with low expectations because it was the only one that suited my program. And incredibly I found it really original. I have already commented on other Colombian films, and I agree that Colombian films tend to have a similar pattern, and they always try to refer to common and vulgar people, especially trying to make jokes with continuous curses. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not particularly exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is the way real people talk. The plot and rhythm are brilliant and could be extrapolated to any country in the world. The acting was great and the script is for me one of the best ever produced in Colombian land. I think anyone in the world can get a good hour and a half of entertainment, with a beautifully well-directed comedy of bluffing black humor. It reminded me of films like snatch and others like that. I highly recommend it and hope it can be seen by more people, since Colombian films seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year.
