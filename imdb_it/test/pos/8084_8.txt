This is a plot based on the plot and extremely fun. Nothing surprising or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves at an exceptional rate and therefore keeps your attention. I didn't really notice the acting that I guess is a good thing. John Mills was fine, but he seemed to take everything into consideration considering how his life was falling apart around him. He would be piled on his head, stand up 20 seconds later, dust off and continue as if nothing had happened. A small quirk in a film with a strong story, authentic places and a plot that continues to guess until its conclusion.
