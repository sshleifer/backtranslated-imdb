I can't remember exactly where I heard them before, but I listen to a bit of a song and I liked it. I went to buy the CD and finally found the kind of music I like. I heard about this video and knew I had to have it. He has a lot of clips from them playing in concert. Let me tell you, watching this video doesn't even compare to them in concert. I've seen them twice in concert and I never want to miss the chance to see them again. The other two things he has are some interviews and even a video for one of their greatest songs. a couple of secondary notes ... I saw them at the ozzfest 2001 and they reigned there, but seeing them in a smaller stage was much better (they had really nice things to do with the ability to turn off the lights) , if someone asks, the vote means a devoted follower.
