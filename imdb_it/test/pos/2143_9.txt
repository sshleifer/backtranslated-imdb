I saw this film for the first time when it was published in 1980. From other sources, I learned that the only version of the 219-minute cut was in New York, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So, I guess I've seen the shorter version before that, I thought at the time, was a very interesting anti-Westerner, even if a little confused ... <br /> <br /> So, it was even more interesting that I finally got a DVD of the full version. I'm glad I did because this second vision confirmed for me that the film is a true classic, and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unjustified, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a long film, but so many others. For example: Once upon a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus {restored version} (1960) at 198 minutes; Gone with the wind (1939) to 222 minutes and others. So, it can't be about running the time that made so much foam at the mouth back, when Heaven's Gate arrived on the scene. <br /> <br /> But note this: all those above the movies have everything to do with strengthening myths about history and heroes. <br /> <br /> Not so Heaven's Gate: in this narrative, the American West is shown in all its sad and inexorable hardness, injustice and poverty. And this is probably the first reason why this film liked it so much: it outlined the circumstances of the war in Johnson County in 1892 in Wyoming, showing how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 murderers to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of rustling cattle; and all with the assistance and connivance of the authorities, up to the President of the United States. For an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link on Wikipedia under Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Very few people like to be reminded of really dirty times in the history of their country, and who fly in front of what the country should be. If it had been a documentary, it would have been barely acceptable to most; as entertainment, it was almost destined to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous. Leaving aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment, that Cimino launched here, with regards to the narrative ?? the story of the three main characters? Well, it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it probably isn't unusual now. It is a fairly normal love triangle in which she must choose between the two men, and in the end she decides the younger man, Nathan, who, although not above resorting to murder in cold blood when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment to old James (or Jim, as most people in the film say). For some, that part of the story is too slow, perhaps; in the context of the wider narrative of war, however, it is, I think, entirely appropriate. <br /> <br /> And that war is represented graphically, cruelly and cruelly with exquisitely staged carnage scenes mounted impeccably ?? although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I am certain that some scenes of chariots that are cracking are repeated. A minor point and maybe caused when the 219 minute cut was restored? However, it hits you in the face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war ... <br /> <br /> Which brings me to another criticism from others: the noise and dust is such that it is often difficult to hear the dialogue and even see clearly what is happening. I have to admit that I discovered that at the beginning it would have been a bit annoying, even going back to reproduce the parts to try to capture the image or the words ?? until I realized that it was not necessary if I accepted the director's intent: life is chaotic, it is difficult to listen and see in crowded situations and, in war, it is the sine qua non of this staging. In short, it's like you're really present inside and inside the scenes ... <br /> <br /> And what about the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to a symbolic closeness to God and therefore, if God is identified with the natural world, the breathtaking scenery that pervades the film ?? and is it surprising, obsessively equal to that of Doctor Zhivago by David Lean (1965) ?? it is a useful metaphor. I tend to think, however, that Cimino had something more to say, that is the idea that the brave immigrants ?? the god-fearing salt of the earth ?? access to paradise on earth was denied and the freedom to build a life for oneself in the land that pretends to be the champion of freedom. <br /> <br /> Was it Cimino's intent? to gut the myth of the American West? To show how, in America, only the rich become rich while the poor are massacred, in one way or another, throughout history? Is it something new? Not really, as we all know. However, where he is really hurt, he shows how America was not and, implicitly, it is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after absorbing this narrative, the impression remains that America's bases have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a house of foot soldiers ...
