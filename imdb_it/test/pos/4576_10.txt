I recommend Idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the film is insightful and made me laugh so hard that I had tears running down my face several times. Until the end, when I caught my breath and realized how close we are to the vision of Mr. Judge tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on a cameo from the Mac (Justin Long) spot like Dr. Lexus. I found his performance worthy of an Oscar, especially considering what Oscars were delivered in the recent past ... besides, it's nice. <br /> <br /> In short, Idiocracy is a fatally entertaining look into a possible future where people are named after product brands (the president's middle name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion dollars, there are mountains of garbage because nobody is smart enough to understand what to do with all this and nobody cares anything but money. All because only the stupid are growing. It seems familiar to me, somehow. Oh yeah; that's what I think when I see a professional wrestling ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. It's a good laugh and will make you think.
