Valley Girl will always have a special place in my heart: I would say that it is certainly the best comedy for teenage adolescents of the 80s, but this is a compliment for the shoulders. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place - almost twenty years later this is a wonderful snapshot - yet its history remains timeless. (This is only Romeo and Juliet, minus death after all!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, showing all the initial promises that, it turns out, has squandered on crapola of exaggerated action. Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this film, and I can't believe she hasn't had a bigger career; someone finds it QUICKLY. This is sweeter and more delicate than most movies of the genre - the required nudity seems to be thrown by contractual obligations - and, although not revolutionary, it is certainly nice to see this type of film that respects its characters and does not crucify its young superficial girls to have fun - even the crew of Foreman's best friends, misled by peer pressure, is never presented as bad. (In fact, her friend Stacy, forced to double up with her friend Fred di Cage, has fun despite her protests, and nods to Fred in the back seat.) This will take you back to the early 80's if you were there, but holds up pretty well today. Beware of those unfamiliar with the film: DON'T watch one of the apparently continuous appearances of VH1 - go and rent it in its unpublished glory. Otherwise, you lack some of the most powerful and specific dialogues of the time. And you can't write about Valley Girl and don't mention the fabulous soundtrack of the great songs of the 80s, most of them made by one-hit prodigies, which are not only an integral part of the sense of time and place in this film, but thematically chosen. Watch it - great little movie! Fer shur !!
