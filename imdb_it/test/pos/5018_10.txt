It is a film with a theatrical message mixed with some clever moments. Films like these are the reasons for stretching of great actors, they enjoy throwing the ball into open pieces like these. The angel that was not what we see in old books and churches is a nice change. It echoed in the piece by Kevin Smith, Dogma, almost in the same slapstick vein. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after sucking it. Could it be so many movies are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this? Probably one of the funniest pieces I've seen in a while, I came across this on VHS in a garbage can because someone's cellar was flooded this summer, and I grabbed a handful of ribbons. <br /> <br /> Whether in a trash can or on the silver screen, light comedies like this are fun, you don't have to tell everyone in a trendy nightclub that you like, or a sensible political party. Just keep it for you, and I bet many people will borrow it from time to time.
