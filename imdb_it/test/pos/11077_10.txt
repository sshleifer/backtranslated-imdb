I am NOT one who likes those Anime cartoons (eg Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Zatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters and doesn't focus much on some sort of weapon or Mamodo as much as the episodes I've seen, such as "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs. Kiyo". Zatch Bell focuses really about the life of The Strange Zatch, The Smart Kiyo, The Clueless Suzy, and WeIrD's Ponygon.Zatch Bell is probably my favorite comic for now, but I encourage others to watch 1 episode of it, you'll probably like it! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H.
