Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a mob boss to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip on the beach to spend some time , but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the big 10 is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys do their best to spot Jimmy, which means no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him. So now Jimmy is hiding to organize a bank robbery to get Pando's money back. Also, during this mess he meets the innocent and sweet Alex (Rose Byrne) and together they are walking around a hell of Sydney's King Cross. <br /> <br /> "Two Hands" is simply a compelling pick-me-up movie that is lively, hilarious and incredibly cool. What do you have here is practically an urban gangster movie with a bleak background and violence in the face ?? what, how cool is what you ask? Well, why does it take us to the underworld, where the Australian culture shines with criminals who wear flip-flops (flip-flops) and shorts, machines made and a can of beer in their hands ?? and don't forget the dry and sarcastic sense of Australian humor. It can be said that he owes a lot to the likes of "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" (my favorite) and "Lock, stock and two smoke barrels" for his inspiration, but for me it is still valid. The film has a real mix of carefree moments, but also a mediocre streak with some unexpected shocks and black humor that can actually be disturbing. You simply don't know what's coming and have a touch of snappy irony (especially the ending) and good timing with his humor. A scene involving a bank robbery will tear you to pieces, I guarantee you. The plot of the plot is actually a story that goes by age (or on the road not taken), with an added punched love story and then the gangster element to finish it. Most sub-plots have been intelligently built and linked together, well, maybe it could have gone without the supernatural element involving Jimmy's dead brother, but in the general context the different plot seems to click together. The intense, natural and sparkling dialogue filled the screenplay outrageously colored, with rapid Australian / twang slang shots - I'm fair dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the film was Pando, Bryan Brown's performance. He simply gave his character such a devoutly charismatic / bad character that when he was not on screen his presence was still felt. He gave his character two sides: one is a sting, but the other side is such a good guy. A young Rose Byrne shines with her nervously sweet / eccentric character, Alex. He looked radiant and added a bubbly personality. Then you had Heath Ledger who behaved like naive Jimmy. Great supporting cast involved with the likes of Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. You get these perfect performances and you get compelling, funny and credible characters. Hitting the rock soundtrack that explodes at the seams with the likes of Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd create a fantastic atmosphere. Furthermore, the fact of being shot on location in Sydney's King's Cross helped to bring it out by keeping a life of its own and showing the Australian lifestyle. The tricks in the sail room have superbly captured the background of the city, in particular the penetrating nightlife. This was a film that when I finished I was totally satisfied with what I got. Overall, a crime thriller that achieves its purpose ... a fun, intelligent and crazy roller coaster journey of excitement and excitement. <br /> <br /> I say, it's an Australian hit on "Lock, Stock and Two smoking barels" by director / writer Gregor Jordan in his debut film. If you find it, don't hesitate to try it.
