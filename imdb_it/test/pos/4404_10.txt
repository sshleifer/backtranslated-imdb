Thank goodness for the Coen brothers. Their success has brought them more budget, but it has not freed them of their creativity. I had planned to see another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one. When it started, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This film is hilarious, but they don't make cheap jokes just to have a laugh. The script is brilliant and comes with great skill by George Clooney (after this, no one can say it's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, regardless of whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was so smart. I have seen others that I will describe as beautiful, intriguing, fun and fascinating, each of which also describes "Oh Brother", but this film reminded me of older episodes of Seinfeld in which all the subplots finally joined. You can feel that their journey is growing in something, but you can't say what. And the Coen brothers are not lacking, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's amazing, and it tidily ties all things together, without bringing the story out.
