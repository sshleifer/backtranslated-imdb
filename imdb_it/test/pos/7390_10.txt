"It's funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /> <br /> The characters of Dark Habour, a married couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and a tramp (Norman Reedus), are slipping into a game full of hidden sexual energy and treason. The tempting breaks now and then increase the tensions and give much space to the interpretations. Good acting and a story that, if you don't use your brain, will leave you in confusion. You have to watch it twice at least. The real strength lies in its non-conformism and, of course, in Alan Rickman. Those who love it will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It is not a typical movie in the early evening, but well done!
