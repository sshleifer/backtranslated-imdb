When it was opened, "Heaven's Gate" had become, to its detriment, more a cultural phenomenon than a film. At a time when concern for excessive budgets and the arrogance of the director were growing, it was a convenient goal, given that it was a job far from the recent "author" of hitting Hollywood, which had not yet established the track record that would have given him the benefit of the doubt between the critics and the industry. As someone pointed out at the time, nobody would have jumped on even more expensive and obscure "Reds" than Warren Beatty, because Beatty was "one of us", while Michael Cimino had not achieved this status. <br /> <br /> But "Heaven's Gate" was also influenced by a cultural change that occurred at that time, from the political move to the right and towards a more unconditional patriotism and the consecration of the myth of the West (and of the West ). A few years earlier, Cimino's demythification of the border might have seemed timely, fresh and a necessary corrective. But in 1980, in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, it was thought of as almost non-American. <br /> <br /> Which is a pity, because the film, seen from the vantage point of several decades away, is a fascinating and stimulating look at that particular moment and place like a world in which life was, in the words of Hobbes, "bad, brutal and short". Kristofferson plays James Averill, an upper-class Oriental who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in Wyoming, where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by settlers and squatters against an attack by an engaged mercenary death squad from wealthy landowners, including Averill's best friend ever. In a more innocent moment, Averill and his "army" of poor peasants would emerge triumphant; but that's all but a traditional western, and when the US cavalry joins the fighting here, it's not on the "good guys" side. <br /> <br /> Very similar to "The Deer Hunter", Cimino's The previous film, "Heaven's Gate" spends a lot of time reconstructing the details of the life of its protagonists, giving the film a pleasant rhythm which nevertheless leads to a compelling conclusion. With excellent acting, a beautiful musical score and the visual plot that makes one believe that one is actually seeing the "Old West" through new eyes, "Heaven's Gate" is a film that rewards repeated views. I just want MGM to release a new DVD, with an improved transfer and a comment from Cimino. Nevertheless, the current version is satisfactory enough to allow viewers to see what critics in 1980, perhaps blinded by the film's cultural subtexts, managed to lose ... that "Heaven's Gate" is a great movie.
