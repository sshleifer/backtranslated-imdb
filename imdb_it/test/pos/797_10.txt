Ok, I'm a big fan of Traci, so his being alone in the movie makes him automatically at the 8.5+ level. But even apart from being there, I thought it was a good movie, especially since it was an HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you remove Traci from the movie, it would be ok. But a person cannot make it and she is a wonderful actress. It continues to improve more and more.
