A fascinating look behind the scenes on how a really good film can be realized if the producers, the director and the cast simply "refuse to stop". These guys met with serious obstacles during the two years of the project (tiny budget, problems with the script and with the screenwriter), so the finished product was not what was originally planned, but it probably turned out to be more interesting than the film proposes to do, which goes to show that the punk mentality of "just do it" ... with or without any support, money or help ... figure it out on the fly and do what you want to do. I really enjoyed this documentary film and I know that viewers will see and learn things they didn't know before. This film is really "one of a kind ... it's hard to classify because it has" science fiction "and" suspense "pieces and also" how to make a film ". It tells the truth about how films are made, what I really like the music written by Ed Ivey. These guys know how to make a good movie on a string of shoes because they are creative and know how to make props, dollies, staging, lighting with what they can dig ... incredible things.
