The battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I've ever seen and it's also the first silent film I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I got the tape at home and watched it. In the end I thought it was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real Russian battleship Potemkin. You wouldn't think so, but part of it was sad and disgusting. Sad because the mother dies and the baby carriage rolls down the stairs and the disgusting must eat rotten meat with worms inside. <br /> <br /> Today it is still considered one of the best silent and Russian films ever made. I think everyone should see it (if they can find it). You'll be surprised how beautiful it is. It is a must see classic. 5/5.
