Florence Vidor plays the daughter of a strict bible with her father who throws her out of the house when gossip makes her name. In the big city, he finds the dying wife of his brother (the two are secretly married) and raises his son alone. Years later, he returns home to confront his family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is heavily imbued with fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but with an extraordinarily modern sound). Some of them are made with a trowel (like his father, Theodore Roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout), but it is well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by cinematographer Henry Sharp.
