This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, the scenery and the reality of the film are quite compelling. A true look, let's say it is, deforestation, the mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development. Horse music is very unique and adds a disturbing quality to some scenes. After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to go out and buy the video and the soundtrack. Overall, a quiet type of film with panic bursts. Both Torn and the Cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this film in the same category as Winter People with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
