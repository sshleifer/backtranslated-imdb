The comment of algernon4 that "the ultraviolet dance of Mrs. Paget (the film is the most erotic in the history of films") is certainly a bit exaggerated. Nor is it the most erotic dance of Debra Paget. His almost naked rotations in "The Indian Tomb" by Fritz Lang make this number decidedly domesticated. As for being the most erotic in the history of dance. Well! Where do I start? The performance of Salma Hayek as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I love the sequence and I included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on Youtube. I just think that making statements like "the most erotic in the history of cinema" is really coming out on a very fragile branch.
