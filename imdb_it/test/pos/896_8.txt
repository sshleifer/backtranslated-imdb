The first of the Italian scams in the French soft porn blockbuster (although it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got the first with IO CAN by Cesare Canevari, EMMANUELLE played by Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle than the squalid sequels provided by the deceased, arguably great Joe D'Amato. It is much closer to the historic 1973 film Just Jaeckin, which took on a poker aspect for male / female relationships, questioning such hot topics as loyalty and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic environments. Unlike D'Amato, director Albert Thomas (aka Adalberto Albertini, who also struggled to find YELLOW EMANUELLE, actually a sexy version of MADAME BUTTERFLY!) Does not present us with drug traffickers, snuff movie producers or wild cannibals, for a visually less sensational but much more erotic experience. <br /> <br /> Photo journalist Mae Jordan aka "Emanuelle" (the lovely Laura Gemser, born in Jamaica, in her first starring role as a Thai masseuse in EMMANUELLE 2 and a "pristine native" in the part by Just Jaeckin of the PRIVE COLLECTIONs rarely seen flies to Nairobi where she is about to shoot the stills that accompany an article by the famous English writer Anne, played by the same Teutonic Karin Schubert with a haircut that takes some you get used to. Anne shares a " open relationship "(remembers when it was realized) with her Italian husband Gianni (Angelo Infanti), which means that they both jumped practically everything with an impulse Contrary to his later reputation, Emanuelle appears positively reticent with respect to his masters who breathe heavily, smoking seductively to Gianni as a preliminary to the exquisitely attractive pay-off, Okay, so he makes up for this lack a of madness at the end when he does an entire male hockey team on the train. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> The production of this sexploitation classic is quite impressive, especially the superb photography. And the musical theme of Nico Fidenco is a strong favorite of anyone who has more than a passing interest in the genre, an exhilarating pop ditty by Eurotrash (try to decipher those texts totally meaningless and have fun with the whole family evening!) That turns up throughout the film in every kind of performance imaginable from the slow 'n' sexy disco to the hip-gyrating one. <br /> <br /> This is entirely the Laura Gemser show. Simply presented as "Emanuelle" (as another actress of the elusive EMANUELLE NERA 2 by the same director), he turns on the screen from beginning to end. Not yet presented to interminable rape scenarios (as it would have been once D'Amato took over), it seems much more relaxed than in subsequent films, even smiling from time to time, a rare occasion like anyone who has seen part of the work of the lady surely knows. An impeccable Eurasian rather than as the title of black beauty suggests (it comes from Dutch India now from Indonesia and is actually rather close in appearance to the alleged author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan), projects a slightly passive sensuality, even submissive that somehow it detaches itself from the "depravity" indulges in its morally corrupt cohorts. Unlike the French film, cheapskate moralizing is reduced to a minimum, almost thrown like an end of the film close to the past when Emanuelle tells Gianni that he didn't lose it as he never owned it to begin with. I swear you could hear the audience moan about Just Jaeckin's version whenever Alain Cuny's extraordinary Mario shows up on the screen because it means there have been too many minutes of philosophical libertine meditations like an alibi for getting the divine Sylvia Kristel (who now lives in the Belgian capital of Brussels, among other things ...) to vanish, the real reasons why theaters have been packed for years and years. Gemser's last husband, Gabriele Tinti (now deceased, remarried), appears on the sidelines as the "Scottish" writer (eh?) Constantly drunk who briefly forces himself at Emanuelle among the African ruins at some point, but none real sex scene though.
