The plot is an exposition of the lower belly of American politics. While the theme seems common, what "makes" the film is the unconventional way in which the story is told. <br /> <br /> The characters are interpreted with conviction. Feel the innocence of lead and its lost innocence. The politician is the prince of the double talk, a true snake. <br /> <br /> The camera work is impressive. Affirms the nuances of acting and dialogue. Ditto for music. <br /> <br /> The story uses a parabola style with vingettes in which the message is full of double meanings. A very astute strategy of the writer / director. The tension in the plot is brought to the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The film was like a good mystery book. Something was "on foot"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know exactly what it could be - you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed, you took your breath away that you didn't notice that you were holding back. Saddened, shaking his head. <br /> <br /> A well written and well told story. 3 applause to a young writer / director.
