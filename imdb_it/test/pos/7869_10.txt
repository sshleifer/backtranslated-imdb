"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films and a detachment from his typical youthful roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, it was made a year before Eastwood's directorial debut with "Play Misty For Me". An alternative title considered for the film was "Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation", which fortunately was not used, otherwise I am sure that the vulgar jokes about the fact that it takes place in a girls' school would be difficult to avoid. I first saw this film in one of my college film classes in the mid-70s, and I was immediately taken by it. I only had a bad old VHS tape until I bought the widescreen DVD, which also includes the hilarious and terrible trailer that makes the movie look like a "Peyton Place" soap opera and does not convey anything about the film's cynic. <br /> <br /> Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight with Universal Pictures to keep the original ending, and they won; and the film was classified as a West Eastwood standard, which it certainly is not. It is a Gothic story of deception and horror set in the time of the Civil War, with a background tone of eroticism and sexual tension flowing everywhere. <br /> <br /> I'm not putting any spoilers into this review, and if you want to see the movie as it should be seen, be careful to look for it on the internet, as spoiler reviews abound. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood plays John McBurney, a Union soldier who is shot on confederate land and discovered by a girl from a nearby girls' school. She saves him and brings him back to school, but instead of warning the local patrol of his presence so that he is taken to prison, the director, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), their black serve Hallie (Mae Mercer), and the girls mostly take it, heal it and fall under its spell. The film expresses its tone of gruesome and gothic horror precisely from the titles, as it shows the real war hits of the battlefield, while the voice of Eastwood is heard quietly singing a funeral song of the time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of his encounter with the child who saves him gives the tone of his character and the tone of the whole film. Saying more shouldn't spoil the surprises in that first scene. Telling a lot more about the movie itself could ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it ... if you're in gruesome gothic stories, find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it's interesting to see him in an early role, or in any role, in which he plays a character who is for the most part very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page had a plum role in the film as director, and I can't imagine another actress of the moment equally good in the role; a long shot could have been Piper Laurie, but I don't think Laurie could have embodied the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. Elizabeth Wilson (whose wonderful performance in the movie "A Patch of Blue" as a blind girl who falls in love with the character of Sidney Poiter is another highlight in her short career) is at the peak here, delicate and masterful at the same time. Unfortunately, his delicacy in the film was also part of his real life; she committed suicide at the age of 45. <br /> <br /> I conclude this review with this observation: a Yankee manipulative and liar man cannot compete with a house of deceptive and libidinous southern bells.
