Great movie! Oh yeah! Full of energy, full of fun, presenting our generation, our alienation: a hymn to positive thinking despite this world we live in, a story of a great party, a story of a group of friends who desperately have to do something in a weekend and the only thing to do is The Club. But fun and ecstasy keep boredom! Very funny, nicely grotesque in some places, well shot ... and excellent soundtrack!
