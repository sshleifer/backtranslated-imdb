Once a year in America, Saturday morning would have given way to new cartoons, usually in America. The school practically started. <br /> <br /> I think this was to not make the school on Saturday more bearable. <br /> <br /> One Friday night before the first of the new Saturday morning cartoons, a movie was released. <br /> <br /> "At The Earth's Core" I had no idea who Cushing or McClure were. They clearly weren't from the same country, so I couldn't understand why they were traveling together. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of the fire-breathing monster. <br /> <br /> What connects this film to me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we make the band play while we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you finish a film like this? The music again, and two cops bewlidered as the drill appears behind them. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, I remember seeing this movie more that Friday night than any new comic that came the next morning. /> <br /> It was definitely the end of the seventies. <br /> <br /> It would be during the Jurassic Park craze, cicra '93, I think, before I saw this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, costumed people. There was the fiery breath again. <br /> <br /> Still loved the finale with the two policemen. <br /> <br /> Finally, it would be almost another decade before leaving for the DVD movie. <br /> <br /> Now I would look only at the beginning and the introduction. <br /> <br /> Oh, I love the movie a lot. Of all these science fiction films Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB, this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> What I notice now is that one of the policemen starts to turn around a little too soon, then turns back, then he and the other policeman are synchronized as they turn inward once more to look behind the drill. <br /> <br /> Maybe for me, this film is the best of Saturday morning shows, which is why I like it so much
