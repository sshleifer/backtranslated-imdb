This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is evident: in dialogues, places, photography, directing and political philosophy. Photography is remarkably safe. The direction is elegant and for the most part well done. If you enjoyed the first Australian films of Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller, then you'll love "Oz". The direction also recalls this review of the contemporary work of Edgar Wright. This similarity suggests that "Oz" was far ahead of his time. The critics of 1967 hated it and the public left - Australia in the 1960s, like the United States in the 1940s, was somehow the kind of place where compliance was important, while this film is a lot different from what those spectators expected, especially after reading promotional posters. This film will most likely have more appeal to the contemporary public: it is still strangely embarrassing and awkward, but in a contemporary European way rather than an Australian way of the 1960s. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared on the Australian television series 'Prisoner') plays the role with a less crude passion than her contemporary Jacki Weaver could, while the Dunstan character in this film conveys the rather capricious strength of the Australian women most represented by Kylie Minogue who plays Charlene Mitchell in the Australian television series Neighbors and further developed into subsequent roles in her career. Men will also appreciate this film, which presents various male problems differently than most of the other films of the mid-1960s from the United States or even Australia. In particular, Bruce Spence (who later played Tion Medon in "Star Wars III", the Trainman in the movies "Matrix" and the chopper pilot in the films "Road Warrior" and "Thunderdome") plays a central role and sustained role that solidly supports the rest of the cast. This film is worth seeing only for Bruce Spence's performance. 7/10 for some small problems of continuity.
