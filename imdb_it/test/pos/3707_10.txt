This film was made in the area where I grew up and now I live. I personally know most of the owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated street shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr and the car. I was told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are NC natives. I was lucky to see it in a local projection. In that projection there was one of the people who helped select safe places and props, such as the bus (Greyhound of 1938) used in the film. The bus was not backing up and during filming, the driver missed his stop point a few times and had to travel several miles to get back to the right point. Those details of the technical problems added to the fun for me. The film accurately describes life in this area during the Second World War. A well made film and I look forward to the availability of the DVD.
