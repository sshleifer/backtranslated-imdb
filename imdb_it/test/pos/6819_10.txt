I saw this brief moment ago on the site of the Sundance Film Festival, and I must say that it is absolutely stunning. I expected it to be fun - like all Sundance shorts - but I wasn't prepared for a deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen any of these festival entries yet, I suggest you go to the site and watch these mini masterpieces: I've seen them all and can honestly say "The Youth In Us" is what it has touched my heart the most.I'm not the weakest member of the public when it comes to romance in movies, but my eyes are flooded so much that I'm surprised to see the screen again. <br /> <br /> I'm d 'agreement with "addicted2you", it really is a masterpiece of directorial work and cinematography will leave you breathless. <br /> <br /> I can't think of a better way to spend 12 minutes less.
