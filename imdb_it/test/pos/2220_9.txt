For anyone who has ever sought happiness, "Half Empty" is not to be missed. This original intercultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make "The Producers" seem boring. The writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, also writing inspiring comments on index cards while his girlfriend pours her heart out, putting an end to their relationship. When his book on happiness, "North Star" is unsuccessful in the United States, its publishers send him to Germany for a book signing tour. While explaining their decision to Bob, the boardroom explodes into an exciting song that would make Monty Python proud. Since his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of the German language leaves him at a distinct disadvantage. However, he continues to defend himself, impenetrable towards his guests, until a very devoted fan arrives and changes everyone's reaction towards him. <br /> <br /> The original songs push the film, often describing the subtext of the story in the precision of the lateral division. The cast, directed by Robert Peters, exhibits an immaculate sense of humor and inhabits their characters as if they were not acting. See by: A case study of how good intentions are totally irrelevant; How ruthless Americans are seen abroad; How little reason it takes to burst into the song and, above all, for a silly, funny and unconventional laugh.
