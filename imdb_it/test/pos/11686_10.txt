A kind of guilty indulgence nowadays, this was required to watch when I was in high school. It's really a great illumination of the punk scene rising in Los Angeles in 1980. As the bands play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in the subtitles, which is obviously necessary if you really want to know what the guy is shouting into the microphone. But it also transforms the viewpoint of the camera into that of the tourist, passing through this alien world. Band interviews reveal an honest approach to music that actually no longer exists. Then again, it's not so easy to get from a $ 16 a month closet, like Chavez of Black Flag does. How many unheard of bands do you know they are not trying like crazy to get a record deal? These kids didn't care. And who can't love the comment of the little French guy who was the "singer" for the Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His gritty voice offers one of the best soliloquies ever captured in the film: "I have excellent news for the world ... there is no New Wave". Thank god! What a relief!
