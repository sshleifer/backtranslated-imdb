I must confess that I've been a big fan of the all-powerful David "the Hoff" Hasselhoff since he starred in the 1980s TV series "Knight Rider". Whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous school basketball player in the exhilarating "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant portrayal of a bewildering prince in the sci-fi gem "Starcrash", Hoff has repeatedly shown that he is simply a fantastic actor (and shamefully underestimated) supreme. The Hoff excels here as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed friend Leslie (the attractive brunette Leslie Cummings) investigates a shabby haunted hotel located on a remote island off Massachusetts. They are doing research on witchcraft over the centuries and the last hotel owner was an actress who would practice black arts. A litigious family also shows up on site to check the hotel. Soon several people start to get away in gruesome and mysterious ways from the mysterious Lady in Black (a mysterious Hildegard Knef). <br /> <br /> Of course, the rest of the cast gives Hoff a run for his money: the ever-lively Linda Blair projects her usual charming atmosphere like a pregnant woman who ends up being possessed (natch!), the legendary jazz singer Annie Ross casually scolds him like an old bat (poor Annie ends up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn up and hung upside down in a fireplace), and the gorgeous blonde Catherine Hickland exudes considerable sex appeal from every hair as attractive as a lustful bitch. Directed by Fabrizio Laurenti, the appropriately creepy atmosphere, the brilliant and brilliant cinematography of Gianlorenzo Battaglia (the fluid Steadicam pointing movements are particularly beautiful), the bright special effects, Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller, the lively score of shuddery ' n'spooky, and the bloody sadistic violence is all on par. But in the end it is the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the Hoff that makes this choice a tasty piece of Italian horror cheese so rewarded: you take off your shirt once (hubba!), It gets sprayed with blood, and - - ATTENTION: Major * SPOILER * forward - also reaches a pleasantly appallingly inopportune end. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato, this overall picture is just as fun and bleak.
