I've seen this movie and anyone who's been with the Marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. It is a must for any collection. Jack Webb does a great job as a hard training instructor. My father went to the Marine training camp at Camp Penelton and said that this film is so precise that it seems to be back to basic training. There's a joke in the movie where the Jack Webbs character gets angry at the boot for killing a sand flea. Well, let me tell you that there are nothing but sand fleas at the camp. I was there and I can appreciate it. In fact the exit to the camp is Las Puljas which in English means flea city. you have to watch the movie to appreciate what I'm saying. Anyone who has anything to do with WWII movies, all the battles start right here with the Sgt drill. A must for your collection
