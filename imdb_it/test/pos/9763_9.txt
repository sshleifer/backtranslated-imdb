This review contains what could be a spoiler if you have never read the book or seen the cover of the video box. So if you want to get close to the film without knowing anything about it, except that I really like it, stop here ... <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not top quality, but the acting between the leads is and they give to the novel among them more life than Shute in his novel (although I generally prefer the novel). My real objections to the film, contrary to the book, are that the film changes some relationships with secondary characters, and among the protagonists of a scene towards the end of the film, to provide something not entirely realistic, dramatic tension and as a plot device general. All this is managed much better in the book, with the result that I find the end of the book a little more moving than at the end of the film.
