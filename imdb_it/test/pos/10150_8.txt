Minus a thriller of a colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH should not really be compared to such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO; it's more like fun games like CATCH A THIEF and NORTH NORTHWEST. Shot mostly in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose vacation is interrupted when they innocently run into a murderous plot - and when their young son is kidnapped by James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles as the American couple, and the characters are given an unusual touch: Stewart, a doctor from the Midwest, is an extrovert but has a touch of "the ugly American abroad" about his personality; Day, who plays a popular stage and a movie star who has retired from his marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play very well in history. <br /> <br /> THE MAN WHO knew TOO contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene in which Stewart Drug Day before telling her of the abduction and the complex sequence of Albert Hall, involving those that look like hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. Less often noted, though in my opinion just as satisfying, are the subtler scenes in which Hitchcock combines a thread of suspense with perverse humor, such as when Stewart attempts to locate a taxidermist shop and Day Belt "Que Sera Evening "(written for this film) in a very unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party. <br /> <br /> Although THE MAN WHO KNEW TOU MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's greatest work, it remains an entertaining film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. It's Hitchcock-light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
