This is a rather stupid film, including the one that could be the least erotic appearance ever made to get on the big screen (the heroine pours the V-8 all by herself and invites the hero to lick it - sucks!). Yet it also features the resplendent Lucinda Dickey in what is by far her most erotic performance. In those distant days, women - even action heroines - with real muscles were a rarity, and I still remember the way my jaw went out when Dickey took off his shirt, revealing his back and bicep more powerful ever seen. The beauty and vitality of Dickey bring the film: it could have been a Schwarzenegger female if someone had the vision to promote it.
