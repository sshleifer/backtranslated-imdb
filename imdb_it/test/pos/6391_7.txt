On a routine mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers retrieves a computer hard drive from an Alqueda training camp that details the position of weapons specialist Dr Walsh. After attending the end of his secret weapons development program, Dr. Walsh finds an alternative source of funding and creates a new research facility in the notorious Belzan forest in Chechnya, where he is developing weapons and selling them to Chechen rebels. The Deltas team is sent on an operational mission to recover the doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his laboratory. What the Delta team will soon discover is that the latest weapons of the doctors are a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically modified to develop a taste for human flesh. I found this film much better than I expected. There is a lot of action and a lot of blood. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a creature. The acting is not great but it is passable. I've definitely seen worse. Overall it's a fun movie for what it is. A good popcorn movie.
