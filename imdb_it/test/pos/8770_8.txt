A man is wrongly accused of killing his friend in an airplane fire and must travel across the country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation. A plot that was then used to feed the classic north of Hitchcock from Northwest, Saboteur benefits from some excellent performance and some masterful sequences of suspense of the Master himself. <br /> <br /> For every Hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he has always been able to infuse the story with his memorable supporting characters and charades. Here, the charming and charming Robert Cummings is the protagonist and soon finds himself visiting many strange and bizarre characters, without resisting a troupe of circus performers, a wealthy businessman with hidden motivations, and a lonely blind man who shows him the best way to judge someone. <br /> <br /> In terms of pure originality and quality, this is lacking in some areas, particularly the antagonist motif. However, there is quite a bit of chemistry between Cummings and its protagonist, the much-underestimated Priscilla Lane and a truly moving performance like Vaughn Glaser's blind. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what Hitchcock would later use in the North West, but this time the climax is at the top of a statue in New York. Certainly not the best, but the Master of Suspense gives us great moments to wait.
