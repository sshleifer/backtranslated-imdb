This film is the best ninja film ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it, it's worth watching. I would say that this film is a 10/10 if you want to see more then check out http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening sequence in which the evil ninja kills everyone on his way is excellent, his character is the best . He must therefore possess a young woman who finds him dying. Then he must take revenge on the police who killed him, which means there is more killing and action. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja, so she and her boyfriend, who is also one of her targets, use the help of Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to free the spirit of the evil ninja and destroy him.
