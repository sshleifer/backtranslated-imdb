As in the case of FOOTPRINTS (1975), I came to know it by pure chance: it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I tried when the film appeared on Italian TV late at night, like in a movie similar vein; By the way, I missed the screening of THE LIBERTINE (even though I acquired it through the same channel later), but I managed to watch the film through a rental of the DVD R1 dubbed in English during my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005 / beginning of 2006. In fact, given the enthusiastic reviews, I was disappointed by THE LIBERTINE - being too light in nature for what was essentially a serious subject (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)! to be honest, most of the time, I was afraid that THE SCREWING WOMAN would have gone exactly on the same path ... but later she was largely compensated by a final evil touch (if not really unpredictable). <br /> <br /> the film is about the free thinking of social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevailing in this era: an eminent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a journalist (Dagmar Lassander) to his fashionable home for the week- end; however, it emerges that he is a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would prefer to dominate them (or even kill them)! Therefore, for the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine endure pain and humiliation at the hands of Leroy (including being forced to make love with a mannequin in his image!) ... until the tables are subtly, but not surprisingly, transformed: she not only frees herself from her control, but teaches him that the man and the woman can coexist harmoniously - except that Lassander also follows his personal program !! <br /> <br /> The protagonists are perfectly expressed, and the film itself is often obscurely comic for those who want to do it; moreover, it is greatly favored by a typically effervescent "Euro-Cult" score (from the timeless Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginary - also outr√© - look (the gigantic structure that represents the lower section of the female figure, with a steel trap where his sexual organ should be, it seems to emanate from Freud: incidentally, this prop was clearly visible in frames that I had previously seen from WOMEN'S SCARED ... but barely records in the actual film!). Other bizarre touches include the absurd "Sexual Aberrations And The Stars" radio program, and an idyll in a castle belonging to the Leroy family, complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarf servant. One of the highlights, therefore, is easily the virtually naked erotic dance of Lassander - an episode that actually points to Leroy's "humanization"; in the end, the two characters have a "showdown" in the latter's tank - have fun choosing a Spaghetti Western theme! <br /> <br /> In the long run, despite all its elegance, the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporary Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it is worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the United States by Radley's directorial firm Metzger Audubon Films; he would also have hired his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the edition I observed: apart from the usual shortcomings in the English dubbing department, the presentation here was further marked by a rather washed-out appearance and brief examples of absent-minded extraneous noise on the soundtrack! By the way, there seems to be some confusion about the movie's running time: its length given on various sources varies from 84 to 108 minutes - all I can say, however, is that the copy I own worked for 87 minutes!
