This film was excellent from beginning to end. I was struck by the action, the black humor and the incredible bad luck our hero encountered at every turn. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many other films to come. Reading other people's comments, I have to admit that I never thought of Tarrantino while watching "Thursday" but now that I think about it I think there are some similarities. I guess I don't spend much time trying to connect everything to everything else. The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one for the record books - the sexiest scene ever.
