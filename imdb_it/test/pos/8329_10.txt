Walking With Dinoasaurs is an exciting new program that uses spectacular graphics to show living dinosaurs. The information presented here is sensational. The moods of the series change to get your attention, things like dramatic music when fighting breaks out. There is clear evidence here for a cracking documentary! My biggest thanks to writers, directors and producers, without forgetting the other people involved. If you run into this video in stores I suggest buying it not only for the graphics, but for the extreme efforts and productive work that the series has to offer. 10/10
