This was my favorite wife's favorite movie. I'm sorry he didn't live long enough to get the video, I'm sure he would have consumed it. What can we say? A great romantic story and the thrust of two great men, the Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance like the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. The backup is provided with Candy Bergen, splendid in her early 30s, as the kidnapped American widow. Great back-up also comes from the great John Huston in the role of SecState, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis, of the Clint Eastwood films, is outstanding as the hesitant US ambassador, Gummere; the late Vladek Sheybal with his demonically evil gaze is as big as the Beshaw and much more is given by Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen whose faces we have seen in different contexts. All in all, this is a film full of wonderful romanticism, reminiscent of a distant era. History without mind? Not at all. The question of the great nations that push around the smaller ones for their own hegemonic interests is as true today as it was then. Excessively romantic? Not really ... certainly they are not shy in any sense. Fun to watch? You bet. I own the video and will watch it again and again. I suggest you do the same.
