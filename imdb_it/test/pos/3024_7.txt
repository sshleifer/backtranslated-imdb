I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was released for the first time and it looked pretty interesting. I never had the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I thought I had to watch it. After all, I made love "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you enjoyed those movies, you could enjoy some "The Cell". The whole concept of history is very interesting. By physically entering the mind of a killer, I cannot imagine the world in which they live. The acting is actually pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say that she wasn't fantastic, but she does a credible job. I would recommend it for a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
