This was one of the first color films I saw in the cinema when I was a child. It's nice to remember that. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred together with the small and excellent actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the film's plot is good for all ages, good intentions and behaviors. The good ethics of Velvet's parents, especially her mother's, is something to consider. Our generations should be well educated and this film can help with this. Velvet loves horses and runs them, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) takes her to an international horse racing competition in England, where the young Velvet finally wins, but is disqualified for being female.
