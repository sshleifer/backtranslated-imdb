Fans of Euro-horror films - The Portland Movie Madness video / DVD shop has an entire section dedicated to this genre - it cannot afford to miss the instinct of Sergio Martino "The island of fishmen" (called " Screamers "in the United States States). Here's the truth: some surviving survivors land on an unexplored Caribbean island in 1891. The island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (Joseph Cotten) and his daughter (Barbara Bach). Sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fishmen. And while the fish-men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion, they become evil otherwise. <br /> <br /> This film is a kind of mixture of genres: Euro-horror, cloak and sword, voodoo and maybe a bit of "Dr. Moreau's island". But it is above all an excuse to make the fish-men become devalued; you must love him! I wouldn't be surprised if the Euro-horror genre had given Quentin Tarantino some of his ideas for "Grindhouse". After all, European horror directors have no qualms about what they show. This is one you will surely enjoy. <br /> <br /> So Joseph Cotten is the only cast member of an Alfred Hitchcock film (I mean "Shadow of a Doubt") who later co-starred in Ringo Starr's future wife and ex of Audrey Hepburn (from which I mean Mel Ferrer) in an Italian horror film. The things we see in life ...
