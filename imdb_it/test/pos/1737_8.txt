It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC that would resurrect WHO DOCTOR and it would make him "Bigger and better", but I had already heard these rumors in the press and thought they were all they were: voices. But it was later said that Russell T Davies would executive produce and write the show and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004, Channel 4 interviewed the cast of the actor in the lead role - Christopher Eccleston. Yes, Christopher Eccleston is an actor who has always struck me since he saw his film debut in LET HIM HEN IT and if he had been interviewed on television it had to be true. As the months passed, more and more information leaked, Billie Piper was about to be cast, the Daleks would return and The Mill, the Hollywood effects company that had made the FX for GLADIATOR, was in charge of performing the special effects for the show. For several weeks before the first trailers broadcast announced the return of the new series, huge billboards in London informed the public about the return of the show, the tabloids published huge photos of aliens and Christopher Eccleston appeared on programs as diverse as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (who had a special edition of DOCTOR WHO), THIS MORNING and Friday NIGHT WITH JOHNATHAN ROSS. Actually this new series of DOCTOR WHO must have been the most publicized program in the history of British television, it would have been better to be damn good <br /> <br /> So it was damn good? Undoubtedly it was a great success with almost every episode that made the top ten shows on the TV charts. To give you an idea of ​​the success of his ranking, only one episode (The Ark In Space episode two - February 1975) of the old series had entered the top five TV chart. The episode of the opening series became the number three with two other episodes that beat or equal the previous one and this is in an era in which there is much more competition in terms of TV stations and choice. Let's laugh and rejoice that the DOCTOR THAT HAS HIT ME BABY ANOTHER TIME, CELEBRITY WRESTLING and handled ANT AND DEC'S Saturday NIGHT TAKEAWAY. Obviously much of the success is due to the stunning visual effects and the casting of a prestigious actor well known in the role. For the most part everything you see on the screen is the same as anything you see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek invasion force that counts tens of thousands, exotic aliens, a nineteenth century Cardiff that looks like a 19th century Cardiff and night shots that are actually night shots and not made by gluing a dark filter on the screen. I promise you will hear a lot more from the directors who worked on this series, Joe Ahearne in particular will one day be on the Hollywood list. A <br /> <br /> There are some flaws in the new series of DOCTOR THAT and everyone should be laid on the door of Russell T Davies. It may be controversial whether soap opera and postmodernism elements are successful or not (in my opinion they are not) but what is not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by RTD. As I mentioned in my CASANOVA review, it cheats the public and does the same thing here: in front of armed soldiers pointing their rifle at him The doctor chokes "delta floor attack" which makes no sense to anyone in the public but allows him to escape from a tight spot, a Captain Jack naked suddenly pulls out a laser he is hiding and RTD scripts are full of this kind of tricks and endings of type deus ex machina. In fact, the final episode is greatly ruined by the ridiculous concept of what the "Big Bad Wolf" seems to have obtained from RTD more than one Doctor. And what endings am I trying to remember if any of them were actually the Doctor? More often than a supportive character or the Doctor's companion who saves the day. The show is called DOTTORE CHI NON ROSE TYLER, so can we see the title character save the day please, just like he did in the classic series? One last point about the Doctor's portrait is the way he wrote like a grin. Eccleston is best known for his serious and dark roles and is absolutely breathtaking in the scenes in which he shows the pain, like the tear that runs down his face in End Of The World, but more often it is written as a "Tom Baker in speed "character. It's obvious why Eccleston hasn't done much comedy in his career - He's not very good at it <br /> <br /> I'm starting to sound like I hate this show? Sorry I didn't want to, but it's just that while some anticipations have been met or exceeded, others are not and they are almost all in favor of Russell T Davies who fortunately is contributing less to the scripts in the next series of DOCTORS CHI. We see more traditional stories of a human outpost threatened by monsters as we saw in the 60s and 70s, imagine a story like The Sea Devils with a huge budget directed by Joe Ahearne! Oh and one last request: can we see the "NEXT TIME" trailers scrapped? They reveal all the best pieces of next week's episode
