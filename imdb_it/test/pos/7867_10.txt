Smart psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood) who seeks refuge in an isolated Confederate school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight, until the tables are turned and he becomes the persecuted in a disturbing, gothic tone. Never has a film been so deliciously erotic but at the same time disturbingly macabre. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best time of Eastwood (who tunes in "Dirty Harry" will be really surprised), while the rest of the cast offers uniformly excellent performances. Try watching the movie on video, as TV prints usually erase crucial flashback scenes between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
