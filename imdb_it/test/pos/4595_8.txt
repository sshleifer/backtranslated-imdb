I've never seen a movie have a worse version than this. And this is a shame, because this is the funniest movie of the year! You might think that an announcement with the phrase "From the director of" Office Space "" would be enough to guarantee a great release! But there are no advertisements, no posters, no websites, I doubt the stars knew that it came out this weekend. What do 20th Century Fox think? Mike Judge's Sci-Fi comedy is set in 2505 but could become reality in about 10 years (if things continue as they are). Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph freeze in an experiment by the secret army and wake up in a future full of retarded zombie consumers. The film reminds me of Woody Allen's "Sleeper", "RoboCop", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and the late great "Futurama". Try to see it before the Fox burns all the footprints!
