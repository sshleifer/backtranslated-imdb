All that Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant and very convoluted to a minimum. Well, whatever it is not, I'm at least a Cyborg. Park's new movie called Thirst is an erotic-thriller-dark-dramatic novel-vampire-thriller? yes, many adjectives ?? inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola entitled Therese Raquin. Park uniquely creates Korean, and uniquely Park, the vision of the vampire myth and asks the public to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest by discovering he is thirsty for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. Park offers the elements you were hoping for but certainly not up to the quality of a masterpiece like Oldboy or even of Lady Vengeance. Heavily swollen with a narrative that often lost much less the audience, Sete desperately needed another trip through the cutting room. It flows when it should be running, but luckily it brings it home before it completely loses the audience. As negative as it may seem, the positives far outweigh the negatives and another volume was undoubtedly added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of the Park Chan-wook movie. <br /> <br /> See the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
