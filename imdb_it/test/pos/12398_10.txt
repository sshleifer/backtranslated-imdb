I just watched this movie on Showtime early in the night. I was observing the beginning with an open eye, but instead of falling asleep, I became invested in this crafty, bitter movie. It was very credible and engaging. I could have done without so much profanity (as in all of David Mamet's films I see), but I really enjoyed the experience. I know that teenagers are cursing, but I don't need to hear it. However, the story has some interesting surprises that I won't reveal but if you have the chance to watch this movie on Showtime, I think you'll like it as much as I do.
