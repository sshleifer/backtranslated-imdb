The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film. It is based on an absolutely fascinating book by Charles Kingsley. He has a very talented cast like James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee. There is also Lionel Jeffries, the director of wonderful classics like The Railway Children and the amazing Mr. Blunden, and although the film is mostly good, it was also a bit disappointing. I had no problems with performances, particularly those of Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are credible as Tom and Ellie. Also the vocal cast is commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, which denotes fascinating characters in all respects. I also liked incidental music, it's so scary and beautiful, and the script was pretty faithful and generally well written, particularly at the beginning. The characters, particularly the Water Babies, are very fascinating, and the villains are sinister and fun at the same time, I loved the part when Tom and his friends help the Water Babies to escape, seeing the shark chasing the electric eel with a very funny ax. However, I will say that the film seems dated, especially the animated sequences, the live action parts were not so bad, if you forgive the rather gloomy work of the cameras. The animation of the character was rather flat, and the backgrounds were sometimes a bit boring, even if there were some good moments, like the scene with the Krakon and, of course, the first encounter with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, the Water Babies song was beautiful, but I found the first song to forget, when Tom ends up underwater. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song, which is like marmite, or you love or hate it. I personally don't know what to do with this song, it was fun to listen to at first, but once in your head, maybe it's annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, his direction lacked the amazement and magic he usually does. All in all, certainly not a terrible film, but it could have been better artistically. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
