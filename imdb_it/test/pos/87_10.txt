It's been years since I had the privilege of watching this movie on TV. I just wish I could contact someone to see him again. I married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome. I didn't realize it, but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My stepson is now 35 years old and thanks the Lord who has blossomed wonderfully, but still has many effects after the birth of an alcoholic mother. We talk to patients in rehabilitation with alcohol and drug addiction every month and this sharing has really brought monumental changes in their behavior and efforts to start a new life not dependent on drugs and alcohol. Please let me know how I can get a VHS or DVD copy of this movie or when they show the movie on TV again. If you've never been in these shoes, you probably could never understand its value. Thanks a lot.
