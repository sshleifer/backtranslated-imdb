Ok, "well enough" don't scream for rent but I was surprised how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. Although not at all a classic, the filmmakers involved have an idea of ​​what suspense is. Fears don't jump on you, but the directors constantly build climatic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The writers have updated the stories pretty well and distorted them just so much that the final family members still have a punch. The best of the short films are "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too", I enjoyed both because they have a beautiful suspense in every story. "The Locket" was a good ghost story and the wrap around "The Campfire" is pretty good, except that in the end they have too many twists. The only disappointing segment is "The Hook" which is fine because it's still quite short. Overall, I gave this a 7 out of 10. It has suspense, which is missing from most of today's horror films, and good acting from the cast. It might not be worth up there with Halloween and The Exorcist, but it's a good little movie that is worth the price of a rent.
