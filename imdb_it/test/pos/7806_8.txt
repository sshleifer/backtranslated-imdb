It's a parody, it's a clever comedy, it has a bit of pathetic and choreographed action (and it does, it's intentional), good humiliating songs, good interpretations of the whole cast, brilliant Amir, Salman and Paresh and above all a script that is so rare in Indian cinema that even in comedy (see David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). The story is of two wastrels whose only purpose is to become rich and famous in any way. They come across this way when they find out that a wealthy NRI is coming from India to get married. The rest of the story is about the uniqueness and the way these ancestors try to challenge each other. The whole cast is perfectly fused by Deven Verma up to Viju Khote. The tracks are positioned correctly and are fun. The Surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his comedy style. <br /> <br /> All a smoke-free movie that you shouldn't ignore if you like and watch Indian cinema.
