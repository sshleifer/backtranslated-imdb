In Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah) was sexier and had a bigger and more demanding presence, she only caught your eye and your attention. now the film had flaws, like the lack of explaining Akasha's past. What I didn't like is that the movie didn't really explain or show more than what the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was / or was similar. The role of Akasha (Aaliyah) was somewhat limited in the film and she did not appear until the second half of the film and then to complete it, her death (of Akasha) arrived 2 quickly. But I liked how Akasha fought when the ancients tried to kill her, because in the book the last battle between Akasha and The ancients was pretty boring (they killed Akasha in about 2 seconds). Akasha's head was knocked down in 1 s and Lestat became the biggest punk in the world. Aaliyah played Akasha very well and Stuart was perfect as Lestat, they could not have chosen a better Akasha or Lestat. "REST IN PEACE AALIYAH"
