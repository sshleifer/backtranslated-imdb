I wish the series hadn't ended so soon. Although acting may not be the greatest in the world, it ends on a positive note and teaches moral values ​​and values. Hilary Swank did a good job in portraying a high school student who had lost her parents, etc. Miyagi was fantastic as in the previous 3 !! If you are not in a happy ending, this film, like the previous 3 in the series, is not for you. This day we live in you can't see enough about the bad guys who get what they deserve and the good guys come out on top. The Bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil. This is exactly what happens in this. It's a great family film. Please see if you haven't already done so.
