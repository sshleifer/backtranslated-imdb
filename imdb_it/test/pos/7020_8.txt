Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. As a child I can remember that I loved this movie and watched it again and again without getting tired. <br /> <br /> Now that I'm a little older, I bought the DVD recently and STILL was not disappointed with the performance. <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere for this film, even if it is claimed that they don't get along, the chemistry of the film is incredible! As the film progresses, we get sucked into their relationship and believe in each of their actions. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible, the music only adds to the romantic atmosphere of the film and adds the relationship between Baby and Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this film, which can never forget the famous phrase "Noboby puts Baby in the corner". The song is perfect and the dance is incredible! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone, at any age, it's just a fun movie that anyone can enjoy 8/10.
