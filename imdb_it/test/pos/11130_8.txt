High school. Years and decades later, some look at him with affection, others with embarrassment. But few find it easy to forget. It is one of the most critical phases of our lives, when the changes come fast and furious, whether we are ready or not. No longer children, not yet adults, irresistible forces take us, push us and drag us in every direction. <br /> <br /> "Fame" has done its best to capture this turbulent and chaotic period for its cast of young characters. For the most part, he succeeded. It moved in meanders, but it felt like a slice of life. This film holds a special place in the heart of the 1980s class. We were just goodbye to a decade, and soon at the end of three or four challenging and sometimes difficult school years. We were headed into the cold and cruel world, leaving home for college and then unknown parts. As we approached our watershed event, this newly released film was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We couldn't get away from the song on the radio. We were up there on the screen. Those were our friends, rivals and classmates because we had faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes and failures. <br /> <br /> It is particularly touching for those who have attended any other high-level elite, high-level high schools, particularly Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like children here, we have been considered the best of the best. We did not have auditions, but rigorous entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the performing arts guys, we expected to change the world, even if we don't necessarily become famous. Like them, not all of us have made it. But the environment of the pressure cooker favored the extraordinary camaraderie and the spirit of body, not unlike the "Hot Lunch Jam" in the cafeteria. On our graduation day, our spirits went up almost like the jubilant crescendo in the thrilling finale. The film correctly leaves us on a single triumphant note at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric", which indicates the incredibly bright and unlimited future and all the promise it has kept. <br /> <br /> "Hunger" I couldn have been set elsewhere. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with film and television, but New York is a mecca for all the arts. Home not only for what was then called PA, but also world-renowned Juilliard, New York is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world. It is also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time, which shows the workmanship, the grit and the dirtiness that were endemic to a New York still struggling with the fiscal crisis that had almost sent it bankrupt. But above all, it showed vitality, since it had changed from Giuliani's incursion, from Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> What I wouldn't give to be young again. But with "Fame", at least I can remember how it was.
