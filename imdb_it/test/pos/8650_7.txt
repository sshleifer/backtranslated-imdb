The whole film made me think of the first circle of Dante's Inferno, in which the souls who "deceive themselves" believing they are happy go. They never realize they are actually in hell, but nothing is pleasant, they move without emotions. In this sense Dante thought they were in the worst part, because they would never have actively tried to change their situation. No one can die in that place, but try certainly to hurt. I'm not sure the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the film when I was watching it, as I was expecting a climax that never came. However, it made me think later and now I really think it's a good movie - it certainly remains faithful.
