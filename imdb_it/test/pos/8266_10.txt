I copied my video of this on DVD so that I can enjoy it whenever I like and it also makes a very successful (and rare) wedding gift! This is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a much loved novel. Everything is just perfect and has aged incredibly well. There is always a chance with something so old that it might seem a little creaky next to more modern dramas, but 'Precious Bane' has more than its own. <br /> <br /> The quality of the acting is amazing with Janet McTeer doing a superb Prudence and a young Clive Owen who wanders like the silent Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to watch the final sequence without at least sniffing the romance of it all. It's the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside and you curl up on the sofa. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend it enough.
