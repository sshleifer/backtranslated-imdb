I always thought that Mrs Merkerson had never had a role suited to her abilities. Familiarity with millions of people like the lieutenant on law and order, has been seen in numerous theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. Hack's Lackawanna Blues changes and allows this talented actress to shine as Tata, a successful entrepreneur in a world that changes from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful array of characters she and her adopted son encounter in a guesthouse in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. <br /> <br /> The story could be set in any great American community of the 50s and 60s from Sweet Auburn in Atlanta to Harlem in New York. But the angle of segregation integration is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the people of Nanny's pension. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all types of people, interpreted by some of the best actors in the industry (I didn't deliberately call them black actors): this ensemble is an extraordinary array of talents that are black, with the exception of Jimmy Smits, obviously) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look in a day.
