Anyone who has seen the trailer for this film would be forgiven for thinking that this film is a real comedy. It is actually a carefree, though not overly funny, laugh about a couple of bandits. <br /> <br /> There are numerous errors in the film. The script and the plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely boring. Yet despite all this it is rather amusing, thanks above all to the two protagonists Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two talented actors, Carlyle in particular, are always good at watching and here there is good harmony between them. <br /> <br /> Director Jake Scott is the new generation of the family whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, have given us movies like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and more recently GI Jane and the enemy of the state. His debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film sizzling, even though without the strong cast that has assembled the results may not have worked. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for an easy, fun movie to spend an hour and a half, then you could do a lot worse than Plunkett and Macleane. If you like something subtle, historically accurate and stimulating, go elsewhere. 7/10.
