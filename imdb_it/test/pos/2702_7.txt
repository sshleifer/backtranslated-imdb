Every time I hear the voice of Karen Carpenter, there is that old familiar feeling of the 1970s blues. What an extraordinarily beautiful and mature voice he had. The role of Cynthia Gibb in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tear-jerky film that does a great job in presenting Karen and Richard's professional careers, but also the personal struggles that Karen has faced and her illness. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very well done. However Karen Carpenter came out, there was a time when it was very special and brought great joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you weren't a Carpenter fan, this is a good story that describes how great talent can be a victim of societal pressure.
