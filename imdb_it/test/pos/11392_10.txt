'Boogie Nights' uses its protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for celebrities accumulated for a decade in America's shameful past, which included an unexpected rise in pornography, resulting in an abundance of corrupt youth. His main character borrows traits from an assortment of genuine actors, engaging in many illegal affairs that have been admired by Hollywood celebrities and all too often exploited by the press. It looks like the kind of tall story that could appear on an E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, sex and violence: the American dream. But what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the more difficult it is to fall. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are enormous, as is another precious resource on his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives every individual on the planet a great talent, and his gift is rather unusual. After falling with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the squalid Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a great porn star, representing the main "actor" in most of Horner's films. With the new success, Eddie is told that he needs to invent a new pseudonym for himself, and so Dirk Diggler was born. <br /> <br /> Eddie / Dirk himself is mainly based on the infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with "Wonderland", starring Val Kilmer. 'Boogie Nights' is unquestionably the best of the two, demonstrating that porn movies can be made without disgusting the target audience: regular movie goers. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1977, an era of pornography art: filmmakers really believed they could offset the low points of X-rated features by adding deep stories and a charming atmosphere. In a sense, the film's director - Paul Thomas Anderson - implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a free and artistic film about a period in American history, when smoking was indeed both free and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep and so distinct that we soon feel like we were reliving the first-hand era. Not a moment passes when we are not convinced of the temporal range treated in the film. <br /> <br /> Everything wasn't happy on the set of 'Boogie Nights'. Before filming, Anderson repeatedly approached Reynolds, many times asking him to play the role of Horner. In the end, Reynolds agreed, but declared that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career, they repudiated him publicly, before being nominated for an award for best supporting actor and to suddenly shut up. A year earlier, Anderson had suffered title disputes over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema thought the former was more marketable. In essence, he lost the battle, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time by inserting the words "boogie nights" into his film through the mouth of a character. <br /> <br /> The casting of the film is one of its best aspects. The regular customers of Paul Thomas Anderson are here, as well as a first-rate first-rate cast. To name some of the most famous stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the whole film is basically directed at Mark Wahlberg, like Eddie, who surprisingly surprises in his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his career as a singer and for his disappointing Hollywood activities, has all the traits necessary to play such a character. This is his best role to date. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to capture his audience and take complete control of each scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson cleverly uses the stars in the background, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as acutely as possible. The opening scene is three minutes, a long rundown that follows Jack and Amber in a night club, where most of the characters are introduced. It reminds me of discussions about tracking shots in "The Player" by Robert Altman - it works so brilliantly in Boogie Nights, and it's the first indication that Anderson knows what he's doing behind the camera. His style is frenetic in the wake of Martin Scorsese, where the shots are fast enough but never seem to hurry. Incidentally, Anderson refers to two classic shots by Scorsese: the concluding speech of the De Niro mirror by "Raging Bull" and the nightclub scene of "GoodFellas". Anderson is a young and growing director who is extraordinarily mature in history and directing, despite his age. While his first feature film, "Hard Eight", was sensibly wise and touching, "Boogie Nights" is even more so. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" began as a love effort on the story by Paul Thomas Anderson. Having filmed the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is so pragmatic that it seems almost genuine. Boogie Nights invigorates us with its free content, sometimes on the verge of pornography, only that it is much more sophisticated than that garbage. It is a modern and wonderful masterpiece that is incredibly explicit and wild and elegant. Probably the best Anderson film and among the largest - and most important - projects of the last decade.
