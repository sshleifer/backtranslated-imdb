Garlin did a great job. Beautiful concept well executed and well made. It was a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm", where Jeff was practically the lead role, he delighted me with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple but effective portrait. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor was discreet and subtle and attracted the intensity, which I really liked, rather than being slapstick or too much explained. And there were some little surprises and twists. The shop cartoons were a delight. <br /> <br /> When I say it's a wonderful "little" film, I don't mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and handmade. Tell a highly credible daily story. Relax and go see it. Let it wash and you will feel good for doing it.
