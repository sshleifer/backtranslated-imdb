I agree with all the comments above. This show was a pleasure to watch. Fun, witty, terrific acting and insignificant sets. It is always exciting to find a show written in an intelligent way, assuming that the public has brains and show subtle humor. I would spend good and hard-earned cash to see it again on DVD. And as long as we ask for the Smart Series that has never had the chance ... What do you think of Massimo Bob's DVD releases (another well-written duck show, with a delightful cast of characters.) . Middle Age or place of Frank. There must be a way to release these shows from the vaults and in the hands of devoted fans and new spectators.
