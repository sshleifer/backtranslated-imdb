I saw the move while in Paris in May 2006 ... I was discussing between this and the impossible mission ... I am very happy to have chosen OSS 117 not only because it was fun but could also watch a FRENV film in France . I had a great time ... I would recommend it. It is important to have some understanding of today's French society to really appreciate the humor of this movie ... I can't wait for the DVD to come out ... I don't know how some of the word games "jeu De mots" 'would be translated into English, I will certainly buy it when it is released! Post scriptum I saw in "BRice de Nice", a film with Dujardin that all the children were talking about in France. this film is a comedy but more foolish than one might imagine ... in comparing both films, I must say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.
