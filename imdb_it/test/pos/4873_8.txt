Remember that friend in college who always insisted on renting the strangest film possible? This is the movie he would have made if he had the chance. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you exactly what Sea of ​​Dust is about. He pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into strange things in the "Black Forest". He goes there to help, but ends up being caught between two young women, who seems to have something to think about. But this is just scratching the surface. This is the kind of movie where things happen by chance ... and it's not nice. People are constantly whipped and stabbed. There are a couple of creepy little girls who seem to have come out of The Shining. Tom Savini is a kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he no longer wants to be imaginary. He has a plan to conquer the world by sharing the suffering of Jesus. <br /> <br /> On some level, this is a film about sex. It is one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but there is no mistake in the intent. On another level, it is a paradise for stoners. Unexpected things happen so often that it stops being unexpected. When the doctor walks the birth canal of his girlfriend to be reborn, you will simply give him the crazy nature of the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the negative side, the film is quite verbose. Some of the points are hammered home over and over again. If you look at it with a group of stoned friends, this could be an advantage.
