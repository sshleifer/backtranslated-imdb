Love Letter is one of my favorite books of all time, so I was naturally skeptical when I heard it would become a movie. But I liked it I found myself smiling through the whole movie. I admit that it is not a great film, but certainly an enjoyable hour and a half. I thought Capshaw and Scott were as perfect as Helen and Johnny. Just like I imagined them. And the city and the landscape were perfect too. I recommend this movie, but don't expect too much, enjoy it.
