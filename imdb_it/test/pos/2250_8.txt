I would like to start by saying that Liev earned me a lot of respect after seeing his directorial debut "Everything Is Illuminated". Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with Alex's exaggerated and exhilarating vocabulary along with innumerable flashback scenes and crazy dream sequences. Liev took all this and it worked. The film itself is fantastic - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - everything works. There is a lot of history that lacks the city and its inhabitants, but there is only so much you can do with an indie, so this part didn't bother me too much. It is only disappointing that not many people will see this film or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that results. I didn't even know it was in theaters. I didn't know when the DVD came out. You might think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEBODY would have at least advertised a commercial for this. I had to see the trailer on my DVD "Paradise Now" (released on DVD in the spring of 2006) to know that it had a release date in "Fall of 2005". Haha - really sad. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you run into this review in any way because one of your friends has read the book and loved it or seen the movie and is recommending you to see it - follow my advice and look at it. It is a beautiful experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
