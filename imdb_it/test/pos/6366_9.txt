I would agree with the comments already published on this site by the previous one. <br /> <br /> I first came across this film in the 1980s when I was employed in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the psychiatric professions of barbs strike at home. I particularly liked the ending, in which the psychiatrist spoke through the Grodin door to the hospital. Trust me, it's pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, the doors of most psychiatric hospitals are not locked, nor are shirts used much these days, and any hospital MUST be allowed to have a "padded room". <br /> <br /> But a wonderfully undervalued film, and certainly quite funny. <br /> <br /> Jeff
