The film is based on a book by Jules Verne that I read once, about ten years ago. I remember that I really liked the book and this film does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this film is not the story, however, but the extremely original visual aspect it has. <br /> <br /> The images are absolutely beautiful and are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animations and sets that are painted so that they look very similar to those of a movie animated. Combined by the exclusive versions of Jules Verne airplanes and submarines and the good direction of Karel Zeman, it translates into a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively keep the attention until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> There are some problems, for example, one of the underwater scenes eventually takes perhaps a lot of time unnecessarily, for example, since the plot in the first part of the film is addressed quickly. None of this matters a lot though since the film is always a lot of fun. A gem that deserves to be better known even for today's public. A film recommended for the whole family.
