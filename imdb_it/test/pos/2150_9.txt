This small photo difficult to see was presented at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen TV shows and Nilsson backstage footage at work . There are also some shots of "Son Of Dracula". This film is the final and appropriate tribute to one of the most refined voices, the smartest songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. It is a crime that the name of this man is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or interpreted. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented jail with an unconscious desire for self-destruction. As a bonus, you also got Eric Idle while performing the song written for Nilsson's final album during the closing credits. It's funny, it's sad. It is not in general version. If this image sounds anywhere near where you live, see it!
