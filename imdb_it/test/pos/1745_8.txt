While Disney has been THE animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. When this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, were running animated films that could be said to challenge Disney's domination. At the beginning, in that period of glory of the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Disney was at the service of film banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was offered by the Dave and Max Fleischer brothers. Despite having published two truly commendable films, have they never been safe on the market? many attribute their fall to the commercial failure of Mr Go Go To Town, published the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbor (which gave the American public something more significant to think than the cinema to watch a cartoon!) that this film has vanished in relative darkness is a disguise. <br /> <br /> In an area of ​​uncultivated garden in the city a lot of insects are in grave danger. Humans use the earth as a shortcut, throwing rubbish and cigars and other dangers, right on top of insect houses as they go. The owner of the honey shop Mr Bumble (voiced by Jack Mercer) fears that the future is dark and wonders why he will be able to raise his daughter Honey (voiced by Pauline Loth) in a safer environment. An unscrupulous creature, Bagley C. Beetle (voiced by Tedd Pierce), offers her a safer place to live if she accepts her hand in marriage, but Honey is much more interested in her childhood love, perpetually optimistic and optimistic Hoppity (voiced by Stan Freed). Hoppity believes that everything is fine, but he remains stupid when Bagley Beetle and his pair of comedian comedians manipulate the crisis to their subtle end. Only at the end, when their patch becomes the foundation of a huge new skyscraper, do insects shift loyalty to Hoppity as they look to him to lead a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of humans. <Br /> <br /> What really works in this film is the delicious characterization ?? all the bugs are intelligently developed and designed for maximum public appeal. The grumpy villains Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. Equally admirable is the drive storytelling ?? even the smallest of children can enjoy this story, while at the same time cleverly conveying a message to the older public on how human inattention can impact wildlife survival. Time has inevitably dated certain aspects of the film, and when you look at it the audience must accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general age and wear. But overall Mr Bug Goes To Town is an accomplished, entertaining animation and presented with great ease with a message worth doing.
