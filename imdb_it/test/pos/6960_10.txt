I highly recommend this movie. Blurs the boundary between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a perfect way that it must be seen to be believed. The actors and the director have such perfect timing that in a scene a name struggle becomes a kind of dance. I loved the plot, the actors, everything. While I think there were one or two very cheap scenes, the whole film was done impeccably.
