Darr, although a copy of some Hollywood movies, is one of the best films I've seen. It is not only beautifully represented, but also has great songs and beautiful scenery. Shahrukh is his usual self. His expressions and his voice correspond to his character. I was pleasantly surprised by the portrait of Sunny Deol in the film. He's a bit romantic and lovable in the film, unlike his other characters in his other films. Sometimes it seems to you that justice has not been done to his character. Sunny had to be played as the good guy in the movie, but in the end he looks like a villain. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. She is her usual car. In short, a great love story with passion.
