"Just Before Dawn" by Jeff Lieberman is certainly one of the most underrated horror films ever made. The film, although somewhat influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", is extremely disturbing and memorable. The suspense almost never lets it speak and the atmosphere is really disturbing. The cast is excellent, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female protagonists. The twins in love are truly terrifying and ruthless killers. The film is beautifully filmed - it was actually filmed locally at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. There is very little blood, but a murder, when Verchel is stabbed in the groin, is rather unpleasant and unpleasant. A must-see for slasher fans.10 on 10-what else?
