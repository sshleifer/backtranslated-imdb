It seems we all agree. It was an excellent show and let it die before it is now. I decided that if I really enjoy a show, it's often the kiss of death. I like quirks, ensemble cast shows, and a fantastic environment always helps. I really expected to see many of these stars in other television productions, but aside from Mariska Hagartay who played Fisher Stephens' crazy girlfriend, I haven't seen many, except in occasional cameo roles. What a pity. <br /> Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all great shows, all unfortunately gone before their time. <br /> <br /> Listen to us, loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
