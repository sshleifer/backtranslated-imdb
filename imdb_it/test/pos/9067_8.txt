Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with phrases like, "Mr. Smith, you shouldn't keep my wife like that." and "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" The poster of this film is a disturbing green and Peter Lorre is a lion so he never wants to go to his penal colony / island. This film is not available on DVD although it is a classic and very rarely shown on TV. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Because the monkey has upset him so much. We will never know. The film should be colored by someone and the excerpts should be turned into a Kinks video. The film was re-released in the 1950s and only some of Peter Lorre's biographies pass any text on this film. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could have been on that island, but they definitely didn't have the budget for him
