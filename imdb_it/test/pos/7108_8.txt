"House of Dracula" is a good sequel to "House of Frankenstein". There is not a lot of action but acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who becomes bad after receiving blood from Dracula through a transfusion (Dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his "affliction" but puts a spell on a humped nurse and then transfuses the Doctor's blood. ). It turns out that Dracula actually didn't come looking for a cure, but instead to drain the blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a (successful) cure. Meanwhile, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death (don't worry, the same trio returned to "Abbott and Costello meeting Frankenstein"). John Carradine still plays a sinister Dracula (Baron Latos is his pseudonym at the beginning of the film and in "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Chaney is the likeable Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as Frankenstein's monster. Lionel Atwill still plays an inspector, which he often does in the monstrous films of Universal Studios. A keeper for your collection.
