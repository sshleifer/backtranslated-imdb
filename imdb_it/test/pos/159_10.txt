If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with splashes of very dark humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and at every moment I loved it, from cinematography (every shot is stupendous and creative) to the plot, which mixes Shakespearean tragedy, homicidal love, gothic horror and multi-level drama . The characters are complex and there is a lot of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is sober and the performances are blurred - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to understand at first sight. Chan-wook Park is a smart, daring, constantly surprising filmmaker. It's unpredictable - the scenes go from brutal and heartbreaking to hilarious laughter in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE as exaggerated and comical. But like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly rich, stimulating and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire stories told wonderfully (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or you're a fan of Chan-wook Park, seeing The THIRD should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of 2009.
