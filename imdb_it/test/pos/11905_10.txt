I love this movie and recommend it to everyone. Damian Chapa and Jennifer Tilly played their roles perfectly. Only the characters drag you to the cinema. The direction was magnificent. The most creative shots I've ever seen. attached to the screen throughout the film, not one scene was slow. The film also has a lot of action-packed scenes, exploding machines, etc. The film is just a masterpiece. If you like real entertainment movies, then look at this because you will always be on the edge of your seat. I put this film in my all-time top ten, because there is never a dull moment in the film, and this is my kind of movie.2 inches up, all the way through !!!!!!!! !
