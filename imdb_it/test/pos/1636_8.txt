Yes, I know my title sucks. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant episode of the first season. Very interesting idea and good acting. The whole thing looking worm was really disturbing to me. I've never been a fan of insects, so all insects are disturbing to me. x] Anyway, let's move on to the good and bad things about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: The parasite thing. Fantastic! <br /> <br /> Scully finally trusts Mulder. Awww ... <33 <br /> <br /> It was a good idea to put another parasite in your ear. Even if someone told me they had to put that thing in my ear ... I think the whole booth would die. <br /> <br /> The Bad: How did the dog stay alive for so long? <Br /> <br /> Why did Huffman not have those blackheads? Or maybe he did, but nobody saw it ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: very good episode, especially for season 1. 8/10
