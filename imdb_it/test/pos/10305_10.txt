A moving and stimulating film that raises mental health problems, terminal illnesses and euthanasia. Does it look a little too heavy? It is a bit, but all this is dealt with in a realistically directed manner within a story of the changes that occur to the family that has to face these things. This is a positive story of facing life and the responsibility that is not overwhelmed by the subject. <br /> <br /> The afterlife is a wonderfully filmed and made in modern times and that deals with modern issues. It's a compelling, compelling film, with a strong cast and some excellent performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it is not the kind of film that always performs well at the box office, so take it while you can.
