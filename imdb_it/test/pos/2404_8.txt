I like this film because it has a good approach to Buddhism, for example, the way the Buddhist uses to cure all kinds of living things, combining some imaginative and real situations; in some parts the photograph is very good and many messages about freedom, such as the hawk episode, always remaining concentrated at all times, even in difficult situations. He also has fun situations like Swank's birthday and, speaking of this academy award twice, his acting shows us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture are trying to have resistance behavior when Miyagi is taking her a Buddhist temple, and how slowly she is changing her mind. And of course, Pat Morita has always been fantastic
