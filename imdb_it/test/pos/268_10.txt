I am surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. film ... as far as I know, the series itself, had a huge following, expert commentators and real people alike, praised it to a person. Anyway, let me tell you right away that, if like me, you're an idiot for police dramas, you'll like "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine, in the whole "Prime Suspect" series, fought the police male, throughout the series, has come to his present, relatively powerful in the police hierarchy through hard work, obstinacy and pure talent for police work. It is, in essence, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly not a man-hater. Unfortunately her relationships are influenced by bad hours, which her career requires, and she never married, so when she gets pregnant from her last relationship, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and jeopardizing her entire police work, not to mention the future advancement, or abortion - which she opts for. This abortion never looms in the drama that follows: it is dealt with very skilfully, in less than a couple of minutes of time, a marvel of economics in script and montage, but it is always there, as a counterpoint to Tennison's desperate efforts to find another "lost child" - a kidnapping victim - before it's too late. The plot takes many twists and turns, before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, in the same way, by the plot and the characters (although I found the many villains a bit upset), the police, and especially Tennison, she itself, I am not always competent, nor so likeable, such as figures, given the unpleasant work they have to do, in the evil world that this series usually lives. <br /> <br /> Mirren herself said that she will no longer make films in the series, but, as excellent as she has always been in the role of Tennison, the series, in turn, is "actor-proof" as is another addiction of my -Dick Wolf's American "Law & Order" - whoever appears to you, everyone could go on forever. How is my fervent hope.
