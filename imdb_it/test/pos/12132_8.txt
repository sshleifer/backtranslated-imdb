Surprisingly, the "Mean Streets" crime drama. It includes elements of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". Joe Pesci's first major role. Intelligent dialogue I think Maltin's guide gives this assessment to the bombs. I can only imagine that no one has bothered to look at it. <br /> <br /> I saw him at the Tarantino festival and he said that Scorsese used a number of these actors in Raging Bull.
