(Some spoilers) The educational film of the early 1930s about the horrors of contracting a social disease and the consequences that derive from it: loss of the madness of blindness in one's ability to act and infect other people with it, even unborn children and finally death. "Damaged Lives" is far ahead of its time in educating its viewers about the dangers of Venerea. now seen over 70 years after its release in 1933 it is as good, if not better, than the many films on that subject made in the 1940s and '60s. <br /> <br /> Donald Bradley, Lyman Williams , is a manager of a large shipping company that has been studying with his girlfriend Joan, Diane Sinclair, for some time. both are finally planning to get married and raise a family. One night at a party, Donald meets Elsie Cooper, Charlotte Merriam, and they drink too many drinks and before you know it they end up spending the night together at Elsie's house. <br /> <br /> I didn't think of his only nighttime presence with Elsie Donald who later married Joan for a long time and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. In the office, Donald receives a call from Elsie's panic telling him to come to her right away for something very important. Running on Donald discovers, to his horror, that Elsie has a sexual infection she had from her boyfriend Nat, Harry Myers, and that she could have donated it to Donald, and he in turn could have infected his wife Joan. By telling Elsie that she is wrong to be infected and that she should look for a doctor, Elsie recovers while Donald is about to leave. <br /> <br /> After the tragic death of Elsie, Donald receives another surprise later when his Dr. Bill Hill, Jason Robards Sr, arrives in his office and tells him to come immediately with him to the hospital for talk to the Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Vincent Leonard, Murray Kinnell, about his wife Joan who was just admitted there. The terrible truth about Donald and his wife Joan strikes him like a bolt from the blue and leaves him speechless, just like Joan did before. Both were infected and the infection is feared and unspeakable in the 1930s, an infection called venous disease. <br /> <br /> Told by Dr. Leonard that it would take two years of treatment for both Donald and Joan to be completely cured, leaving Joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. Later in the movie Joan, feeling that he has nothing to live for, closes all her windows and Donald's apartment and turns on the gas stove, at full blast, to kill herself and Donald Duck sleeping right now. <br /> <br /> Honest film about the ravages of Venereal Disease and the damage it causes to those who are infected, both psychically and mentally, and how it could be treated if immediate medical attention is given instead of hiding it from one's own doctor and hiding it, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it is too late.
