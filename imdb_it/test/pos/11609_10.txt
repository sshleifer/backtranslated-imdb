I was able to watch this fantastic film at the Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I left the cinema I felt like a drug addict * g *! I've really seen a lot of movies and there are only a few that I'd call perfect like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious Cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people watching him in Berlin left the room and I can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone who lives in his perfect world day after day dreaming about his dreams without thinking about the horror on our planet life! I don't think I have to describe the story of the film for you because people have already written on this page! It's a film that shows everything and more !!! Get 10 points + 10 !!! It would be nice if you too, people who saw you love, wrote me an e-mail! So far I have not met anyone as impressed and happy as I am !!! Finally I'm sorry for my bad English, I'm not a studied person (and it's not that bad !!! :-)))))))
