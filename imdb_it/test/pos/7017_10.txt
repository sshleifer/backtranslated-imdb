I think the dirty dances were a great movie, they tried to do another Havana night, which was good but it was nothing like the dirty dance. I'd like to see another dirty dance with the same people. without them I think it would be a disaster. a lot of times movies are made then when they try to add more they start to change people and make movies go down. I'd like to see someone else dancing dirty to see what happened after they were able to be together. patrick and jennifer did very well together. this film was made in 1997, it's time to make another one. but this time he starts again from where he left a group of people.
