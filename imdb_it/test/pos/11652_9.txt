Tim Robbins makes a wonderful film. His wife (susan sarandon) gives a wonderful performance like his sister Helen Perjean who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn) who is worried about the murder and who will also die from an injection ... 120 minutes of acting and moving scenes what get. Great acting and it's a movie that gives something to think about! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves the Oscar for the best actress of 1995. It is probably one of her greatest films ever. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen "The Craddle will rock", but I definitely have to see more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 on 4. Go and see .....
