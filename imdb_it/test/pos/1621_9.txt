I recently took the movie and all I can say is a good movie. There are many famous monuments of Rome and historical places. He is the same author and director of the Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars together with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with the space and time of the experiment in Sweden until one of the containers was stolen by the church's most hated enemy by the Illuminati. The plot is difficult to discuss without ruining anything. All of Rome is a race following the Illuminati to reach the secret place of the Illuminati. As you race against the clock to find the Illuminati path. In his film it's worth seeing the hell I watched it 3 times and I still like it so eventually go and buy it. It's much better than the 2010 movie. And the ending has a fantastic plot.
