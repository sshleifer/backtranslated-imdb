A fun romp ... lots of good twists! (and we weren't even baked!) <br /> <br /> I didn't know this movie existed until I watched the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD ... (strangely it was there with The City of Lost Children and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) <br /> <br /> The plot continues to amaze you. <br /> <br /> The acting was fantastic ... Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching .
