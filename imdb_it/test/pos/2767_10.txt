This film used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a little younger, and I really remember that I liked it. However, I didn't have a great taste then (not to mention I do it now) so I can't guarantee my nine-year-old too well. The film was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it one more point. Yes, it's worth watching. I know some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is, the one that appears when it's in a car accident. The song is "Play a Love Song" by Jaguar and is VERY hard to find and get. In fact, this film is too. I can't find it anywhere online or on DVD or VHS. I'd like to see it again so you can evaluate if it was actually a good movie. Oh good.
