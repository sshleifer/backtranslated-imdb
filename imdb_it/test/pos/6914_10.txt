This is a speculation. This film was able to inspire Paramount Pictures to film the movie The Core. Both films have something in common. The only improvement for Inferno is a better cast. Inferno's cast is still good. Great movie 8 out of 10. Worth watching. This film has truth for him the heat waves are real. Another piece of truth is heat-related power outages. Where I live, I heard the transformers blow. Heat-related disorders are possible because people trying to cool off can become turbulent. There is a significant amount of teamwork in this film. Also in this case it is worth watching a movie. The film has a good cast. The film has no slow points.
