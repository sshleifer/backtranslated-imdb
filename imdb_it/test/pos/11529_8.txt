If I look pretty good, in this film we can find flaws, mainly with the script. I found Wolf's character not entirely convincing. However, those were my only "complaints". Because when this movie started on Cable, I was about to record it and watch it later. However, from the beginning, with the disturbing music and Cameron Diaz that made her dance the spaced sixties, I riveted myself. I never got up until the movie was finished. It seemed that I had never flinched. <br /> <br /> The acting of Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster was excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful and the music was disturbing and very touching. The story was quite unique and sometimes had a surreal quality. The viewer would tend to appreciate the image more if he had a good understanding of the mood of young people in the 60s and 70s, especially in America. Many scenes have managed to show something of that difficult time to define. It was a bit more complicated than the simple statement that they wanted to change the world and remained disillusioned, although this may be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more about this as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> An aspect that does not seem to be covered by other reviewers that could be mentioned, is the way the two daughters seem to go through life after their father's death. Both had adored him, and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and obviously he had loved them dearly. We read so much today about boys who lose their fathers too soon, only to lose the road themselves. This film covers the chain effect of her father's loss on her remaining daughters, first on her older sister Faith, then on her younger sister. The mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. This type of dynamic is not covered by almost any other film, especially in so many different plot and subplot levels. The inner struggles between reality and Phoebe's perceptions are gradually erased as layers of an onion. <br /> <br /> Speaking of plot, this film should be higher than it is here. I kept waiting for a great conspiracy to discover the death of Faith. How it was solved itself surprised me, although others may have guessed much earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could watch this movie many, many times.
