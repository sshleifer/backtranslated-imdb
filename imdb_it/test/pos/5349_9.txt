My only problem with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is that the film does not have the time to correctly present Wallace and Gromit to those not familiar with Park's short films. Strangely, "A Close Shave" manages to do it with much less time to waste. Anyway, I enjoyed seeing the guys in action and I love all the new characters, human and otherwise. I particularly loved the voice of Ralph Fiennes as the intriguing Victor Quartermaine. It is also interesting to see the series on the big screen. The workmanship with the clay characters really stands out. It's a real hoot and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs but I have every Wallace and Gromit and I will happily add this.
