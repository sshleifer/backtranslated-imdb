This must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; it throws virtually everything from visual gags and skit-comed sketches to social relevance, romanticism, even violence. The mix is ​​challenging and intriguing, and the film has many fun and clever sequences (like the one in which Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together and the mix (and tone) seem a bit disharmonious. As for the famous final speech, although undeniably honest, today he also seems a bit naive, with his allusions to "a better world where man will overcome his hatred and brutality, and his soul will fly". Great perfornmances by Jack Oakie and the beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
