This film, directed by George Fitzmaurice, who has made so many excellent films, lives up to its excellent standard. It is clear, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic part. Colman plays the irresistibly charming young son of a wealthy English contemporary. He is financially irresponsible (spending, for example, Â£ 15 of his last 20 pounds in the world on a cute terrier he calls George), but open, wildly generous, contemptuous of profit, irreverent in the most politically possible and hopelessly sentimental way. It is so fascinating that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of music halls, and so in 1930, an inhabitant of the demi-monde, he played with his typical, quick and thin goggles from the young Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great close-up user, and the girls of that day had their half-hidden faces with those horrible hats clinging anyway, so we wouldn't have had a good eye on the faces of the two heroines as we would like. However, the director seems more interested in the fascinating Colman. The romantic female protagonist is the young and fresh Loretta Young, who had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews of which we generally know her, but she was still a blushed girl who exuded all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughed cheerfully and with everything the weather. It is obvious that a character with his terrifying sense of humor was necessary to appreciate the snobbish social anarchism that sports the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot does not matter, as often happens with these light and fun films. This is so fun.
