My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which has now been released on DVD for the first time in the UK, has been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins stood out in his boldness and technical skills. This pseudo-documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and updated. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the upheavals of the late 1960s in the United States, when the government increased its legitimate use of violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement reacted increasingly violently and radically. To cope with this, the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training for riot control units, the government introduced so-called punishment parks. The convicted "criminals", mostly activists, receive the "choice" to be locked up for years and years, or to spend three days in one of these parks, where they get the freedom or punishment of a prison sentence again longer . The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations, however. It reminded me of a kind of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The film's structure is extremely effective and recalls the parallels with the Cannibal Holocaust, which is done almost 10 years later. Both films are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged to think and feel that he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked, although aware that: this is a film. Both confront us with the intrinsically violent nature of humanity, but where the Cannibal Holocaust lacks any deeper meaning (above all, it is an exploitative film in every sense of the word) and does not pose critical questions about the state of the world, Punishment Park does just that. <br /> <br /> I was deeply impressed with Punishment Park and I find it hard to believe that such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Perhaps this says enough about the truth of its content, about the way power structures work in this world. I disagree with the criticism that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes, because the film describes activists and holders of legitimate power structures that are actually as polarized as they are here. If they were not, there would be no conflict and therefore no change in our societies. In reality, the clashes between these two groups often take stereotyped forms, whether you put them between activists and institutions in Latin America, Russia or New York. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, the activists would be part of the silent majorities that complain tacitly but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction to the DVD, the actors of Punishment Park are mostly amateurs. Most children were real LA activists, most policemen were part of the national forces and even some members of the courts were part of the social and political establishment of the time. Not introducing both groups before filming the scenes that take place in the improvised court room, it adds to the spontaneous and improvised sensation. The parallels are drawn to issues of the time, such as the repression of Black Panther members (one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the charismatic condemned Biper Seale) and the Chicago sects trial. <br /> <br /> I admire Watkins' obvious and sincere commitment to injustice and his concern for human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (today in the name of the War in Terror) to put silence those who disagree and refuse to be brainwashed. Punishment Park remains an extremely important film that should be shown in schools and seen by all those who share these concerns. Perhaps his marginalization can finally be compensated.
