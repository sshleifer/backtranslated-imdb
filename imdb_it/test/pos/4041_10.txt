I know the girl who did the figure skating for the main girl. Once he went out with my brother and she was always very pretty! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 minutes from Fort Steele. Haha I went there for field trips when I was in elementary school. It was rather strange to see him in the film. I also had the chance that the movie turned out to be an extra because there was a casting call to the mall. But I didn't want to go at that moment because I wasn't interested in acting. Now I'd really like you to do it. This was a fantastic movie that I bought on Ebay. It never came out here (which is strange since it was partially filmed here) so I was excited when it arrived. I really loved the plot and the polar bear was pretty nice. But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away :)
