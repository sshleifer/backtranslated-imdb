There are a few movies that made me wait and wait for more than this. This is the last film by The Dead Gentlemen group responsible for the original film Gamers and the films Demon Hunters. This group has not been terribly active in recent years, but this film is a specific reason to try to keep up with their progress. <br /> <br /> This film follows a group of players who are trying to finish a campaign run by a GM frustrated by his group's contempt for its history. With the help of some new blood, they try the campaign again with the hope of ending this time. <br /> <br /> This film is a breath of fresh air in the cinema community and a great improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game very similar to the original film, but in addition to this film shows a clear improvement of the special effects that launch it over the simplicity of university films. The acting is pretty decent and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately many of the jokes are playful, so if you are not a player you may not find the movie as fun as the others. So that's why I give the film an 8 instead of the 9 that I initially thought of. In any case, if you are a player or you know the games, check this game and you'll like it.
