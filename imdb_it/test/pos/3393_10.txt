This film is VERY LONG, but it is worth dividing it for several nights. He has an all-star cast and if you are a fan of Patrick Swayze, this will make your heart beat! :-) My mother is passionate about civil war and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it on TV), for several nights, until we succeeded. We have memorized every line of the film, lol. Pop popcorn, relax and enjoy the action and romance. It is a fantastic film for those who love action, war, blood and courage, but also for those who have a soft and romantic side. The clothes women wore were GORGEOUS! Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong age, lol.
