But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And this is only the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not entirely sure that any description of the film and the plot makes you want to see this. Suffice it to say that it has something for virtually everyone: death, singing, a sparkling dress, cell phones, a small person (actually a beautiful woman), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic one. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You will have to trust me when I say that 50% of you out will hate this movie due to the lack of the Absurd Gene in your DNA trick. It is not your fault; is hereditary The other 50% of you will probably want to change channels after 20 minutes, but you MUST KEEP THE WATCH. <br /> <br /> Again, in the end you might ask yourself why you looked ... but that absurd thing continues in mind. It should grow on you. It's a test.
