A surprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. Presents performances by unnamed actors that rival the best talents on the planet (unfortunately no one has ever pursued a career). <br /> <br /> Also contains the divine ability of Christopher Nolan to write a perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what brings this story, about a man who likes to follow people by material for his books. Well shot, VERY well edited, even better written and incredibly well executed. <br /> <br /> This film has everything a great film needs except the people who saw it. 9/10
