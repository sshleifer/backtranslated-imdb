Well, every scene is so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen a film of this kind that has meaning in almost all the scenes. <br /> <br /> Ben, while I was watching this movie, I remembered seeing "Amilie". Amilie is also a similar film with a more fun and fantastic touch. These films are both based on the same storyline. But both are perfectly perfect and can create a world of their own. <br /> <br /> Red can cause a lot of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavus. And I'm still thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The story is great and the ending is a bit strange. I was laughing at the end of the scene. Very funny how the three films Red White and Blue are connected. <br /> <br /> All in all a great work of art. A work of a master. <br /> <br /> 10/10
