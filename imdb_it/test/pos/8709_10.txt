This is one of my cheap, cynical and vampire movies of all time. <br /> <br /> The underwear model by Calvin Klein ... oh, I mean, Stefan the Good Vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend the throne of Vampiric Royalty, but Radu has another plan. After killing his father the Vampire King, Radu now sets his sights on Stefan, Stefan's new mortal girl, Michelle and her two beautiful friends, and the all-powerful Bloodstone. <br /> <br /> Ok, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be like it was shot on the spot in Transil-fricken-vania for god's sake. Actresses are not great shakes and Stefan the Heroic Vampire is as fascinating as a chilled fireplace poker, but who cares? There's only one reason to watch this movie, and its name is RADU! It is a physical tribute to Nosferatu and has the best lines in the film, all spoken with the hoarse voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as Radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning and drooling face to the world. I found myself cheering him up when he picked up the victims and taunted his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sicko. Questionable taste among men, I highly recommend this movie to vampire fans. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time ... a lot more fun than the undead, tragic, whining and whining kids who are endlessly framing horror screens today. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. That's what a vampire should be.
