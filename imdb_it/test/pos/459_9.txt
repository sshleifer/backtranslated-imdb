"The Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), out of Hungary during the 1956 Hungarian uprising. international people trying to get out of Hungary across the Austrian border. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bus is stopped by the Russians for a security check. The current Russian officer (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr) and delays the journey. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist posing as a British citizen, but decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him. Of course, this all sounds absurd, but it's a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr. Brynner and Ms. Kerr, which seems inappropriate in the situation in which they find themselves, the film becomes full of suspense and interesting. Good acting bypasses some of the silly dialogues. Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian uprising would not appreciate this movie; they would consider it a piece of plush. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite role of Yul Brynner. He speaks with his own male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is the second time that Deborah Kerr has worked with Yul Brynner since they made "The King and I" in 1956. They make a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. This was the second sexy role Ms. Kerr took from "From Here to Eternity". Although Ms. Kerr wore heavy winter clothes throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was directed by Jason Robards, Jr., in his first film role. Some of the international casts were recognizable, such as Robert Morley from England. However, the rest of the actors, whom I never saw before or after, were simply fantastic in the film. In the background, it was fun to see Senta Berger, as one of the waitresses, speak a few lines of Hungarian. A few years later, in 1966, he starred in a film, "Cast a Giant Shadow", with Yul Brynner as the protagonist. You are still working today.
