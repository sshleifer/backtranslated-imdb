This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is by far the best I've ever seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations, it has the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Jacobi of the disturbed Prince is multilayered and compelling. His manifestations of emotion oscillate from hate to pain, from love to revenge and from anywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or exaggerated. Indeed, some of the most powerful sequences occur when they are subtly placed on them, with gentle language and reflexive expression. Regarding whether or not you play Hamlet as crazy or sane ... well, you should decide for yourself; I changed my mind more than once. At one point it seems that he thought himself sane and that he simply played mad, but he suspects he is really crazy after all ... a revelation to himself, captured beautifully. Having played the part of Hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history, the affinity with Jacobi for the role is not all that surprising. <br /> <br /> As for the production itself, it is presented as a sort of "filmed copy" of the theatrical drama, with small special effects or imaginative photographic work, minimal series and no musical accompaniment to talk about. This production is based on the acting feat of the cast, and the words of Shakespeare, to evoke the excitement and interest of his audience. And it works. The other players are also top notch, especially "Claudius" by Patrick Stewart and "Gertrude" by Claire Bloom. Together, the cast presents a seamless ensemble. <br /> <br /> The last (but not least) element that distinguishes this production is the game itself. Here it is presented in its entirety, a rarity on the film. But strangely, I never noticed the time. I was too busy to get involved in the story. I suspect you will too.
