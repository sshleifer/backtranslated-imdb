I've seen the Korean version of Daisy before. He came across a simple love story that flowed pleasantly from beginning to end. I saw it 3 times while waiting for my copy of the director's cut to arrive. <br /> <br /> Then I took the DC and looked at it. Wow! I think this is the first real cut of the director I've ever seen. Amazing how detailed the change is in both versions! The DC is structured as a hardcore thriller, with the romance in the background. It moves at a slower pace than the Korean version. The variations between the two versions are so drastic, it seems that two totally different films. I thought I would be consumed watching the movie again, trying to resist just looking for the added scenes. This was not the case. It really felt like I was watching a whole new movie. <br /> <br /> While the DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, it will be difficult for you to determine where or what has been changed. 2 seconds cut here. A second added there. An entire scene added here. Another canceled there. In both versions, the scenes have been added, omitted or cut and rearranged. In some scenes, entire lines of dialogue have been replaced or rearranged - while the scene itself was intact. Even the simple sound effects have been added / omitted from each version - with a greater impact on the mood of the film and, sometimes, even changing the result of a scene. What appears as a moment of tenderness in the Korean version is sad and gloomy in the DC. The terminations of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I can tell, both versions end up being very different, and they were designed that way. <br /> <br /> I suppose most people will get the director's film, and find the film pretty nice, but a bit long and boring. If so, look for the Korean version. The same movie, but different feeling. I think there is a deluxe 3-DVD version that contains both cuts in the film - I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> The versions complement each other so well that as a couple, I'll watch one of my other favorite Korean movies more often than I do. Alone, I would say that the Korean version is a beautiful love story that I would look at once in a while. The director's cut, I'll watch maybe once or twice, then never again, while I find the rhythm boring. But they go so well together! For what I consider the best experience, I'd say before looking at the Korean version. Then look at the director's cut to help fill in the gaps in the story that interested you. <br /> <br /> Editing is the real star of the film.
