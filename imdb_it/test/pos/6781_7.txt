I found a copy in a sales deal for this old-time classic. I played it with dosbox on a machine seen without problems. It's graphically dated heavily, but what do you expect for a 12-year game! The game is a hybrid FPS / Adventure game. It's what I call pseudo 3D, you can't look up or down, you just turn in 360 (think Wolf3D). The game can be complicated with a very limited supply of health containers and a fairly average interface (Tip: press I), but overall it is passable. <br /> <br /> A strong point of the game is the mood. The game uses video in full motion intensely, and while the acting is type b and the plot is very discontinuous, the game as a whole looks really creepy. It also does a good job of getting the 'good guys' interrogated. Are they really helping, or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? The other strong point is the length of the games. There are 18 chapters in the memory, which vary in playing time from 10 minutes to potentially hours. My first game brought me a week with some devotion of the time. <br /> <br /> Pinned, yes, but if you missed this year and can find it for $ 5, check it out. Cheaper than a movie and more fun than most movies.
