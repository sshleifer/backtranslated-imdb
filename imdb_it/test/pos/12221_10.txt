I bought the full season of Surface. watched in 3 days! I was so captivated by the plot, by the theories and fundamentally by everything related to this show. The actor who plays Miles is fantastic. Mile's sister, mother and father behaved like a real family. You could connect to so many levels is fascinating. <br /> <br /> I find that animals are so wonderful, you can almost connect with them as a parent is for a child. It would be something if a creature of this kind of nature really existed. <br /> <br /> I'm sad, that Surface doesn't have a second season or at least four other shows. I have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book. <br /> <br /> I love the show a lot. For those who haven't looked at Surface, if you like science fiction you have to see it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
