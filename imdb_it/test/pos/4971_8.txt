This is a great movie about Italian sharks, probably not an action movie full of sharks, but it has a nice story about a Native American in the form of a killer shark attacking a small community on the beach. the film has real scenes of real sharks and others do not, but how they did it is nice enough that the cast is not so brilliant in acting in this shark movie, but it shows a better acting in some other Italian shark films like (for example , cruel jaws, last shark) show a rather bad acting but most of the Italian shark films are good, which means that they vote better as the best Italian shark film ever, some scenes in this film show violence / gore that makes this good film that proves it so to say that this is the best film for all fans of shark movies.
