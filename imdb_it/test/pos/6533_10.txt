Well, I have to say, this film was probably the most fun movie I've seen throughout the year. And I don't mean exactly that in a positive sense. This is probably the most pathetic movie I've seen in a while, yet that's what makes it so fun. you can say that these people are really trying to behave, unfortunately for them they are not doing a good job, thus making even the lines delivered in what should be a serious tone, they sound really fun. Aaron Carter essentially plays a character quite similar to him in real life, and still manages to make the character seem trivial and not at all realistic. This film is one of those movies where everything that should seem serious comes out very funny and all the things that should be funny are so silly and silly that you have to laugh because you know how they try. This movie is so ugly, it's actually good. I would certainly recommend it if you are in the mood for a good laugh.
