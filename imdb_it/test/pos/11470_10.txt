I thought this movie was good, I loved the plot, I liked the scenes, except for a few, they weren't necessary and I liked the character of Ma too, he was a driver I liked. I have to say that in this gangster movie the actors were well chosen because sometimes some actors don't adapt to the role. However, even if I hate to say it, but I hated the ending, I felt like it should have gone in a different direction. Also it would have been better with a little more detail, it is based on a true story, but there were many facts left out, but apart from that it was good. If you like gangster films from the past you will enjoy this movie.
