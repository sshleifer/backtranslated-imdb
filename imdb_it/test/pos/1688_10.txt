When I first saw this film in mid-January (2005), I didn't like it. I thought it was too weird and thought some parts that the main star, Judith Light, played were so different from her. (Which of course is true) And then I looked at it a bit the next day when it aired and I felt pretty much the same. Then I looked at it again two Sundays ago (March 20, 2005) and I really started to enjoy it and this time I recorded everything. I even cried the first two times, but mainly because the actress was crying and I'm a big fan of her. <br /> <br /> It's a TV movie very well done and done. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a great job in this movie! I keep looking at it again and again. It is a sad film, but very beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it! Usually it's not my type of film, but I liked it! A +++
