I recorded this film as a teenager in the mid-1980s based on the synopsis in the cable guide (the aspect of the treasure hunt fascinated me), having no knowledge or expectations of the film. what a pleasant surprise when I saw it! this was such a funny movie and I remember seeing it repeatedly. I thought the concept was well executed, I liked the harmless competition between the different groups and I thought the treasure hunt was smart enough. sometimes it seems that people have too big expectations for movies. not all films will have a heavy "message" or stellar acting, production values ​​or special effects. sometimes movies are just meant to entertain and be fun, and this succeeds at both levels. it was so nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I haven't seen this movie in years, but if I did I think I would have had a reaction that was just as hot and enthusiastic as I was when I was a teenager. even as I write this, I am reminded of fragments of the creamy but appropriate theme song: "when midnight madness starts coming at you ... no matter what you say, no matter what you do ...!"
