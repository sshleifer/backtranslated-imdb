I think Vanessa Marcil is the best actor in the cast. It makes Sam one of the best characters on the show. James Cann is also quite good. I like it when he worries about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes where Ed and Delinda are beating a boy. This was good. Nikki Cox is also good and has great skill with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was fantastic in her role as a guest. I wish they hadn't killed her. The show has a fantastic cast without bad actors that is not something you often see on TV. I still believe that Vanessa Marcil is the best. He should have an Emmy in my opinion. It is a pity that the show has been canceled
