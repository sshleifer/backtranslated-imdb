This film is based on the book "A Many Splendored Thing" by Han Suyin and addresses issues of race relations between Asians and whites, a topic that comes from the personal experiences of Han as a Eurasian raised in China. This backdrop and the beautiful settings of Hong Kong give this love story a unique and rather bold atmosphere for its time. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, the story is a stereotyped love story with a memorable song that is perhaps most remembered of the film itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones plays the part and gives a wonderful Oscar performance as a mixed race doctor during the advent of communism in China. William Holden has never seemed better at playing a romantic role as a journalist covering war-torn regions around the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers offers some genuine moments of affection from silver screen that will surely melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined. <br /> <br /> Cinematography really brings out the fifty of Hong Kong, in particular the hill that dominates the port where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a true tear-jerker. Some might consider sentimental romance passages, but for those who love classic Hollywood love stories, this is a brilliant example.
