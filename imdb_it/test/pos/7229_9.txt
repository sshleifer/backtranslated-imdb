In the squalid streets somewhere in New York City, a lonely punk named Tromeo (Will Keenan) has little friends, but all they do is get tattoos, piercings and just have fun all the time. He falls in love with a beautiful rich girl named Juliet (Jane Jenson) who is also troubled by the fact that her father is a rather abusive son of one you know what, but how our title characters meet and fall in love with each other things they start to get pretty magic to them. Unfortunately their fathers are among them while Juliet's father wants to take over Tromeo's father's film studio, but could he really love to win them all and stop this feud? <br /> <br /> The horrible and gross dramatic comedy of the satire of the extravagant and disgusting people of Troma is a wonderful modern interpretation of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. It came out in theaters in 1997 and got some positive reviews for this dark humorous satire of the legendary story that started it all, has some laughter, piercings, graphic violence and gore as a head that is cracked on a fire hydrant. For me this is Troma's third best film alongside the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War" secondly, yes the acting can be a bit ugly like some Troma movies but the stuff above makes up for it and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson and Troma or if you want to see a comic version of a beloved story, BTW also looks for a couple of fun appearances from The Toxic Avenger and SGT. Kabukiman NYPD. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Toxic Avenger", "Meet The Feebles", "Ichi The Killer", "Re-Animator", "Terror Firmer", "Class of Nuke'Em High", "Romeo and Juliet (1968 and 1996)", "Pieces", "Troma's War", "Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger 4", "Basket Case", "Riki-Oh: Ricky's Story", "Demons" " , "New Nightmare", "Freddy Vs.
