They were two films shot on video that Troama decided to be horrible, so with a desperate move they turned into this one movie. Perhaps the bitterness of the part of Troama has contributed to giving life to the comedy, but for some reason this is a very funny thing with a piece inspired by "Oliver Stone" that makes comments during the film. Lots of cameos, a lot of use of the Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown song add to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> One of the best recent versions of Troama. Yes, it's all over, knowing that entering, the quality of the production, or the lack of it, becomes one of the many jokes in the running. Go with it and you'll have fun. <br /> <br /> Behind the scenes, often the best things from the versions of Troama are also above average this time. I really think that the anger they felt about these two bad movies helped them to bring them, well, not to greatness, but they pushed them to "fix" this film in a way that is better than one of the two films, as expected originally.
