* MINOR SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Do you need further proof that Tsai Ming-liang is one of the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today? Watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Working from slight variations of a theme that spans most of his work, THE HOLE represents a study on alienation and solitude - in this case between a man and a woman who are on the floor of above / downstairs - and how the various structures (real or psychological) of modernity tear people apart from one another. Here, the woman (the neighbor downstairs) tries to endure how her apartment is flooded with a prodigious loss from upstairs. A plumber tries to identify the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. Already isolated and desperate (both characters are among the few inhabitants of a housing project who have not fled before a mysterious, almost apocalyptic epidemic). The hole that connects the two apartments works first as yet another in a long series of unworthiness, but soon begins to take on a meaning of almost mythical proportions. <br /> <br /> A sense of Tsai's humor and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a little more surprise than usual - while the occasional dreams of the woman revolving around her upstairs neighbor appear as musical numbers (set to the music of Grace Chang) that explode from the screen in short fragments of romanticism and sensual and surreal humor - it is reminiscent of the big screen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And as for the new and the alienation exposed here, Tsai's espionage of the pre-millennial tensions of the late 1990s is fun, absurd and gives this film a very attractive strangeness. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile Tsai - in a typical way - subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions that Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a casual, straightforward ease, focusing on both the absurd trends of the human mind the most absolute of worldliness. There is a total and careless demystification of almost everything related to his characters, bypassing the background or most of the cultural signifiers (which amplify the isolation of the characters), making THE HOLE - and his other films - rather confusing , but also always fascinating and insightful.
