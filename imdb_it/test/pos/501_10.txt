This movie is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the pure-class vampire hunter, gets kicked in such a fluid and violent way that he would make Bruce Lee proud. The film is a frantic round of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and the last one are exceptional and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around sweeping away all the sucking heads. The script is quite good and there is also a close dialogue. Wesley should have done more action movies than he has, I know he's a very good actor and he's not as tense in this as in his more comic or dramatic roles, but as far as action stars are concerned he's the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) are approaching. Although Wesley is quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as a bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone short of the Snipes should appear threatening, but he does. Overall the film is crisp, elegant and I hope the sequel has the same rhythm.
