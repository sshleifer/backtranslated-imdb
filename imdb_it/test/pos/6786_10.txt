I just wanted to say that I'm watching National Velvet on TV, it's now February 2006 and I was checking the details of the dates, etc. Surprising to see it made in 1944 and Rooney was 24 while Liz Taylor was only 12, what a good English actress she is. <br /> <br /> To make good some American contributors: there are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are presumably taken on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (county of Sussex). Unfortunately, no such scene exists. Like many other places, roads and buildings have been built on hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So, please, all of you adorable Americans, never confuse Ireland with England! we make a great exception to it. How to confuse Texas with Coney Island.
