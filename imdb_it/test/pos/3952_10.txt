The images of Blind Spot are fantastic. The action attracts you completely, even if the film is a bit long. For the credits, all you can think about are the positive positive points of the film. The main actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heartbreaking. The soundtrack of the film is undervalued. Completely moving in its powerful way. Not your melodramatic standard. The trance moments add poetic resonance to the compelling narrative and the fantastic visual compositions. I hope you have the chance to see this movie. Dig into a dark territory but you exit the tunnel without seeing anything but white light.
