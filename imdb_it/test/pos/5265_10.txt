As a veteran screenwriting instructor at Richland College in Dallas and former MGM screenwriter at the time of decent movies, I'm thrilled to have accidentally clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas tonight and watched this enchanting movie where Betty White is GORGEOUS and does a year ago for the good old days of really good movies before Hollywood started banging out all this shit for teenagers. If a producer listens, I would like to say that there are enough of us over 60 who will happily pay a penny to see a film that has no guns, killings, special effects, sex and violence and just a good touching story of human relationships that leaves you with a good feeling of warmth, as this film did for me.
