"Four Daughters" introduced John Garfield to the public, and is what is most remembered for this film today. Unlike some actors who appear in several films before the gels of their images on the screen, Garfield immediately created him, with a cigarette hanging from his mouth and talking about the fact that fate was against him. <br /> <br /> It is actually the story of four girls, their widowed father musician (Claude Rains) and their various suitors, one of whom, Felix, is played by the handsome Jeffrey Lynn. He's the one everyone has a crush on, but he's in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then he meets Mickey Borden, who falls in love with her. When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty formidable story given the life (and the sequel) from acting. Garfield has already been mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest of the daughters, the most interesting and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a cool and handsome front man, and this movie took him on the right foot with Warners. However, the real celebrity did not have to be. Like many others of the era, he entered the service, and when he came out, he had a bronze star but not much of a career. Later he went on television and in real estate. Claude Rains is as warm and wonderful as the patriarch. <br /> <br /> So popular was "The Four Daughters" which inspired "Four Wives" and "Four Mothers", as well as rejoining most of the cast in "Daughters" Brave "where the actors played different characters. < br /> <br /> Very funny, a nice memory of simpler and probably happier times, and the chance to see John Garfield in his first film.
