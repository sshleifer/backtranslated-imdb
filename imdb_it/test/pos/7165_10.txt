An unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that people's well-being had not changed much since Soviet times. As we see in "Window to Paris", most people are still as depressed as ever, while they are encouraged to go after the money. <br /> <br /> So everything changes for the music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergei Dontsov) after he finds a window that leads to Paris. He and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find. This film has one of the funniest discussions of Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf I've ever heard. So watch this movie. You're sure you love it. It is a sort of precursor of "Being John Malkovich".
