It's the best acting film I've ever seen. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this film. Sometimes it is said that "Do not act, live it", you can really see it in this film. The director is also competent, it is not possible to see many cameras in motion, but also the positions of the cameras are good. But after acting, the most notable part is the content of the film. Gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, the importance of true friends to people. Today we started living individually, in this film you see that there are others that are not us. And most importantly, see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love, love for your friends, love for your love. All people should see this movie ...
