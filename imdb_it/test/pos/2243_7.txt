Starting from where he left off, Doctor Who, Rose, his alternative dad, Mickey, his alternative counterpart Ricky and the small band of Mickey's rebels find themselves at the mercy of this reality version of Cybermen, this second part of the arc of the Cybermen in 2 episodes seems more like an episode of Doctor Who, in contrast to the previous part that honestly seemed more like an episode of the dead show "Sliders", which was a great show in its full splendor. The arc as a whole was quite amusing because I am one who subscribes to the maxim that ANY Who is good Who, but at the same time it is inevitable that this will be compared to the Dalek episode of the previous series. And the said comparisons would only make this seem like a minor job, as it is. I feel that this story could have been made in one episode. In the first part of the review I said that this type of stories dealing with alternative realities usually do not have lasting repercussions, but this is not the case, but what changes overall feels tagged and not quite in line with the character. /> <br /> My Grade: C +
