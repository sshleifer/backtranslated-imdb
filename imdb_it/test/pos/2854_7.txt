Small spoilers follow, but nothing you haven't learned by reading the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Held together by a wonderful central performance by Ren√©e Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark but deceptively good-natured comedy. <br /> <br /> Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing the murder of her sleazy husband, Betty, already tormented and desperately unhappy, becomes convinced that a character on her favorite daytime soap is her boyfriend lost to time and leave from Kansas to Hollywood to find it. <br /> <br /> Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's state of mind, writer John C. Richards is very understanding, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely defenseless but tragically vulnerable. Above all, she is never really a victim and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motivations of the characters who treat her badly are all understandable - even Greg Kinnear as the object of his deceived affections can be a self-centered, winked, arrogant but believes pig sincerely that she is simply a strange aspiring actress with talented bags rather than a crazy stalker. <br /> <br /> The farcical ending where all the main protagonists descend into the same place (in this case Betty's house) at the same time to have it is as old as the cinema, but it works very well here, even if the movement of tone is unlucky. <br /> <br /> Zellweger is ably supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, both of whom are involved in solid work, and it's especially nice to see Chris Rock show moderation in his previous scenes. <br /> <br /> It is not as cruel as one might expect, and by no means mean, Nurse Betty - while she is far from being a ridiculous laugh - is solid entertainment elevated to something much more leading actress.
