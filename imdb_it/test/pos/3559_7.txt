The Bounty Killer George Hilton, the good Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland (who is exceptional), and bank representative Edd Byrnes try to outdo one another while looking for a large amount of gold from one of Roland's thefts hidden by a treacherous member of his gang. <br /> <br /> Although it is not the best that the genre has to offer, it is still quite cheerful with a lot of carefree fun, full of action and a satisfying ending. <br /> <br /> Any Gun Can Play is mainly remembered for the opening of the gag where George Hilton can easily shoot three outlaws that look like Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Django. The following year, Hilton and Roland joined forces with Van Heflin and Klaus Kinski in the highly recommended The Four Ruthless.
