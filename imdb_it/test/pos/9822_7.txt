I read about 10 reviews of this film, but I didn't take any "at heart". Harrison Ford has been criticized for everything from haircuts to his earring and I really don't see what these things have to do with the movie. As I recall, he had ugly hair and negative reviews in Blade Runner, but he is still a favorite among us videophiles. It is slower than most of its previous films, but not worthy of the rejections it received. <br /> <br /> I would be happy to pay $ 7.50 just to see a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn.
