I saw this movie last night at a "pre-code" film festival, and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head for his introductory first floor, the whole audience winced. It was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Apart from the looks of Cooper, this film shows perfectly the art of directing by Rouben Mamoulian. Fantastic scene dissolves, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions - Mamoulian continues to explore the means of direction and to invent innovation. <br /> <br /> This was the first role of Sylvia Sidney in Hollywood, after her success in New York stage, and is as adorable as a Gary Cooper protagonist should be. It's nice to see her in a role with a margin that is harder than she was given - so often it seems that she is afraid of being hit by someone. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in this film, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. The most surprising is Guy Kibbee, best known for his role as rich and fatuous men, as a ferocious and mendacious man. <br /> <br /> There aren't enough of these pre-code movies available on VHS or DVD, so if you can't find a pre-code festival near you, try turning to Turner Classic Movies for a broadcast! As for the reviewer who believes that Gary Cooper was too stupid to have a more complex dialogue than "Yep" or "Nope", he should perhaps consider Coop's performance in films like "Mr Deeds Goes to Town" or "Meet John Doe ". Even if the sky knows that anyone who was so good shouldn't even be smart.
