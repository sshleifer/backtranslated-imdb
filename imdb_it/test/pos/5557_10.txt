Faqrscape is really one of those shows that only has everything, great acting, great cast, great script, set, chemistry, muppets ... it has everything and then some, except a house. This fantastic series seems to have everything but an end. It seems that the TPTB thinks this is a series of consecutive single series, when someone who observes knows that this is an epic and continuous story, that has an end that must be seen. If you have never watched Farscape do yourself a favor and watch it on DVD when Season 1 is released in October ... and Season 2 is the best there is! Watch replicas on the SciFi channel to catch up and the new season starts from January to March, when most shows are scheduled and be sure to watch. If all goes well we will get our final!
