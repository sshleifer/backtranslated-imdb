James Joyce could probably write some of the best sentences in English, and his short story, "The Dead", which concludes his collection The Dubliners, contains in his final perhaps the most perfect paragraph in English language. It is right that John Huston, who held in the attempt to film this story, ended his career with it. As with The Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Be Be King, Huston revered the literary source but made the film adaptation. And with "The Dead" (which was completed after Huston's death by his son, Tony Huston) we get something almost perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema. <br /> <br /> Valuing all that cinema can do, as one commentator points out "this is not the African queen" (nor is it necessary), this is the kind of film that does not compromise the public. We all made our way through Portrait of a Artist at school and we need to bring the maturity to appreciate how words and images of themselves can touch us. As in silent films, Huston looks for something pure here, and works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world with a masterpiece that is the same as Joyce's original one. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man full of self-importance (and fake self-doubt) who is reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the Feast Epiphany. What is in store for Gabriel Conroy is an evening of festivities, songs, dances, poems in which they are asked to give the two sisters an annual toast and their granddaughter who is hosting the party. He is distracted by the commitment he wants to live up to the situation, and this distraction makes him vulnerable to a shocking experience, given to him by his wife. While his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past, it is also a gift in which everything that seems to have mattered throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who live. <br /> <br /> And instead of trying to make the last famous chapter in the "cinematic" story, Huston makes a voice out and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch "the snow that falls faintly across the universe and falls feebly. " It's the perfect solution for a director's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The cast is all we hope for. Since this is fundamentally a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through common experience, each actor seems elevated by their role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a wide range to interpret, and her story of a boy who once loved her not only Gabriel Conroy, but also the public. <br /> <br /> When I think of Anjelica Huston, it's the transformation she makes in this film; and when I think of his father, it is this film that I remember first.
