Unlike the many who have published here, I am not a cinema expert. I came across this movie by accident (browsing channel) and could not navigate. This is a truly incredible film, worthy of all the praise that the critics and those on this site have piled up. The actors are fantastic. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her boyfriend Boris is sweet and patriotic. One cannot help but feel the exasperation and pain of Boris's father as he scolds his son for such nonsense as a volunteer to serve in the great war. <br /> <br /> Others have synthesized the film so well, so I'll mention just a couple of scenes that moved me more. When Boris's brother reveals to his family that he has broken faith with his brother and "must marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (although her part in infidelity may have come through rape). You fear that the rest of the film will correct this mistake by visiting only the destruction on Tatiana and her brother, or worse, show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent in the decadence of smoking. Since this is not "existential French cinema", the latter does not happen. Luckily! <br /> <br /> Another scene that fills your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier who was rescued by Boris returns to report to Boris's father about the death of his son. Inadvertently communicates the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sadness of this scene ... However, Tatiana finds a straw to grab and hopes that Boris will return home. The musician has actually never seen Boris buried, after all. <br /> <br /> I will not mention any more scenes, but I want to note that the touches of Soviet political correctness have by no means diminished the film. Boris's brother reveals himself as the pianist playing the anti-Soviet fanatic that someone who steals his brother's future wife should be. No doubt he gets at least one "tenner" at the end of the film! The ending, when Tatiana finally learns for sure that Boris is dead, still manages to end with joy and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and the catharsis that must have crossed the theater when the survivors of that war, with their own losses in the head, saw this film for the first time. <br /> <br /> Incredible. Go see it.
