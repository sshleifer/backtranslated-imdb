Definitely a "must see" for all fans of film noir. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a refined script and a clear and sharp direction, a leading cast joins and functions as a well-oiled watch to produce a psychological crackerjack thriller. <br /> <br /> The wonderful characterizations articulate the powerful message of the film of racial and religious tolerance. It is difficult and almost unfair to identify a particular performance because there is no weak link in the whole company, but Robert Ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is really cold. <br /> <br /> Making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. Now, all these years later, at a time when contemporary films are dominated by a ridiculous abundance of vulgar language, bare breasts, poor acting and deafening soundtracks, it is refreshing to return to the basics of quality film production with a visual treatment as "Crossfire". <br /> <br /> Another low-cost gem from the Hollywood archives.
