Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has cerebral palsy and lives a quiet and boring life at Carrigmore Residential Home. When a newcomer home, Rory (McAvoy), befriends him, he continues to show Michael how to overcome disability. Despite, or perhaps due to Rory's crippling disability (unable to move everyone but his head and a few figures on his hand), Rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious. His affection for peace and reserve to Michael is spectacular, and soon the two leave the nursing home to create lives in the outside world, where they recruit Siobhan (Romola Garai) for help. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the gems of the year! Much like last year in America, the film goes from being extremely funny, to distressing, moving, shocking and truly moving without once sounding sweet and sugary. Knowing exactly where to pull the strings of the heart, and where to simply let the story, and the characters, do their thing, O'Donnell made a wonderful film that tells us to look beyond the surface and see what's inside. /> <br /> The real strengths of the film come from the main actors. Their characters are so convincing that you really believe you are disabled. To continue to transmit humor and pain on top of the already great performances is surprising. The two seem really close friends and, while their story unfolds, you are completely interested. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the best examples of films this year, telling a very relevant story in a simple way. If this movie fails to touch your heart, then you have to hold pure ice inside.
