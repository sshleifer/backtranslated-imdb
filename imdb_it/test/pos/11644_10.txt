I saw this film many years ago and never left my list of the best films of all time ever made. When I saw it for the first time, I was just starting what has become a passion for justice for life. He gave an interesting perspective on the death penalty and also gave me some things to think about. <br /> <br /> When you have a cast like this, you are right to assume that it will be nothing short of fabulous. This is, by far, the best role I've ever seen playing Sean Penn (along with I am Sam). It reveals the role, it doesn't fascinate his actions while he does it. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the film that I think was very important. Until the end, he doesn't try to be seen as anything more than he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past, but continues to apologize. He ends up being able to redeem his sense of self-worth as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can through the help of Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean. His character taught me goodwill towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was also first rate. I was surprised to see a small cameo of Jack Black in this movie given the funny man he became today! I loved this film both for personal reasons and because it was a work of film art. And, in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the film is very far away, the book did.
