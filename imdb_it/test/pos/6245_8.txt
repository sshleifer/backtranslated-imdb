"Tourist Trap" is a strange thriller released in the 70s, it is composed of 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott), which stumbles upon the museum of a cloesd SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a curious and mysterious museum along the way. This gold mine of decaying but strangely lived mannequins is run by Slausen (Chuck Conners), an eccentric, but apparently harmless. Slausen has a warning for young people: Stay away from Davey, the lonely and disturbed brother of Slausen. <br /> <br /> The curiosity of young people gets the best of them and they go to the discovery. The trap was born! Among flying objects, slamming doors, scarves that strangle themselves, enhanced by a hidden force, the trap slowly approaches the group. The "Creature" Davey and his army of murderous dummies do the quick and brutal work of friends, until only one is left. <br /> <br /> Even if it is not a movie Slasher "Tourist Trap" still contains elements of slasher movies such as the chase and stalking scenes and the fact that the killer wears a mask. <br /> <br /> The killer's seemingly telekinetic abilities to lock bolts and animate wax mannequins are used to great effect. Perhaps the scariest thing about this movie is the mannequins, which are scary enough to start with, but they're a bit spooky here. The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, obviously a scarce budget. These wax figures are shamelessly plastic mannequins, but this only serves to become even more disturbing when their eyes move with an incredible human. The acting is actually quite good, Chuck Conners gives a well rounded and disturbing performance while Mr. Slausen, Jocelyn Jones is as big as the female lead.
