This is a fantastic movie! The characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they weren't real people. Being from the South, I thought Judith Ivey's character was particularly real, and like everyone else mentioned, she does an exceptional acting job. The characters are not beautiful and do not resemble the average Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem much more natural and real. <br /> <br /> A reviewer said that the main character, Alice, had no good reason to run away from home, which is true - she had no moral or justifiable reason to escape, how to escape from child abuse, etc. . I thought she was simply sick of lifeless jobs in a working class and wanted to escape to Florida where her friend lived the attractive and privileged life of a university student in Miami. The actress shows Alice's confusion, uncertainty and the turning point towards the decision and the will to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in seemingly untapped situations, causing her to panic, acting and seeking help. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the grainy film style put me in trouble and made me think it was a very low budget or a home-made movie, but in reality it is very well done. The quality of the original film really makes you feel like you're there with the characters, a part of their trip in a camper van across the country. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, even if I don't understand all the descriptions as a story of his age. It is rather vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad at the end.
