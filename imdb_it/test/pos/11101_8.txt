John Schelesinger's career as a director was extraordinary. We saw this movie when it first came out, but I wanted to see it again when it appeared recently on the cable. The film looks faded, as we look at it today, but it's still interesting for the intense performances of the two main ones. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, please don't read further. <br /> <br /> Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends who came from upper-middle class backgrounds. Chris went to a seminar to be a priest, but he gives up. Daulton has become a small user and drug dealer. The two lives seem to run parallel while the couple is involved in an illegal activity that will demonstrate their myopia. Indeed, it shows how both young people miscalculate in their attempt to deceive the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two, in a sense, were so naive in thinking they could attract something bigger, and the better equipped people couldn't even imagine they could do it. <br /> <br /> Chris's motivation is legitimate, as he feels outraged at discovering the sly role of the agency he works for in dealing with other nations, in this case Australia, something he finds by mere coincidence . When he involves Daulton, we know that the whole thing is doomed because no one in the drug, as it is, will ever be equal to anything. In reality, Chris and Daulton had no idea of ​​the extent of what they were trying to do, or its consequences. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton was in this period of his career, an actor who went to the seats. He had shown he had talent with his work in other films, so it was a natural choice for Mr. Schlesinger to select him, a choice that pays well. Sean Penn, was also a young actor who showed intensity, as he had never seen before. In fact, sometimes, Mr. Penn reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum being worked on. The contribution of both actors to the film is incredible. One cannot think who could have interpreted this duo but them. <br /> <br /> "The hawk and the snowman", although not up to the rest of John Schlesinger's great films, is an interesting aspect of our not-too-distant past.
