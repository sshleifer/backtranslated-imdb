It carries the tone of the voice that tells the book in the jungle of Vietnam and in the wild looks of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity that surrounds Colonel Kurtz (I don't say Marlon Brando because after seeing the documentary, "Hearts of Darkness" I'm skeptical about how much credit Brando owes to that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is dark and dramatic without being too overbearing: "Everyone gets what he wants, I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one, they sent him with room service". It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example of this is Hopper's indulgence in aphoristic madness, generously generating lines written by T.S. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling in his stone monologues: "I mean, the man is a genius sometimes he walks beside you without even saying a word, and sometimes he takes you by the collar and tells you" did you know? 'if' is the average word in 'life' ?? if you can keep your head while everything around you is losing their "and then" I mean he is a wise man, he is a great man; I should have been a pair of torn claws running across the floors of silent seas "(The first is Kipling, the second is Eliot.
