I thought this movie was pretty good. He was on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at three in the morning one night, and his unusual humor kept me up to five. Kelly performs beautifully in this role, especially with her grandmother (whose joke almost made me laugh from my seat). The main actress was fine, but her father managed to keep her character isolated from the conflict and kept her mood. If you like a good old movie, I recommend it. Unlike the other comment, I like Gene Kelly. He was the perfect main actor for many of the early musicals and I think that in this role, he exudes his charisma. A disadvantage is that the dance scenes get a little lengthy, but if you can overcome them, you're in the clear.
