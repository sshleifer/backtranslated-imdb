This bewildering and angry film is against not only the war during which it was made, but the whole war. He doesn't care what war it is. It could be the most emotionally engaging experience I've ever had with Ingmar Bergman's work. There are no sides to the two main characters in this drama that has an impact, which does not affect a point in any ceremonial symbolism as usual of Bergman, but clearly shows the people and their lives and exercises that Bergman has already shown to understand about reaction of a person to a film. <br /> <br /> His regular composers Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play a couple of internalizing but quarreling spouses who were once orchestra musicians. Now they live on a seasoned farm on an island. Part of the constructive frustration that we share with these two people comes in the detail that nothing in their home seems to work. They are not even intellectual prisoners. They are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less resigned life and is essentially apolitical; they only have the wind of distant voices of a war that has lasted forever. Ullmann worries about the danger to their lives and his desire to have children. Her husband, Von Sydow, shrugs to get the war through. Their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house, the killing of a paratrooper aviator, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition and finally their capture by what appears to be the part local, but loyalty has long been fragmented. <br /> <br /> They are sent back to their home, witnessed free destruction and suffer the vengeful consequences of a marriage so unfortunately wary. This, one of my favorite Bergman best efforts, is a study of a couple shaken by their safe and self-unaware lives and violated by manipulative despair, testing them both to reveal who they really are. Compassion is lacking to some degree, too selfish and restless to have patience for its capricious failures in crying. His repressed emotional problems led to the repression of the initiative and the excitement that attracted them from the beginning. The immense last twenty minutes, sporadically interrupted by the images of the overwhelming gray sky, are among the closest to the true emotions that Bergman has ever filmed. <br /> <br /> All systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this essential and portrayed downbeat. The fundamentally clear personalities of the characters of Ullmann and Von Sydow are thrown into the degenerate world of the war because they are accused of being "sympathizers", but the film, shot on the small Faro island of Bergman, Faro, does not provide any information on where or when it is set, who are the two sides and what they are fighting for. For a civilian not involved trapped, the knowledge base is likely to be quite similar. <br /> <br /> Ullmann and Von Sydow are not sympathetic to the apparent enemy, but are partisans for those who apparently are on their side. This reactive allegory of 1968 may concern ordinary non-combatant citizens of Iraq, Kosovo, or Vietnam, or Israel, or Palestine, or ...
