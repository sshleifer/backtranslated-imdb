Watching some sequences (err, the whole 1/3 of the film dedicated to the battle on the ice) in Alexander Nevsy, a film directed by the Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (co-directed by Dmitri Vasilyev in his only significant credit), gave me made to understand how much he really has to go to directing, at least on a scale like this. If I were a member of an award group at the time of this film's release, I'd probably give Eisenstein the posthumous award of the year as a director. It's such a crazy cinematic stroke of mind that it pulls out some things that were dragged into the film, even if for someone like this director after he came out of his best work - Battleship Potemkin and October - it could have been something he scoffed at the beginning. But in the midst of a film that is sometimes a bit frustrating about how small grays enter the black and white topic, it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later. Fans of the Lord of the Rings, meet the film's grandfather, so to speak. <br /> <br /> To say that something is a piece of propaganda already gives a connotation to it, and often a bad one. It is something that has a full message and a point of view. It's still a matter of heated debate (see the swarms of arguments on Moore's films for demonstration), whether great art can come out of something that is point blank to make the audience resonate in a specific way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. At the time it was approaching World War II and Russia once again faced the "German invaders", and it is interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film, as a call for the Russians never to forget a crucial piece of the their history. The end result turns out to be something that is actually slightly common from seeing Battleship and October, however; if nothing else happens through these films, it is that Eisenstein is more concerned with how the image and the content can finitely join the viewer, that the style can completely envelop the viewer without failing. In those terms Alexander Nevsky is fearless. <br /> <br /> But even with the general idea of ​​"great Russia, bad Germans", there are some small moments where things are made a little less severe, a little less severe to these ideals. For example, when we first see the Germans in Privka, they are not a faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind intent to conquer (not that they are not ready to take everything they can). They too have their national pride, which would be nothing less for them to go on with whatever their Christian-led teachers give them. At the very least, the evil of the photo has a face, however kept at a low minimum for the most prevalent side to kick. There is also a brief scene, before the patrol battle, where the Russian troupe has a joke that is said and laughed, and adds a little more depth otherwise there may be a small precious one. Because most of the time in Alexander Nevsky, with his battle songs full of war pride, there are no complexities for the characters, especially Nevsky himself (interpreted in an ultra-heroic way, only at the beginning, of Nikolai Cherkasov) that perhaps it must be in this way in Eistenstein's intention to have him as the only infallible force with which to reckon in the story. After all, looking for a naturalism in an Eisenstein film is like trying to find non-Kosher pig's feet in a deli. <br /> <br /> But the real reason to see the image is not acting, however, but for the appearance of the film, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that Eisenstein exposes. On an epic scale he is as ambitious as his films of the 1920s, with a series of extras not only in the main battle scenes but also in the city scenes of the hundreds of people passing by. In fact, I would say that any director who works in Hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some sort of great epic, especially war, would do very well to take a look at this film, even if only with the sound turned off. It's even better if it's thought of as a silent film, with visual traits accentuated in a fantastic way sometimes. An entire month could be spent analyzing the battle on the ice, as it begins with distant German soldiers and then coming forward as insects, and then as Eisenstein cross-cuts between close-ups of the fighting actors and then with cannon shots and with modifications accelerated. And, of course, the power of music cannot be discarded, Sergei Prokofiev offers one of the great successes of any epic work. All the while the director's editing keeps our eyes on the move with this frantic fast-paced action. If this were just a short film, he would definitely be ranked with the big boys, very similar to the Odessa stair sequence. <br /> <br /> If I had found it a little less completely magnificent, it would be because of the defects that come from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than to the sound. While I still have to see Ivan the Terrible, my only negative criticism would be his direction of the actors, which is really as wide as possible, with his melodrama at such a high level that it is disconcerting (the sub-plot of the two soldiers who compete for Olga they are the best example I can think of). But even this considered, Alexander Nevsky on the whole is too extraordinary to ignore, and increases the involvement in the action and in the making of the film to a level that still today puts a point of reference for the films to try to be up to.
