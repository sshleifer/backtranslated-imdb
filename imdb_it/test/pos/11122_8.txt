Fame is one of the best films I've seen on The Performing Arts. Music and acting are excellent. The screenplay and set design are also excellent. My favorite part is when all the students start dancing and making music in the canteen. I can watch this movie any number of times and I never get bored. I give him 8 1/2 out of 10.
