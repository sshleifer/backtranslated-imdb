I liked this movie. I'm not a big fan of horror movies so I couldn't comment on the similarities between this and other films of this genre, but I found this film rather catchy. the plot, although a bit obvious, had some really scary / tense moments and the acting (in particular the female lead role) wasn't bad anyway <br /> <br /> Overall I'm a bit surprised low rating obtained from this film. I watch a lot of movies (working in a video store tends to help) and this really isn't as bad as people seem to think. I have some criticism though. The last call from the policeman was terrible, almost exaggerated, the dead girl in the bathroom seemed to have some sleep (probably from the amount of tequila she was talking about drank) and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled in me I hope that in the end they were killed <br /> <br /> I hope this helps some people
