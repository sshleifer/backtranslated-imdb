seen this film and totally loved, the characters are fantastic. it's definitely my kind of movie that you don't get bored in this movie, I love independent films, they are much more rewarding. my husband and I really enjoyed Jay's style. If you are an open minded person who likes to think about making movies and love the conversation after it's over, you'll love this movie. it is certainly a stimulating thought. The film will definitely take a step forward, but who cares will probably not go to see this movie. it's amazing to see the characters evolve. Jay Floyd has really captured both sides of the table. Applause Applause Jay I hope you are working on another film.
