I took it as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was another wise, forgettable simply of the bad grouping of films. <br /> <br /> A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent but simple animation, this is simply the story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming and touching. A little corner of paradise for cat lovers, romantics and anyone else you appreciate the beauty of simplicity. If it's in your city, watch it. This short is worth the admission price.
