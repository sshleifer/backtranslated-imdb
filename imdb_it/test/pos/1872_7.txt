I firmly believe that a film, a television series or any other art form must and are fully appreciated once the time factor - when written, produced or conceived - must be taken into account. <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one of these series. I remember watching it in the mid-80s on TV and re-running through video cassette libraries in the early 1990s. and laughing out loud and being dependent on it. This made me buy the DVD set of the complete series and the surprise of surprises: the comedy and the moments of the good days simply fell flat. Even the famous "30 years of experience ka" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "Sofa cum bed" did not invoke the kind of joy I thought. The time factor: for the 1980s, this was the showstopper. The main event. The mother of all television comedies. And it worked during age and time! Perhaps the same cannot be said at the moment, but nevertheless, watching the DVD brought back good memories. <br /> <br /> I hope the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat have been longer. Satish Shah was incredibly good as the heart of the show, with the equally effective supporting cast of Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and the Bengali neighbors. Rakesh Bedi hams in everything. <br /> <br /> All in all, an experience that will bring back memories to those who saw it during the first few times, may not appeal to younger spectators or first-time spectators!
