This film is a fascinating drama about making a film. The actor and the actress can't really put up with it, but we build on a scene where they have to have sex - her for the first time, for screenplay. The actress shows small emotions inside or outside the camera in the plot, apart from the fact that she freezes in the first scenes on a beach. The actor is absorbed and increasingly challenges the director's direction, Jeanne. I couldn't help but feel attracted by the drama of "how could these two act ACT in a sex scene?" That drama itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida is not adorable and worth seeing naked! However, there is a rather young stage hand that walks through some scenes as an extra. I think it's you on the far left of one of the images (2 of 9) here on IMDb. I don't even know if this girl is credited, but when she walks (fully dressed of course) with confident indifference to her short blonde hair - SHE is Sexy! WHO IS THIS GIRL???
