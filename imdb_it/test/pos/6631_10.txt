I should not be more surprised when critics lack the most obvious things in works of art, because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature. That said, the simplistic idea that Ingmar Bergman Shame's (or Skammen's) great 1968 film is just an anti-war film hurts the reputation of this very complex and very nuanced film. Compared to its more film-like predecessors showoffy, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame is apparently a more classic film, in terms of fiction. But the key word is apparently, because while lacking Persona's psychologizing pop skill and the striking horror movie of Hour Of The Wolf, it is one of the best films ever made about war - and not as an anti-war film, nor a movies for war. As such, he must classify Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films, as well as one of his best screenplays, if not the best. <br /> <br /> Although apparently a more psychologically outward film than the films that preceded it, it really says much more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod to the notorious American spies, which many European intellectuals considered innocent), two musicians who played for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out, and retired to live on a small piece of land on an island, happy to work in a greenhouse. The country they live in is unnamed, as is the island they live in, even though the film was shot on the small island of Bergman, in Farö, just outside the northern part of the Swedish island of Göttland. It seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps engaged in a civil war with the rebels of another province. All this is left deliberately confused, since this war intends to symbolize all wars. This is reinforced by the fact that the film begins with a series of war citations on screen, while the credits come out. These include quotes from Hitler to the American military figures of the Vietnam era. After the first scenes that describe the prosaic nature of their rural life, and then the advent of war, where even the old men are enlisted, an air attack devastates the land of the Rosenbergs, while enemy jets fly up, dropping the bombs and what appears to be chemical Weapons of an Orange agent like nature. A plane is hit and a paratrooper jumps out and ends up hanging on a tree. Jan, who starts the film as a coward coward, refuses to go and help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and they discover that the pilot was hit. It appears to be, in fact, part of the invading force, or perhaps rebellious. A group of government soldiers soon stop by their house and ask questions about the dead pilot, so they advise the couple to leave their home, given that the invaders are close? there are misinterpretations of the film on a micro level, like that of Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provides the film's commentary on the film's DVD. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is a Quisling, who collaborated with the Invaders. But this is clearly and patently wrong, because Jacobi is with the original fascist government. As proof, first of all, the invaders are repulsed after invading the land of the Rosenbergs and shooting their agitprop interview. We know this because the government that subsequently interrogates them about the false interview, and the words put in the mouth of Eva, see the film as an alleged proof of their betrayal, and Jacobi is clearly working with them, the statesmen of the Big Brother fascist. Secondly, Jacobi has the task of deciding which of the citizens are sent to the concentration camps, to collaborate with the invaders, and the Rosenbergs, again, are among those saved. Thirdly, in her seduction of Eve, Jacobi tells her that her son is on leave from the army, and clearly, if he were an Invader, he would not speak so happily about the son who serves the state. Furthermore, rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official permits. Finally, is Filip clearly with the rebels, or Invaders, of the Organization, and why should he kill a colleague? <br /> <br /> That Gervais and other critics are so obviously and readily misinterpret and slowly lose such a key and the strength of this film calls into question their ability to discern all aspects of all the films of Bergman. This is a wonderful and grandiose film and very high in Berman's canon, but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understood his complex message, opting instead for the lazy, easy economic claim of his being simply against the war , and a rather simple film compared to its two most striking predecessors. And this, in the long run, is the real shame of Shame.
