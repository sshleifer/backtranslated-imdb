It started out strange, the medium was strange, and the ending was strange, but I really enjoyed it very much. A modern version of Homer's Odyessy, but it's really irrelevant. Interesting story and casting. Clooney was great and I applaud him for taking on such an advertising role, so different from anything he did or ever will do again. A lot of surprise stars - because it's not Holly Hunter anymore. Do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected movie.
