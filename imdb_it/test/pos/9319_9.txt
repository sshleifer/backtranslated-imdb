Yes, I give it to 10 because I compare it not only to others of its kind, but also to the dreck that is bombarded daily by what is ridiculously called the "popular culture" of today. Apart from that, the film is beautifully cast, as has been stated elsewhere, and gives us a pretty good look at the popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries. No small coincidence is that many of the plays performed by Olcott involved a similar plot: the boy meets the girl, someone objects (usually the father or some authority figure) the boy fights, the boy wins the girl. At the time it was known as "Chauncey Olcott Act". No coincidence that John Ford has also directed one. He called it, "The Quiet Man". And, "My Wild Irish Rose" is in itself an "act of Chauncey Olcott". Great things, isn't it? However, great songs, great things. Have a good time. <br /> <br /> PS - After watching the movie I'd like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found an objection that he had left "Mauvorneen" because of the madness (replaced, as in the film, by Chauncey Olcott) and died in an asylum several years later. But he had apparently been a very large star in his own right, who wrote songs and plays and wrote works for him. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know more?
