I just saw it on the Hallmark canal. I was surprised by John Denver! This film was full of clichés, but that's to be expected (a movie for Christmas TV - come on!). Acting is as good as any other film from the 1980s. The story is, as I said before, predictable and cliché, but still good. If you are looking for a Christmas movie to camp, it will definitely scratch your itch. <br /> <br /> I was also happy when I heard that it took place in Georgetown, Colorado. It's a real mountain town west of Denver. Very cool as this is my home region. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of John Denver (I've always found him very nice) but he was a decent actor. He is as good as the good old boy as he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it then. I'm sure it will be back in 2007.
