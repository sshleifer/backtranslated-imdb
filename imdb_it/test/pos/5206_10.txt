Simply the best and most realistic WWII movie I've ever seen. Not only because German soldiers speak of Russian and German soldiers speak Russian (no English in a German or Russian dialect) because of the realistic decor in which the film was shot. The acting is exceptional. No Hollywood feeling, not even a love story ... Stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrific battles during the war, and in that context there is no place for romantic feelings or scenes. What you get is a movie that will make you shiver and that has one of the best unhappy endings that a movie can have.
