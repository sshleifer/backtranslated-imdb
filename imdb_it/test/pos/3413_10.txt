Of all the seasons and episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, after seeing all the fantastic, shocking and stimulating stories, this is at the top. Quite right. This story, called THE HUNT, is on top of the large number of the best screenplays in television history. <br /> <br /> True, there are no interplanetary space flights, no unexplainable crack over time. There is no living nightmare, no sudden change of setting. It seems that there is nothing extraordinary for our protagonist. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, played by veteran actor Arthur Hunnicut, leaves his hut in the hills, accompanied by his faithful hound, to hunt the raccoon. Because the raccoon is a hunt for mainly nocturnal animals, it is in the moonlight. <br /> <br /> The man and the dog soon meet a large raccoon, who jumps on the back of the dog and tries to drown the dog in a pond. The man jumps to help his dog. There is a sort of blackout, after which the couple can be seen on the shore, in a lying position, almost asleep. <br /> <br /> Calling your dog by name, (Rip, I think) the old part to go home. When he arrives, he finds his wife crying and does not respond to his conversation. He also observes the visitors who come and go to his home, who pay tributes and give the words to console his wife. <br /> <br /> They still seem perplexed by the strange reception and by the turn of the Home Cabin, the Man and the Rip take flight on a long walk along the road, where he looks aloud that he could not remember a fence so long in those parts. Eventually a rather big guy arrives, dressed similarly to his suit, hat, work shirt. They are at a gate, which leads to an area where a sack of smoke is rising freely. The Guardian of the Gate is too greedy in his persuasive tone in trying to get the man in. Rip sounds sorry. The Gate Man tells the Old Man that he could come in, but the dog should stay outside, offering to watch the animal for him. The man will not have any and the two will continue along the path. <br /> <br /> After a bit more trekking they come across a second controlled entrance where the Gate Keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him. When the Old tells what happened along the way, telling him how the guy from the other door tried to separate the Man and the dog, and added: "Without dogs allowed, that must be one hell of a place!" The 2nd gate keeper said he was right! "That's exactly what it is!" <br /> <br /> Our family had lost our 1st Dog, Lady-a mixed workshop, in October 1981. About 6 months later, as good luck, his wife (Deanna) and I along with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) watched this episode on TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, for us it was all perfectly logical. <br /> <br /> We are certain that anyone who has had that relationship with a family dog ​​would agree. The episode still brings a condition of tearing to this 60-year-old writer.
