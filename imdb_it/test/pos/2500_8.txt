This film was a sweet and sad romantic comedy, just the kind of film I usually don't like, but that was nice enough to get me interested. It was really fun in a moment (probably because I liked it) and then just as serious in the next. Besides, Ellen was there and I always had a thing for her. <br /> <br /> Basically, the owner of a book store, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old sofas in her store. She thinks it's for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. It is almost closed off from the world, so it really throws it for a ride. In the end, almost everyone who is connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals that create really fun moments. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm usually not one for this kind of film, but I'm really hurt enjoying it and I highly recommend it.
