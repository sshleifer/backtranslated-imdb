The Lone Ranger & Tonto has decided to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what initially appears to be no apparent reason ... until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the chief Indian Tomache that each man owned a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts that we will later learn combined will provide the mind behind the hooded raiders with a map of a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on them? Is there really a lost city of gold somewhere on the homeland? <br /> <br /> Looking at this, I kept knowing what was going to happen in advance and it all seemed very familiar to me until I realized that I saw exactly this same movie when I was a kid. they were inundated and I remembered spending a fun time as a child enjoying this with a group of my friends. As an adult, however, the plot is quite predictable, but you know, although not entirely similar to that of the 1956 film, it remains very fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels while Tonto steals a lot of this movie because he is probably in more action scenes than the Lone Ranger. There are some very familiar faces here including Douglas Kennedy as Ross Brady, head of the Hooded Raiders band, Charles Watts as a bigoted sheriff and Ralph Moody as a kind father.
