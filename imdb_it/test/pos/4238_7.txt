This is a 100% improvement compared to the waste of a third movie and is a great fun. This is a John Hughes film that meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly had played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes, once again, really makes this movie shine. In reality they are the only positive parts of the film. I was rather bored with the scenes of Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable. It is as if they were thrown there like a sidecack and someone to save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were fantastic to watch and I really liked black humor. I thought the film stood out more. If you want a nice time, make sure you take a look at it. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
