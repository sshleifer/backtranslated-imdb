To speak in a relative way, if we were only to see "Pixote" by Hector Babenco (1981, Brazil, pronounced "pi-shot"), after having seen a good number of films dealing with street children, young delinquents , children in distress ("The 400 shots" by Truffaut, "Los Olvidados" by Bunuel, "Shoeshine" by De Sica, "Salaam, Bombay!" By Nair, "Mouchette" by Bresson, "Leaf on a Pillow" by Nugroho , etc.), It could be feared that the situation of the child portrayed in the film may not interest anyone anymore, having been "de-synthesized" already after passing through the exciting rollercoaster ride set in motion by the previously mentioned films. <br /> <br />, it will not be so. Because Babenco tells his film in such a simple way ("without art", as a film critic said, in a positive light) and that his central child actor, Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years old at that time and a boy from street himself), gives a performance without frills, wound, raw in its simplicity (that hardened face, those lonely and eager eyes) that it is difficult not to be pierced in any way. (Such a feeling can reach such high realism when it is learned that the child had only lived a short life, having been involved in street crime after the film and subsequently murdered.) <br /> <br /> In the first semester of the film, Pixote and his fellow travelers and criminals spend their time in a repressive state reform school, where brutalization and humiliation, rape and murder, are the norm and culture, where they are forced to confess their "crimes" , on the weak notion that under Brazilian law, underage criminals are not "punishable" for their crimes. For these boys, the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation provided by these allegedly well-intentioned authorities. Within the walls of this supposed protective structure, these young souls will soon discover that the love and care of parental figures are not even remotely present, except to a worse degree. <br /> <br /> (For Pixote, the only form of escape comes from the swelling of the grass and from the glue, secretly smuggled into the reformatory.) <br /> <br /> When the children launch into a "small-scale" revolt to finally express and then satisfy their collective desire to return to the outside world - their "home" - the intensity and the form are such that one cannot avoid thinking about the revolt of the pupils in the influential "Zero for Conduct" by Jean Vigo. It is only that in "Pixote", the "revolt" is made to appear at the level of the gutter. <br /> <br /> Once Pixote and his small group have returned to the streets (the second half of the film), they engage robbery, exploitation of pies and drug dealing to defend themselves, along which they meet Sueli, a battered but gentle prostitute. Sueli gladly welcomes the four lost souls, so as to allow his clients to be robbed by them and that provides more than maternal care (at least to one of the children). <br /> <br /> I thought that street kids finally found the only person who could provide them with the love and warmth that was seriously lacking in their lives. But however dubious the freedom that these children believe the streets are providing, this rediscovered "mother figure" can only remain forever. <br /> <br /> Jealousy, quarrels, differences and murder have only driven the boys away - and forever. And during that defining scene in which Pixote, driven by circumstance, gets to shoot not only Sueli's arrogant American client, but also his fellow traveler Ditto (more than a son at Sueli), then literally returns to "childhood ", As he sucks from the disoriented woman's right breast, right there and then materializes his persistent desire for parental affection, the image itself both sad and disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is how Sueli, in a probable return to his "senses", painfully pushes Pixote back from his "nourishing" position and rejects him, forever. Thus, in a moment of calm, Pixote, with that young man's face and those sullen eyes (not entirely dissimilar, even if in a different context, than the young boy in "Come and see" by Elem Klimov), gets up, he puts on his coat and takes the pistol (yes, a gun!), and starts for nothing, walking along the train tracks and in the morning light that is just starting to show. With that scene, Babenco could simply pay homage (among many other tributes found in different movies!) To the final iconoclastic scene of Truffaut "The 400 Blows". <br /> <br /> But while we knew what became of Antoine Doinel three years later in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (as well as in three other films in the following years), we are left struggling with the darkness for what we wait for Pixote after it finally disappears from the last frame, which is the last time we will see this street child in real life (despite the fate that actually hit him in the end). <br /> <br /> "Pixote" may not be nearly as whimsical as "The 400 Blows" or hallucinatory as "Los Olvidados", but it still stands out among theme films and similar textures for its simple and raw power.
