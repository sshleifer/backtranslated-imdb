This film is my favorite comedy of all time and I've seen a lot of comedies. First of all, I shouldn't have this movie. Just a storyboard. The dialogue is written almost completely by the actors. This makes this film absolutely hsyterical. The cast is one of the best comic ensembles you've ever seen. The story is about the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of the competitors in them. Photographer Posey shines and is absolutely fantastic! This is one of those films that laugh out of the absolute pathetic of the characters. ***** / *****
