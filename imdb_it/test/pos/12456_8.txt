Although he does not approach the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs than, for example, Johnny Wiesmuller's films have had a particular, and fun, bent for history. It's a well-made Tarzan movie. Beautiful landscapes, good photography, workable continuity and a cry Tarzan that echoes the one described by Burroughs. The players behave well. The only negative points I found were, I think, related. It moves slowly in some places. That slow movement? Makes this image long. It could have been 15 to 20 minutes easier, which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot and the development of the character. But the rest of the film works well enough to take him on these two difficult points and leave the viewer satisfied with the film. Short version of all the above ... It is a very good film Tarzan.
