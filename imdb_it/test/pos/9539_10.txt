This is a film I love more than anyone else. I try to revisit the main film locations of Oakworth and Oxenhope whenever I can, which helps to re-establish those magical qualities that this film seems to uniquely embody - recalling a gentler and more polite age, with its unexpressed claims that people really do care, that family life is not just another available one, and that life is really worth life (although sometimes, we can doubt it). In short, a film that soon brings tears to my eyes, perhaps aided by profoundly evocative music - some melodies are casual (like Perks' melody, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the moving melody when the family for the first time away for Yorkshire not knowing what awaits us, and the disturbing melody played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden changes of luck. <br /> <br /> This is as much film for adults as it is for children, which appeals to the eternal child in all of us - a key that effortlessly reactivates those profound and seemingly lost values ​​and feelings buried within us, which are normally swept away by the demands of modern day life. This is a film about the goodness and basic human decency in which we viewers are left to do with it what we want, and there are welcome touches of humor sometimes added for good measure, like the arrival of the aunt or, in another earthy level, the bedroom scene for Perks' birthday - "All right Bert - how's your birthday!" I have to know every scene, every line of this film, yet so great is the magic that every time I look, it's like opening a box of delicacies for the first time, savoring every moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes .. .. well, very different. As Peter says in the film: "it's perfect - more perfect than you know". And so it is !!!
