If there were two parts in which the physically very high and charismatic actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was born, like a Frenchman, to play, he must surely have been Cyrano de Bergerac and the speaker Georges Danton. Here the film dominates both through the width of its shoulders and the power of its voice; his charisma bears the part although it is clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as the rest of them. Danton celebrates while the people of Paris die of hunger ... but he is the only man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the feared Public Security Committee in the name of "freedom", and is presented as the hero of the film - despite the fact that the source plays practically idolizes his opponent Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who know the characters of the story, there is interest in identifying the minor parts: the frog-faced Tallien, Couthon the cripple, Fouquier-Tinville, the court attorney, the fugitive -Fairly St-Just, the epic painter David. But the script doesn't make much sense in this sense; the names often arrive late if minor characters are identified and there is no Hollywood-style 'info-dump' to ensure that the public can place the events in their historical context. The film takes for granted that you know what happened before and what will happen next - sometimes it takes too much for granted, like when it is based on a thorough knowledge of the dates to give the blow to the fact that Robespierre has followed Danton shortly on the scaffold. <br /> <br /> Considered as a movie, it is not entirely satisfactory as it goes towards the end. The structure of the plot leads to a great confrontation between the protagonists in the classroom or a dramatic climax to the process, which, thanks to history, never really happens. Things vanish: there is no uprising, there is no reverse of tyranny, there is no assumption of power by the victor, there is no triumph anywhere. It may be historically accurate, but it is not entirely satisfactory as a result of a cinematic scenario: it seems a strange place to stop. As others have commented, it would have been more logical to take events until the end of the Terror and show the fall of Robespierre in apposition.
