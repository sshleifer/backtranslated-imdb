A great Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings that proves once again that it could really set off a storm. <br /> <br /> This time he is a defense officer engaged in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed in the factory. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in Cummings as the plot thickens and is chased from California to New York <br /> <br /> There is a diabolical plot of a group of rich 5 columnists to destroy from within. Hitchcock was known for playing the upper part of the society involved in chaos in his long career as a director. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the film implodes right at the end. While we see what happens to the boy who killed Cummings' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the top of society.
