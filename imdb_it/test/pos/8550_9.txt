This is a finely made film with moving sequences, humor and, above all, a love story. Anthony Quinn is wonderfully chosen and after seeing many of his films, this must be classified as one of his best performances, besides Zorba. The film really makes you wonder if it is shot in Romania, which apparently is not the case. It is safe to deceive even the Romanian natives, with its authentic landscape, its customs and its ways of life. According to IMDb it is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The plot is compelling, it makes you want to watch the whole finished movie, to see if you missed something. He pushed me to do research to find out if it's a truth-based movie, but to my great disappointment, it's a fiction-based novel based on the movie. It seems a bit far-fetched to have really happened, but you never know ... The only problem with this film, is that it doesn't look like it plays Romanian actors, and it's a film about a Romanian character. There are probably many Romanian fill-ins at the beginning, but maybe not, it's shot elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least this is beautiful and dandy - overall a masterpiece in cinematography.
