Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, died and his relatives gathered for his funeral. Included in the funeral feast is the younger sister of Abernathie, Cora Galaccio. While no one in the family has seen Cora in at least 20 years, they all agree that Cora has always been a little different. So when Cora says Abemethie was murdered, most mock him as one of Cora's eccentricities. But someone is taking Cora seriously. The following day, Cora is found dead in her bed after being violently beaten. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It is up to Hercule Poirot to find a murderer. <br /> <br /> After the Funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire Poirot series. I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and, from what I remember, the film is true to Christie's original material as any of Poirot's episodes. The mystery is top notch with lots of clues, suspicions and false bows. And as I've already written, I always like a Christie story in which Hercule Poirot brings everyone together in a living room for the final revelation. It may be old-fashioned, but that's how I like it. Going beyond the plot, technically and artistically After the funeral he is a winner. Set, editing, direction and cinematography are as good as the ones you'll find in one of these movies. The acting is equally impressive. I have come to expect a pleasant performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he does not disappoint here. The rest of the cast is equally strong with Monica Dolan offering a particularly noteworthy performance. Apart from a small quirk with the speed with which the characters are introduced, I have no complaints. It's a good show all around.
