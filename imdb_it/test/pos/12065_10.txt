Fun show with lots of great stories, which reflects today's world as we know it, so funny that it literally stole my laughter for other shows. I laughed so much that I just found other unpleasant comedy shows. The unique confessions of each character are a great original technique that makes the show enjoyable and fun. You might think it's a media comedy about a family's hard life. This is what I thought at the beginning, but I discovered that it contains new and unique techniques that completely distinguish it from any other medium comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star. I hope this show has not been canceled.
