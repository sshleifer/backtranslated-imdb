When I saw the commercial for the first time, I thought "Oh, here we are. He did the high school musical, but he can't keep doing it, so now he makes appearances in other Disney shows." Personally, I love The Suite Life and I'm a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason, I'm not too excited about Zac Efron, even though all my friends think it's the best thing since Jesse McCartney. But it really annoys me. Anyway, I watched the show (taking a break from the English courses) and was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good all round, especially from the regular characters of The Suite Life, and Zac Efron wasn't as bad as I had anticipated. All in all, a pretty good show.
