* The fate of Al Capone <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb lands the "Gypsy" part in the TV remake <br /> <br /> are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. How else can I say, except I thought it was terribly terrible. Mannequin mannerisms, scarce reactionary acting (ie: that blank look, stoic while he is co-starring in the scene speaks) and a sung voice that most of the coaches of the voice would consider "mediocre". But is she extraordinarily beautiful and, after all, wasn't this the true gypsy character? Cashing in his looks because he didn't cut mustard in the talent department? <br /> <br /> For the rest ... Bette is fantastic. Whether or not she is playing herself or playing Mama Rose, it works both ways, and I for one thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as the drywall in the original. Peter Riegart in the role of "Herbie" is the perfect subtitle of Bette's exaggerated mother, and is the medium-temperature porridge between Midler's hot plate and Gibb's cold stone mush. Riegart is perfect. <br /> <br /> One last scream to the man responsible for the decades of Cher's jokes: Bob Mackie. The drag pairs would kill for the pomp and glamor on display here. Everything is coming with sequins and trinkets! <br /> <br />
