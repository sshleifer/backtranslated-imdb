Probably one of his lesser-known films, he suffers from the same lack of visibility of Salvador as it is actually one of his best. <br /> <br /> Written by and played by Eric Bogosian, Talk Radio tells the story of a radio telephonic host commentator who upsets the wrong kind of listener. The film is important, and has a lot to say about the issues of freedom of speech and how free it should be, and it can easily be said that it started as a theatrical performance. You know what happens to you before sitting down to watch it and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> There is not much to act, as Bogosian steals the film, wrote and is given permission to bark, I could not take my eyes off him and this was part of the charm of many listeners; the people who hated him did not go out if they lost something. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but a very good drama and, overall, a great film.
