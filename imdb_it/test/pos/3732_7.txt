WTF !! Does any of his books / films end in a happy ending? The notebook was good ... but sheesh, enough already with the depressing endings. I was told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable ... but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to arrive at a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life? We cannot - for a moment (an hour and a half) live indirectly through a film that ends with a happy note - which gives us hope for our future ??? <br /> <br /> Yes, wah. I know. But really, I think we need to prefigure films that end up like this with a warning. "Warning: no happy ending".
