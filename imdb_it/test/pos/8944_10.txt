I accidentally came across this film on Cinemax while browsing the channel. I must admit that what attracted me was Christopher Walken. And the setting was the one I wanted, so I started watching it. At the beginning I was expecting a serious drama, and it seemed so for a while ... until I started giggling here and there, and before I knew it I was laughing so much throughout the film. I really like how thin and carefree it is, but it still has a huge impact on the public. The plot is very simple, and it's anything but trying to be fun like many Hollywood "comedies", yet it almost made me roll on the floor. A must see for a good evening rest, or at any time in that case.
