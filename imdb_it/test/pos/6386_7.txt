An unusual film, which starts from the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him to escape the country. But a change soon turns the story upside down. Most of the film has the right buttons: the plot develops smoothly, the acting is solid (Sienna Miller's drawl is priceless, she can really act!), The chemistry between the two main works, and the American rural routes and the extravagant secondary characters really do for good weather. The mood, which starts as light and romantic, sometimes turns into something darker and decidedly eery at times. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, however, the pace slows a little slower than we would like, but don't let it stop watching this unusual little movie show.
