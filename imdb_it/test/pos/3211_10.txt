People need to give this show a chance. People who write negative reviews (there are few) are clearly people who have not seen many episodes. You really have to sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws.

Also, it's nice to see a show that can have a girl in the middle of it, and not be full of teenage angst. Rory is a smart girl, who doesn't see much even on television today. If only other shows could capture the entirety of this show ...
