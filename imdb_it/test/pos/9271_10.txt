So absolutely unique and fun! Another great Canadian invention. A regular "Joe" (Dan) and a group of disillusioned delinquents (also known as Puppets) all share the residence in a halfway house. Dan's job is to keep an eye on four "threats to society" and help them rehabilitate. Bill, the homicidal mannequin, Rocko, the dog who smokes cigarettes, Buttons, the nympho teddy bear and Cuddles, the comfort doll. The five are in all sorts of strange situations. Despite their murderous, and often openly perverse tendencies, it is difficult not to find them adorable. <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10 show simply because it offers good entertainment, without a huge budget, and exudes a Canadian touch that makes me proud.
