Bergman and the comedy don't quite get along. Some of his plays are so sickening that they almost wince. This film has the strange moment of silence: the last 30 seconds are the nadir, but overall this is a fascinating piece (rather than fun), pleasant everywhere. Bergman launches many of his usual suspects who behave well. There is a big scene on the train between David, Marianne and a rough seller who will remain in the memory. Part of the wedding material is typical, cynical Bergman, but this is Bergman in a light rather than in darkness. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moments and is worth the odd 90 minutes. Not one of his classics and not the starting point if you want to fall for Bergman.
