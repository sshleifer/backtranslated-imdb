Recently I had the privilege of seeing what is said to be the last 35mm print, Technicolor, stereo and I found it much more lively and more moving than I remembered. Moreover, closer to the original material, in practice, all screenwriter N. Richard Nash has been clipped, changed a lot of recitative to the spoken dialogue and inserted a scene or two of transition (including a very funny one for Pearl Bailey). The design of Oliver Smith's production is seasoned in the "Li'l Abner" - "Guys and Dolls" 50s adaptation mode, but works well for the folklore and unrealistic quality of this work. Stereotypes and racism are present, but not by a degree of induction. Moreover, for a film of his time, it is quite frank - adultery, violent behavior, drug use and the self-destructive habits of the inhabitants of Catfish Row are not at all minimized in telling. But there are debts, starting with all that variation from the text of the stage. The loss of so much compromise the genius of Gershwin - it is not surprising that the family does not like it. The reorganization, particularly of Sammy Davis Jr. material, is staggeringly fashionable and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, people; you didn't have to mess around so much. And while Poitier and Dandridge perform well and their singing well doubles, there is a huge glimmer between the singing and speaking voices of the characters: you are constantly aware of the artifice. What really matters here, of course, is music, one of the largest ever written for theater, anywhere. Despite all the bricolage, it survives, and you should be made of stone so as not to be moved by it. If the treatment is not entirely acceptable to the property (and should not be), there is still no reason not to spend some money to restore this ambitious recovery of Gershwin's masterpiece and make the new generations more aware of his genius.
