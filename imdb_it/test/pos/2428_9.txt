I wouldn't be so sure of accepting DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First, read Peter Kurth's book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could have known (forensic evidence aside from Anna's favor). Secondly, compare the images of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are the same and one person. Third, visit Peter Kurth's website (url below) where you can read detailed information on DNA tests, and why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll to the link, "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA" ). Even Schanzkowska's relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. <br /> <br /> I will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were actually the same person; I will never be affected backwards. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
