This is a nice film of a lifetime about a guy (Peter Coyote) who lives the suburban bourgeoisie perfect life when police suddenly burst into his house late one night and arrest him for murdering a boy 27 years ago. <br /> <br /> In his prison cell, Coyote tells his wife the fateful events of 27 years ago and how he got in touch with Wayne Kennedy the man he was going to kill. <br /> <br /> From here the story is told in the fashion of flashbacks and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the most interested in you. <br /> <br /> Acting is not something to talk about, even if that guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty scary. The real strength of the film is the mystery of what really happened on the mountain. The wife spends the movie turning around clues to the mystery and every time something new comes out, we are treated to another flashback that reveals more than mystery. It is actually quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> So with regard to Lifetime TV movies, this little movie is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
