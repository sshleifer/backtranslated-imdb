Is it full moon tonight? OH! It doesn't matter that they can change every time they want to take that drug! What was I thinking if it was the full moon tonight ?! Geez <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror and hot stuff;) I like the first half of the movie when the boy saves the girl from biting herself and catching her. It was really nice. The setting of this film is in the city of love, Paris in France. The cemetery scenes are beautiful, it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of your place are really beautiful. They took me on those scenes too. His friend who died and the girl he killed in the cemetery, but still shows himself to the main character (I'm sorry I forgot his name), was really fun. The actors did a good job, plus the makeup people. The part where everyone celebrates in an abandoned church, I can't believe that people would do it because, even if that is an abandoned church, that is still God's house. I bought this movie a long time ago, and I don't regret it. to have bought it. I'm a lover of horror movies. I give this movie 5 stars out of 6. For people who are open and love movies like this, try it, you might like it.
