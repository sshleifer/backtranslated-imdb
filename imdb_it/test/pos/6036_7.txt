My first "Columbo". Rather, I liked it. Large format, and the extremely good Peter Falk character ... wonderfully eccentric, can take its place alongside Poirot, Miss Marple, and even characters like Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can understand why this series has a similar following. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician, I have to say a few things. First of all, a conductor who simply produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) will never have a house like that or a fame like that or machines like that, much less to be called a genius. And the conduct that the actor does is so ugly as to be ridiculous. No orchestra would take it seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also many small things, like his test of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why try it when they just did it for TV? Any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his sleep anyway ... ). His instructions for the ensemble are very senseless and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what "almost fantasy" means, she says she is "Latin". It is Italian, like most musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, there are no two great musicians that NEVER have the following exchange: "Play something". "What should I play?" "Chopin". Music is their job and passion, they know it well. Something much more specific would have been requested and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should get out more ...
