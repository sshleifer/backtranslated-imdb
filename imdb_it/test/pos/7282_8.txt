I was pleasantly surprised to find a very funny movie that caught my eye. I'm a horror fan and I see almost everything in that genre, but Dead Line managed to drive me crazy. The pace is very clever and Andr√©s Bagg performs well as a desperate man. What's under the main plot? A journey to madness. How can you end up like this? Martin Sanders asks himself as he sees a homeless man talking to himself, alone on the street. Towards the end of the film, Aaron Mandel's character poses the same question as he sees another homeless do the same thing; not knowing, however, that this homeless person is Martin Sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film. The broken glasses in two are a clear symbol of rupture and division ... of the personality. The ending is stunning and you only know that a sequel should be done.
