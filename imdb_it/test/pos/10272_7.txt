A visually pretty but interesting film is mainly the plot. The film describes a zigzag progress in exploring the most intimate feeling of the main actress. Max, who has lived in New York for two years and plans to marry a girl he met there, returns to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend, who still has fantasies, but eventually discovers what he loves most she is her best friend. The non-linear narrative therefore many flashbacks and each part is articulated quite well. The three women whom Max met symbolize something we must pursue, even though they may not have a clear picture of the basic motivations. His girlfriend is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and, therefore, completely without any loyalty we can see. It also does not give him love, but only stability. Furthermore, true love cannot be found in his relationship with the ex-girlfriend. Just a fantasy to escape - many very romantic things she has done for her, but almost nothing seems acceptable. What really animates Max's life, in fact, is his best friend. The balance achieved at the end is not identical to the initial balance because Max understood much more about his more intimate feeling. The non-linear structure makes research progress more complicated. Not as brilliant as "Pulp Fiction", but things seem much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact the description of Romane Bohringer is also interesting. Good photography also makes her and Monica Bellucci very beautiful. A good comment on today's love and undoubtedly a movie to watch. <br /> <br />
