I saw him recently at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival. The title of the film and indeed much of the film is taken from the poem by Robert Graves Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk directs a screenplay by Petr Jrchovský from a story by Hrebejk and Jrchovský. the story begins in 2002, when Prague was struck by one of those devastating 100-year floods that destroyed the families of Marcela (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two children Kuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) . Because of the mold conditions in which Kuba's asthma now lives, his life is in danger. Marcela works and Jarda runs a chop shop from the garage where they live. Jarda's obscure occupation breaks him from the law and one of his victims of theft becomes infatuated with Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to take care of Marcela and her two children. Jana Brejchová is the mother of Marcella who lives with her usual husband, Uncle Richie, played by Jirí Schmitzer as probably the best role in the film. Completing this excellent cast is Emília Vasaryova as the mentally frail mother of Jarda who gives all the money she gets to the local religious charlatan. There's a lot to do here for a little movie and it's a good story with a fantastic script and a lot of comic relief. Ales Brezina provides the soundtrack with additional music by Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard. There is a lot to appreciate in this film and I would like to give it an 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.
