At more than one level, I can relate to what happens in this film in a very personal way. And all I can say about it is that it's true, what Dexter's mom tells Eric at the end of the story: he actually "cured" his son, taking away his sad feelings and his loneliness. <br /> <br /> This film emphasizes a philosophy with which I can really agree. We will all die one day sooner or later. In the end, it's not the amount of time we live, but the fun / good times / happiness we have at the moment. It is not quantity, but quality that counts. <br /> <br /> I imagine that all the other words used here would only keep you watching this movie, if you haven't already. I would really like to see it published on DVD. Surely it will be added to my "all-time classics" immediately!
