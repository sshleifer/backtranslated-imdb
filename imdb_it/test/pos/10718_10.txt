This is a phenomenal film. Really one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am a serious critic and it takes a lot to stimulate me, but this film had all the right combinations to "mix". The passion of the actors, without the exaggeration, the pain for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, make this film a must see, despite the fact that they are 70s. This is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic / vintage film. I hope you work like when you consider the volatile relationships of all kinds, when you also consider how deep the pain associated with love can be and how the most difficult decisions to make are always the most painful, but once the Pain will subside, but only gradually. This film certainly shows that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that departure is certainly not synonymous with loss / lack of love. The "crafting" of this film certainly emanates from a place deep in someone's heart and mind.
