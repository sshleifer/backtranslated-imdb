In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan in the San Juan River. Along the way, they meet first the waterless chariot of the charlatan Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws of Clegg's boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to mask the patrol led by the Crystal City sheriff who is chasing them. When the Navajo cross their path, they are invited to visit their village for a dance party. When the train car is near their destination, the Clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take an attitude. <br /> <br /> "Wagon Master" is another great John Ford western. The sequences with the caravan that crosses the desert and the hills are impressive. The adventure of the Mormon group is fun and very funny and the songs fit the plot well despite being dated. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Caravan of the Braves")
