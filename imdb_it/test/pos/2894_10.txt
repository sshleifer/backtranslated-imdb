I've always been a "big" flagship fan since "moving images" and this concert is simply an example for all those who are passionate because Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, still managed to give an exceptional performance from start to finish. A true example of this is that during "yyz" the whole crowd starts singing in a classic way, in perfect sincerity. They play all the favorite songs of everyone with a real "desire" that rarely happens anymore. Get the best place at home for one of their best concerts given. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary of the band while I'm in Brazil and shows you a lot of things behind the scenes and allows you to see them not only as musicians but as real people in their everyday life. This DVD gift set is a must for all Rush fans, young and old, and is definitely a keeper of your DVD collection. Their is also a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to music. This DVD is worth it!
