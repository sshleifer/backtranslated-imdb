With the recent release of "Fados" by Carlos Saura in the United States (albiet, a limited publication only for the art house), the time has come for a new version of this beautiful documentary on Amalia Rodrigues. This film is a treasure trove of vintage Amalia films on Portuguese and American television, as well as various other films, including one of his and his mother that could easily reduce the most macho man to tears. I saw this beautiful documentary for the first time some years ago, when it received the unjustified "art house" (it deserved much better). Fortunately, there are several recordings of Amalia's best recordings on various "budget line" recordings (which are generally available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy), or if you do a little research, you can put some of the versions well originals, both on E-Bay and on one of those distribution services specializing in expensive imported European CDs. There are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation (the original Portuguese version, with no English subtitles, and the American version in Portuguese with English subtitles, except the European version cannot be reproduced on most USDVD players, due to of the color PAL line system). Not classified by the MPAA, but contains nothing to offend.
