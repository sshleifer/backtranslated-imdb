I rented the movie and liked it so much I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are as exceptional as the two boys. Their new stepfather physically abuses Bobby. The abuse is implicit, for the most part, unseen, and has aroused much passion in me to help abused children. There is a magical quality in the film, as the imagination of the boys helps them find a way to deal with the abuse. You have to try to understand the story from a child's point of view. I'm still thinking about the ending. I've seen the movie 3 or 4 times and every time I think of possible new meanings. I'm not sure what Richard Donner wanted me to think, but this is an excellent movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will get you to hug your children.
