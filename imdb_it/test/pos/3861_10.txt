<br /> <br /> As cats have nine lives, I will give you nine reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> * Kittens Berlioz and Toulouse play the piano together (so incredibly cute!) * Dogs chasing cars Napoleon and Lafayette * Toulouse jump like electrified whenever he wants to be like a cat of hard alleys * Marie sighs romantically as alley cat O'Malley seduces her mother * Scat Cat and her jazz band, singing "ev" rybody wants to be a cat "* Stupid but just and nice English geese Amelia and Abigail who make cats walk like geese * O'Malley getting the" magic carpet "that shames the Cheshire * Roquefort cat the brave journey of mouse to ask for help from alley cats * Edgar the butler chases the scenes and the transition from a good boy to a crazy enemy of the cat due to the cat's liberation plan gone bad
