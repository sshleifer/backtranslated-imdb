eXistenZ was a good movie, at first I wondered what was going on, organically "pod" made of mutant reptiles that connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game through an umbilical cord, well, it seems a bit strange. <br /> <br /> But once it's a pretty good movie, with some twists and turns with an open ending and good weridness throughout the movie, it's also fun to see how you don't know what comes next. br /> <br /> Security personnel throw away metal detectors; they have bone cannons!
