An excellent combination: - Chabat's humor - The world and characters of Uderzo / Goscinny - The limited presence of Christian Clavier <br /> <br /> The original comics were fantastic - one of the best in a great general series - and Alain Chabat, one of the best the funniest member of the famous French group Les Nuls, was able to film, replicate and integrate the great work done by goscinny and uderzo skillfully enforcing the story, giving Djamel Debouze his best role (finally a little away from its usual repeatable part), bringing together a group of great actors (Gerard Darmon is wonderful, as Chabat himself is often a great Cesar). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, despite being obliged to continue with Christian Clavier as Asterix Chabat he cleverly focused his role in the film to highlight Darmon and Debouze ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> => Fantastic environment, fantastic scenery, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This film would have deserved a 10 if Clavier had not had api n involved.
