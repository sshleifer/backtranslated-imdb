As a mini-series of adventures, this is the best you can get. I saw it when it was originally shown on HBO. Sigrid is absolutely credible in his role as Philadelphia, and the entire production was first rate! See all 400 minutes if you can. I highly recommend this mini series. Unbelievable that I cannot officially evaluate it, but for you readers / users I will let you know that it is a solid 10!
