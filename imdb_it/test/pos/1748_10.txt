I'm normally a typical "creepy" girl, but after watching this movie (on YouTube of course), I have different perspectives. And I also didn't know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer made another film about an insect community whose garden in the city is threatened by humans (lit cigars and cigarette butts, footprints, etc.) E like a young and robust grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of Honey the ape; I love the beautiful Mrs. Honey. You know, after seeing the movie, the bugs reminded me of some of the "jitter-bugs" of Don Bulth's Thumbelina. And among the songs in the movie, I love "We're a Couple in The Castle;" when I sing that song, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> This wonderful film was the second (and last) film released by the Fleischer studio. The film originally came out in November 1941, but since Fleischer's rival Disney left Dumbo weeks earlier, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but Mr. Bug unfortunately went into a trap, unrealized, not made of terrible times. Having had the misfortune to open two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bug was a financial disaster and led to the ouster of Max and Dave Fleischer, of the studio they had founded in 1919, and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another important factor in their departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer talking to each other due to disputes (how sad he was). Overall, I love both films by the Fleischer brothers. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
