I was a child when I saw this serial, a little after seeing that of Buck Rogers, both characters played by Buster Crabbe himself, and I must admit that these films have always been part of the best entertainment I've ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was more interested in knowing the final fate of the Flash love triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin arrived and persuaded Aura to forget Flash, the very innocent end of her obsession with good-looking Flash. The serial has no offensive and truly violent scenes and can be seen by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned to float in the water looking at the way Crabbe did it when he fought against sharks. The soundtrack was also pleasant, although it was previously used in another Frankenstein film by Boris Karloff. It would be nice to have the DVD of this serial as long as it comes with Spanish subtitles (not yet available).
