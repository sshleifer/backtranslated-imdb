We don't know why this extraordinary film was never officially released on DVD ... Anthony Quinn's performance alone makes it a must see. There are relatively few films in which an actor identifies himself so deeply with his character, a phenomenon that is always unique to us, spectators. <br /> <br /> But Quinn's powerful portrait of an innocent Romanian, literally dragged out of his house and every day life for the forces he can't understand, is only part of what makes this film great . The screenplay is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who escaped from the communist assumption of his country, and the film manages to penetrate deeply into a little-known area of ​​Eastern European history. Told as a succession of twists by Kafka-esquire, the misadventures of Johann Moritz (told openly and honestly, without any of the currently correct political correctness in Hollywood) are actually a praise of the Romanian people's innocence lost. It is ironically ironic that this eulogy is signed by a French director, who works with the American money of an Italian producer, and oversees a multinational cast in front of an extraordinary Mexican actor. <br /> <br /> I saw VCD mentions of this film in various Asian internet stores, and I was lucky enough to take possession of a digital recording of this film, broadcast on the English version of TCM. But it is a pity that "The 25th Hour" is nowhere on the MGM studios' future DVD release map.
