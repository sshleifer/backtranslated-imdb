"Best in Show" is certainly Christopher Guest's most amusing and profound film. The characters are excellently portrayed and the pet's connection to the owner adds a new level of comedy to the film. I have been a fan of Guest since Spinal Tap but in this film he really achieved what he proposed to do in the "fake-documentary", a genre that he invented and has now perfected.
