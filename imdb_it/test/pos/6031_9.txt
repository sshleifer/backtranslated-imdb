I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to confess, the only reason I went to see it is because I'm a big fan of Callum Keith Rennie. And he didn't disappoint me. He gave a good interpretation of a rather unpleasant character and provided the only comic relief in the whole film. <br /> <br /> The film itself is the usual plot "a lot of bad people trapped in a snowstorm together", but has had a couple of twists that made me guess. The characterisations were strong and the whole cast went quite well. The only problems I had with the cast were Rose McGowan. It was so cold throughout the film that we had no idea about his character's personality or motivation. Apart from her and some small problems with continuity, this was a well written and well acted thriller.
