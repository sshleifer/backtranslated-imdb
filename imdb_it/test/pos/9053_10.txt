Now this is classic. A friend of mine told me about this film, saying he is incredibly lame, stupid, retarded and deficient. He also said I'd like it. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found it available from netflix and rented it at once. I'm just shocked that I've never heard of it before. If I could give him an eleven, I'd do it. <br /> <br />
