What a wonderful documentary - I sat thinking that it would be a review of the heartbreaking stories told in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, but it is actually a glorious and clear celebration of a strange and twisted era that gave rise to something really great movies. What struck me was the lack of bitterness in the director's interviews, given that now the film industry sucks in style - instead, men like Friedkin and Coppola seem to shine positively remembering their glory days. The video of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the Exorcist was priceless. "He was - traumatic," says one guy. A big epitaph for the late Ted Demme, an electrifying film, I just wish it were longer - I could have taken a three-hour break.
