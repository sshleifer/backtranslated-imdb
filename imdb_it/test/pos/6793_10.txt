This is the best movie if you want to inspire you to follow your heart and never give up your dreams. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and in her best time (of her childhood, at least), Mickey Rooney is a cynical friend who will eventually become her trainer and go to the Grand National hedges with her beloved horse "the Pi" - short for " Pirate "- just to make Velvet the jockey and have a chance to win. For those of you who haven't seen it yet, I won't give away the ending but you should see it and once you're done you'll love it. Notice a very young Angela Lansbury as Velvet's older sister.
