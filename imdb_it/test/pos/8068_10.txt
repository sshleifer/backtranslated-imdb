Although it might seem a bit bizarre to see a 32-year-old woman play the part of a twelve-year-old, Mary Pickford will soon make you forget the inconsistencies and simply enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> Mary is a street kid in New York City, with her lovely band of misdeed creators, whose attentions are committed by the older William Haines (she was 25 at the time and only on the cusp of his celebrity on the screen). <br /> <br /> Giving up too much of the plot wouldn't be right. Suffice it to say that Mary is a lot of fun to watch and shows widely because she was the first and most beloved Hollywood star. Production values ​​are very good, with many extras that make New York street scenes quite credible.
