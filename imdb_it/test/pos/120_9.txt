There are questions that sometimes hang over us and have no answer. Two women find themselves progressively trapped in each other's arms (as banal as the expression sounds, that's exactly what happens) and the fins that can't answer their own question about what defines their relationship when their own society has no name for what we are. The FIRE by Deepa Mehta is somewhat misleading and the first in a freely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements and more symbolic of consumption. Fire as an uncontrolled erotic passion does not make its appearance here, since women - the oldest and most feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger and more virile Sita (Nandita Das) come to understand that they share much more than ideas common and mutual affection and represent what they believe is their passion for one another, despite opposition to their very traditional husbands and families. As in WATER, FIRE is profoundly spiritual, although technically it falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER, just like the weight of the word, has a stronger meaning that eventually transcends its definition). Even so, it is a very beautiful image, and a strong voice from a strong director.
