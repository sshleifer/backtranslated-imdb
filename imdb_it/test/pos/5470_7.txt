And I would have rated him higher than 7 out of 10 had it not been for Barbara Hershey's Irish accent in the title role of Mother Madalyn. The accent came and it went unfortunately that I found more than a little distraction. <br /> <br /> However, William L Petersen's performance as Joad was exceptional, bringing a warmth and depth to the character despite some periodic dialogues. Captivating and genuine, I found it rather amazing in the way it captured the character. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is quite simple, the construction of a forgotten staircase in a church. It is based, I think rather vaguely, on a true story and I had heard of this scale before seeing the film. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal undertaking for its time: a double floating propeller made without nails or screws. It exists until today even if it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Minor spoiler ** A good supporting cast and Barbara dies so well in all her films and here she does not disappoint. Lots of special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
