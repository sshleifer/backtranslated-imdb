The fact that the film is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the film. The plot is full of unexpected twists that prevent the viewer from understanding from the start. In a moment you think something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well, certainly not what you would expect. <br /> <br /> The film never becomes boring or too sentimental and the performances of Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. are among the best of my opinion. The ending puts a lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you're doing is right. Well, I guess that was what Michael Tollin and Mike Rich were trying to do. First class movies. <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
