Bonny Hunt marks a coup d'Ã©tat with his directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have something indescribable called chemistry. Of course, the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop you from enjoying this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play with his card mates. Jim Belushi is hilarious as Megan's simple husband, part of the extended family. <br /> <br /> Faith, family and marriage are respected. Some sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor. <br /> <br /> And in the background that wonderful piece by Dean Martin - "Return to Me". <br /> <br /> Recommended.
