Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrait of a Vietnam veterinary house from the war, but still obsessed with it. Bates plays an unsuspecting mother who just wants the family to be a "family". Sheen is as formidable as his father who tries to understand what his son is going through, but he is too busy with his principles to empathize. The setting is Thanksgiving and relatives come to dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning vet, does not want to be part of the family tradition and insists on wearing his combat suits for dinner, explaining "This is what I wore the last Thanksgiving". The contentious and family arguments are priceless, in particular the "peanut brittle crisis", but the ending is both compelling and terrifying. It must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
