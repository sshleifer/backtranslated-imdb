I've always loved "Gone with the Wind" and I've seen it numerous times. However, his end left me not only "hung", but depressed, with a hopeless feeling. Finally, in "Scarlett", Ripley led us to a very plausible and satisfying ending ("beginning") of the original story. <br /> <br /> It follows that someone from Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) eventually grow. Although, like most people, I fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW, I was tired of her tasteless infantilization to the point of exasperation, and I was disappointed that Mitchell didn't show Scarlett that obvious intelligence to try to grow emotionally. Fortunately, someone eventually did. (After all, isn't it that annoying immaturity that contrasted with her beauty and intelligence the reason why Rhett eventually gave up her in the first place?) I think Ripley did a great job describing that long-awaited process, and Whalley-Kilmer did a great job of painting it. Joanne WK has all the fire, the exuberance and the intelligent sparkle of Vivian Leigh, and is certainly at least as beautiful, if not even more beautiful. <br /> <br /> There was, is and will always be one Clark Timpano. However, if I had to choose one of the thousands of actors I was exposed to play in his biography, he would definitely be Timothy Dalton. Dalton possesses the same elegant charm as Gable, essential for Rhett's character. I can't imagine anyone else that could come close. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, both Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were superbly interpreted and the only actors who could have played Scarlett and Rhett. I think both their performances have done justice not only to the late actors, but also to the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I loved the whole cast. Julie Harris was her usual delightful presence, and Jean Smart was a lovely kick! Even the character of Ashley was played by Stephen Collins, and the progression of his relationship with Scarlett was absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> The story has become a bit convoluted in Ireland, but life is like that, after all, and I still found it funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, I really enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I had written it! <br /> <br />
