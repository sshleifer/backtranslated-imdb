This film, without a doubt, is the clearest example of British humor that the Germans cannot understand. The one-liners are rife in a film that generates one of the largest series of films in the history of British cinema (St.Trinians). The history of bureaucratic incompetence in the midst of post-war processes allows Frank Launder to direct the maximum talent from the whole cast. It is probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her game, in Alastair Sim, for forced characterization (however she wins anyway). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mention in Dighton's masterpiece of the English label and the stiff upper lip under pressure. <br /> <br /> No Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell fan would be without this in his collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes.
