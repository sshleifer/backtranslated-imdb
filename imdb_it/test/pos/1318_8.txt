The only pure life is that which ends with a signature in the blood. <br /> <br /> So says Mishima anyway, a young protected boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of the most famous Japanese literary voices, is told from three points of view, his life just before he and four members of his private army conquer a Japanese military base and commit a ritual suicide (shown in color), flashbacks (shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels (shown in a kind of Technicolor dream set set between the traditional Noh Theater and the "Wizard of Oz". These stories are often told at the same time, but are modified for reinforce, the slow merging the life of Mishima with its fictions, until the end (or beginning) when, like the ancient samurai who admires it, it will be at a balance of pen and sword (when its words and actions are the same, and is full and "pure" being. <br /> <br /> Paul Schrader wrote the script for "Taxi Driver" and directed "Cat People" (a bizarre erotic horror film, which has left strange impressions about me as a boy) and in Mishima, s i closer to making a really excellent movie. <br /> <br /> What's interesting to watch the poet, the homosexual, the shy and clumsy man with a low body image that overestimates his tuberculosis to get WW2 (which he seems to be ashamed of forever) , becoming a body building, obsessed samurai, a-sexual, media phenomena, all the time writing prolific quantities of novels, plays and stories. <br /> <br /> A short and sweet version is to say that Mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self-destruction, in a tragic attempt to feel connected to something greater than himself, which he was always missing. Looking at him with his fellow suicide cadets, do you see him happy, pronouncing his great paternal speech, giving orders and loving control ... until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet? Obviously, this ignores the subtlety of the narrative trade here that makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story, sometimes fascinating, is not really the biggest success of this film. Cinematography, performances, editing, music (by Philip Glass) and set designs are really what make this worth seeing, and much more than a traditional bio-photo. <br /> <br /> One day I will go to get a book by Mishima, it seems to have an ear for prose, and for scenic ideas, but for now I am satisfied with the film. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture should check. Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should also enjoy.
