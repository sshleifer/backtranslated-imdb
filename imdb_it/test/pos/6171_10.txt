This is a well-made film that precisely balances the fragile human stories (both before and after 1945) and the indiscriminate fighting of the war. The use of outtakes of Battle of Britain (a film that does not describe the 1940s so well!) Improves, instead of diminishing everything. A deeply impressive work, this is lived in my memory for the past 2 years since I saw it, and I just bought it to explore the production extras. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie (film). Like "Aces High", it alternates between sequences of viscerally exciting (or scary) aerial battles, in which the spectator could experience the actual loss of characters they care about, but also unpredictable interactions on the ground, where skilled authors and realists life experiences inform some engaging and moving events. This also underlines the fact that for many people, 1945 marked not only the end of one conflict but the beginning of another, and even today we do not recognize the loss, courage and sacrifice of so many unnamed heroes, or even worse we venerate from afar without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that derive from them - making their sacrifices even more valiant. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is an experience that will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy, and return to a love that lasts beyond death. If all the war films were like that, we should never fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I say it is worth looking at? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
