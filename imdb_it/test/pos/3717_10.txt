Remember that this came out before the first Gulf War, which gave us the "Lessons of Darkness" by Werner Herzog. <br /> <br /> Le Dernier Combat is not "Sci Fi". It's more like judgment. I've seen it at least a dozen times. He is indeed a perfect companion to Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness": "And at that moment, men will seek death, but they will not find it, because death will flee from them." <br /> <br /> That one day, alas, it could be today, in Iraq. <br /> <br /> But, back to Le Dernier Combat, make sure you watch the last second of the film. I wouldn't call it a "surprise ending", but it's something you will miss if you think the end will be nothing more than what you have already seen.
