This is my favorite love story, it contains all the elements that a good love story should have. Poetry, jazz, friendships, the ups and downs in relationships. Finally a film that shows positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was fantastic. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Darius. He recited the poem as if he had written it himself and meant every word. I own this movie and if I had time to watch it every day it always makes me feel better and that's what a good movie should do. Moreover, the character Savon could not have treated the theme of marriage better. We would all like to find a Darius, but most of us are content to watch this movie. My vote is 10/10
