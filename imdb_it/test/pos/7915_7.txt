Eisenstein's first sound film traces the ice battle of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonian knights, eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Built in 1938, the Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat stupid) helmets, are obvious contrasts for the Nazis. The slaughter of knights when they enter a Russian city seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of the Second World War. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made of delicate black and white (a bit reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked the return of Eisenstein to official favor. In the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet directors to stop experimenting and produce films that would be more populist and more appealing to the Russian public. This stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he returned with his most accessible film. The strong point of the Nevsky is in its second half, which characterizes the battle itself, and is rightly seen as a milestone in the history of cinema: never before (and probably never after) a battle would have been so vivid on the screen. Another strong point is the beautiful and disturbing soundtrack by Prokofiev (using a composer to mark a film was quite unusual at the time). One of its weaknesses: the comic relief (in the form of two simple Russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful Russian peasant) is truly shocking.
