One Night at McCool's is a very funny movie that is smarter than it should be. Its shape is more sophisticated than I expected and its randomness was superb. The thoughts behind the film (mystification, sadism, stupid men) are childish. This is what I have to say about this film: not only does he hate women, but he hates men. He has no sympathy for any of the men, really. It looks so because of the shape, but the ending says it all. Nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The module has the first 2/3 of the film told in flashbacks by three characters: Dillon, the stupid bartender; Reiser, the stupid mysterious lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid cop, holier than you. History is therefore always perverted by its own images of self and altered realities. Reiser's BBQ fantasy is a nice touch. In the end, we never really know the truth, and nothing is what it seems. Dillon has never been so innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> Actually the rest of the movie is fun too. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the film to the extreme obviousness of Tyler's manipulations, the film seems to have an energy all its own. Everything is just out of nowhere and nothing seems to make sense. Do we really care if it does? No. <br /> <br /> It is also a very dark comedy, but has a superficial presentation. Think of Nurse Betty or Jawbreaker. Very caramelized on the outside, dark rubbery on the inside. If you like your casual movies, obscure or just petty, watch this movie. This will satisfy your desires for the strangeness that is One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
