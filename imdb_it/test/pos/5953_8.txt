Jean Dujardin lowers Connery's mannerisms: twins adjustment when entering a club, while all women turn to admire him, the ease that straightens and flattens the tie, the bold and bold gait. It's disturbing, and you realize how much of Bond in the 1960s was the creation of Connery and not the character of Ian Fleming. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a nod to those early films, the film kicks off from Russia with love and Thunderball mainly. The main joke is how the hero is chauvinistic, not only in terms of sexism, but also of nationalism and colonialism, and how he breaks off when sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> Not perfect - about 20 minutes in it looks like a joke movie and some of them resemble one of the bad words of the day, of which there were many. Morcecambe and Wise's intelligence men had suspicious-looking men in the fezzes that followed their heroes, and that's a little behind. Unlike the Clouseau of the Vendors or the Borat of Baron Cohen, Dujardin does not give his character that level of reality or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his Connery ways. It doesn't do enough with the credits or a great song, and there's no funny or serious villain, like Mike Myers's Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun, for the hero he has to face. <br /> <br /> But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning made me laugh out loud in the three-quarter empty cinema, and the whole thing looks wonderful, and you'll never get the chance to see Operation Kid Brother on the screen, and the women are ace, very hot. It's a parody of James Bond without falling into Ken Adam's mad scientist / set or funny gadget stuff. Recommended
