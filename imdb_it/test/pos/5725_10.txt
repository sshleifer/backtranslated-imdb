In the wake of my personal research on the outstanding "final cycle" of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system, I believe this film should be seen as "What The Bleep Do Know?" While some may believe that high-level science issues should be communicated only at the doctoral level "speaks", "The elegant universe" breaks such obstacles. The images and the selection dialogue facilitate the understanding of this walk through the history of physics. There are numerous messages in this film, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to review what is being taught. The real discovery is pure, science is beautiful because there is always something more exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to look for it in front of "consolidated" science.
