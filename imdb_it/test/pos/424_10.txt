I love this show. He is intelligent and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have excellent chemistry. The writing is intelligent and the sub-themes generally give a great comic relief. After each new episode, I'm always amazed at how exciting and fun this show is at the same time. My only complaint would have been the absence of Donna Murphy, at this point, in the second season. As the former wife of David Morse, Heather added a character like that to the show. <br /> <br /> I think this show is a recognition for the crime / drama genre. That being said, I cannot for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating. Could anyone like who gave this show a grade 1 on which they backed up with a critique?
