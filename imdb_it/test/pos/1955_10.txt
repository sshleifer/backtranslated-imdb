The critics of IMDb insert a certain amount of lines, but all I want to say is: "This is an incredible film, and you can't consider yourself a fan of cinema without having seen it". You should just trust me on this and stop reading this review and get the movie and push the game. But I have to write something. So let me emphasize the following: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge contains what could still be considered the best Crispin Glover film ever and the best performance in a movie, and if you followed Crispin Glover of everything, you know that this alone justifies giving it a 10. Funny lines galore. <br /> <br /> (2) River's Edge contains the second most memorable performance of Dennis Hopper's career (in addition to the one in Blue Velvet), and it's really excellent. Dennis Hopper is really fun. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge contains the best performance of Keanu Reeves' career, and is excellent. It was the role he was born to play. It has a lot of good lines, but one in particular is really fun. Listen closely when your character and stepfather talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Still the best stoner film, it's much more than that. It tends to appear in the dramatic sections of film rental stores, but if this is a drama, it is the most entertaining drama of all time.
