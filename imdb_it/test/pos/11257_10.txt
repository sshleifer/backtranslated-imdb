I just watched this movie tonight (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to see him because I saw the basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio) and I loved it, but this was much heavier. I think he had a good representation of the drug to some extent. I identify mainly with the Nick Stahls character, probably because if someone I was crazy about was on those things, I'd like to help them get off. A promising student and an athlete who spends all his time training and studying, well, it is understandable that he would like to try his teenage life (the crazy side of it) and in his efforts like what he starts is helping his friend that ends up being dependent because he wanted to see what it is and because of his horrendous family situation that translates into his most tragic death. A really sad film, but one of the flaws I've noticed is that you don't get a pretty thorough view of the damage it does to families but, apart from that, excellent performance in a truly heartbreaking movie.
