Being a bit of a junkie connoisseur, I came across this little treasure. Action, romance, corrupt cops, violence. It's all here and not just one has been pulled right. I was immediately in love. Then, a funny thing happened for the second time. I became addicted. I thought it would be a kind of rental movie and giggles. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did the same. It's really commendable. He also shows that he was making the film on his own. I don't know how many of you have listened to Rudy Ray's music, but if you haven't, it has a lot of albums that go until the fifties.
