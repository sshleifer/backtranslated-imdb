I probably saw the movie 4 or 5 times. Every time, I am more and more impressed by how much the desire of a young heart can go, and by the strength of Kai and Gertha to fight for what they believe. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is presented this way, you've just moved into the plot and before you know it, you're there. you can see ... yes, there is Kai ... working hard in the mirror ... a little jump ... there is Gertha, who fights for his love ..... and there is the Queen of Nevi ... <br /> <br /> is just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, tension. <br /> <br /> it's brilliant 10 out of 10
