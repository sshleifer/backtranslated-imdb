I'M SORRY!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. He should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie !!! It was the movie! While the film may be missing in some areas, Cuba was fantastic ... and for me, this is the best role I've ever played! The scene of the film in which he discovers that his mother is dead has made me break down and cry IN THE THEATER !! I guess I could really relate to this movie because I saw the same treatment of people as I grow up in my school ... what a tragedy! Even seeing the "real" radio and coach at the end of the film was really special! If you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears, you need a heart check! If you liked "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you will also love "Radio"! I wish they would make other films like this ... Radio is the real deal!
