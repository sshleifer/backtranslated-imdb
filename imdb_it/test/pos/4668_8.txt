Especially after seeing THE REFILLED MATRIX !! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After seeing the Matrix with all the ridiculous fantasy-robotic fantasy characters with their super powers, it was nice to see an action movie with real people in situations that posed a real risk! I cared about these people, and even if some acrobatics seemed to me a little too much, they still left me with the lines "it's possible" that stupid video game (like Matrix) <br /> <br /> This is not a movie Brain surgery is very simple. Some things are predictable, like knowing that someone will be a boxer and that someone will soon die. Quite obvious, but SO WHAT? The first 15 minutes are our reason, our motive, our main goal. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Theron and Walhberg had no makeup scenes. I'm glad they didn't go there. They kept it for a fun dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE. That guy is FUN! <br /> <br /> This is a movie I would buy when it comes out on DVD. It's fun, fast and fun. The only thing (and I think it's a great thing) is that we really are - rooting for the bad guys. This group of protaganists is already on the wrong side of the law. It is not a good message for children - parents, please explain them. <br /> <br />
