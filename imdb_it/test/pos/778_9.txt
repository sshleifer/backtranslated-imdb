I took the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act beyond Harry Potter. Laura Linney is as extraordinary as the oppressive mother. Julie Walters is as exhilarating as Dame Evie Walton, with a worse mouth than a sailor. I hope this film is picked up by an American distributor so everyone can see it. This film is not just about driving lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between the desire to obey his overbearing mother and vicar and the desire to live his life. It's a fantastic film, by an extraordinary director who took his life and put it on the screen so that everyone can see it and anyone can do it.
