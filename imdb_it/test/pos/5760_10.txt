Why did I vote 10/10 for this movie that is completely out of belly *? Simply because if you let yourself find fun, you can just laugh until you choke. Some people may find that it goes too far, it's not for everyone, but when I'm down and I just need something really stupid to laugh, chuck on Bottom or GHP and I can forget all my problems and be transported to a magical world dark and bizarre. <br /> <br /> * "completely out of courage" is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.
