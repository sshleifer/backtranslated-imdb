The best thing - and it is quite beautiful - on The Black Castle is that it is a black and white Gothic cluster of the Forties with a crazy madman who was somehow created in 1952. The apparently star is British actor Richard Greene, a capable leader who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a crazy count played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job except when he is called to laugh maniacally. Hiding in the shadows is a long-standing Boris Karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an elderly doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. <br /> <br /> It is the mid-18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared near the castle of Count Karl von Bruno (McNally), deep in the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends helped to defeat a brutal von Bruno plan in Africa three years earlier involving slavery and ivory. The Count was left not only with failure, but with a scar on his face and a black spot he is now wearing to cover a broken eye. von Bruno has sworn revenge, and it seems he may have had a partial success. Then, under a false name, Sir Ronald organizes a hunting invitation from the Count, and we leave by carriage through a dark voyage of storm and howling wolves towards the castle of the Count. It is a massive mass of stone turrets and corridors, shady staircases, enormous chimneys ... and gruesome passages that lead to wet cells of underground cells, a torture chamber and a large pit full of crocodiles that shake and shake. It is also filled by the beautiful, blonde and sensitive wife of Count Elga (Paula Corday, who is sometimes announced as Rita Corday), and by the two close friends of the Count interpreted by those two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being costume slime, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, irritating servants, wooden signs that creak and sway in the cold wind and poison in a cup. No less important, Doctor Meissen (Karloff) has a special vial filled with a drug that will slow down bodily functions that death will seem to have occurred. The risk is that ... well, when the person wakes up ten hours later, you better hope he isn't already locked up in his coffin. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for all the clich√©s, The Black Castle continues to move happily. The film takes itself seriously, but it is done competently to maintain our interest, even if we end up sitting with a smile as we watch. It is also reassuring in a way to realize that there are strong echoes of The Most Dangerous Game. When Burton realizes how crazy von Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring von Bruno to the accounts. And, of course, he fell for Elga. von Bruno, maddened by revenge but clever and capable, is a man who loves hunting and is swollen by killing. The second creative principle of Hollywood has always been: "If you intend to steal, steal at best". The first creative rule, of course, is "If you're going to steal, steal from the best and then turn it into a liver stew". The Black Castle is a nice morsel of Austrian braunschweiger.
