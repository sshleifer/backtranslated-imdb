You don't see the meaning of the title much later, but you take the point in the first few minutes. This Golden Globe-nominated directorial debut by Danny DeVito also starred Owen / Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, a Hitchcock film about a man's hatred of his wife's book (he stole his) and hatred of a man for his mother. Basically, Owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and is inspired by stories of murder. Larry suggests seeing a Hitchcock film, quite ironic, and that is when Owen has the idea of ​​killing Larry's ex-wife, Margaret (Kate Mulgrew of Star Trek Voyager). Owen is inspired by "Strangers on a Train", exchanging murders, so Larry must kill Owen's horrible Momma (nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe, Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced that Owen had killed Margaret, and also that he had to / wanted to kill Owen's mother, but there is a happy ending when months later both Larry and Owen bring the books, mom died naturally and went on vacation with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Also played by Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With hilarious moments, a great director / actor and his support, this is a comedy not to be missed. Very very good!
