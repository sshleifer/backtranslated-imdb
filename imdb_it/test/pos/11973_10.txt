Watchers is a funny movie if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously much better but the film itself is fun in its own way. The film has many changes for the novel Watchers, the only difference is the protagonist Travis. In the book he was an adult soldier and retired Delta Force while in the film he was a teenager. Watchers has good points, the film has some gory scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Michael Ironside and it was nice to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. OXCOM's costume looks nice but the camera never shows the creature completely until the end of the movie. The Einstien dog was impressive because he was well trained. <br /> <br /> The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a laboratory, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically because the two animals are part of a military project in which the dog would infiltrate an enemy base, so the creature would attack and eliminate them. The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers he is smart and so calls the dog Einstein, meanwhile the OXCOM is around to kill people and dig their eyes, two government agents are sent for find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. Travis discovers that he is not safe while OXCOM is attracted to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone else, so Travis and his mother go to save his girlfriend who is detained in the hospital by the two agents. Then they hide in the woods while government agents and OXCOM are not far behind. <br /> <br /> The observers are not a great adaptation of the novel by Dean R. Koontz, but it is a horror film of the 80s, some fans of the book may not want to see this since it is not faithful to the book, but fans of 80s horror movies might want to check this.
