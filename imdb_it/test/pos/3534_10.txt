1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best horror wilderness tales out there. It is one of the most refined of the 80s and easily blows films like The Last Terror, Don't Go to the Woods, or The Prey Out of the Water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in nature. A murderous race murderer, who appears to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates offenders. <br /> <br /> The director Lieberman, who gave us great films like Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), does a great job with this smart thriller too. The film is pleasantly atmospheric, with a sense of creeping tension and a certain suspense. This film also makes the wild desert seem frighteningly claustrophobic. The Oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by clever cinematography. The soundtrack is a truly original and impressive contrast to the scenic images. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson is a great protagonist, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry offers a good performance as a lover of Benson and Chris Lemon offers some occasional charisma. Even the supporting cast, particularly veteran Kennedy, does quite well. <br /> <br /> A true gem of the slasher genre, which does not need a cold-blooded thrill. Definitely worth looking for slasher fans and horror fans alike. Watch it! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 on ****
