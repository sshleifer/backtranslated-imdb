This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Pretty pathetic, you say? Well, yes it is. But Chris is incredibly, incredibly funny. His innocent genius emerges in this film more than in his other films. Look at both scenes of the motel, when Spade is captured with the zipper lowered, and the other: "JUST GET THE END OF GOD LOVE !!!"
