Back in the mid / late 1980s, an OAV anime titled "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I believe is a military term that speaks when technical equipment goes haywire) made its video debut, taking inspiration from " Blade Runner "," The Terminator "and maybe even" Robocop ", with a little touch of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and the power of Charlie's Angel girl launched for good measure. In 8 episodes, the general story was that in the 21st century in Tokyo, Japan, from 2032 to 2033, living machines called Boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes caused problems. A special, SWAT as a branch of law enforcement, the Advanced Police (AD Police briefly) was formed to manage the boomers, but they were mostly ineffective, prompting the millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the scientist's daughter who made the boomers , to create four enhanced combat armor (hardy suits) that must be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil company that produced the boomers, GENOM. That group became known as Knight Sabers, and in addition to ring leader Sylia, his band of rebel women included Priss Asagiri, a rock'n'roll struggling with a passion for motorcycles and contempt for the police, Linna Yamazaki, a aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and Nene Romanova, a young ADP officer and experienced computer hacker (the first in a long line). GENOM, meanwhile, is represented by Quincy, a tall, thin old man who happens to own the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD police detectives (Leon appeared in an anime spin-off / prequel, "AD Police Files" which I heard very dark), their bald overweight leader Chief Todo, the younger brother of Sylia Mackey is a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia keep the seeds. Apart from the general plot of Knight Sabers & AD Police VS GENOM, there was also another plot involving a friend of Linna who apparently was a daughter of a large criminal family, the annoying Largo who tried to usurp GENOM, and several Priss-wants-revenge-story for a minor character. Oh, and did I mention that there were indications that Sylia might have been a boom? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a great watch, full of chaos and chaos and also some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was interrupted after episode 8, when it was originally scheduled for 13 episodes in all. So some of the plots, such as the outline (or schemes) of Largo, the family of Linna's unfortunate friend and the origins of Sylia, were never solved. Another problem of the series was that at the time Priss was the most popular character, so a good part of the series focused on her, and unfortunately most of the Priss-oriented episodes focused essentially on Priss seeking justice / revenge for some a secondary character who had never appeared before but who was his friend, yet rarely did everything for her, Knight Sabers, who had always taken her out of trouble and for some reason took great care of her - being (right to be fair, however, she went to save Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a boom and the ADP acted badly in the investigation). This meant that we could not concentrate on Sylia's most interesting story, or even on the daily antics of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes oriented around her, which concerned her friend with the mafia family, while Nene managed to wrest the last episode for herself, which showed that her eternal good humor was sincerely good and not dizzy. Nene also had the opportunity to put her computer skills to good use, or sometimes she just acted like a lovable goof, who put her time on the screen and on the development of the character of some clove above poor Linna, who was often pushed in the background with her greed and her tendency to devour the boys to attract her attention. Don't get me wrong, I like and love the general concept of all this, but it annoyed me a little. This is also one of those runners-up for the "worst voices of English dubbing of all time", which means you'd better stick to the Japanese. Some voices were in place (some really corresponded to the characters of the characters), but others were simply flat and without passion or, in the case of Priss, they were really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, Tokyo 2040 arrives and practically dumps everything out the window. A few years later, the story is that after the earthquakes destroyed Tokyo, the GENOM boomers rebuilt the city in a big old paradise, except that the boomers still have a tendency to fly away from the handle, which leads the police to AD to form, followed by the formation of the Sabers Knights. So the general story is the same, but the background of the characters and the appearance and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Originally Sylia had short black hair and brown eyes, usually dressed like a severe business woman and far from others. 2040 Sylia has a more super-model appearance, dressing more provocatively and with white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (the range goes from blue to violet to silver and eyes from time to time appear purple or gray) and even 2040 Sylia is more an emotionally unstable woman who flies out of control when she is not in public, and perhaps keeps even more secrets than before. Even Sylia does not take the greatest risk on the battlefield, since it is more a type of pit stop in the furniture, but fights when it has to. <br /> <br /> 2 Originally, Priss was a short woman with an Afro and a bad temper, always fighting with people who had offended her, always biting more than she could chew, etc. 2040 Priss, however, has gone the way of Clint Eastwood's solitaire - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you might say), so it's not very attached to anyone. Her hair is also more sting and cat-like (a big improvement) and she is dressed in leather like Trinity from "The Matrix" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, writers inculpate her eventually revealing her reasons for hating ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Originally Linna had this big black hair that was going to meet her, but now her hair is shorter, more brown and, well, more like the 90s. 2040 Linna is also an office woman who has the misfortune of being sexually harassed. As if to apologize for the way it was treated by OAV writers, the writers of 2040 actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing it as a new country girl in town but determined to meet the Sabers Knights and win a place with them, which in the end does. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a red-haired girl who was often a victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a short-haired blonde girl who likes to tease and take the twists and turns of the ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him playing with her in the OAV?) And other characters, including his older sister, Linna and Mackey, the "brother" of Sylia, with whom he became infatuated. Cockey is arrogant, he still eats a lot of candy and is a great hacker, but in the end he is deflated and grows beyond his state of comic relief. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic man, robust and with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul of TV Highlanders), replacing Dr. Raven of the old series and now he is the man who gives hand to the hard clothes of Sylia. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you wouldn't know from his behavior. He is a kind of father / elder brother / mentor figure to Mackey. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but obviously differently. The original Leon was a tall, tall boy, built like a baseball player with brown hair combed back, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans and always with a gun that could magically pack more than one howitzer , if necessary; while he wasn't really a bad boy deep down, he was a bit of an idiot, but he served mainly as a comic relief, while trying to chase Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and Daley served as a guide for information for important points of the plot. Even the original Daley was a rather muscular red head wearing pink / purple clothes because he was a conspicuously homosexual character who was always hitting Leon when he didn't provide important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a handsome boy but more the typical robust and robust type, with spiked black hair, brown eyes, large and muscular muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (it really looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a little, or maybe a pumped Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and still wears a revolver, a BIG one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although the 2040 Leon still has some attitude problems (especially in the approach to Priss), it is not so much an idiot as it was in the old series, but it has a bad temper and is easily annoyed by Nene and Daley (also he drinks too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still behind Priss, but this time he has much more luck. Daley, meanwhile, is now a taller (but not taller than Leon) nicer guy with red-rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes and light brown hair, and carries a big machine gun (he really looks like James Marsden of movies of X-Men); Daley is much smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV and, although not entirely clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost completely disappeared, except for a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about Leon investigating e-mail from Priss. <br /> <br /> 7) Brian J. Mason (what does "J" mean for?) is back, and so is Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, with Quincy as co-villain, since he is no longer an imposing figure of terror, but a vegetable with a pile of batteries and cables connected to him. Mason now has brown hair combed back instead of black hair like he did with the OAV (actually he looks like an OAV Leon in a suit) and is very similar to the school of bad Alan Rickman. <br /> <br /> 8) Although he is a pervert in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are many different things about Mackey in 2040, but they will not be revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia now has a companion, an Alfred-the-butler named Henderson, who cares about her and the gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, the boomers were like the Replicants in "Blade Runner", armed with their own thoughts, feelings and ambitions, but by 2040 they are more of the stupid-monster type on-fury. Most of the time they are just big robots that do whatever they are programmed to do (heavy work, fighting, cleaning up, etc.) And they have this tendency to "be a thief", which means trying to evolve and become a monster in the process. <br /> <br /> What remains the same is the theme of humanity VS Technology (do machines have souls?). Unfortunately, this series, although well animated and well written, handles only 26 episodes, so it moves faster than you could wish for, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it still ends on a hanger with unresolved plot bits (which I will not discuss here. What saves this show and makes it what it is, however, are the characters, a colorful cast of screw balls that are, ranging from the solitary stoics, psyche women, crazy genocides, big-necked cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old wise men and adorable innocents, much more different than before and with much more to play, are enough to make you want this show to last longer. <br /> It is not nice, but it is a good watch, even the English dub (of ADV) is quite good, although not lacking in some points, but certainly better than the dub on the original.
