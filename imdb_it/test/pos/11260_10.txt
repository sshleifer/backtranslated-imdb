What can I say? I couldn't sleep and I came across this MTV movie. I started watching him with every intention of changing channels if he started to become lame like many anti-drug movies do, but I got sucked into this movie and couldn't stop watching. Nick Stahl did a fantastic job with his character, and I think he really made the movie something that is worth watching. I was interested in buying the soundtrack of the movie (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com was of no help, but believe it or not Amazon.com is taking the pre-orders for the 5th edition of the DVD movie. I know I've had trouble tracking him down, and I'm sure other people might have had the same problem. I'm buying my copy so I can drool over Nick Stahl while screaming my eyes at the same time thanks to the thrilling storyline!
