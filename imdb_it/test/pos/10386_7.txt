First, the positive aspects: an excellent job in depicting urban landscapes to adapt to the mood of the film. Some of the shots could be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> The negatives: stories are hard to believe. Unreal and one-dimensional characters strut and position themselves 100% of the time, as if they were in a sort of catwalk. This is neither the Hurdles of his precedents, much better films nor the Wenders that we have all known and appreciated. Malkovich is the excess baggage in this film.
