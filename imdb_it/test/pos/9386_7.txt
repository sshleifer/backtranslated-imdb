As Roger Corman said in an interview, making low-budget films allows filmmakers to seize opportunities for unusual ideas. Well, it's hard to find a movie that lives in the original way like "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" by George Barry. <br /> <br /> The film has its own story, and it's interesting to this. I will give up any kind of detail so that you can listen to them by yourself if you have the chance to watch them. Suffice it to say that the head of the furniture has an insatiable hunger, which consumes the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that melts its victims like acid. <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" is a scary and disturbing little film that interprets its absurd premise in such a way as to transcend the usual Schlock assortment of foods. He occupies his particular dream world in such a way that I was able to take it seriously. It's a really weird and unconventional horror film. It delights in exploitative ingredients - there are some tasty female nudity dolls - yet it is also art, even if art with a completely distorted sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not so bad for a film with a microscopic budget and Barry gives the film a good midnight movie quality. The cast acting is not as inspired as one might imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist / narrator, and a definite point of interest is to see a familiar face at hand: the future 'Boy Meets World 'father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This film may not even have found the small cult following the fact that it was not for pirated copies that were circling; this certainly must be considered one of the cases in which this practice eventually ended up helping the film - even though the exhibition took years to take hold. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste of truly bizarre dark objects, "Death Bed" could be just what you have in mind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
