First of all let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most undervalued films since it came out in 72. I loved this film, it's very urban, gritty, there's no real Hollywood glam. I feel for all the characters in here, I love the blood splattering here abound. Joe Pesci was very good here, but it seems to me that he was definitely overtaken by the protagonist Joe Cortese, now I don't know anything about him, but the guy can really act ... I think this film is probably true, because living in New Jersey , living near Philly, you this thing all the time. I think that if the film had a bigger budget, and I said that Robert Deniro is Jerry's boss, you would have a perfect movie, but hey who I am to discuss, I was so absorbed in this film, which is already up there in my mind, Mean Streets. I would like Hollywood to return to this urbanized and gritty exhibition of cinema: it would be very useful to do so. this film is a great drama with great actors. and I highly recommend it to anyone.
