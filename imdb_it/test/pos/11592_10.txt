This story about a man's 28-year fight for a death that would free him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to remember, thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace. Directed, written, edited and marked by Alejandro Amenabar, it touches you from the first images, and does not leave your eyes and heart at rest until the last credits, thanks to Alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and wonderful actresses. Bardem is an acting animal: one of those few comedians who can make a masterpiece from almost all the characters, the non-leading actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such sensitivity that one laughs and cries in the same minute, as we used to do with great ancient masterpieces. The best film of the year in every sense. 10/10
