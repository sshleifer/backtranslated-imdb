I must confess that I was surprised at how beautiful this film was when I first saw it. I had planned to see it in theaters during the summer, but I found it unpleasantly that it was already gone and finished. Therefore, I expected it to be removed from the cinemas because it was bad. Then, today, I rented it and looked at it and liked it a lot. The speed at which events were occurring was questionable, could have been a little longer. I found out that he was very faithful to the book, yet it didn't contain any crucial parts: the real name of Mullet Finger, etc. It seemed to me that I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have really understood what was happening. The acting was pretty good, another thing I expected was poor, but the cop, I'm sorry not to remember the name of the actor, could have done a little better. All in all, I found this movie very funny and would recommend it to all audiences!
