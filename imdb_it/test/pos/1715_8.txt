One of the most successful shows in television history is back. Now I admit that I never entered the original show .... Ok, so I never looked at it at all. But the new show is impressive. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi debuted the first two episodes, "Rose" and "The End of the World", this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-year-old secretary who is chased by remote-controlled mannequins. She is saved by a mysterious stranger who calls himself a Doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a lover of conspiracy who warns her that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows. When her brilliant boyfriend Mickey is replaced by an impostor, the Doctor informs her of a plot to use the Earth as a breeding ground for other plastic monsters, which the Doctor has fought in space and time, traveling in a Tardis disguised for years 50s style police call box. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world - there would be no show otherwise - and he decides to join him. But when he puts his life in danger, he is upset, and wonders if his company is worth the risk. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are a bit boring, and some of the scenes are a bit discontinuous, "Doctor Who" is (after two episodes broadcast in the United States) an intelligent and well-written work . Apparently, the second season has already been broadcast in the UK, so I expect the same success here.
