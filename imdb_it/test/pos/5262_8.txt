An exceptional dramatic comedy about the powers of friendship. Despite being a remake of a 1939 film of the same title, it would probably be compared to Sex And The City. I would not compare myself completely. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan) who seems to live most women, is happily married, has a good daughter, great friends and a big house. But Marys' perfect life is not what it seems, when she finds out that her husband is cheating on her with Crystal (Eve Mendes) from Zach. Mary is puzzled and doesn't know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) try to be there for her in every way possible. I really don't want to give up anymore. But I found it funny, and I'm a man. Meg Ryan is fantastic, it's nice to see her back on the screen after a series of flops. And the rest of the cast is also great, including Eve Mendes as Crystal. Just a fun, carefree comedy.
