1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was Robert Downey's second film to get some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope has achieved a much larger version. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and hateful. Those two films were petty to the point that they blocked the career of the Prince's feature film for several years. <br /> <br /> The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a farce / sham satire that must be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here. What plot? People looking for a plot will be scratching their heads. Keep scratching !! This film is not about PLOT! It could be compared to a film by Mel Brooks; only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel has always thrown. In this I also see a bit of Monty Python. By the way: this film was shot before Monty made his BBC debut !!! <br /> <br /> I have noticed that the Gag and Lines that are drop dead hilarious do NOT transfer well with word of mouth. You must see them in the context of the film. There are some flaws in the film; but the defects are also unique. For example: often the actors repeat the SAME LINE over and over; and somehow it works. How many syllables Mario? Putney says the six girl Borman must have soul! etc ... <br /> <br /> Black and white photography is exceptional. The sound / score is even better! Assembly is just so-so. Acting is above average. The script is priceless. The jokes are like non-PC like you can get: MR. The bad news says "Sonny Williams has just been captured in a motel with a 13 year old girl" says Putney "Well, at least it's not superstitious" Beware of Uptight's conservatives. The anti-establishment mentality of this film will take you directly out of the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie about today: NO SMOKING !!! Reverse racism; with African Americans treating Caucasians like garbage. The manipulation of mass media on the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood intentionally pedals something that any 8-year-old can say is pure junk; Internet, I'm talking about "the drum"; Interracial appointments; I could go on and on .... <br /> <br /> I must also mention that there are about 8 minutes of this film shot in 16 mm in color. These are the advertisements shot by the Putney agency. The stains work quite well the first time. They are annoying even if on repeated views. The real magic here is within the black and white sections of the film. They are the non-scenic lines that stand with you: "Rent yourself an INCREDIBLE Schmuck". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take the pill?" "anything I have to say would be redundant". And a host of others. I also really like the bite with the minnow mounted on the wall: "The game warden wanted me to throw it back ... I fought so much, I decided to have it mounted!" <br /> <br /> Cast actors include Buddy Buttler as Putney's bodyguard # 1. He should be a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as the Arab. He went on to become famous on TV and in Films. Arnold Johnson looks just like Putney Swoope. Robert Downey used his own voice because Arnold didn't remember any of his lines. Also Downey realized that he could complete other dialog boxes / jokes later, if he had nicknamed his leading actor. <br /> <br /> The film has some shortcomings. Short time is one. I wish the beginning with the members of the board would have been extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are exceptional. The final seams were thrown together as if he could not think of other gags. All in all, this is one of the best low-cost independent films of its time. A period in which very few actors performed outside of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see it at least twice. Downey's Putney Swoope is ahead and beyond time.
