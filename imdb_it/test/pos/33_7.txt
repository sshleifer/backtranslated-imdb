Lackawanna Blues is an uninterrupted drama. Describes the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by everyone who knows her, but she may have been called Wonder Woman. He embodied strength, willpower, confidence and resolution. He owned a house that housed almost every type of person the company would refuse. His tenants were a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a multitude of other tramps who made the house far from the ordinary. Each subsequent event, Rachel, has taken a step and impeccably managed. He was not a compassionate dictator, but in reality it was exactly the opposite. He showed almost guiltless compassion by giving shelter and refuge to so many people that he seemed to extend too much. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I think this role was still at the height of his alley. The film had a drift not yet far from Rachel. There were obviously dramatic moments, but they were predictable. Nothing was ever shocking or profound beyond Rachel herself.
