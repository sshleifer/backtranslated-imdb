The box in my video store is why I rented this. It seemed nice on the part of the guys half-faced, so obviously I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that he was a fan of "Evil Dead". Swedish producers must have been fans and included many references in this masterpiece. A criminal tries to break into the house Evil Ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him crazy and says "groovy" as he looks at his weapon just like Bruce Campbell does when he ends his hand with the chainsaw in Evil Dead 2. There is also many posters of that film are scattered around the home and office in the film. They don't just spoil the Evil Dead, since there's a Gremlin-style puppet monster that swears Ed to his fridge. My favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says "I'm coming to get you Barbra" which, if you didn't know, is the main line of the Barbra brothers in "The night of the living dead". This film has a pretty good storyline, fantastic characters, funny things (Gremlin puppets), scary things (demon doctor), excellent effects (exploding head) and a fair amount of female nudity. I only gave a 9 because its kind of slowing down before Ed goes crazy, but it's worth the wait. So, if you liked "Evil Dead 2" or one of the other films I mentioned above, you have to rent it and watch it with a freind, and when you have finished try "Brain Dead" because I heard that it is similar to this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
