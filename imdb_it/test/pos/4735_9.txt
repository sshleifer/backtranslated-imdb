When I started watching I thought I saw some pro-Koresh amateur documentaries. However, I had never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. They interviewed people saying that the FBI / ATF instigated all these things, which seemed so far-fetched, but then followed the FBI video and testimony. I was amazed. The documentary followed the Senate investigation after the fire, and after seeing the interview and video, you will be shocked by how the Senate and the attorney general turn their backs on the Davidians to hide the FBI / ATF. If you start looking at this you have to finish it. Otherwise you will think it is a propaganda of something like this.
