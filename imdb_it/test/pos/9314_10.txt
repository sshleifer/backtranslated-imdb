I spent many years studying all the great directors, like Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick and I admire them very much. My favorite movie is Once Upon a Time in America. <br /> <br /> I recently became a fan of D'Amato, and while he was not a master of horror, his films were extreme whether it be soft core, hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Porno Holocaust is now one of my favorite movies, the way his shots are brilliant and the music is captivating. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato was not a horror master, he is not Fulci or Bava, but he was a master of eroticism, no other director could make erotic films like him, he never tried to make films outside of this genre. <br /> <br /> live Joe D'Aamto-Master of Porn and Erotica!
