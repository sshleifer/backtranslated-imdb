The thirteenth and final RKO Falcon movie begins with the mutual injunction of Tom Conway as Tom Lawrence, aka Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of "No dames!" while getting ready to go on vacation. While you are still wondering what they will go on vacation since they had not had a job since the first film began in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay and Jenkins in the role of Goldie) they meet a woman and are dragged into a vicious industrial espionage caper. <br /> <br /> They promise to help her when her uncle is killed, taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make replacement industrial diamonds for her work colleague in Miami. Do you suspect everyone here except the cops who are looking for Lawrence ?? and Goldie for the murder. To console herself Goldie continues to paraphrase the travel brochures: "On the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cozy electric chair". Some beautiful and languid nightclub scenes accompany the particularly bad behavior of the bad guys. Favorite well: the dignified game of hide and seek the thimble the imperturbable and gentle Lawrence has with the bad guys on the sleeping train. The least loved thing: the most embarrassing scene of the whole series in the alligator wrestling hut ?? definitely for kids! <br /> <br /> All in all it is not the best in the series, but it is still another fun, with a satisfying general storyline and many episodes in this too that make me want to be able to go on for just a few more years like Columbia did the Boston Blackie, although the RKOs were churning them out faster. Absolutely no sex, not a lot of violence (actually none by today's high standards), and positively no message makes all this kind of film anathema for serious people who can only consider films as an art form that must depend on these three pillars. Three Diet Falcons were made later with John Calvert in the title role, I don't mind but I never managed to count them in the main series, which Tom Conway had made his own from this time. Sad that after all this it was all downhill for Conway, who moved to TV, voiceover and even played Norman Conquest at Park Plaza 605 quite well in 1953. He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems ?? I don't know if they were connected? he dismissed poverty and after a spell in the hospital in 1967 he was found dead in his girlfriend's bed. For us people who want at least we still have his 10 fun Falcon as well as a number of other worthy, even classic RKO films from 1942 to 1946 with which to remember him.
