He recently traveled to Norway from Bergen, Norway, and stopped in the small town of Voss, Norway, and there was a monument in honor of Knute Rockne, born in Voss years ago. People all know Knute to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at its monument. This film is a great story of this great man and his great love for Notre Dame. Never understood that Knute has such great talent in chemistry and laboratory science and has been teaching chemistry for years and has coached the soccer team at the same time. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp, (The Gipper), who was an exceptional soccer player; Reagan had a short role, but he gave a great supporting role in this film. Donald Crisp, (Father John Callahan) was exceptional as a priest who always had great faith in Knute during his whole life at Notre Dame. This is a great classic movie and will be seen for many generations to come. To enjoy.
