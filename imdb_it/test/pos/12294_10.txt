Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Pierre Pierre by Herman Melville; or, the ambiguities'. The comments here surprise me, I wonder what led to the extremely negative reaction. <br /> <br /> The shock value is the least attractive thing about this film - a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion. History is the ruin of Pierre - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - who is openly demonstrated in his features, demeanor and idiolect. The dialogue and the soundtrack distinguish this film from all the others I've seen, and transform a fundamentally traditional plot with controversial twists into an unforgettable epic. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough the importance of ignoring everything I've heard about this movie and looking, as I did, with an open mind. I hope, I will be rewarded the same way I was. I felt nervous and nervous for about half an hour, but the film is anything but scary in every traditional sense. It will leave you with 1,000 thoughts, each of them both annoying and exciting. I know I'm gushing here, but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film. It's the best I've seen throughout the year.
