I just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and moving study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and education in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and preparing them for all the challenges that life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a precious concept that we must all remember. The thread concerning the Vietnam war still sounds today. It's worth a look.
