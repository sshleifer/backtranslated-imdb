Clich√©-avoidance is one of the main results of this film. When do you feel a vague outline of the story ?? Erasmus students of mixed nationality who share an apartment in Barcelona ?? you foresee a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In reality, it is a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, who tries to make sense of human relationships. There are some well-regarded minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the unbearably unbearable brother of the English girl, Xavier's abandoned mother) and good visual humor, especially in the opening scenes that mock the bureaucratic complexity of the application procedure. So what does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. In place of a conventionally happy ending, is there an unpleasantly portentous ending on "Identity" ?? Xavier became all the friends he made. However, this very pleasant film deserves its great success. I saw him in Luxembourg with a mixed European audience, who had a great time and even applauded in the end.
