I still can't believe that computer graphics can create 3D images. The moment I heard it from my friends at a forum, I swear to myself that I'm going to get myself watched. <br /> <br /> I was able to see parts of it in another mall where they had many Advent Children DVDs and they showed it on some laptops for sale. Obviously I was very happy but it was still not enough. Then I went to YouTube.com to search for the movie. All I invented are the dedications of music videos. Until that fateful day ... I found it. I looked at him despite all the distractions because I knew I had to watch otherwise I would be called a loser. <br /> <br /> More than me on the film. As if Final Fantasy VII were not enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud OmniSlash couldn't be better. But I wouldn't want to completely ruin the show for you. You have to watch it by yourself !!! Get the DVD now!
