What is the problem with you people? John Dahl? From "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? TOO eccentric? Knock Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman for having fun playing against the guy? And did someone like the Gingerbread Man? <br /> <br /> I rented this not knowing anything about it and found it as a nifty video found as you can get. Never insulting, well thought out, funny, scary. I disagree with opponents, of course. I thought the story itself was irrelevant, but the excellent cast, which most likely means the director was paying attention, took him to a fantastic state. Good sound design too (much more appreciated in surround, but I'm not bragging). And yes, I'm a girl, so maybe she has a slight feminine inclination (the guys in the band are worth it). All in all, a 9 and a cordial RECOMMEND.
