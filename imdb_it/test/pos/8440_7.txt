The thirty years that have elapsed since the making of this film have made the suspense a little less compelling, and will not keep the audience alert as I am sure it happened in 1979. It is still quite fun, and recovers some of its power when discovers his sad relevance today (see the history of FirstEnergy's Davis-Besse nuclear power plant). With the top of the line actors and steady pace you can learn to overlook the old 70s environment, and see it for the political critique it is. I doubt however that it will survive the test of time. It may not be completely forgotten thanks to the cast, but otherwise the dialogue, setting and scoring will make a remake of this film inevitable. Since the oil situation is now comparable to the situation in the 1970s, and alternative sources of energy are becoming a hotter topic again, we can only hope that the current generation will get very successful warnings about nuclear (privatized) risks like this one .
