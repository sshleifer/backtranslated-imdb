It's not a bad MOW. I was expecting another film based on women's problems, but I was pleasantly surprised by the suspense element. Sure, some parts of the plot were pretty dry, but for the most part the movie made me guess. Was the wand connected with the ex-husband, someone in the tavern or was it the type (person) he had interrupted? Daniel Magder was excellent. I saw him in Mom's on Strike and in Guilt by Association, both MOWs and he are very credible, especially the way he defies his mother like a preteen would normally play. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton has also played the typical mother (ex-wife) to whom both men and women can refer. She was frustrated enough to seem real. <br /> <br /> See if you missed it. It's worth it.
