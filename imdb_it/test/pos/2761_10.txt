The graphics are far from the best part of the game. This is the best TH number one game in the series. Next to the subway. It deserves a strong love. It's a crazy game. There are massive levels, huge unlockable characters ... it's just a huge game. Wasting your money in this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted correctly. And even if the graphics suck, this does not make the game a good result. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES? As they say in Canada, this is the fun game, yes. (You have to go to Canada in THPS3) Well, I don't know if they say it, but they could do it. who knows. Well, Canadians do it. Wait a minute, I'm going off topic. This game fluctuates. Buy it, play it, have fun, love it. IT'S BRILLIANT PURE.
