I remember coming home from school to watch and come this was the story of a black family moving out of the ghetto into a class community that the family called Wilson Frank Wilson with his construction business his wife Joyce was a bank manager had 3 teenage children, Kevin Valerie and Marcus. This was a very good show. it was educational without the preachie. the show was well written. This show took a look at a successful African American before the Cosby Show. A very black actor has appeared in this show from Ester Role to David Hubberd to 227 Stonnie Jackson to name a few. If you can find this show on DVD, you should do it for your whole family
