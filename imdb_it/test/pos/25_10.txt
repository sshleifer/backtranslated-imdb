This is a film that deserves another look - if you haven't seen it for a while, or at first glance - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play of the same name, it is the story of an older actor who runs a Shakespearean repertory company on tour in England during World War II. He faces his stress of trying to perform at Shakespeare every evening facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company composed of elderly or physically handicapped actors - the young, the robust ones being taken to military service. He also deals with his relationship with various members of his company, in particular with his chest of drawers. So far everything seems rather boring, but nothing could be further from the truth. While overall it is tragically, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high everywhere. Both have received Oscar nominations for Best Actor and deservedly. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves human drama, theater - especially Shakespeare, or who has ever worked backstage in any role. The background compose another aspect of the film that will be fascinating for most viewers.
