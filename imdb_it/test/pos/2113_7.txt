We liked the whole movie. It's a very charming family film with lots of fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film as well as the roles of famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is particularly nice in the film, but all the kids are good. The scenery of West Texas is fantastic, as is the soundtrack full of Texan artists. The last half seemed a bit exaggerated, however, my son was interested in the whole film that is not so often with him. Something in the plot was appealing to children. Having shown the calves as a child, I really liked the finish. This is definitely not the way it really works, unless you have heifers.
