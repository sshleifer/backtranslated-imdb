This is not a walk in the park. I saw it when it came out and I didn't have the courage to look at it again. You'll never see a movie more horribly devastating or depressing. I felt like I was severely beaten. What kind of world do we live in when we have children treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what is allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, to make us tremble to the end, and he succeeded. How can we be cruel, self-indulgent or negligent towards our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He is pointing a finger of accusation against all of us for doing it to the lowest and least powerful of our society. And if you're not doing something every day to prevent it, then you're part of the problem. I am NOT a religious fanatic, but this film made me think about the state of my soul.
