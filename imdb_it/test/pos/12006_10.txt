Probably undervalued by all those who have never experienced the hell of living under the communist regime. Although it seems hard to believe, everything happened, in reality the reality was even worse than the movie. It resembles Orwellian fiction, only it's not fiction. John Hurt is excellent as always. Yes, the script is not full of action, but life isn't either. The plot is breathtaking. Yes, people have been killed, yes thousands of them. Their "crime" was that they wanted to leave the communist "paradise" without government authorization. Sometimes the film brings tears to your eyes. We need more films like this to really appreciate what America offers for us. Excellent film, I highly recommend it! God bless our country, USA!
