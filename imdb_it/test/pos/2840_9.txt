This movie could make you a little stupid. The film was WELL worth the dark journey into the city. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the solitary "acceptable" soap group out there. Her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself forgiven for being such an idiot. I could even afford to lose myself in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it were not for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George ... And talk about the devil; "looker" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you want his wish to come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you want to tie him to a chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) takes you back to those wonderful school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and loses his name. The rest of the cast fits well. Never one to do the same movie twice, Nurse Betty is the exception. One of these long, cold ones, which need to smile for a few winter days.
