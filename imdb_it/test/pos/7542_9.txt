A really funny mid-1950s English comedy on a school for girls. The girls are all involved in trouble and chaos, making bath, smoke and gambling gin. Alastair Sim plays the director Millicent in a glorious drag queen role, as well as playing Millicent's brother. A female police officer goes to undercover school to see what is happening. This movie is fun, with great visual gags and Alastair Sim is fantastic. Just a classic Britsh play, a lot of fun and not too cruse. Joan Sims and Sid James, protagonists of many Carry On films, play small roles, but this film is about girls. It has generated 3 sequels and a recent re-make. Watch and enjoy where it all began.
