A messy man, known as Bill, lives in a dingy little apartment, with a Marilyn Monroe poster on the wall and his typewriter for company. Only man cannot think of anything to write. Wander the streets following people, just to see where they go. Perhaps this will give him some inspiration to write. Start by following a well-dressed man holding a bag. He follows it for a few days. While in a bar, the well-dressed man sits at a table on the opposite side of Bill and asks why Bill is following him. The well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a thief, and even begins to take Bill with him to the houses to steal things; although Cobb insists that he does not enter the houses of others to steal. He says he likes to let people know he was there and interrupted the things they take for granted. He puts on his underwear from another burglary in a man's pants, for example. <br /> <br /> The film is also told in flashbacks at times. The director used this technique in great abundance in his recent film Memento. Eventually Bill decides to cut his hair and dress up, according to Cobb's advice. He meets a blonde lady in a club, who used to hang out with the owner, a bald man, who is very dangerous, he says. We see a scene in which a hammer is used by the bald man, hence the men on the fingers of a man in the apartment of the blonde Lady. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit in their place when we come to the surprising conclusion.
