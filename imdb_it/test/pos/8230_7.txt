I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are incredibly clich√© (as are most of the westerns of this era), its ease of delivery and style really raise the films to classic and almost classic status. While this film presents yet another example of real life of Western heroes exploited after their death from Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the film works well thanks to him as well as excellent supporting characters. One is the always strong acting of Robert Ryan - an excellent actor who unfortunately is almost forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes who has one of his best roles as a crunchy and very colorful vice. Here is more fun than in his many secondary roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne - mostly because his part is better written and has more to do. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically the plot of half the westerns ever made. There are some villains who hire a bunch of thugs to trample on the locals and it's up to a good guy (Scott) to restore peace and kill the bad guys. However, how the plot is performed is much better than average and that's why the film is still fun to look at. Just don't expect a lot of innovation or uniqueness - unless you want to see what could be Gabby Hayes best performance.
