"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is an extremely bizarre horror film that must be seen to be believed. There is an antique four-poster bed that only loves to eat humans and does so whenever it can lure anyone to lie about it. There is also an artist long dead, imprisoned behind one of his paintings, which provides a narrative voice. George Barry is the first and only film that offers some really surreal moments like the bed that absorbs its victims in a mysterious sea of ​​yellow foam and liquid. The atmosphere is dreamlike and there is only a little blood, unfortunately the premise is rather stupid and the acting is amateur. Still as an unusual cinema fan I enjoyed this low budget oddity. Give it a chance.8 out of 10.
