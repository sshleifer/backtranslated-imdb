Even though I brought this movie by mistake (I thought it was the original of Halloween (stupid eh!)) I was surprised by how beautiful it was, many sequels continue only the events of the previous films, this tried and managed to explain prequel events, because Michael Myers kills people and why he seems to have supernatural abilities. I thought it was a top horror film full of action, suspense and surprises, I'm very happy to have brought it. I gave 9 out of 10.
