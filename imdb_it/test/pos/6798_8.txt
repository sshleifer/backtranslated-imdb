Mickey Rooney (in the role of Mi Taylor) is a young man who adrift along the symbolic road to ruin, where he meets twelve-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (like Velvet Brown) - he loves horses, but has a sad history with animals. Ms. Taylor is in love with the sense of Mr. Rooney's horse; she takes him home and brings him food and lodging with her family. They are very well supported by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (as Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's twisted brothers. <br /> <br /> The plot of "National Velvet" is not plausible; for example, the circumstances leading to Taylor's "Big Race" race are quite long (but they were probably more credible on paper). However, the connection of the characters with the horses and the character of Mrs. Revere are well conceived. Rooney and Taylor are excellent in leading roles; there is a balance between the fading "baby star" of Rooney and Taylor's new exuberant "baby star", which adds depth to their characterizations. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by good direction, photography and editing by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith and Robert Kern. A sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (12/14/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Revere
