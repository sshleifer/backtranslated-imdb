Some argue that Argentine director Esteban Sapir's La Antena is an exercise in anachronistic futility; that, while the silent films to which Sapir pays tribute are at the forefront of the cinema when they were made, today they are outdated, leaving La Antena an insignificant strangeness. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't agree. Fervor. La Antena merges the conventions of silent film with 21st century technology, making it the ultimate exercise in post-modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the timeless "The City Without a Voice", so called because the citizens were rendered speechless by Mr. TV, a dictator / media mogul with painted hair. The city resembles that of the first Metropolis by Fritz Lang (1927), perhaps 100 years before that film. They are all expressionist skyscrapers, TV antennas and animated billboards. <br /> <br /> Citizens of the city are simplified by La Voz (The Voice), the only person with the gift of the word. Her face perpetually wrapped in a hood (held even when she is naked), La Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV's television network. But when Mr. TV creates a plan to steal the written word, La Voz and her son without eyes join a renegade family in an attempt to restore people's freedom of speech. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. By imbuing themselves with the conventions of silent films, Sapir must rely on images to tell its story. There is a sound, particularly in the almost continuous soundtrack by Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent film music, just as you naively work in the film's diegesis, like the beep of car horns, or the rhythmic ra-ta-tat-tat of gunshots. And, at the base of the whole film there is a familiar hum, as if it were shown on an ancient projector. <br /> <br /> There is also a good amount of dialogue. But instead of using captions, Sapir has the words of the characters that appear in the frame. They are larger or smaller, fill the screen or obediently hover in the air, depending on what is said. Think of a more imaginative version of subtitles in Night Watch (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, words do not distract from the images. Which is really very lucky, because La Antena boasts some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time, all captured by Cristian Cottet's sumptuous black and white photography. There are expressionist urban landscapes. The hooded singer and her son without eyes. There is the abandoned antenna of the city, which resembles the decomposed remains of a colossal spider. And there is the sinister Dr. Y, whose grating mouth appears on a television screen attached to his face. <br /> <br /> La Antena has been criticized for relying too much on her images, stigmatizing on allegorical depth. But again, I wouldn't agree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a swastika-shaped mind control machine, or the apparently crucified boy with no eyes on a David star, feels out of place, a little over the top in what would otherwise be just a fairy well done story. <br /> <br /> But the lack of obvious symbols (the two previous examples apart) works in favor of the film. It allows us to make our decisions: to decide whether to deduce a political meaning, to see La Antena as an allegory for fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies, and the power and responsibility of the media; or simply take the film at face value, as a visually stunning adventure through a simultaneously unique and familiar world. <br /> <br /> The sacrifice of explicit depth in favor of unique images may seem a compromise. But really, when a movie looks good, it's hard to cure. There is more imagination and artistic talent in every frame of La Antena than Hollywood can shake a derivative stick. Summoning films of almost 100 years could be useless, but in this way, Sapir could show us what's missing in today's films. He could tell us that it's time for another artistic revolution. And he could be right.
