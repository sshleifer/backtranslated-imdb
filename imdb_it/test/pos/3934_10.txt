I'm not sure why this movie makes an average on IMDb on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could want in a horror movie. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax It is the story of a group of college kids who go to a soccer game that decides to camp for the night and escape with a local freak. When they wake up the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go to the city for a part of the broken car. The city is creepy and I'll stop here. Because this is the moment when the real and terrible confusion begins. trust me when I say that if you are looking for a horror movie, you will see it, you will like it. He is wonderfully devilish and inventive with his killing scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are designed in a decent way with the actors giving them a handful of personalities. Paris Hilton has included those who do quite well with their part. the film lies a little on the superficial side, but it is so funny and who cares. This movie should devour the box office and all horror fans should be part of it. Go see House of Wax, the film in which the skin is peeled, super glued lips, carcasses of dead animals, hot wax sprayed on a person still alive, a cut finger, a beheading, a stake through the head and much more . I was lucky enough to watch this film at the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were present to promote the film. And boy do they have something to be proud of House of wax is the scariest roller coater ride of the year! 9/10
