Following the enormous success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with short animations by Wallace and Gromit, we now have the first (I hope for many) with the plasticine characters that so many love. The DVD of the film proved to be the most enduring and the best among the many Christmas gifts of my two children. The plot of the film is quite simple but the beauty of the W & G films for me are the gags in the background. There are lots of frontal gags and slapstick for kids and adults to have fun, but the background is the killer for me. All in a classy addition to an already classy filmography for Nick Park etal and I would recommend fans and new viewers to see this movie ... often.
