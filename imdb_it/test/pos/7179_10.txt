The second film about the adventures of the couple Gaulois Asterix & Obelix is ​​10 times better than the first. The humor is fantastic (and irreverent) and the script is well executed, taken from the original 1965 comic by Goscinny and Uderzo. I fell asleep with the first movie (even though I'm a big fan of Asterix) and I was reluctant to watch this sequel, but I'm glad this movie gave me wrong. Great comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
