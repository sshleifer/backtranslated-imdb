I couldn't believe that the guys at Adult Swim invented this character. I laughed for days thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot, I believe I will stay for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole police crew is around, but Assy is hard to understand and this was a bit frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking donkey with nothing but legs that sport sports stockings with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and "plays by his rules" as you might have guessed. The only other fun moments are Assy who shoots many, many people and spends time at home - in the bathroom. It's not fun Squidbillies, but it's worth a look.
