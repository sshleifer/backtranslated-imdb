'Steamboat Willie (1928)' is often erroneously touted as the first Mickey Mouse film, although that title actually goes to 'Plane Crazy (1928).' The source that feeds this common misconception is probably an episode of "The Simpsons", which places the origin of Itchy the Mouse in a brief 1928 called Steamboat Itchy, obviously a parody of this cartoon. It is interesting to note that "Steamboat Willie" was in itself a parody, falsifying the last release of Buster Keaton, "Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)," although the connection extends beyond the title and the general setting of the history. In this short by Walt Disney, Mickey Mouse takes on a steamboat on the river, to the great disappointment of Captain Pete, the cat, who chases him from spite. But Mickey is not far behind in malice. Far from the pleasant and healthy Mickey Mouse enjoyed by the most recent generations, this little mouse cares only for the number one, inflicting pain and sorrow on a series of farm animals to provide music for their own entertainment. <br /> <br /> First, there is the laughing parrot, which faces a bucket and a large potato at the head. So a goat is operated from the queue to provide music ("Turkey in the Straw") from a guitar he swallowed. A cat swung around by its tail, a goose choked around its throat and a fiercely started piglet. For a child's cartoon, "Steamboat Willie", directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, certainly has a certain petty humor, although I have also noticed similar elements (though not quite to this extent) in some Disney short films, such as "Gulliver Mickey" (1934) '. Let's not forget Minnie Mouse, of course, who suffers from a treatment she could today sue for sexual harassment! The jokes can be rough, and perhaps the animation is even more so, but this comic offers a bucket full of laughter, and it's easy to see why this little rodent has become one of the most beloved characters in the history of cinema. If you are a fan of Mickey Mouse, or Disney in general, this is a steamer that you can't afford to lose.
