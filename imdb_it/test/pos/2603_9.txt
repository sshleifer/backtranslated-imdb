The four signs on the road say "If you're looking for fun ..... You don't need a reason ... All you need is a gun ... it's the rabbit season!" <br /> <br /> In the woods, we see hundreds of "Rabbit Season" signs published on each tree. We see more and more signs that point exactly to the hole of Bugs Bunny. Who is putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Daffy puts the last entry on tiptoe and tells us, the audience: "Terribly unsportsmanlike on my part, I know. But, what hey, I have to have fun, it's really season of ducks. "<br /> <br /> From that point, we now see Elmer Fudd, rifle in hand ... and a semantic war between Bugs and Daffy with Bugs winning every time. Fortunately, only in cartoons we can see someone being shot in the head five times and keep it up!
