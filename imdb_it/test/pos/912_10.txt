This film is not just about human feelings and emotions, but also about everything that could be but is not. Poetry in movies can be terribly boring and annoying, but this movie is delicious to watch. Not to mention the extraordinary Irène Jacob, a great actress in France - one of the best, actually. When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. After all, when something is really great, we want more (well, for another great K Kieslowsky movie with Irène Jacob we can always watch La double vie de Veronique)
