My God, Ryan Gosling has created many deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting jobs. For me this is a very deep film, it needs a lot of concentration, not because it's hard to watch, just because you understand it if you put the shoes in this guy, even if he has everything and he has a famous father who is a writer, he has a deeper mind, you don't understand why it kills this poor boy, until you've really heard what he has to say and start thinking, at least for me, that many of the things he says are true. Simple child, sweet, very kind, in a normal way like any teenager, but inside he suffers because he starts looking at the world in a different way, so you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this film to those who love deep drama.
