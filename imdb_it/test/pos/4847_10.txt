Arthur Miller certainly knows. His stories provide a clearer picture of what it means to live in the United States in the 20th century than any other writer he can think of. <br /> <br /> Focus, based on one of his novels, is no exception. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Laura Dern give fantastic shows here. Emotional bruises but ultimately gratifying, this film is excellent.
