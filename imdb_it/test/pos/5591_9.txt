This story of the problems caused by an over-possessive, domineering, despotic and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two grown sons, and their girls, is a strong vehicle for the stellar performances of Irene Dunn (the new daughter -in- law), Joel McCrea (son number one), Eric Linden (son number two) and Frances Dee (boyfriend of son number two). Here is the spectacle of the pure tyranny of jealousy and possessiveness of the mad mother while four good people find their lives damaged, their plans changed and their identities in danger. Irene Dunn is stellar in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews is as masterful as her mother. <br /> <br /> However, this review reveals that Frances Dee's performance is the best of all. His is the first character in history to show the strength of his inner feelings. His performance in his broken-hearted love scene is heartbreaking and even raw. Dee squeezes the observer and pushes you into her pain without even showing her face! <br /> <br /> Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been neglected for too long and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress she was. No actress who started films after the Second World War had anything to talk about Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, which has never been released for TV, you will find this "old fashioned drawing-room drama" to be an exceptional film that shows very well 74 years later its release in 1933 because it is full of superb performances.
