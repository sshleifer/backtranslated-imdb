BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes that represent a clever way to start a story about television anchors who have no idea what they are telling. <br /> <br /> In a speech before a group of - journalists, all bored by his presentation, many of them leave. When the last one comes out, the co-host of the event says quietly to HOLLY HUNTER: "I don't think there will be questions and answers". Thin line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy, a farce about the aspect of the television show anchor biz. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HURT is the still inept who finds himself working with HOLLY HUNTER as a network anchorman. Hurt desperately needs help with corrective reports and Holly refuses to take the bait - at first. He knows he is only capable of looking good, but he is not a reporter. It proves to be a quick study as long as its headset works and receives all the information directed by executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's other anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps to give her the information she transmits hurting. Obviously she becomes confrontational about her feelings for the ace reporter Brooks and equally strong attraction for the funny anchorman Hurt, who has his passion with a rather nice staff member. <br /> <br /> You have to wait up to twenty minutes before the film ends up finding out which man it will end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything he is against. In this unpredictable comedy, it is not clear who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will be. <br /> <br /> Fittingly, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were nominated for an Oscar (Brooks in supporting role), as was the film itself and the director / writer James L. Brooks. All in all, seven well-deserved Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script does not include a happy conventional ending - and, in this case, this is the only flaw in the brilliant script. I felt cheated and a little disappointed by the melancholy conclusion.
