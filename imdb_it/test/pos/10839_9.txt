This is a superb TV series, it's nice and for once realistic! the portrait of lesbian women is delicately managed and well done. Moreover, the direction is wonderful and the sumptuous and rich settings, a real surprise. If you missed the first one, I suggest you watch the next few weeks, 21:00, BBC 2
