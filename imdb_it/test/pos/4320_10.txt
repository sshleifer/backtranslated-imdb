* May contain spoilers, read only after seeing the last episode of season 2 * Think about it. The boys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Are you looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something: "we missed it again?" So there was another anomaly? Of course it was when the plain crashed! I think this whole island is a setup. Created by his father. He discovered it and is looking for Desmond. How else can he know what to look for. <br /> <br /> So basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. Everything is false. All the signs are fake beards, fake doors, counterfeit medicines, false observation stations, with fake air ducts that lead to nothing. It's really a project, and thanks to the final scene of the season 2 finale I know he has to do something with Desmond, his girlfriend and his father (and probably Libby, it's weird, maybe he really has something to do with the plane that he crashes, OK I'm drifting now. <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates, and he will find the help. This is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield. " once you're gone, there's no way to go back ". <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty obvious, despite the many questions I still have and I hope to get answers for next season. what we learned in the first and second season, I'm sure we will receive many answers in the third season. <br /> <br /> I can't wait. <br /> <br /> Can anyone agree on this theory? I hope to hear from you ...
