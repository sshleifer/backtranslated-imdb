There is no doubt that the independent film Eddie Monroe is one of the best independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance by Paul Vario. I first saw Paul, or "Big Paulie" as he was named in Danny Provenzano's hit movie, "This Thing Of Ours". Fortunately, the filmmaker "Eddie Monroe" did the same and used Paul's undeniable abilities in a leading role (main?). A performance came out (also with the use of the video camera and the voice-over) that proves to be worthy of big-budget studio roles in the near future. It's nice to see an experienced actor engaged in the trade demonstrate the same thing to the public. Keep up the good work Big Paulie and we'll see you soon in Hollywood! Not bad for a Canarsie child, eh?
