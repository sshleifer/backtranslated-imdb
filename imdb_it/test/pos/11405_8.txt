All you need is a big house, a babysitter and a phone. Simon West directs this electrifying and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror film. Emotionally tense with a growing fear factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) needs to process an excessive phone bill; assumes the task of babysitting the two children of Dr. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful masterpiece in wood and glass from the 1970s. Secluded and peaceful. The children are already in bed, the wind accumulates and joins the pouring rain. The phone starts ringing, ringing, ringing. The babysitter is soon in a frantic survival mode for fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone. <br /> <br /> Belle is fantastic as the innocent, intelligent and strong teen babysitter. The voice of the stranger on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also present are Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Congratulations to James Dooley for the original and atmospheric music.
