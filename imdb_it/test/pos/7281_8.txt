This is a very dark film, a little better than the average Asylum movie. It was much better than I thought, it's a combination of psychological thriller and horror film. <br /> <br /> The voice on the phone is really disturbing - this faceless voice, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film, since we never see the killer face left to the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> The action and the suspense never decay and after the first half of the film, it becomes dizzying; there is not much blood in this film, just enough to serve the story, and even the director does a good job of keeping your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this film an 8/10 because some clich√©s.
