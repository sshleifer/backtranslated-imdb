Had it been made 2 years later, it would have been BANNED! The number one MUST SEE the recommendation of the day! The best Rouben Mamoulian film I've seen so far (I haven't seen J + H yet). <br /> <br /> It's no wonder why this film has received less than 200 votes. A larger greyzone that does not care about what is right would not be seen again until the 1960s. Morally ambiguous and dark like the determination of the 70s but with a certain charm. Obviously this had to remain low in the last 30 and unfortunately does not seem to have been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Really. This took everything. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and this time not very lovable Guy Kibbee. And a powerful good director. So far I have not been the biggest fan of RM, but I really enjoyed his films and with that he made a new championship. One of the best 30 movies I've ever seen! This is something I didn't even think existed! 9.5 / 10
