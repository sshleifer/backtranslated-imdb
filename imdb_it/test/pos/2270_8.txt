The actor directed the director Liev Schreiber (The sum of all fears) makes a film version above the average of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by the author Jonathan Safran Foer. This story of travel and self-discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and a strong direction with a plot that enriches and illuminates the soul. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who saw his grandfather, Safran, pass by. Jonathan has a habit of taking small items and small heirlooms and sealing them in zip-lock plastic bags to show them on his wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old photo showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. So Jonathan begins a long journey to locate this mysterious woman in Ukraine without knowing if she is still alive. He enlists the help of a brazen, young tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to bring him to his goal. At the beginning the journey hits dead ends and false clues, but when the group approaches the target, the men find themselves in the ruins of a dark chapter of history with memories of war and the ghosts of the past of a non-existent city. There, they find their respective destinies and will be changed forever by what they learn. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be directed by someone who knew how to get the most out of his actors. Sometimes the film is spoken in Russian and looks like a foreign film. The title itself is a game of self-discovery. This is a meditative journey of a man in his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey also becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather. It is a story of long-term bonding and the sense of guilt one has to endure for a lifetime. At the end of the film, these characters have all lived life-altering events that permanently weave their lives. It shows that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and purifying the soul. It also concerns one's inheritance and the way others see an event or a person in the past. Eventually Alex sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Our perception of these people will also be changed at the end of the film, which is a tribute to a well-told story. <br /> <br /> History is deceptively simple. It works like a road movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mysterious story. It really involves many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present. The finish is a bit surreal with its feeling of déjà vu. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Sin City, the eternal light of mind without spots) has chosen a wide range of roles since he played in The Lord of the Ring Trilogy. Here, he does a great job with what is essentially a minimalist role with little to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin are better off as Alex and his grandfather respectively. Even the dog of the grandfather named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (it is true) is funny as a faithfully faithful companion. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Paul Cantelon is a complimenting compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. The change is effective because the images of the past and present are connected and transferred without effort. The cinematography of Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is appropriately bare and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its consequences. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film render a good drama but are a bit too casual. We never fully understand the whole story of Alex's grandfather and what his motives are. Similarly, Jonathan's empty looks and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a bizarre man. Sometimes, the movie feels a bit down and depressing as other horrible revelations are revealed. But these are minor criticisms of what is a good introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of memory and closure. That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile story is a tribute to his talent and his promising future potential.
