It is a pity that this film has had no more show in theaters. It's a rich and structured love story with believable and all-too-human characters, who are too busy playing and protecting their hearts to recognize The Real Thing when they experience it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is its setting in Chicago, among fashionable African-Americans, artists, writers and bourgeois who discuss poetry, music and literature. Another is his Royal Fineness, Larenz Tate - and if you are also a half fan, you have to see this movie! His male arrogance and vulnerability are perfect for the role of Dario. Nia Long also shines like Nina, who wishes to tell Dario that she loves him but is afraid of breaking "the Rules". A great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your sweetheart!
