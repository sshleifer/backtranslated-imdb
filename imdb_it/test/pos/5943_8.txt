What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only the French can do this kind of thing without being coarse. And as a result, you have a really good time watching Jean Dujardin play the silent role. Most of the film is on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good movie. He has the perfect way to exaggerate with the type of James Bond who is not as good as Mike Meyers at Austin Powers, for example. The dialogues are also good enough to keep the viewer's attention high, with lots of stupid jokes, which is really perfect. Both women who have the main parts of the film endure the confrontation with the main character, and this was a challenge. There is no plot in this film, but that's not what is expected of this type of film. You just want to laugh for an hour and 40 minutes, and that's exactly what the movie manages to do. It deserves the success it has in France
