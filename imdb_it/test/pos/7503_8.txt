George C. Scott gives his best and most fun with a wonderful drama even in this script by Paddy Chayefsky. Diana Rigg is an attractive and quite complicated young woman. This film veers between tragedy and chaos in a New York hospital of the late 1960s with stunning consequences. Barnard Hughes is delightful as always (a great theater actor). <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a blow when he put Vanessa Redgrave down at the 1978 Oscar ceremony, but he's a good writer. A true cast of ensembles that does miracles, down to the smallest role. This won the best script at the Oscars and Scott was nominated. He should have won for this instead of PATTON the year before (which was also brilliant). Look for it!
