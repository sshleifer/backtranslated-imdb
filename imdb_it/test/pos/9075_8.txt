My mother always told me to sit down and really watch this movie because it's one of her favorites, I've never done it for years until I took a night on TV. This film was great, I don't even know how to explain it. Not only is the cast excellent (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is fantastic. It's scary but not too scary and makes you think. I was speechless after this film and amazed at how good actors and actresses are really all these five people. Where William Baldwin went, it's fantastic. This film is a must see for anyone, if you haven't seen it go to rent it, you won't regret it. Amazing!
