I took this movie from eBay mainly because I'm gay and I love Til Schweiger. However, it is one of those films that, when you look at it a second time, you never tell yourself "Hmm, I forgot this boring part, I'm going to make popcorn". It doesn't have that part. It is a very fluid and constantly interesting film. And, yes, Til Schweiger is worth it, if nothing else. But it's a good film even for straight guys.
