Hello. Hello and goodbye. but, before I go, I want to talk to you. I just want to quickly mention some key points about this film. the first is erotic. especially homo-erotica. <br /> <br /> yes, well. Let's start. When a man and a man love each other very much, they blend together in a spectacular, not to say tender, explosion of cinema that we call the merchant of Venice. <br /> <br /> the erotic homo love was sensual for the worse. and even more sensual at best. it was hardcore and emotional. touched me inappropriately and I'm pretty sure I touched it. and when no one looked I touched myself a little too much. <br /> <br /> I laughed because the portia was denied. he was second in line to our friend, the homo erotic love. oh Antonio antoni. just tones i love you. more than you loved that boy. whose name may or may not contain a "B". it was very ugly. <br /> <br /> antoni was very fat. has soaped his body in a spell of his fat hair and sensual juices and proceeds to write on the screen and introduce himself to the boy with the name I like the film in conclusion, go see the film if not for the homo-erotic connotations, for the love of a man like Antonio. only tones
