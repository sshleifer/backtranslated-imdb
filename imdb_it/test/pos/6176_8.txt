It is a brilliant and sumptuous Czech film of the team of father and son of Sverak, all about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of England but who also fall on a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Does he present some amazing and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes? probably the best ever and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the movie Battle of Britain - and a series of interesting general themes like love, war, romance, camaraderie, loss and servitude. Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (although made easier here with the great brave Anna Massey). <br /> <br /> The film has some small motifs like the famous RAF bullseye device, shown everywhere and at some point well reflected in the black vinyl record, which revolves around music (music is another theme in the film , obviously). In addition, all the traditional icons of English life: beer glasses with dimples (unlike the straight post-war glasses used in Pearl Harbor), tea in a beautiful porcelain tea set in an English country garden (even if shot in the Republic Czech?), The mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a dart board! <br /> <br /> Of course, the airport and the surrounding countryside is ridiculously different from any other part of southern England, although the virtuous aerial sequences compensate for this by showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always in tune with southern England and the Battle of England. But the best thing is the amazing soundtrack by Ondrej Soukup, by Hans Zimmer, but all in the tradition of the deceased, excellent Ron Goodwin who made the original film of the Battle of England among the other classic British war films. There is also a nice cameo role for the ?? apparently ?? the famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline's double) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays the theme of the title, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! <br /> <br /> It also has some small and fun Freudian devices, such as always showing an inflated floating condom to the ceiling whenever Karel (the insignificant but brilliant Krystof Hadek) is stuck at the airfield while his rival love and fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actor in this film! Charles Dance is obviously as beautiful as Bent Commander Wing Commander. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and worth looking at / hiring ?? take the DVD with special features (things like how they created fights and dog stuff). Probably the only film ever to combine subtitles with characters who speak English, German, French and Czech at the same time.
