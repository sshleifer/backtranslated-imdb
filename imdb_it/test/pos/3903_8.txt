After learning that her sister Susan is thinking about divorce, Kate decides to go to the distraught woman's distant country house and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere to be seen. This is because someone killed her and stuck her body in a trunk in the basement. While a storm is raging, Kate tries to figure out where her sister might have gone and endangers her life ... the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery offers a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's film is based on a story by McKnight Malmar. Malmar's story was first shown on television in 1962 as an episode in Boris Karloff's anthology THRILLER. THRILLER remained very close to the story, which is a bit of a shame, because he could have used a bit of punches. Guaranteed Malmar wrote a moderately gruesome number, but Gerard (creator of the show ONE STEP BEYOND) adds several intelligent ingredients that increase tension and suspense.
