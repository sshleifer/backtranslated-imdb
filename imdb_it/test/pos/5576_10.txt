I happen to love this show. It is a renewed version of some old fantasies and sci-fi styles. they are not afraid to shoot, and when they do people tend to die. Too many shows are afraid of this and only end up pointing guns and then having a stalemate. Farscape also comes with a large amount of moving characters. Everyone grows up on you to the point where it confuses you by hearing them discuss taking some of the animatronic out of their box to make the mini series. From beginning to end, farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope and dispair, when new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die, surprising you every time. It is worth looking at even if you don't have the time.
