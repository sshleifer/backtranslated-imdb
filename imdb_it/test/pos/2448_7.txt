There have been many movies about people coming home from wars and having to cope, but "The War at Home" is worth seeing. Finding Jeremy Collier (Emilio Estevez), a Vietnam veteran who has trouble getting in touch with his family in Texas, it is very likely that most of the film will keep you. But nothing can prepare you for what ends up being revealed. <br /> <br /> Part of what makes this film so beautiful is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both Texas and the generation gap. Jeremy's parents, Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates) clearly have a problem with their son's attitude, both to the war and to the rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is uncertain with whom to side with. But after dinner, there can be no neutrality. <br /> <br /> So, like us Americans we will never be able to completely overcome the Vietnam War, but this film can probably help us seriously consider how many people have been influenced. Emilio Estevez has certainly done a good job of directing. Also played by Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
