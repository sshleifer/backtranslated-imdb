Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations from the novel to the screen I saw in the movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with an excellent characterization, from the lost Chabert of Depardieu to the proud lawyer of Fabrice Luchini to the complicated widow of Fanny Ardant. The film has a wonderful dimension, as one might expect from a great filmmaker like Yves Angelo. The characters keep this film running and, even if a little slow at the beginning, it takes rhythm and is a good film when it reaches the finish line.
