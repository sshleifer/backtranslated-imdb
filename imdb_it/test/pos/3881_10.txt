For those out there who like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love movies, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie films with funny dialogues and cleverly written, then this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> For those with little attention, high expectations and no brains ... well .. er .. you might get bored and find things that drag you down sometimes. <br /> <br /> This is a fascinating game, modest and well-structured film with the actors that give a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I giggled all over myself ... <br /> <br /> This film is a little gem.
