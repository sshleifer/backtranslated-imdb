This must be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family that leaves everything behind to live in the desert. When mom and dad lose both jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. They decide it is in their family's interest to move to Oregon. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters compliments this film. Including a young Molly Ringwald, this is a film that I highly recommend.
