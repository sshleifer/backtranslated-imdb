I am giving this film 9 out of 10 just because there are not enough specific scientific references for the amount of energy needed to produce food to satisfy the haters of science. mdixon seems to believe that explicitly distorted commentators are doing these things, but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that, at least, they are on a solid scientific ground when they say that we cannot continue to depend on oil, we must switch to different types of energy, and we don't have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil. Other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have died. Read "Collapse" by Jared Diamond which is a popular book, or any elementary Ecology or Earth Science textbook and you can check the basic premises of this film. Go ahead, armed while Rome burns!
