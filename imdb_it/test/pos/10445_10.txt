Sounds like the usual T & A movie of the teenage audience, but the feeling is incredibly dark. If it had been made today, it would be considered an arthouse film. He goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to fuck, but the results of his efforts are hard, cruel and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The whole teen flick formula is respected, but nothing would happen you'd expect. Imagine a director's cut from "It's a Wonderful Life" in which, in the end, James Stewart was not allowed to return to the real world. An incredible film that subverts all the expectations of the genre. It makes you feel dirty later: there is no ransom for the characters. I am amazed that it was never created. The eighties version of Detective Story.
