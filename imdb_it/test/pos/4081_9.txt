As a former Seaman merchant I was really interested in this film: I was personally involved in a clandestine search to leave Kingston in Jamaica where a person was found. We were able to bring it to the shore even though we were in the territorial limits. On another ship that I was on the clandestine was found and we could not land it anywhere due to passport / nationality problems. In fact, he remained for a year as an almost "honorary" crew member and worked for his keep. Africa is famous for illegal pick-ups. There is a great scene at the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the African port: its size diminishes everything. The crew went ashore for a small relationship and drunkenness. So far normal. The drama begins when the illegal immigrants enter the vast cavernic holds of the ship. Joss Ackland is as brilliant as the captain with a problem with drinks harassed by his Nemesis Suchet right on the form of the Companys representative on board. The clandestine search is classic but we had no guns. I wonder about the use of guns in this film. This ship seemed to have a vast armory. In my experience, weapons at sea are severely limited due to customs regulations. Even having a dog on board was strange. The anti-rabies laws, especially in Europe, severely restrict the transport of animals. In any case, Pertwee is as brilliant as the bitter Bitter. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the sad metallic background of the ships holds up and the feeling that there is no place to hide is added to the drama. Some merchant crew members are not involved in the murder and those involved are gradually sucked into a world of violence from which there is no escape. The chase through the ship, in particular the engine room scenes, are "edge on the seat": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. The feeling of metal that presses in and death is just a gun barrel. The film is brutal: my girlfriend had to give up looking at it during the shooting and typing scenes. While this goes on Suchet in the comfort of his well-appointed cabin he gets drunk unaware of the chaos of chaos 3 below. It is a stretched film, imperfect in some parts, but the real message is that we can all be sucked into violence like this. Slowly and surely. Think of the drivers who brought Jews to Auschwitz, the salesmen who had worked out the train schedules. I always remember someone who had visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and said one of the guards of S.S. he had put a bird table outside the camp crematorium. This film is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!
