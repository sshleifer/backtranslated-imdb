I think this is a film that was heart-wrenching. Richard Donner (Directed the most successful film "Superman"), did a great job directing this film. Some of the segemets were good, and many were horrible because, Bobby (Mazzello) was beaten by the King (Baldwin, and especially their dog, Shane attacked the King, which means he paid for what he had done to Bobby. <Br / > <br /> Elijah Wood, played an important role in this film: the memorable scene in this, he dreamed he had taken the buffalo's advice on Bobby who was abused. Lorraine Bracco, (Pre-Soprano) had played an impressive role. br /> <br /> I give this movie *** out of four !!!
