with what they had, John and Carolyn were very close, so the writers had to put together what they could. I really liked Portia de Rossi like Carolyn, but Jacqueline Bisset's voice irritated me. He should have used his normal voice. I would have preferred the whole movie to focus on John and Carolyn instead of reworking stuff we already know about John.
