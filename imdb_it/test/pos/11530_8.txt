It's 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who grows up with an idealized view of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the agent, the seeker of truth, the fixer of all the wrongs of the world. Then one day, Phoebe and her mother Gail (Blythe Danner) get the news that Faith is dead. Faith killed itself. Both Phoebe and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, though saddened, mourns Gail. Phoebe can't let him go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> It's 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 and decides to go to Europe for her mother's objections to discover the truth. When he was alive, Faith was inseparable from a man she called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf said he didn't know anything about Faith's last days, Phoebe convinced him to tell her everything. Within a few days, Wolf realizes that he has not let go of the past and joins Phoebe on his pilgrimage to Portugal. <br /> <br /> In the end, Wolf is able to tell Faith's dignity in drug abuse and his own fault for not preventing suicide. Though angry, Phoebe finally understands how human and fragile Faith was. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I am old enough to remember the Red Army bank robbery and I was 10 in 1969. This story was familiar to me. I can still remember the young people trying to decide whether to go to Canada or not to avoid the draft. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that time. Camilla Belle was fun and fun to watch while she portrayed her adoring young sister excited by what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster easily slipped into the role of the oldest Phoebe. Blythe Danner was the mother always sympathetic, a role that she is all too familiar with American TV, unfortunately. I would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with. Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. Although at times, his performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come out of a news story. Of all the characters, it was Wolf by Christopher Eccleston, who made the most growth. When the character is introduced to us at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a worldly man. He is a patient and kind man full of anger at the injustices of the world. In the end, he realizes that the direction in which he and Faith are going is wrong and begins to "grow" by deciding that he should fight injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him in this and eventually leads to his death. Eccleston's Wolf is the most real of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was fun and challenging. "The Invisible Circus" is rated TV-MA, but there are very few curses, sex or violence. The topic of the film is the reason for the evaluation.
