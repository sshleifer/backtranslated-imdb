This film is probably the best new French film I've seen so far in this century. There have been large ones, including Noe's Irreversible, Le Pont des Arts by Green and Innocence by Hadzihalilovic, none of which comes close to the timeless glory of Les Amants Reguliers. <br /> <br /> The film is a description of the events of May 68 and what followed in tow and also is and is an update of, and a tribute to, the Nouvelle Vague films of those days. As for the representation of revolts in Paris, the film is meticulously accurate (I am only 19 years old and I wasn't there by myself but you understand what I mean) and the very real and very long riot scenes prepare the stage perfectly for the consequences. of events in the streets of Paris. The revolts are not glorified or magnificently photographed like those of Bertolucci's The Dreamers (to which the film is comparable in many ways), but are shot in dirty black and white shots courtesy of the excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story that is the main concern of the film after the revolts of the 68 is filmed in breathtaking and much less blurred scenes and manages to arouse true feelings of love and confusion in the midst of an otherwise politically interested and apparently cold environment. > <br /> This film is a beautiful love story and radiates through it that the director wants to represent his own experiences of those legendary 60s that make the film even more compelling. But the film is also a tribute to the entire canon of Nouvelle Vague. Much of the dialogue soon evokes Truffaut, and the length and non-action and less structured texture are reminiscent of Eustache or Rivette. There are even verfremdung effects similar to Godard with people looking directly into the camera and turning directly to Bernardo Bertolucci. This film is undoubtedly a response song to Bertolucci's The Dreamers and is also a tribute to Nouvelle Vague, but it stands alone as a beautiful and radiant love story. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This film is incredible and if you love French cinema you shouldn't sleep on it. It could be the best French film after Eustache's La Mamain et la Putain.
