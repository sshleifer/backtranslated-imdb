Watch out for the Scottish game! In his compelling and heartbreaking work, Dario Argento returns to the classical form, regaining the composure he lost during the shooting of shocking and delirious psychopaths like Darkness and Phenomena. In fact, based on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent sets, sequences of imaginatively imaginative killers and refined photographs, the film looks like the Silver we once knew. The only real infringement of Opera is the lack of a soundtrack by Goblin, which provided unusual, iconic and timeless music for many of the greatest Silver films (the opera selections used here are still wonderful). <br /> <br /> The production is compiled by different competent actors. While she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra's double, Cristina Marsillach, manages to seize enough courage and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as a horror-film-helmer-became opera director Marco. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively short role (watch the making of featurettes on DVD for an exhilarating interview with Nicolodi about her role - clearly brazen and resentful about the end of her relationship with Argento!) Stage fans Fright (another excellent thriller of 1987, directed by Michele Soavi, who worked as director of the second unit for the Opera) will barely recognize the last girl in that film, Barbara Cupisti, as stage manager here (I think they are the glasses to do it). With me, it's often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination / obsession with solitary nightmare images makes him my ideal filmmaker. The work is full of little details that left me grinning. For example, I like that we never see the face of "The Great" Mara Czekova. I also love the scene where the killer is scraping the tip of his deadly dagger on a television screen that shows Betty's performance as Lady Macbeth. In the end, I also challenge the veterans of the most sloppy veterans not to shudder while the "skittles" are placed over Betty's eyes. <br /> <br /> In short, Opera is a clean, tense and tense thriller. With his solid performances, lucid focus and literal cinematography, he aims to be in the same league as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Could the work be the last big yellow?
