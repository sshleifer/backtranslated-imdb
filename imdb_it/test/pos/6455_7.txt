Clearly modeled after the first gangster films Warner produced the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931), this gangster film is one of the best efforts I've seen. Although not quite in the same category as the classics mentioned above, it has a powerful performance by the young Sylvia Sidney. It is magnificent and offers its most natural jokes than perhaps anyone has ever done at that time. Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage of his career and shows signs of what will follow in the coming years when he gets to the top. The film has some fascinating villains in Paul Lukas (I've never seen him so detestable) and Guy Kibbee (which is silly to see him act as a thug). The director of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive, probably the first voiceover to show a person the thoughts appear in this film. If you have the chance to see this little gangster movie, don't miss the chance.
