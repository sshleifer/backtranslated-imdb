Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are a joy to watch in this dejected comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was an emerging star when the film was made, is a real blast. Dean Stockwell, in a message from John Gotti, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, like the paranoid and over the top, Connie steals the movie. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, previously known for extravagant comedies like "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard" - proves once again to be a genius. I was not at all surprised when he won the Oscar for directing "Silence of the Lambs". The performances he evokes from his actors in "Married" are inspired and the audience is carried on for a wild and woolly race. <br /> <br /> One of the most likeable and fascinating films of the 80s, stands at the head and shoulders above many of the satires of his era.
