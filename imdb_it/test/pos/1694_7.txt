In the Landscape after the Battle, Andrzej Wajda paints the emotional and psychological confusion in a former Nazi prison in Poland, released immediately after the Second World War, in the second era of his directorial career. <br /> <br /> A hand-held camera explores a lot of extreme close-ups and vivid colors. The final credit as graffiti on the sides of freight cars symbolizes the film. The soundtrack is fantastic, except for Vivaldi, who sounds very vulgar in pop-art fashion, in the opening sequence.
