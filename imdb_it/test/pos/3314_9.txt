Having grown up in the age of the typing pool and dealing with office politics and men who were willing to make a feast of beauties in a delicious meal every day, this film hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this film to star alongside the wonderful GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be inside and I think he did well and resisted over time. The best kiss on the screen between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd. <br /> <br /> It may not seem that all this is plausible, but in reality it has been and probably is still subject to sexual harassment. I thought the film was well done except for the terrible acting of Evans. What a fat ball but he found his niche somewhere else. Apart from that, everyone got closer to the plate.
