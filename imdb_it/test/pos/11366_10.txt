I followed this whole series when I was a child in elementary school, by choice, not because it was necessary for school. I read the comedies to the rhythm of the series. Experience has given me a lifelong love for Shakespeare and history. He also gave me some acting bugs, even if it was just amateur. Every time I read one of Shakespeare's plays, the images that come to mind first come from this black and white production, seen on a large "mobile" TV with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" and the fluctuations that accompany that. <br /> <br /> Even if the sets were minimal, if I remember correctly, this was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good. At the time I had no idea who the actors were. Now I see that many of them have become famous over the years. I particularly enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, whom I now see played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would love to see it available on video, especially since many of the songs are rarely played and even fewer are available on video. It would also be useful as a document of television theatrical production in the mid-twentieth century.
