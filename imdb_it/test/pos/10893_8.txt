This is one of my favorite James bond games because: The missions are fun to play, they have a lot of action where they can be difficult to make fun the weapons you use. The way James Bond appears in this James Bond game is beautiful, you can see the brosnan penetrating him which is beautiful and all the other characters in this game look like the actors who played them in the film. There is no way not to have fun playing this game. I loved it. The game also follows the movie more or less something, but it follows the film a lot. Also this James Bond game has quite good graphics for Nintendo 64 and, apart from that, there was no voice on the actors in this game, but who cares as long as the game is fun. <br /> <br /> Overall score ** ****** outside **********
