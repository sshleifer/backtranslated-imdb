15 Park Avenue, well, the name seems to me initially a New York address and the film set in Kolkata. However, as the plot develops, one realizes the thin line that the director tries to walk between relationships, social causes and, of course, the world of schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is a director who has much more to say and has less time available. Well, no doubt she managed to make a good movie. In a sense, it makes us understand that everyone is probably looking for our '15 Park Avenue '. It's a never-ending quest within each of us ... <br /> <br /> The performance of Shabana Azmi's power plant is a pleasure to watch. His presence on the screen brings a lot of life into the scene. In fact it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after so long because I expected it to be Konkona Sen's ground. Shabana makes you feel the deep skin of an older sister who is conducting the entire show for a rather unlucky family this period almost forgets to live his life. She oppresses all her ambitions and desires with her 18-year-old younger sister (who is more like a daughter to her) and an elderly mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. As for the lead actress in Guide (that's how I can remember her instantly) there is almost nothing to say except a few lines and tears here and there. Rahul Bose, always reliable, plays another key role in the film, showing the emotions of a middle-aged man with repentance on his face to almost perfection. This man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. From a musician of Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and many others ?? It's versatile and I really want to have more shots in the first part of the movie. The cameo in the film is by Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She is really beautiful and paints the role of a mother of 2 children very easily. It gives you a taste of today's Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's previous relationships. <br /> <br /> The focus of the camera was Meethi, played by Konkona. She and her schizophrenic world make up the core of 15 Park Avenue. He really worked hard for the character, but there are times when he can't relate to the audience. The fatal accident of his life tries to chase each other out of sympathy and has only been partially successful. <br /> <br /> The film tries to tackle a lot of things at once starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a woman even in today's modern India and also the twisted relationships in a family shredded. And I believe that Aparna has succeeded to some extent. The impotence of Meethi while working as a journalist in an eastern rural state really gives us an image of the country of which we are so proud. <br /> <br /> Well after finishing 15 Park Avenue, there was an inexhaustible thirst inside me. I wanted more from this movie to get soaked emotionally. It was a commendable effort by the director, except for a few hiccups. Must look for everyone who likes to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose.
