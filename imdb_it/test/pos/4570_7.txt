Caught this recently after noticing the name of James Earl Jones on the title. It was better than I expected. Obviously it's quite old - made during the early 1970s, but it's actually a decent drama. It runs for about 90 minutes and shows good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a black woman on wellness who has 6 children and tries to deal with all the problems that persist. This makes the view interesting ..... even in the fact that the script was not too sentimental or too dramatized - it's almost like watching a slice of the past. All the styles of the 70s are out in abundance. The finish is a bit kooky though ... probably he would have done better without theatricality.
