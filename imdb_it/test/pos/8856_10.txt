In following the lines of the classic formula to the point of making another leap from the material, the remake of The Thing becomes one of the coolest remakes of his time. John Carpenter comes out of what must have been a pretty vague script on certain things (or maybe very descriptive that they know), bringing on incredible and fantastic Rob Bartin puppets and animatronics (with Stan Winston also in the team). These effects help establish the tone against the harsh and detached environment that Carpenter brings into contact with his characters. The film tells the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, as opposed to an evil force that takes the forms of others. A full life is given by the choice of Carpenter's tones and surprises. For someone who follows in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the director here has much more confidence and talent in performing the material than most of the chance of having another movie with an old movie. <br /> <br /> With the effects people working at full strength, between what probably will follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become excessive, but everything fits the suspense after a while) - the actors behave like a nice group. Unlike the team in Predator, these are mostly just regular boys, with the leader coming from MacCreedy of Kurt Russell (excellent role for his style, excellent in fact). Successful support roles are up for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the kind of absurdity of what is happening in the film (an alien that starts with dogs and then moves onto others in a cretura, a demented form of transformation) is a well against such a tone of timing with all. I loved the long silences sometimes, with the strange and curious music of Ennio Morricone in the background (and that bass line itself is in itself). <br /> <br /> It ranks with being, if nothing else, offering what it fights for its genre / cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film in which the story is told clearly and precisely through the camera position, dialogue and time with the scenes. This does not mean that the film is not full of violence, it is, and in fact it is almost funny a couple of times. But since it dates back to what seems ridiculously a bygone era, the creatures / make-up, along with the constant and well-calculated script, have been made completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real and atmospheric at a T.
