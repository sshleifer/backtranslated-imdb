The other night I saw it on an on-demand cable and I thought "this is the kind of film that could have been played in Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns if it was made in the late 1950s". A farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portraits. Naomi Watts simply sizzles in a womanish Jayne Mansfield-ish (if she could have acted). The rest of the cast has some great curves and bits. The Welsh landscape is delightful. An absurd premise, really and not at all credible, but that does not hinder the fun. It's not a BIG movie, mind you, but a really fun watch. And Walken is at his best weirdo. A joy to see!
