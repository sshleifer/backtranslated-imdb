In Dublin, the crippled rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves to the Residential Home for the Disabled in Carrigmore, affecting the lives of residents. Roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson), who was left in the shelter by his famous father many years ago due to his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and take on the magnificent Siobhan (Romola Garai) to assist them. Living with Rory, Michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom and learning to survive on his own. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The performances of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy are fantastic and I don't understand how they haven't been nominated for an Oscar with such magnificent shows. Romola Garai also has a high level performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. The script is touching, never banal and without redemption and the precise direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately the Brazilian DVD title is shamefully ridiculous, giving the wrong idea of ​​this excellent film. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The best years of our life")
