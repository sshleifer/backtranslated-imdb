Some films want us to think, some want to excite us, some want to get excited. But sometimes, a movie just wants to make us laugh, and "In & Out" definitely has success in this department. <br /> <br /> Indiana high school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is about to marry teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) in three days, but the whole city is more excited about the nomination at the Oscar of former inhabitant Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon). But when Cameron wins an Oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks gay teacher Howard for inspiration. What follows is that Howard denies it in a hilarious series of setbacks in a truly extravagant way. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline is great, exuding gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a talent for lawyers' antics. Debbie Reynolds is quite hilarious as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a cry as a homophobic principal. <br /> <br /> Gay screenwriter Paul Rudnick achieves a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that is mostly tolerable to Midwestern conservatives and yet largely inoffensive to the gay public. It's not exactly progressive, but it's fun and harmless, and certainly a step ahead of "The Birdcage" from the previous year.
