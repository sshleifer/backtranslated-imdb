I saw it for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe close to 20. In a way, it was better than I remembered ... in others, it was MUCH worse. <br /> <br /> First of all, there's the music. It's just awful. There are only 5 songs in the film, many of which you use more than once. The opening song is screamed by a chorus of annoying children, and the disco-y song is played by Rick Dees. There is nothing worse than that. Even the background music is terrible, with many of these repeating the themes of the other nauseating songs. We also have a little lame slapstick, especially in the opening titles. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is brilliant as usual ... one has to wonder if he criticized the whole thing, or if the writers just gave him all the funny jokes. Or maybe it's just great, turning a weak script into a comic genius. The best part is his surreal PA announcements. ("Lobsters ... get out of here ... you're a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also have a lot more character development than you have the right to expect in a movie like this. At least half the characters look like real people ... and mostly real people you'd like to have around. Even "Spaz" manages to do more than any other Eddie Deezen character and when the girl arrives it's plausible. (It's not absurdly sexy, but it doesn't automatically pair with one of the nerd girls - see "Revenge Of The Nerds" for examples of both film phenomena.) <br /> <br /> And when the plot looks cliché Well, you need to know if it wasn't a cliché when they did it. Although it wasn't the first summer movie, I had to go back to "The Parent Trap" at least - it's definitely the movie that made it a genre of its own. In fact, I was surprised that there wasn't a Talent Show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" falsified the summer camp genre so perfectly, I thought it was all straight out of Meatballs. (I had also expected Jon Cryer to stay in a convertible with a chimp, thanks to "Mr. Show's", the epic "Mr. Monk Academy" Olympic camp) <br /> <br /> Anyway, this seems to be fading a little until the late 70s / early 80s, it's no longer a basic cable, and certainly doesn't have the cult following of Caddyshack or Animal House. I was glad to see it in Showtime today and in high definition! Sure, it's pretty awful in the points, but you could do a lot worse in a teenage comedy from the 70s / 80s. And yet, Murray is a genius.
