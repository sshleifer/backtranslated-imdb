Like many people, I was interested in "More" just for the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which turned out to be the only Pink Floyd album I still listen to after all these years. It was rather a surprise to come across the film in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. It was an even greater surprise to find out that it is a rather beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Visually it is quite beautiful, especially when the two protagonists are hopping on the rocks of the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of music from the soundtrack, which as far as I can tell is exclusively Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a joy to see the film with my copy of the album next to me, mentally marking each track as it was used in the film. The short piece of "A Spanish Piece" by Dave Gilmour was the only one I didn't hear, and several tracks were used quite prominently, in particular "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver". This last track is boring in the soundtrack album, but it works very well during the film's title sequence, re-emerging at least once. Maybe now I can appreciate it in the album, now that I have some visual elements that accompany it in my mind. <br /> <br /> The plot of "More" is a bit difficult to take at times, especially at the beginning, when the film seems to be only a vehicle to demonstrate the elegance of those involved in doing so. But in the end the film shows that it has much more to offer, as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does ANYBODY take heroin, fully knowing the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer this question directly, but the use of Stefan's heroin seems a logical extension of his search for pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to all Pink Floyd fans who have an appreciation of the much-overlooked "More" soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone with an interest in the counterculture of the sixties and how it has been portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this film is, since I'm too young to have experienced the Sixties firsthand, but it seems to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other film does.
