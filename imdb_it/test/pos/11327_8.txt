I thought it was a good movie. it's not my favorite of his films - chungking express is worth that place - this is very different from anything else I've seen of him. it's slow (but it's not that annoying) - it takes time and meditates on the characters .. there is a minimum movement in the frame - the camera is wonderful. the acting is great. the film looks like a long warm and comforting drink.
