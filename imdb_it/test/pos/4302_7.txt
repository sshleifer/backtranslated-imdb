This is a well-directed episode of Columbo, with some good characters too, but the story doesn't really know enough to interest and doesn't look as stratified and built as it often happens with a Columbo film. This also applies to the killer plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem so well thought out. Perhaps this film has not really taken itself seriously enough, since the film's atmosphere is mostly light. At least compared to the different Columbo films. <br /> <br /> For example, the film presents a quantity of comic relief, mostly from the character of Columbo himself. It makes the film pleasant to watch, but it also gives you the feeling of having exaggerated it, also because it does not correspond to most of Columbo's films. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and help characterize Martin Landau in a dual role. It is always fun to see how different he still is as a young man, while for example a person like Peter Falk has practically changed nothing over the years, he has only become grayer. The film also includes Julie Newmar, among others, who is best known for playing Catwoman in the '60s in "Batman". It's strange how he still moves as a Catwoman in this movie. Is it intentional or is it just his way of acting? <br /> <br /> It's a fun and good movie to watch with the Columbo movie, but it also gives you the feeling that everything could have been much better with a better script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
