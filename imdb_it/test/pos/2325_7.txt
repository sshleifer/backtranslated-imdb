This is a VERY undervalued movie to say the least. As has been pointed out in previous posts, this film has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script, but you find yourself saying "Who cares?" while you milk (or insert a drink of your choice here) through the nose. It was indeed due to a rare mix of synchronized actors. While Kelsey Grammar is obviously a talented actor (referring to "Frasier", this film), supporting actors / actresses perform their roles quite well. I found it interesting how they played the part about Duane Martin who shot in the "big game" of Navy's basketball team; If any of you are a basketball fan, you will remember Martin from "White Men Can not Jump" and "Above the Rim" and you will know that Martin had a brief time with the Knicks in the NBA. Nice as they have cast credible attributes like this into credible characters. Rob Schneider's anal-retentive character was the perfect reward for Grammar's calm demeanor. Lauren Holly played the brave sexpot with a brain well enough to make you want her to succeed. This is a movie that will make you laugh even if you've seen it many times before ... the comic pieces of this film definitely last. I still find myself laughing 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is he one of my chickens?" "Uhhh ... no, this is a parrot .... from the Caribbean." "Well, don't let it fly away ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
