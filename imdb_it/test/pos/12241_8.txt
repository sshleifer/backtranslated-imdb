Or maybe not. Whatever you think of "Broadcast News", good or bad, almost all the credit for that "thought" belongs to writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of whom he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to make a whole deal - in this case the "business" is television news - but doing it with a smile, a wink, a conscious nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do everything that requires real talent, something that Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance. <br /> <br /> A user on this site, in his summary, asked the musical question: "Did Walter Cronkite behave like this?" Answer: No! Obviously not! And the reason is that in the time of Walter - Mr. Cronkite - the only thing that mattered was to bring the news to the people. The same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Of course, they had to pay attention to their vows, if only to please their leaders. But all of them really LIKE the news itself. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, everything has changed. In the last 25-30 years in the field of network news, the only thing that really matters is assessments, evaluations, assessments. The bottom line. How many dollars will there be for our network news division? Don't believe it? <br /> <br /> Consider "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (aka "Stanley Stunning"). All three have been at work in their respective anchorages for the past 15-20 years (Peter had his first shot at the national anchor desk in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job). Of the three, Dan is the one with the largest field training as a reporter. Personally, I think that all three do a terrific job as a news anchor and deserve their positions. This has nothing to do with the fact that all three are actually IN those jobs. All three are now in 60 (Dan is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very beautiful. And if you think they are still beautiful now, imagine how beautiful they were at 40, when all three were hired to (say, "put") their current job. But honestly believe that any of these three would have been "put" if he had, say, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or how - heaven forfend - ME !!! Not only that, if Dan retired tomorrow, a young man (compared to today) Walter Cronkite would not be able to get his old job back. Why? Not pretty enough. And it doesn't matter that he was, or once was, "the most trusted man in America". <br /> <br /> And this is "Broadcast News". Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next handsome boy-nation-yet-still-to-be who has problems with some minor things, such as thinking alone, being able to write and knowing things. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with business standards and news ethics, who are all thrown to the wind when she falls in love with Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relationship with James L.), a leading newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he is "plush" behind the anchor desk. And many other characters so imperfect that you can really exist in the news divisions of the various networks. <br /> <br /> "Network" paved the way. Eleven years later, "Broadcast News" carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next film to unleash the network business "news you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.
