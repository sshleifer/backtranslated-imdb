Lady and the Tramp II is very colorful and the songs, in particular that of Junkyard Dogs, are pretty good. However, the family also seems too idyllic, and I can't help but realize that Scamp is unhappy when everything is forbidden. However, I also pity Angel who has never had a loving family until he meets dear and dear Jim. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is clear that the original Lady and the Tramp is better than this sequel.
