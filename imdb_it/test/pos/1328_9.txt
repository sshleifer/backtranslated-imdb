The twelve from Ocean are probably better than the eleven from Ocean. I know a lot of people wouldn't agree, but I actually liked them better. After three years, it was good to see the band return. The reason behind the robbery is a little more inspired the second time. I understand why they stole from Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last movie. This film has a little more motivation the second time. The twelve from Ocean are more fun and fresher than the eleven from Ocean. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace that says "I just walked into that new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. <br /> <br /> The Plot: about a year after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the guy who stole from the last movie) is back and says that if Ocean's eleven doesn't give him back the money they stole, he'll call the police. So Danny Ocean and the band go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old girlfriend policewoman Isabelle. After meeting him again, she starts following them. Furthermore, the gang discovers that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are. <br /> <br /> With lots of fun scenes like when Tess (Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty smart movie. It's cooler, more fun and more fun than Ocean's eleven.
