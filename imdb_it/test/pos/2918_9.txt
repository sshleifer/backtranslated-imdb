Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years, I was surprised to learn about this movie via E-bay and bought a copy for DVD of 99p. I liked the film, the plot twists and the fact that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a "family saga" rather than an action movie. The costumes and attention to detail were remarkable for his time (1955). The rear projection during the chariot race now looks awkward. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. In this film he was portrayed as "Jesus" as in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites also through the invasion of Egypt and in his concluding speech on the futility of materiality and political power. Initially a connection was made between Sinuhe, who was thrown into the Nile river in a basket of reeds, and the Old Testament of Moses. But this connection has not been doubted, this will be completely explored in a new film in which a character similar to Moses brings the monotheistic religion of Akhenaton into the wider world, if such a film will never be politically possible to achieve. It is universally accepted that women were worried that we men are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons is difficult to accept. And that Sinuhe, an educated doctor, would be so struck by Nefer as the Babylonian "femme fatale" to the point of giving her the home of her adoptive parents and the tomb is not really credible, nor that her parents would even have a grave. In real life Nefer (Nefertitti) was the wife of Akhenaton. And although Horemheb became Pharaoh, he was after a few others including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Akhenaton. <br /> <br /> But of course this is just a stickler and the movie is fun to watch and that it is Akhenaton and its monotheistic religion are a big advantage. Perhaps following the book "The De Vinci Code" and filming this film with the central secret is the foundation of our current monotheism! I await such a film with great anticipation, there are already numerous books on the subject.
