Let's face it. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly clich√©, like the Korean love dramas and movies. First of all, there are a couple of long lost brothers, one of whom falls in love with the other. Secondly, there is a not very popular girl and two beautiful and popular guys who fall in love and fight for her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic illness, which eventually takes away his life. <br /> <br /> However, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the right actors, this film probably would have disappointed the fans of the novel. But because the actors adapt perfectly to the roles, the film is compelling - I honestly couldn't stop watching. Kang Dong Won, despite his handsome face, offers an impressive and heartbreaking performance, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun, as well as all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
