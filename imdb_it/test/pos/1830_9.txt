This film is sweet, not cloying, just warm and gentle. I found it only slightly funny, and the premise * is * wildly unlikely, but the characters are so fascinating (especially those of Minnie Driver) that they got all my attention from the beginning, and soon my love too. <br /> <Br /> Bonnie Hunt did a great job in her directorial debut and also a good job with writing. I highly recommend this movie and I'll see it again, I'm sure.
