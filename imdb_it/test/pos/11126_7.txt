"Fame" is a very well done portrait of the students who live in the High School of the Arts in New York. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while they perfect their craft in the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on screen, allowing you to feel a connection with each of them. The music here is contagious and fun. The dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for an Emmy-winning television series starring Debbie Allen and some of the other actors in the film. One of the funniest "dance" films of the 80s. Oscars received for music. 8/10
