I have been a fan of Rachael since the 30MM on the food web, so I saw it grow over the years. The moment I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how much Oprah was with her, and with a good reason: she turns out to be very natural and willing to laugh at herself it's very addictive. The set is attractive and there are some new ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on). There is only one segment of celebrities, and she remains far from controversy and debate (there is enough on daytime TV). The show is a carefree getaway, and she hasn't strayed from her strength (cooking), which is excellent planning. I know there are people who hate her and hate her show; okay, you can't please everyone. And somehow, I think Rachael knows and accepts it. So just turn the channel; I don't think she'd mind.
