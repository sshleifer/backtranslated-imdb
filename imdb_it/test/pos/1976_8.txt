A little the case of the film in the film, or the theme here is the virtual game, which is the reality or even more frightening of what reality is. The real thing is that in Cronenberg there are organic things, like the pod and wonderful idea: the organic pistol, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth. If there are slower moments, the sets, the drawings and the ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. It cannot be appreciated because the way in which the film is happening is rather unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it is certainly worth it.
