I think my husband and I are a bit slow. We don't usually warm up on a series until they are almost at the end of their productive life. In this case, we didn't start looking at the KoQs until almost the sixth season. I'm not sure how he escaped our radar for so long. Besides the fact that we are not big fans of television viewing "appointment". Our programs are such that we don't like to commit ourselves to watching the series every time they arrive (and we didn't have a DVR yet). So I suppose it wasn't until TBS started running replicas on their daily schedule in the evenings when we started looking coherently. <br /> <br /> The moment we hooked, there were still a couple of seasons left before the series was canceled. But we still watch it almost every day on TBS. I almost prefer to see the series this way, because you can watch more episodes day after day and help build continuity and what's going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the episodes stand alone because the stories are not handed down from one week to another. But that's fine with me, because you can watch an episode, then lose weeks and get back together. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be outrageously hilarious, and some would be only slightly amusing. So I'm not sure he had the quality of the writers of Seinfeld or Raymond. But I loved the casting and the characters are all pretty credible and realistic. Kevin James is simply fun to watch! So even if the plot isn't great, James's body language and expressions make the show worth seeing. Leah Remini is as big as the "play-it-straight" wife. I think it's more difficult to play the simple character for laughter than the comic character, and he does a great job. He has a talent for sarcasm and insults like no other. She is a difficult cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father, who lives with them in their basement. <br /> <br /> This is a great series and I'm sorry when it was canceled. But thank you very much to TBS for keeping the King alive in the replicas!
