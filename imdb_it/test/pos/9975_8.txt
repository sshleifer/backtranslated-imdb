this film has a decent story in my opinion, very good fighting scenes but I was a little disappointed by the end of the film. I think it was a better way if even Lydie's denier knew karate or if he could use some weapons his character became even more interesting and she was a decent opponent for Cynthia. I think when the director filmed the final "battle" between cynthia & denari he wanted to finish the film first, so he didn't care how the end would end up all in all I think Cynthia Rothrock fans will be very happy watching this movie. It's not like "yes, ma'am"! or sworn for justice, but it was enough entertainment and Cynthia looks fantastic in this movie, so my speed for this movie is an 8/10
