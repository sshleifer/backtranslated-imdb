Being advertised as the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically suggests that it will be glorified and clich√© (for fear of the budget). However, with a budget of 8 million and a half of the film in English, it wasn't exactly a big budget, high-risk film. <br /> <br /> What we have is a great epic tale focused on the friendship of two people, the young Karel and the old Frantisek. As pilots of the Czech Air Force when the Germans invade before the start of World War II, they flee the country to England to join the RAF. <br /> <br /> Their friendship becomes tense through the love of the same woman. However, there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond just being friendly. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember that it was not the winners, the Germans defeated only to be invaded by the Russians. <br /> <br /> Funny, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and enlightening, this film is one of my favorite war movies. Above all, I like the way they make fun of the English in a way that is incredibly affectionate and offers an extraordinary insight into the way the British military fought the Second World War. Forget the recent American efforts (Peal Harbor), Save Private Ryan), this is the best movie of World War II for a long time.
