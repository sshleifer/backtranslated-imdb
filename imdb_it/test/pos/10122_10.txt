As one who often goes to the cinema, I must say that this was one of the most impressive films I have seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. gave exceptional performances allowing viewers to lose themselves in the various emotions and really feel for the characters. It's nice to occasionally see a film that doesn't depend entirely on special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. I wish Hollywood would produce more films of this caliber.
