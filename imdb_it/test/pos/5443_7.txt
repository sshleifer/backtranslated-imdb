This film was advertised as a comedy, but it was much more serious than the trailers were. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but I expected more laughter. Great shows by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. Worth seeing, but don't expect to roll on the floor. The film left me wondering how it would have been if the character of Robin Williams was a real person who was running for president. Would we elect a comedian? I doubt it, unfortunately. Today that kind of sincere honesty is something very lacking. This is a movie that I will add to my DVD library as soon as it is released on DVD. The film has a heart.
