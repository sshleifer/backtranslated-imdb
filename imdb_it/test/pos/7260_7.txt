Plunkett and Macleane are a wonderful update of the tradition of swashbuckling, before Johny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is carefree, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. You could almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in this. <br /> <br /> Start in a low gear, with the introduction of the characters and the definition of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but it takes over when the boys reach the highways. The robberies are grandiose and elegant, with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of bullies. The actors are engaging and help to raise the material a bit, which is rather empty. There is not much depth in the figures, but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Muh has been said about modern music. Vintage music tended to be more serene, which seems out of place. A classic soundtrack with Celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work, but the more modern and rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add a touch to the action. Because the characters are more legendary than reality, the accuracy in the music seems pointless. The pieces tend to adapt to the mood of the scenes on the air, so it works mainly well. I simply wonder how they lost Adam Ant's "Stand and Deliver". Make no mistake, this is not a serious film. It is pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows some of his father's visual talent, but I don't think we will see many more Oscars in his career. He seems to understand the material here and brings out a good movie. Over time it could be a name to be reckoned with. His father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director. This is definitely one to watch for a fun evening or a swashbuckling movie.
