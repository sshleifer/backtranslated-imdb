Before seeing this film, I suggest that the viewer put aside all expectations that the victims of the crimes represented receive equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator of the crime. There have been many films about crime victims. This is on the killer. <br /> <br /> "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: there are no lawyers arriving to save William Poncelet and no dramatic plot. The film does not attempt to put it in a good light; he is guilty, he is repugnant, he is a racist and he was responsible for murders. That being said, we are asked to do something very difficult: to look at it as a human being despite its crimes. In this way, the film challenges the idea that the death penalty offers "justice". Whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises doubts about whether the culprits can find redemption, unfairness in the judicial system and the appropriateness of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Great interpretations of both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. In particular, the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's ability.
