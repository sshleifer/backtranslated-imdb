For people who are in the early days of making a film, I think they did a great job !! We must support the emerging industry, especially coming from the north. He was very popular when I was in the movies, a good home and good reactions and lots of laughs. It's a wellness film and that's how I felt when I left the cinema! It has northern and positive humor for the community it represents. The film has just been opened, I hope it's good, people should support this little film. I think this person "vinny ..." is very bitter, for something! And becoming too personal ??? shame!! I say well done to all those involved, have a drink on me !! I look forward to your next adventure.
