this is a TV movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, in the mid-70s. Based on how difficult it is to say, this is certainly based on the book by Mark Fuhrman. In any case, the film describes the crime in flashback and its consequences, including the arrest of a suspect, some 25 years later, which was never considered a suspect at the time. In the film, of course, Fuhram is largely responsible for stopping and closing the case for Martha's surviving family, especially her mother. The narrative of the film is of the ghost of Martha Moxley, who speaks in the first person. This is a very effective device in this film. For me, it adds more impact to the film, and puts a human face on the murder victim (if only one actress plays the part) Maggie's grace plays Martha, and I was really impressed with her. It is certainly not certain that Mark Fuhrman's motive for investigating crime could have been out. a sense of justice and maybe it really mattered to him. Or maybe it's just him aw dollar signs from a future bestseller book. In both cases, it makes an interesting and fairly fast interpretation of a film.it interesting. I don't think there were many extra, useless things in the movie, just what was needed to tell the story. It could be argued that they omitted the things that would throw a little more light on the proceedings, and one would have been right. Moreover, one could argue that the end was abrupt and again one would have been right. I said, for me, I think they told the story at least with most essential things. Everything else would probably have required a miniseries. Apart from that, there is a miniseries entitled "A Season in Purgatory" which came out 6 years before (1996) to which this film has some parallels, even if only faint. However, if you like this movie, "Then you might be interested in" A Season in Purgatory ". It is my belief that" a season in Purgatory "is actually a fictionalized tale of the same crime, however, for me, the murder to Greenwich "is an 8/10
