I really liked the film's wooden camera. I think it's a bit influenced by the Brazilian film "City of God", but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks to follow (crime and art) in the social neighborhood is a reality. <br /> <br /> I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I don't think it is unreal that he has made such beautiful films, because there are many artists who have no education whatsoever and can be genial. <br /> <br /> I really liked the soundtrack. It is adapted to images. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... it's nice to show how life can be in a social neighborhood.
