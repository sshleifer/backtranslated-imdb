I am sure that people from the United States know nothing of the rest of the world, but I think they shouldn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the United States. The only places where adolescent consented sex is illegal are the United States and Islamic nations. In France, for example, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it is 14. In Spain it is 12. So the teen actors, 16 and 17 at the time of production, are not doing anything illegal. Nudity is not considered a major problem in almost all civilized countries. And only a maniac could consider a teenager's love as child molestation.
