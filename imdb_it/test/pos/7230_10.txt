TROMEO & JULIET - 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION <br /> <br /> The work of William Shakespeare Romeo & Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films. Sometimes it literally follows the original text (which is, sometimes, vaguely in the scenic indications), sometimes in new interpretations in which the directors have chosen to show their vision on the piece. Some are good, many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original and modern versions of bard creation, it can be placed in a modern New York in decay and full of modern anti-social behavior, piercing, dismemberment and eccentric sex (which, for the reader rather than casual, Shakespeare himself was not moving away, but at the same time he remains incredibly close to the general sensation and to the point of what the show is, which is a great effort. Kaufman wrote the screenplay with his co-director in the movie James Gunn, who is now famous for writing two successful Scooby Doo films, doing the impossible realizing a perfect remake of an already perfect movie with Dawn of the Dead and the director of one of the best horror films of the year: Slither. The innovative vision of the director of Lloyd Kaufman, along with the original and unrestricted writing of James Gunn, is for an interpretation of Shakespeare's play that perhaps not everyone will "get" immediately, but it will certainly be recognized by a truly unique vision and very important on a classic game. With a screenplay entirely written in iambic meter, the appearances of Lemmy by Motorhead and an impressive and scandalous soundtrack that looks at Tromeo and Juliet is something that no one will ever forget. Apart from its historical significance, Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure for filmmakers of all kinds. Not only for the script of James Gunn, now he has a good influence on Hollywood while working from the inside, but also because he presents an initial part of the legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Well known to all those who are familiar with films made with lower budgets. The tenth anniversary edition on DVD adds all this to include so many still unknown gems that not only all the information one could want about the film itself and the experience of making it presented in ways that make it impossible to turn the DVD off, but also one very honest (and disturbing) look at the ways in which independent cinema must survive these days. In many ways the extras on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given to Kaufman's "Create your own damn movie" film school. Furtermore's historical articles from Troma's triumphs including James Gunn, Debbie Rochon and all the other contributors to this masterpiece are included, and the film itself is, apart from a better aspect than ever, accompanied by no less than four audio commentaries, each is all informative, excruciatingly funny and all done for a serious addition to the film, instead of the boring and pointless comments that are so common these days. There are new comments (one with Kaufman and Gunn together), but also what James Gunn did for the original DVD release, but he couldn't be included there for some honesty showing up some other people on this disk. With the recreations of fans of some scenes in the film, a video diary of Lloyd Kaufman's visit to the set of James Gunn's Slither and a visit to the two groups for the Eli Roth Hostel birthday party and much more, this is the set final all must possess. Weather you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of Bard's great work, a fan of great cinema, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of James Gunn, interested in learning more about making low budget films, a fan by Lloyd Kaufman or anything else: this is the most important DVD-release of this millennium!
