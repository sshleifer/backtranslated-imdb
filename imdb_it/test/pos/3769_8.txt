Spectacular comedy in which the comedian Mark Blankfield plays Jekyll as a tense doctor and deeply engaged in his research. Once he sniffed his experimental formula, he turned into Hyde who devours the landscape, causing endless problems to all those around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by this. He has a really crazy and crazy approach; it is full steam ahead with an outrageously stupid but undeniably exhilarating joke after another. Fun and gag lines are in abundance; Blankfield plays every role for all that is worth. One of the highlights is Hyde exploding in the song; "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hyde" is quite catchy and even now I can still hear it in my head. The climax even breaks old horror movies in black and white. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is also quite lively, with Bess Armstrong playing the great girlfriend Mary, Krista Errickson as the bubbly Ivy, and Tim Thomerson as flamboyant colleague doctor Knute Lanyon. I wish we could have done more with the Thomersons character, since I'm a fan of that man, but it's always nice to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A wide range of familiar faces parade before the room: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in a cameo like himself. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you prefer intelligent and intellectual comedy, you'd better avoid this at all costs. But for those who like a politically incorrect, voluptuously vulgar moment, this could do the trick. <br /> <br /> One of the best bits was saved last. <br /> <br /> 8/10
