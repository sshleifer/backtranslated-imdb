Done on a spare budget of twenty dollars, this thirteen minutes at low cost merrily parodies the legendary George Lucas science fiction blockbuster "Star Wars" as imaginatively as possible. Writer / director Ernie Fosselius offers a winning and often devastating mix of ridiculous sound effects, ineptically staged action scenes, special effects (anything but) crudistic (you just have to love laser-stained films on scratched film, tin asteroids and family appliances ... eer, I mean spaceships that swing on obvious wires), badly nicknamed in dialogues, shamelessly acting Amazon, and the bombastic piece of classical music by Richard Wagner "Ride of the Valkyries". The characters are presented with sufficiently large traits; my favorites are whiny whimp Fluke Starbucker, the venerable Jedi knight Auggie "Ben" Little Dog and the hateful evil arch Darph Nader (who does nothing but incomprehensible incomprehensibility). Furthermore, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on the Tin Man of "The Wizard of Oz", while Artie Deco is definitely an inexpensive vacuum cleaner. The real masterpiece of this film is the casting of legendary supreme voice actor Paul Frees as a storyteller; The deliciously rich and tasty tones of Frees immensely add to the considerable nonsense, yet they act as a boast to playful gaiety (lines of choice: "You will laugh! You will cry! You will kiss three dollars goodbye!"). A real hoot.
