I can honestly say that "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" was a much better film than I expected. Let me clarify the plot in case the film's title is a little too vague - there's a bed that eats. An evil bed. Eat people. Several unsuspecting women in a "trip" of some kind, stumble into the sinister "sack" and eventually fall prey to his hunger. The devouring process of the bed consists of a yellow foam that immerses people in its interior ... stomach acid; all complete with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult film and the only film by George Barry that had forgotten he did it until the word of mouth of his new cult status returned to him and decided to release it on DVD. It's not a bad movie at all, if you can look beyond bad acting and enjoy the effects of hokey - the most laughable is the guy whose hands are eaten and he's left with only plastic-looking skeletal fingers ... rather dreamlike to it, also, finding myself as very surreal and aberrant - mainly the whole thing that involves the artist behind the painting and the demonic story of the bed. If you like the bizarre quirky without budget, weird that you definitely look for "Death Bed".
