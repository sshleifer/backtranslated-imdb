The film begins with three people taking part in a crocodile vacation and they decide to visit a crocodile farm first and then devote themselves to a lighter activity, a "fishing" tour. <br /> <br /> interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to increase the suspense later in the film, as we remember what was said earlier. <br /> <br /> The action in the film is well planned and unfinished. The suspense is built through the "what ifs", the "unknown" and the sometimes harrowing decisions that the characters make in the film. <br /> <br /> I found myself wondering what I would do if I were in the same boat, no pun. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film was really good and the effects were realistic, credible and not exaggerated, or cartoons and out of place, as sometimes happens with CGI. <br /> <br /> As a fan of horror movies, I watch almost all the horror films I can get my hands on, in almost all genres, and this is one of the best horror films "crocodiles", if not the best that I have seen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.
