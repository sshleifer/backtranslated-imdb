I originally saw it in his preview in the UK. I was fascinated by it and it made me cry all the time. I disconnected it from the TV for safety, but over the years it has been consumed. And the TV never seems to show it. Therefore it was a joy to discover that True Movies owns the copyright and was showing it on its own channels. This time I recorded it on a DVD, so I can enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> Lucile Fray (beautifully played by Ann-Margret) discovers she has cancer and is terminal. Her husband has arthritis and, even if he loves, he is an alcoholic and would not be able to take care of his children after he is gone. Therefore, he must find new homes for each of his children before he dies. <br /> <br /> The acting is top notch, the music is wonderful, and has stood the test of time wonderfully (still makes me cry!) If I had the chance, you'd be foolish to miss this. It's a wonderful movie! A must see for everyone !!!
