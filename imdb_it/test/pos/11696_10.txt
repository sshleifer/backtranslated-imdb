Crackerjack is a fun movie, everyone at Bowlo has seen it and everyone says the same. The cheese wheel was a big part of the movie, even the speaker "dear Mr. so and so you left your indicator right on". Or when Jack returns home and lies on the couch and breaks a beer, "bowls are hard work" made me collapse. And when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling the bingo number. Jack buys all the lottery tickets to win the meat platter. Honestly a great movie, if you like lawn bowls as you can identify with it, if you're not a lawn bowler forget it, I think. The Evans Head Bowlo would be considered the best club in Aus, friendly people, great company. To Evans Head Bowlo Steve
