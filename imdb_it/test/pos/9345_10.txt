"Thriller" is brilliant. It's a long video, but still simply brilliant. The song itself is ... excellent ... add Michael JAckson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon. Of all the videos I've ever seen, this is the best. If you haven't seen the video yet, then I urge you ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing for its time ... everything, from the werewolf transformation to the idea of ​​these gruesome zombies that you they raise slowly from their graves they are grandiose ... spectral grandiose. Vicent Price has his segment of bone-chipping lines ... known simply as "the rap" Ola Ray is as good as Michael's girlfriend, and Michael JAckson himself ... dancing and singing (though not during the video itself) is unmatched ... <br /> <br /> 10/10.
