Aslan Adam, or Lionman as he is more commonly known in the English-speaking public, begins with an epic battle while King Solomon and his army defeat a lot of kids even though I'm not sure who they were and the movie itself isn't too useful to establish the fact. However, after King Solomon massacred all these types of Princess Mary, Bishop Osorio and Commander Antoine are forced to sign a treaty that allows King Solomon to govern almost everything in sight. Shortly after Princess Mary seduces Solomon and they have sex, meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever (only two sentences) Antoine marries Princess Maria and is planning to rebel against Solomon and get a sweet revenge in the process. Antoine and his guards attack and kill Solomon even though his pregnant wife Princess Almunia escapes with her protector Rostin with Antoine's guards in pursuit, after the shortest labor ever (less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run in a bush) Princess Almunia gives birth to a small child who is hidden in bushes away from Antoine's guards. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to recover the child, he finds out that the child has been adopted by a pride of Lion as one of them! The following year and the evil Antoine now rules his subjects mercilessly, Princess Maria gave birth and has a son but Rostin is still trying to put together a band of rebels to overthrow Antoine, the task seems hopeless unless they you can enlist the help of the legendary Lionman who is more beast than man ... <br /> <br /> This Turkish co-production was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan and is a unique kind of film, I found it hilariously bad but at the same time immensely fun. The script never seems to take itself seriously, it's a pretty funny movie sometimes, it moves like a rocket and it's never boring or boring and some of the dubbing dialogues in English are simply hilarious in the context of what happens on the screen. None of this makes sense, we get a boy raised by Lion's, a wicked king, betrayal, dark family secrets, cravings that form the shape of Lion in an element of the story that was present before the child was raised by Lion's, crazy combat scenes, torture scenes in which the posts are supposed to be linked to oscillations, ancient interiors of the castle that casually contain threads of zips and gymnastic rings, bad idiots who seem to have many hairs on their faces and a central character who has a line jaw that resembles a house brick, can be stabbed twice, have hands covered with acid (this acid can eat through steel hatches but is stored in a ceramic jug!) and fall on 20 feet on a floor of cement and still not report serious injuries! Aslan Adam is an extraordinarily funny film, I don't think I've seen another film that is similar enough to compare it, if you're looking for something serious then forget it, but if you like it 'so-badly-I'm good-type movies and you want to have fun, laugh and have fun, then Aslan Adam should be at the top of the list. Total 100% gold for fans of bad films and those with a taste for different and bizarre. On the disappointing side, Lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> The director Bayten certainly keeps things moving at a fast pace although it is far from well done, during the opening battle one moment the boys are fighting their neighbor on a sand dune a grassy hill with trees in the background! There is a point where Lionman uses a "branch" for the pole vault but it is obviously only a long tube with a screw wrapped around it! Then there's the scene when a thirsty Bloodhound pack is supposed to be chasing Lionman, but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless-looking dogs ever! There are so many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are simply hilarious, stupid, bizarre or all three things I could go on and on. Just check the end when Lionman is jumping and flying everywhere as if he could fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, even if there is not a lot of blood or graphic violence, some stabbed and someone has his hands cut is a graphic as it becomes. <br /> <br/> Technically Aslan Adam is rather sad, the period costumes are bright and bright with purple, yellow, red and other bright colors. The fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers have tried to put as many actions as possible. The music seemed more suited to a classical ballet than an action film and is yet another bizarre aspect of Aslan Adam. The acting was very bad, even if it was said that it could be said that the acting was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from beginning to end, there are so many things to love, laugh and enjoy in this film that I just really liked. In no way can Aslan Adam be considered a good movie in every sense, but it's really fun. Maybe I'll have to watch it again sometime soon to prove to myself that I haven't dreamed it all! The best Turkish action movie about a Lion's grown man you'll never see, period. Tried popular enough to generate a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
