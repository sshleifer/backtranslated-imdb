Another Raquel Welch Classic! This film was released in theaters November 10, 1969 with Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is about to meet her friends Michele and Jackie. While he is coming, he meets his ex-husband who wants a second chance. Nikki turns away from him and goes to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when Alan shoots her behind. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital where he meets Jackie only to find out that Nikki is dead. Alan then chases Jackie, who hits with a car and then tries to drive away Michele. Michele jumps in the car and heads for Los Angeles. When he arrives, he calls Lloyd his boss in Las Vegas to let him know he was fine. Lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see Jeri for a job. However, there is a problem! The bartender has a drug problem and Alan knows it, so Alan and the bartender talk a little. Back in Los Angeles, Michele not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, but also joins the bouncer Joe Jeri. Now some thoughts on this image! This picture was far better than Raquel's, and it had a non-stop action. Luke Askew did a great job playing the ex-husband Nikki. It was your typical murder with the look that accompanies it. As for the performance of Raquel Welch, the only word that comes to mind is fantastic. She was fantastic in this film and her beauty stood out and shone like never before. The dress she wore on stage for dancing was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits he wore in this film were breathtaking. Of course, it doesn't matter what Raquel did because she is beautiful in all or nothing. I give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first, by far, is Raquel Welch, who is the leading actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this film was a wall-to-wall emotion from start to finish.
