Great music, great dances, a sexy star (Swayze) and real sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters motivated mainly by lust and it is a nice change. I also think that the film captures very well what it means to be a teenager facing class issues and having ideals that suddenly come across in reality. Sure, it's a bit musty in moments - it's a musical film after all - but all in all it's a real pleasure - a fun and even politically enlightened novel. This film also has one of my favorite movie lines of all time: "I brought the watermelon".
