When the long "Happy Ever After" ended, his characters - "Terry & June Fletcher" were revived for the longest and most popular sequel - "Terry & June", although their surnames were changed by Fletcher in Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry received a new job and, as a result, he and June move to Purley where they end up with all kinds of scratches, unwanted guests visiting at an inconvenient time, the boss inviting you to dinner and Terry trying to give his do-it-yourself arm a chance, but armando every time. Another user of IMDb has marked this show as "not intelligent" and "never well written". Right, he wasn't smart, but that was the point. As for the "never written well", some of the episodes were pretty bad, I'll admit it, but overall I found it extremely well written, very funny and very well acted. <br /> <br /> It was very friendly slapstick, not unlike the next BBC sitcom "Keeping Up Appearances". Eight different writers contributed to the nine series, giving ample space to the show. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he showed well in productions like "Hugh & I", the films "Carry On" and, of course, here! June Whitfield was also a legend of comedy. <br /> <br /> I like some modern shows: "Still Game", "The Catherine Tate Show", "Legit" and "Empty". I also liked the 'alternative comedy' - 'Naked Video', 'The Young Ones' and 'The Comic Strip Presents', but I'm more inclined to enjoy vintage comedies like this. The humor that you don't have to think about is excellent for when you feel down and want to lift you up. For the record, "Terry and June" were wonderful things. A special note should be made of the catchy theme melody that has caught the mood of the show tremendously well!
