Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible that a sequel is almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, he came very close! We have fantastic actors and a fantastic storyline with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton as Batman and he is still as fantastic as ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman, was perfectly put in her place. As much as I love and is an incredible actress, Annette Benning, could not be Catwoman, she doesn't look exactly. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as the penguin? It was simply fantastic and terrifying! <br /> <br /> Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, celebrating Christmas with Max Shrek starring a gruesome Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina, who has the impression of feeling too much in his office that pushes him to push her out the window in the hope that she dies and will never reveal the information to know the Penguin and the attempt to make him love in Gotham. When he survives and is awakened by the cats, he wants revenge and is ready to face him with his cats! But there is also another active villain, The penguin who is looking for his parents who have abandoned him and is now trying to become the new mayor of Gotham City! Will Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their execution actions and from preventing the mayor from destroying the city too? <br /> <br /> You'll have to see! Batman Returns is as good as the original Batman, although the first remains the true classic, this still takes you for a ride. Come on, I mean we have Michelle in leather! His classic time to meet Batman and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines and sets! You will have a lot of fun! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
