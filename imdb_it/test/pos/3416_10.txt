We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the process of truth and reconciliation, but as others have written, I didn't know much about the details of the process. This film has shown the process and growth that can occur when people are able to face their past, understand the events from the perspective of the others involved and suffer together. Archbishop Tutu and others involved in the development of the T&R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. Seeing this movie gave me hope for the human race. If we can do T & R, we could not destroy ourselves. People will look to T and R as the first step towards human adolescence and towards maturity. <br /> <br /> As a film, there were obviously flaws. I didn't notice any major problems in acting, directing or writing - but for the first time in years I was totally lost in a movie, so maybe I didn't notice. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. The Toronto public didn't give up the stage for the next movie, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went out on the sidewalk to continue the conversation. People just came to shake hands and thank them for the movie. It touched us all.
