His fantasy adventures of John Dark-Kevin Connor were a mainstay of the summer vacation movies in the days leading up to Star Wars: they weren't masterpieces, they weren't equipped with cutting-edge special effects, but they were exactly what a children's audience taken from a film in the mid-70s. <br /> <br /> Earth's Core captures the right tone for Burroughs' pulp adventure appropriately named for Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure who ends up in Pelucidar's underworld and fight its diabolical telepathic combatant dinosaurs. This time the puppets went in favor of men in monster suits, which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend disbelief, and if you're not, there's always the neckline of Caroline Munro to watch. Apart from what could be the worst performance of Peter Cushing, an annoying but pitiful rehash of his movie Dr Who ("You can't hypnotize yourself, I'm English!"), It's easily the best of John Dark-Kevin Connor- The fantastic adventures of Doug McClure, surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of color. Never particularly good at outdoor scenes, Alan Hume's photography gains immensely from the control a studio set gives him (the film was shot entirely on stage) to paint a vividly vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover. It is not an art, but certainly a great fun on Saturday matinee.
