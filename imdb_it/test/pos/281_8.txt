Excellent and moving story of the end of an exclusively intimate relationship. Then again, the point of the film, to paraphrase another comment, is that each relationship can be unique and intimate. A really quality short film that caught me in my moment of greatest affluence, but it had the power to drag me on the sofa and watch it fixed and silent for the whole duration. Bobby and Tessa are moving the characters with force and anyone who has suffered the end of a love story will find this film a cathartic exercise. Beyond that, the idea of ​​the film in a film looks very good with this cast and is quite compelling, albeit in a somewhat melancholy way.
