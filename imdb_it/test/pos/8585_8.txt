Being myself Belgian, I have an interest in the history of the Congo. It was our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and it is part of the history of our country. Nowadays it seems to be very popular to say that everything the Belgians have done in the Congo is wrong, especially in the nineteenth century. I'm not saying bad things didn't happen. Of course they did, but in those days it was not abnormal. Do you really think the French or the English were much nicer in their colonies? No they were not. It was "normal" at the time when our king Leopold used the Congo as a way to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (he didn't belong to the state then) and he tried to make the most of it. Naturally gruesome things like hands cut off happen and yes to today's standards which is inadmissible, but in those days it was a common practice. And it must be said, all this has not happened in the last decades ... I know several people who lived and worked in Congo for many years before the Congolese declaration of independence. It is true that they had many black servants, but they are very kind people and I can't really imagine that they ever treated me badly. As far as I know, they have always treated them with a lot of respect (However, I'm not saying that all Belgians did). In fact, if they weren't so old now (almost all around 80 years old), they would like to return to the Congo. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is that it offers a historically accurate view of what happened during the last years of Belgian rule and the first years of Congolese independence. The story is not in black and white (perhaps not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean) as I feared it would be. He does not say that all the Belgians were wrong and all the Congolese were good. It shows perfectly how the Congolese, in their race to gain independence from the Belgians, did not have the courage to accept the help of the Russians and the Americans, who both had more eye for raw materials like copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber , ... and get the Congolese in their political 'field' and they were not all interested in their independence. Not only does it give a good idea of ​​how Lumumba has become more powerful, but also of how Mobutu played a dual role. It shows the Belgian reaction to some of our compatriots who were violated, threatened and even killed (my father was one of the paratroopers who had been sent to the Congo to save the Belgians). It gives a good idea of ​​the political problems encountered by Lumumba in the province where Katanga did not want to be part of the Congolese Republic, the role that the Belgians had played in the assassination on Lumumba ... all this is part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be very accurate and the characters really seem and behave like the real ones. This film was able to give a very precise idea of ​​how life in the Congo in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by all those interested in the history of the country. But it should also be shown in history lessons, especially in Belgium, because it is a part of our history that should never be forgotten. I give him a 7.5 / 10, maybe even an 8/10.
