The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard complaining that there are not enough Australian films, or that they are all the same. <br /> <br /> Well, in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other Australian films. It's unique - it will make you laugh out loud, make you cry and make you feel really good about yourself. <br /> <br /> The casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. The script and the photograph (color / light, etc.) are wonderful. But more important is a great movie. I don't want to talk about the plot because I think it's always better to see a film knowing as little as possible. Suffice it to say that this film is aimed at a wide range of audiences. Bring your girlfriend, take your mom, bring your friends - for a nice evening. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
