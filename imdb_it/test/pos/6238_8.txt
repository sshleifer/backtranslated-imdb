As one of the other reviewers (may have been @ Amazon), I was first introduced to Tourist Trap by the dear, decrepit old WOR-9 in New York, around January 1983. Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell, which I was been waiting to see since he debuted at Halloween in 1978, it was just over, and I thought I had my horror for the day (stop laughing) that the monster "Borgost" (sp?) with three eyes that Ike Eisenmann has collected in his room is As much as I still like Richard Crenna wearing his custom-made TV horror hat, it was the first 10 minutes of Tourist Trap, which followed that Devil that day, to really leave a mark - and months later , became the first movie I ever recorded on TV. WOR used to play this quite often, often like the Saturday afternoon Million Dollar movie, as others have observed. It is one of those offers that offers a powerful punch of horror forward, a true left hook - and then practically starts again with the rest of the cast, dances and jabs, putting the opening scene in a wider context along the way, then switch to the real climax (see Night of the Living Dead, King Animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I have not mentioned a single mannequin. Face it - the damn things are pretty scary, without the music and the script. I too can remember some dummies of scary clothes and similar things in the attics and basements of various relatives, and say what you like about how relatively simple the approach of Schmoeller and Carroll is - nobody, sooner or later, played so well. In real life, a good mannequin will make you take a double step - and behold, this is the last thing you will probably see, if you happen to get stuck in the defunct Slausen wax museum. Yes, there is a point ("I loved it very much"), where Chuck "Slausen" Connors is trying to pass as Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could have taken over a whole paragraph in the early stages; I can't see the script so thick. It does not matter. From directing to competent acting (Meryl Streep is definitely not present, and here, which helps instead of hindering), to another useful and effective score by Pino Dinaggio (see Carrie and various other films de Palma), to various types of lighting, film material, use of various sound levels ... I could go on - every element of this low-budget production gets together and you get a job much bigger than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I say it's scary as Hell? Stephen King talked about this film in Danse Macabre about a year after its release, and for good reason. Like many of his works, it may not be a great art, but it certainly tells a scary story, and does it well. The rest of the cast could be relatively unknown (wasn't Jocelyn Jones even in that car chase movie in Texas?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are, familiar enough for the public, to make you think - Stephen King style - that this could happen to you or the people you know. <br /> <br /> Comparison with Psycho (plot) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (general aspect), although they are not the first associations in my mind, they are valid. I would just like to be able to comment on the DVD, which I can't wait to buy, given that Tourist Trap has become notoriously difficult to find on video after the almost complete extinction of independent video stores, where it had a house apart from WOR and so on cable in the 80s (although TMC / Showtime seems to have picked it up and played it regularly now). No, no spoilers here, I'm afraid, no interruption of the plot - go see it yourself (okay, there might be a small little underneath, so scroll if you want - better prevention than cure). The mannequins are damn disquieting and I'd rather show that telling ... :) <br /> <br /> For the record, Tourist Trap is also chock full of lines, from "there will be a party! How I look, eh, how look?! ", to" you're so cute "," you can't hurt me "," I shouldn't hide it - it's good! "(listens to Vincent Price's inflection), the inevitable" you're crazy! " (delivered at the right time and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - to keep the hair on your arms when you hear the mannequin's head scream "Molly!" - especially when you realize who was the head ... :) <br /> <br /> P S ... Charles Band was the producer of this, I think, and probably possessed the rights to the music of Dinaggio. Band, from what I understand, was the brain behind Full Moon Entertainment, which could explain both the later use of the music in Puppet Master, and, well, the 40 commercial approach characterized the Full Moon in everything from the funny series Puppet Master and Subspecies, a, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).
