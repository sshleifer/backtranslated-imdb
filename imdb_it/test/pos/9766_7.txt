I ran to the library to take a look at this mini-series after having just finished listening to the wonderful "talking books" of the full version of the book. The first half of this TV version is really very good, but it gets a little stuck in the second half. The relationship with the trustee is exaggerated and conflicts are inserted between Jean and Joe who do not exist in the history of Shute, recklessly in my opinion, since they greatly diminish the power of their love story. I was disappointed to discover that Bryan Brown's wonderful Joe seemed much more exhilarating and far less attractive than the one in the book, but Jean of Helen Morse was really very good. I think they should have created a 10-hour mini-series to properly develop the story of the outback. But all I said, I looked at everything more or less and appreciated his merits, hoping that someone would make a less soapy remake.
