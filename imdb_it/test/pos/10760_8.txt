From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (a game of tribal costumes photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, which shows why this South American Ishkanani tribe is so fierce) the film's direction is nebulous: we're looking at a dark comedy on the confrontation life on the streets of New York and uncivilized people, or is it a message of a more serious intent? But as the story develops, this thin line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear. Griffin Dunne's direction for the adaptation of Dirk Wittenborn's novel may be a little reckless at times, as it moves away from the development of the rational plot, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to correct the holes he created . <br /> <br /> Our storyteller Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke addict / sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer to join her anthropologist father on a trip to South America (a father who knows only from letters and videos), when a drug bust suddenly changes their lives: one of Liz Ogden Osborne's wealthy clients (Donald Sutherland) saves the family and transfers them to his estate of ten acres, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the villa with Osbornes' "rich rich" - daughter Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor guide Liz on the drainage path and Finn's ties with Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity between the poor and the rich, the living situation works - for a while. The incidents occur to alter the feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and Finn's vision of the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they discover the truth about Finn's disturbing episode - and also about the ferocious illness of the wealthy class. <br /> <br /> The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels to some of the more difficult scenes. For this viewer that works well, but when the director decides to place tribal individuals in full honor in the context of the Osborne estate, the concept seems forced, as if the public were to be forced to "understand" it. The various subplots between the waitress Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of an obese late plaster artist Whitney (Branden Williams) push the margin of credibility to emphasize the line between the rich and the "lower classes", but Sutherland's performances, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the gaps in the film. Not a great film but one with many worthy ideas sketched on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for leadership. Grady Harp
