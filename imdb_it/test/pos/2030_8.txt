Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolizes a rock star to the point of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take on the role of "idol" in the band, miss the chance. However, the role of a rock star may not be the one that is broken to be ... and relationships can change .... This film has certainly struck me from the fact that having the theme of what you get may not be that that you think is understood once. Overall, a really beautiful film with great performances by the whole cast and the two protagonists, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It made me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met Chris in Seattle and saw the depths of what had sunk. If anyone has ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie, they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamorous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you could wish for.
