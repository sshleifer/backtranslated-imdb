I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and honestly I can say that I am one of the few books that I could not put down while reading. <br /> <br /> The film was more or less what I expected, lots of action, with a rather mysterious plot. In my opinion, Tom Hanks plays a much better role than Professor Langdon with respect to The Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You won't have to worry about how awful the Da Vinci Code is, that's all it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense and less unnecessary controversy. If you haven't read the book, don't worry, you'll find it very interesting. And if you've read the book, let's say you might be a little disappointed because I found many missing scenes that I couldn't wait to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, a rather impressive film for all everyday movie goers. But maybe it's not something too special for Dan Brown fans.
