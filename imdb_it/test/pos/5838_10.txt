I watched a lot of television in my 51 years, but I never had so much fun week after week, as I was watching Oz. The acting of the whole cast was excellent. The writing was simply perfect, with each character remaining consistent for the duration of six years. I also liked the chaos and ultraviolence. It may seem strange, but sometimes it was funny to find out how one of the characters would eventually die. I particularly enjoyed the true love and love story between Beecher and Keller. Those two men really knew how to throw it down, in every way possible. I really hope that HBO continues to show us the replicas of this great show FOREVER! I've watched every episode at least 4 times and yet I still wait for Tuesday and Thursday nights at 11:00 PM. for an episode of this fun and very funny show.
