A powerful debut film by Murali K. Thalluri that explores the events in the life of a group of high school students, each in crisis in one way or another. The film begins with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then traces the lives of the group in the previous hours, leaving the public pending until the last minute about the identity of the deceased. Each of the main characters is faced with greater stress factors that we could see as potentially causing a suicide. The cast of strangers offers performances full of power and emotion. Fantastic, especially considering the youth of the scriptwriter / director who was 19 when he wrote the script.
