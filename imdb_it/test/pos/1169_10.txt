A film that I've seen and appreciated perhaps more than any other film. I saw it for the first time as a child and I loved the drama and the great climate battle. Growing up, I enjoyed it a lot or more than before, but now thanks to all the components that work together to become a true classic. The acting is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the cinematography is spectacular, the script is full of gems and the director does it wonderfully. It is vaguely based on a real event, and shows Europe's race and an emerging new America to carve out the "old sick" (the Ottoman Empire) while collapsing in a fashion different from any other "historical" film I've seen. Humor, drama, action, love ... it has everything and deserves a lot of support (very similar to "The Great Waldo Pepper").
