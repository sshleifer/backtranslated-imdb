In Everything Is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, an American Jew who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during World War II. In a sense, the woman who saved her whole family. <br /> <br /> This is a touching story about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a strange land so to speak. Jonathan is not quite ready for this adventure, he leans like a sore thumb in Ukraine (probably he would stick out like a sore thumb everywhere). But what he finds is much more than he expected. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry. Elijah Wood is really good in this film, based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. <br /> <br /> From someone I talked to, this film is a bit different from the book. A book I collect is really good. However, this is a good movie, it has something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can anyone say Oscar?
