A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian director of photography, director and Italian film producer who died in 1999 with almost 200 feature films to his credit as a director. A large part is spent on D'Amato's softcore films, including his infamous Emanuel voices with Laura Gemser. They also briefly covered his porn career, which kept him afloat during his last decade. More interesting to me is the section focused on his horror and action efforts. D'Amato has many anecdotes about actors and his low-budget filmography, including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones among the false ones while shooting in a catacomb two thousand years ago. Other respondents include George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked a little more conversation about his Stateside Filmirage productions (not a single question about TROLL 2, assuming it wasn't the cult movie of the time).
