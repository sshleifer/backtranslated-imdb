This is actually a very good surreal mysterious film, despite the description that tries to sell it as a science fiction movie. Balkan plays a woman obsessed with mysterious visions and lost memories she is trying to rebuild. He spends most of the film trying to make sense of his visions. Very suggestive and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear much in this film, but the fixed actors are very good. In the United States there is only a dubbed version in English, and dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors do a great job. The cinematography, of the Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro is excellent. A previous Yellow by director Bazzoni, THE FIFTH CORD, is also excellent, and also shot by Storarro.
