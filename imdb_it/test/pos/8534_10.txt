(Spoiler warning) I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a great horror / parody comedy that does everything right for a change. Humor is great and ranges from fun to so much fun ... you'll be fun. In one scene, Ed becomes edit-crazy and erases a great scene. When his boss is looking at Ed's frame, he yells, "What part of the fu # is my rapeseed-beaver scene? Hysterical. There are also many other quotes and great, funny and memorable moments all over the world: Ed screams "I wouldn't like to look at myself !!!" while punching a little poor schmuck repeatedly in the face. Very funny stuff. The plot of the film itself is so ridiculous that it is priceless: And it is a mild everyday boy who is transferred to the horror film editing department, and after a while he goes crazy, sees the monsters and attacks people while he mentions the horror film that has changed. This film has everything and is simply hilarious. The DVD only costs around $ 7 and is a great deal as it is the unclassified widescreen cut. I own many DVDs, many of which cost a lot more money than this, but not many are as big as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and I would like to beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it. Evil Ed exudes style and quality - something that Hollywood filmmakers need to learn in an important way. Evil Ed is a rare gem, and I would like to thank everyone involved in this wonderful film - you did everything right, and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
