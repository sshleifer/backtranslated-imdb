I loved this film thanks to the dialogue and superb acting of Candace and Jacqueline. However, I never knew until now, watching a Bette David marathon on TNT that this film is a remake of a 1943 Bette Davis classic called Old Knowledge. Bette is co-star with Miriam Hopkins, who had a terrible feud during the making of the film, because Bette had had an affair with Miriam's husband who had directed her in a movie before they made the Old Knowledge. <br /> <br /> However, both are worth every minute spent watching. I highly recommend this movie if you like a lot of dialogue and drama. It is a study of the psychology of women and their mutual relations, in my opinion.
