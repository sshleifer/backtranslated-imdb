Being a Carpenter Fan enthusiast, I loved this movie (although wigs leave a lot to be desired!) And I agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of his life were absent or untouched. Whatever - leave your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so I went to find out more. I have to recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and, unlike the film, it is "real" and realistic. I hope you enjoy. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her Fame and Gypsy days. She is a singer (and even a dancer) in her own right and I think this was the necessary margin to create the character. Some other actresses may have struggled with this. It is embarrassing that the film has not delved into its history. After all, this is the title of the film, but I heard we learned more about Richard, but I suppose that, like any actor who's worth it, you should always let them want more!
