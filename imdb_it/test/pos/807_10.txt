Excellent all-round work especially by the actress who played his wife Gerda (Claire Price), of course, like David Suchet. I really did understand whodunit, but this is beyond the point. The ending, which I won't divulge (someone describes it in the Board in response to someone else's question if you're interested). I found myself really sad. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cartoon characters, I thought they were really well-rounded. <br /> <br /> The pace of the story was good and I enjoyed seeing Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (son of Cedric I believe besides being a well-known Dr. Watson.)) as her husband .
