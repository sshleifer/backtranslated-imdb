First of all, I must say that I don't speak Spanish and I usually don't like Spanish films ... MA Two Coyotes is an exceptional film. There is enough action and hard drama that it does not matter that it is a film in Spanish. The subtitles were easy to read and didn't block the action - OR the drama! <br /> <br /> I would like to tell fans of Spanish-speaking films and non-fans of Spanish-speaking films to go and watch this movie. Action and drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
