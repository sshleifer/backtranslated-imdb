The Coen brothers really outdid themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped prisoners. Although based on "The Odyssey", the ancient work of Homer, it is not necessary to read "The Odyssey" in order to follow the story. The Coen brothers have woven a celluloid tapestry and delights! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, in fact it is as if the soundtrack were the product and the film was wrapping the paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and recalls the times of a time when films were full of character actors whose appearance in the film adds richness, consistency and authenticity. George Clooney is as magnificent as the fat Everett Ulysses McGill, an honest runaway swindler whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and catchy. O Brother, Where Art You are Coen's best film to date and Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to deserve a nomination for best actor, as is the portrait of Tim Blake Nelson of his deceived friend Delmar, while the film itself deserves a nod to the film Best.
