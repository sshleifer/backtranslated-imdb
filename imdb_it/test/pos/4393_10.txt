Regarding the discussion on the South, the rednecks and the hillbillies ... Well, I come from the South: Argentina, near the South Pole to be precise. Is it enough southern? Seriously, some stories are universal. We have never been to Greece, nor have we lived the classic period of Homer, but he speaks to us today. The same do Shakespeare and Dante. And even stories from distant, unknown places reach us, when told with sensitivity, intelligence, humor, just like "O Brother". Moreover, all of us (the rest of the world) also have our hillbillies! And our era of depression (never heard of Argentina in the year 2001?), Our politicians and racism, our kind souls, just like Delmar and Tommy ... I simply loved this movie, folks. Despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (And please forgive my mistakes in English, I did my best) PS: I don't think anyone mentioned this favorite phrase: when Delmar asks George Nelson what he does for a living, while he handles the gun machine ...
