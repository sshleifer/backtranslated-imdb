I took a DVD at 1 ?? discount, having no idea what it is (but at that price I can't resist ..) In short: I was positively surprised. <br /> <br /> So much that I did some research. On the German DVD (part 2 of a series of 3), the episodes were recombined into two parts of 85 minutes and out of use. Here are my results, based on the list of Wikipedia episodes: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is In My Boots + The Voice (final episode). <br /> <br /> "Machine War" is Hel & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what can I say. Upside down girls are obviously interesting for older men. I've never seen so much Charlie's Angels, so I can't compare it, but the more I looked, the less I looked at the bikini tops and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both m and f) have become more interesting. I can imagine that feminists also enjoy this. All in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but it was a pleasure: ^)
