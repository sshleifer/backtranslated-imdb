Delicious! He never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it is a mini-jewel of British comedy from the late seventies. Since the producers wanted to sell it abroad, it features an American (the late character actor Richard Jordan), but at least he is not the usual boring Hollywood guy. Around him is the cream of the acting talent of British characters, led by David Niven, wonderfully stupid and superior. <br /> <br /> Niven's Ivan the Terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots. He also manages to be surprisingly threatening and intimidating. The moment in the snooker club when it drops the fascinating and threatening fa√ßade Richard Jordan will come as a shock to those onlookers who think that Niven is just a comic living room star. He is full of genuine power and unscrupulousness, as we see how Ivan has earned his nickname. All the more surprising considering how much Mal Niven was at that time. Shortly after filming this production he lost his power to talk about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last image that Niven has realized where you can hear his own voice, which is later nicknamed by the impressionist comedian Sid Caesar. Alongside him you can identify numerous well-known faces from the cinema and television of the 1970s. Elke Sommer (who shows her breasts in the politically correct baby mode of the seventies), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc. Davy Kaye receives one of the biggest laughs while holding up a security guard who makes a phone call. "Who are you playing ?! .... Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You're gitless git!" <br /> <br /> Great shots of London street locations; transforming the film into a vintage patina of red telephone booths with large portable hands with a round dial, black carriages guided by "Cor blimey, gov!" cockney, and ladies and gentlemen who shape every type of leisure clothing and retro-styled hair styles. <br /> <br /> Unlike the classic Ealing comedies of an earlier era, the hero can escape with his crime and escape into a life under the sun. How times have changed! The moral code with which the criminals in the films have always had to be seen to be punished had already passed by the seventies, with anti-heroes like the status of earners Pinky Green through their irreverent anti-authoritarianism and determination to "cock a snook" to a capitalist disheveled creation of suitable fat cat businessmen. We are encouraged to cheer while Pinky leaves, unpunished and free as a bird with his bad results. Compare this to the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Very funny, with a certain dating in its fashions and attitudes, and the stuff of the late night cult vision. Perfect to watch at midnight after closing the pubs; if you are of a certain age, you feel a nostalgic touch and you always wanted to see David Niven in a branch of McDonalds, silently intimidating an American through the use of a retractable telescope!
