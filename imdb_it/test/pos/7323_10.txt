Columbia Pictures Short Pictures unit has never had any illusions about the production of "Art" films. They wanted to offer the film's exhibitors a little more for their money when they booked a Columbia movie in their theaters. This would have been dubbed for The 3 Stooges movies. <br /> <br /> MEN IN BLACK (1934) became the closest of their Comedy Shorts as it received an Oscar nomination for best short subject, comedy. Even if he didn't win, he could very well have it. It was pretty good, and even those who don't count in the Stooge archives still seem to be conquered by the cry of clarification of "....... calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" This was the second entry in the long series of comic short films made by the Stooges for producer Jules White, head of Columbia's short film department. Only WOMAN HATERS, described in his credits as "Musical Novelty", preceded him in the production of Poverty Row by Harry Cohen. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the office of Dr. Graves, the head of the hospital. He is receiving new trainees and in facing the group, he reports that three of them have gone through Medical Conditionally as if they had been there so long. But, the good doctor states that he will not reveal their identity until everyone commits "...... to Duty and Humanity!" The Stooges run forward promising "... for Duty and Humanity!", And they finish the office, breaking the window pane. The game was active. <br /> <br /> The Stooges took off and did not stop for the rest of the 2 Reels. Every type of gag was in evidence. From great gags to Sennett's sight, to word games, to dialectical humor, to "theater of the absurd" and to a surreal racing gag involving a system of public addresses, which seems to take on a life of its own and have the real culprit a radio tube shot "........ it took me!" (Everything happens pretty well, honestly!) The sets used were very authentic and were undoubtedly borrowed from the characteristics of Columbia produced at the same time. There are a lot of wheelchairs, surgical cotets, stethoscopes, scalpels etc., to highlight the illusion of a hospital. <br /> <br /> A real strength of MEN IN BLACK is the high number of usually unnamed players, which we all recognize for face. Together with them, the film boasts a large number of veteran comedians, who always turn into excellent performances, often stealing the show. People with names like Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison also shine in small parts. <br /> <br /> And finally we have the Master, the director-director Raymond McCarey, younger brother of Leo McCarey who showed his skill in getting this little film 'in the jar'. He cleverly kept everything moving, sometimes acting like a traffic cop, with all the actors, employees and crew behind the scenes moving and moving away from each other. And that doesn't count for the Giant 3 Man tandem bicycle, the Sway Backed Horse and the miniature racing cars, not to mention the "giant green canaries"!
