The slightly overdone episode of the previous week was bluntly rewarded by an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain taste deus ex machina for the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start for all this. As is now common to this doctor, the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were center stage. They were always present in the classic series, but they were a secondary problem, to be overlooked when the Doctor was in the midst of battle. This regeneration also says sorry to a cyberman during the battle! Finally, this episode shows Mickey embracing the heroic side that had been mentioned in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete, and was absolutely convincing. With the fears, the humor and the scenes that made you a lump in the throat this episode had it all. After many considerations I can finally say that the new series improves the classic series in all respects. Coming from a tough Whovian you cannot get better recommendations than those.
