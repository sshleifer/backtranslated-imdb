What a movie gas! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this is different from the rest. Only "The Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can approach this Capper classic. I know that these four American films I mentioned are not caper films in themselves, but rather detective stories with a complicated plot, which still exude a gritty, "Noirian" quality, similar to "Rififi". <br /> <br /> What is different here is the way Jules Dassin sets in motion the total atmosphere of the film, not only in the cruel realism of the principals, but also in the use of the streets of Paris as a subliminal character and co-conspirator of himself! The film focuses on "le Stephanois", an obscure, moody and complicated former scammer who is dragged into a final blow to heavy gain. Even though he is a hard and unyielding type, he still feels in him the desire for a sort of redemption, extricating himself from the demons of his past (hey, he saved little Toni!). Dassin chose the right guy (Jean Servais) for that role. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, the rest of the development of the story falls into place as we cross the famous scene of the "silent" caper until the eventual disappearance of the main "perps". Only their women survive, except Ida, Mario's honey. They seemed to understand the underlying futility of all this!
