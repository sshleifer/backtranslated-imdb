If anyone ever assembled a compendium on modern American horror that is really worth salting, there will be * an * entry for the ubiquitous SF Brownrigg exercise in Asylum Horror. Every time I watch this film, I am impressed by the complete economy of the film, from the compact, totally autonomous plot, with a disconcerting beginning and a too horrible ending, the engaging performances of what was essentially a group of non-professional actors, a predictive sense of terror and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the narrative with a certain inevitability that is all the more terrifying because viewers know what is happening long before the hero, with the only question being when they are going to wake up and hear the smell of coffee? <br /> <br /> Shot on a budget of dental floss in Brownrigg's Texas, in an old lavish manor that serves as a backdrop to a private sanatorium, NOT LOOKING IN THE BASEMENT is another intriguing blow to the good old Edgar Allan Poe on inmates who take possession of the asylum just before a "normal" outsider otherwise unintentionally joins the ranks without realizing it until it is too late that not everything is what it seems, they are completely cut off and beyond any external help , and inevitably find their sanity questioned as madness turns out of control - The original STAR TREK TV series had an attempt with their 1968 WHOM GODS DESTROY episode, Juan Moctezuma gave In the proceeding a peyote fueled the journey Mexican psychedelic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972, and linked tangentially to Fernando Di Leo's ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER HOTEL, which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as "Splatter Cinema" - Brownrigg may not have seen or thought of SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but he certainly had similar ideas. <br /> <br /> Legalists former Playboys Playmates Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, RNs in Clinical Psychology, who just quit her job as a supervisor at a major hospital to go to the middle of a god who abandoned the refuses from a Peckinpah film to work with a Dr. Stevens in his private sanatorium. Dr. Stevens paved the way for a new form of therapy based essentially on emotional and psychologically scarred encouragement to confront their inner obsessions, bring them to the surface and hopefully free patients from anything that fried their sense of reasoning . Nice idea, but arm a five-foot man with an ax and tell him to beat his aggression AND THEN TURN YOUR BACK ON HIM probably isn't the smartest idea, and Dr. Stevens is sent before the Mrs. Holotik appears on the screen with a beautiful blow to the lower part of her skull. <br /> <br /> This event leaves the sanatorium in the hands of a Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick, who also worked as a script supervisor and production manager], a woman of a surprisingly professional demeanor who quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam, the incredibly unlikely hero of the film, a lobotomized African American boheomouth played by an actor named Bill McGhee who was sadly robbed of an Oscar nomination for his shift as a muscle mass with brain of an 8-year-old child. Sam's only wish is to have someone help him put his beautiful toy boat "in the water", and his continuous demand on the various female cast members to do so [and his continuous consumption of chocolate popsicles] as * SOMEONE * type of underlying theme, although we will avoid doing it here because the children may still be standing. There is also a quick subplot on a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients, but I will leave the details of this to your discovery. <br /> <br /> Ms. Holotik arrives just as Dr. Stevens was put to rest and is quickly won over by the outspoken professionalism of Ms. Masters, who reluctantly allows the young nurse to remain standing despite the tragedy that it just happened, oh, TWENTY. A few minutes ago, you have to admit it was pretty sporty. The nurse of Holotik Beale begins to demonstrate the symptoms of not being the sharpest cleaver in the drawer, however, when she is informed that she shares housing with a group of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors and she does not move towards the Ace anymore nearby the Hardware Store collects a hasp and a padlock to protect yourself, and we are treated to a couple of really gruesome scenes where some of the inmates sneak into his room and do things like smell her hair, try to kill her with butcher knives and caress her neck with ax heads. But all this is part of the work in such a radical psychiatric psychiatric environment, Mrs. Master's informs her, and she talks about her strangely defined "shifts" which consist of wearing a leg to define a nurse's dress as you can find on a 42nd Street fetishist boutique and learn about prisoners. <br /> <br /> Allysson is an obsessive and compulsive nymphomaniac with murderous tendencies who likes to take off his shirt and provide the film with a T & A with access to histrionics; Harriet is a young ex-mother who lets her child die in a stupid accident and now rips up an old, shabby doll that is also a protective for murder; The Seargant is a true sergeant [and implicated veteran of Vietnam] that negligence led to the death of his platoon, and now he looks through the window with binoculars for the approach of an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a Phish fan who failed to get a ticket for New Year and went crazy and likes to mock nembutoli and other barbitena when no one looks, and likewise hides murderous tendencies related to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a murderous pervert who has become obsessed with his own sense of power and now loves to cut things with axes; Mrs. Callingham is an elderly poet who serves as a sort of old untamable MACBETH witch before the cat does her tongue; and Danny is a crazy idiot who has been included in the cast as the random element that the plot cannot control, and who is a fool acts as a catalyst for the series of tragedies and murders that eventually take place in this dark, old house terrifying in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> The house itself is a wonderful set, with a worn-out 70s decor that is remarkable in its insignificant, with a fantastic use of color achieved by light ambient lighting. The house is a series of corridors and rooms with polished brown wooden floors, twisting, confined staircases, secret closets and passageways that lead to the different larger areas, and of course the basement mentioned in the title - visited only once, but safe boy proves to be a doozy! I love the old frozen freezer in which Sam preserves his stock of popsicles, the absolutely simple exteriors that remind me of a summer house that our family visited every year and forced us to suffocate in the heat: Everyone is covered with beads of perspiration and exhausted appearance , and even the always cheerful Sam at some point begins to suspect that bad things are happening, even if he can't understand what it all means and Rosie H. is too firm in his belief in his profession to even suspect what really happened, and while Ms. Holotik's limits as an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her Great Revelation scene, she is a great scream when all Hell begins to unleash, and Brownrigg takes some nice pictures of her in various poses suggestive or stages of undressing which shows what a beautiful lady is without exposing anything more than her stipulated contract. Sin! <br /> <br /> The real thief of the show is Sam, however, and the fans of what I was taught to refer to Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking ending, and there is something as moving as Sam runs to the protection of his friend and brutally kills everyone at his fingertips in a matter of seconds that either suggests he is an average motha before his lobotomy, or the film is CUT. In any case, you won't be prepared for the end of the first time you see it, even if you as a viewer know what the longest score will be before anyone else in the film has put it all together. <br /> <br /> With the exception of one person: the old stereotypical coot of Rhea MacAdams Mrs. Callingham [who seems inspired by the character of Donald Sutherland Old Woman in Michael Reeves' 1964 film by Christopher Lee CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD , in addition to a rather nasty character, death by firing at the eye], which not only predicts the future, but also has the funniest laugh in the movie, a bit of funny dialogue while on a walk in the garden with the Mrs. Holotik performing something like this - <br /> <br /> "Is it really nice out here. Do you quit a lot, Mrs. Callingham?" asks Holotik, to whom the old woman replies <br /> <br /> "It is YOU who needs to go out." <br /> <br /> Hilarious, and one of those things you need to see for yourself "get". NOT LOOKING IN THE BASEMENT is available on at least half a dozen DVD versions without bargain bin code from companies such as the HORROR CLASSICS series from Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and Platinum Disc Corp .; In a way, I like the beautifully decorated 2003 release of Sex Video, from 2003: <br /> <br /> Dig your way in those business bins! But make sure you have one with the 89/90 minute print it contains; an older version of 83 minutes is definitely confusing due to some of the trims, and you really need to see the credits as intended to bring this sick, intricate and surprisingly fun yarn to its end. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece? Perhaps not compared to THE EXORCIST or ROSMARY'S BABY, but it is a truly unique American horror film, and a true drive-in classic that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something done with more than a little brain juice, and not a penny more than necessary. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 on ****
