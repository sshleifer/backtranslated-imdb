Read this: <br /> <br /> BOYZ 'N THE HOOD IS A SCENE FOR A SCENE, COMPLETE RIP-OFF OF THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood, one focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. The friend who is an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and is killed. (The athlete seems to be Washington of "Welcome back, Kotter".) <br /> <br /> It drives me crazy that people don't know about it. It makes my head go every time I go to a video store and Boyz 'n the Hood is in the' Drama 'section while Cooley High is in' Comedy '. It's an embarrassing shame. This film is both more entertaining and more dramatic than John Singleton's. At least Singleton could have had the dignity to say that his film was a tribute to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 Men, however, named their hit album after this movie.
