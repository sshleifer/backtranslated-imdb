Shot less than a year after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the topic was fresh in the minds of the cast, director and audience. Most of the cast are real soldiers and officers just returned from the war. The Soviet army worked a lot during the shooting, which is strange. <br /> <br /> The Afghan intervention was a bloody and useless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodbath. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that has convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> Powerful scenes are not lacking. One of the first is the registration of steel coffins loaded on a direct transport to the USSR. The soldiers continue their work while an officer quietly beats destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, the Baltic. <br /> <br /> A previous comment describes the last scene with Maj. Bandura as illogical. It is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship that Bandura has maintained has been with the Afghan family that it accidentally killed in the assault. Having lost his only bearing against the senselessness of war, Bandura turns his back on the boy (and his gun) in resignation to his fate. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the last scene: a flock of MI-28s rises in the mountains while a pilot's voice screams: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! (We're leaving! Guys, there, Come on!) In a tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent film - brutally honest and unholliwood as they come.
