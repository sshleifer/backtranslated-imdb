"The Student Nurses" is an excellent film about four women linked by friendship and career. For the first time, you are able to see a realistic representation of relationships within the workplace, outside the workplace, the risks of such relationships and the consequences. This film also offers a rare chance to see veteran and TV actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as the nursing instructor "Miss Boswell". Ms. MacGregor is best known for her portrayal of "Mrs. Oleson" on the television series "Little House on the Prairie". The direction, the music and the color of the print are very good as well as the opening theme performed by Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who love themes centered around the late 60s and early 70s, which offers a "softer side to life" while appreciating the beauty of the female sex.
