David Cronenberg, much like his colleague David Lynch, is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes such as reality, perversion, sex, madness and death is destined to get the most extreme reactions from the public. He demonstrated this with films such as The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (capital X, capital Z) and more recently, Spider. It is best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot, otherwise it will ruin you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a journey into the world of video games that serves as a metaphor for any kind of escape behavior. Living fantasies is something that people always dream about, but how far can we go, before reality becomes blurred and fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? These are the themes touched on in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies invaded by diseases and, above all, reality itself. <br /> <br /> History and direction are excellent. Cronenberg knows his job very well and successfully brings an artificial world to life, avoiding the usual pitfalls and clich√©s related to stories like this. The film shows some rather disgusting things, but is unusually low-key in the department of gore in comparison to other Cronenbergs works. The shock effects on which he plays are never exaggerated and the progression of the plot is very intelligent and creative. It is not the most intellectual film of all time, but it will leave you thinking about it, asking yourself and quite confused. <br /> <br /> Even acting has two thumbs up. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their parts perfectly and skilfully interpreting the moods and changing identities of their character. The dialogue may seem a bit stale and clinical at times, but this is part of the effect that Cronenberg was looking for, to create a disenchanted and alien atmosphere that rather embarrasses you. Supporting actors like Ian Holm, Don McKellar and a particularly disturbing Willem Dafoe raise the film even higher with their disturbing performances. <br /> <br /> This movie takes some getting used to, but if you can appreciate the dark tone, bloody images and story of existential deformation, you'll like it.
