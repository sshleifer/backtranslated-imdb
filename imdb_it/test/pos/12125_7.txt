Of all the mafia movies I've ever seen, this is one of the best for many reasons. The acting of Pisces, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best ever (in the mafia genre), as it is realistic. The characters are people with whom many other people can identify. This film is also fantastic, because the dialogue is good. He also has very realistic fights and action scenes. This film has also launched the careers of Pisces and Vincent. If it wasn't for the success of this movie, Casino and Goodfellas would not have been as good as them. <br /> <br /> History 10/10 Acting 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> OVERALL 10/10 <br /> <br /> My favorite films on Mafia are <br / > <br /> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Family Enforcer (The Death Collector) 5: The Sopranos (I know it's not a movie)
