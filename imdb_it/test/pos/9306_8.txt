Fat Man and Little Boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were launched in reverse order on Nagasaki and Hiroshina. How they became and became American hands is the story of this film. <br /> <br /> The terms are the code names of two bombs fueled with plutonium and uranium. Fat Man was the plutonium bomb and that was dropped on Nagasaki and Little Boy was the one used on Hiroshima <br /> <br /> The film is mainly a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of the US Army and the physicist J Robert Oppenheimer who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under the direction of Groves. With two men with such divergent contexts as these, the conflict was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman who was a disarmament activist all his life plays General Groves. To his credit Newman does not interpret a man of whom one would not see much in common with any kind of caricature. Groves is a military man primarily with an engineering background. He wanted a combat command as trained military professionals would naturally want in this great war. But due to his experience in engineering Groves managed to direct the Manhattan Project, which was the purpose of the code name. So be it, Newman is determined to contribute to the counting of war efforts. <br /> <br /> Many of us have known Dwight Schultz of the A-Team as H.M. Murdoch the pilot whose grip on reality is rather tenuous. If only the A-Team was known, one might think that Schultz had a great future in the comic book roles. <br /> <br /> Instead Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with a surprising range of dramatic parts since he left that television series. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. Even the challenge of the problem fascinates him. Later, Oppenheimer had a real bond because of his political views and his leftist colleagues who all knew they had walked in the Manhattan Project. <br /> <br /> Some of the minor roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia in the role of Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson in the role of Oppenheimer's communist mistress, whose relationship with Oppenheimer later led him to such a jackpot, and Laura Dern as a nurse at the Los Alamos site. <br /> <br /> But the best is John Cusack who, like Michael Merriman, is a composite of some real-life scientists who could be accurately labeled as the first victims of the atomic age. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to him, take on a real intensity. <br /> <br /> The debate on bombs as the use made of them is still the subject of heated debate. Fat Man and Little Boy present the facts and let you decide what might have happened if an alternative use of them were taken.
