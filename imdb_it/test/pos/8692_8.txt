Despite its age, this film retains its undoubted charm and attraction, and is an excellent example of British cinema. It has a mysterious air, interspersed with beams of humor that are not out of place, and serves to demonstrate the direction assured and the production values ​​involved. So many episodic movies are disjointed and messy, but this is not one of them. The acting standard helps a lot, and the various disparate characters appear interesting and credible. All in all, this long-forgotten gem deserves anyone's attention, despite the only discordant note in the film that, surprisingly, escaped the attention of the censor!
