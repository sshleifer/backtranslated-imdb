One of my favorite movies, whenever it's active, although I admit that I once missed it when it was on Foxtel last year. <br /> <br /> Despite the film's age it does not seem so and even if it had been made a thousand times before I still felt funny. There were one or two small flaws for me in history, but I looked over and enjoyed the movie for what it was. <br /> <br /> In general I give him a 7/10
