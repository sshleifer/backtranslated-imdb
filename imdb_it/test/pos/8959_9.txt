Once again, I am stunned by the fact that Thomas Gibson never came at the head of the group early in his career. In this film, Gibson once again demonstrates his ability to capture a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th century. Soft but not effeminate, fearful of the fundamental principles of love, Gibson's character touches a variety of emotions. The performance of Cameron Bancroft is also worthy of praise. His need to be the heterosexual conqueror in contrast to his best friend's "homosexual conquests" provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected. The chemistry of Bancroft and Gibson is evident from the first scene in which they appear together. There are many "panels" in this quilt. From gay relationships to direct relationships; from heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love; this film travels through the broad spectrum of sexuality despite having at its center the story of a serial killer. My only regret is that it took 6 years from its release before discovering this movie! I look forward to seeing him again and highly recommend him to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or director Denys Arcand.
