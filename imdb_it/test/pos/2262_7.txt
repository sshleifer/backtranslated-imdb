Everything is illuminated A young American Jew looks for the woman who helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a European tour with some unlikely associates. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with playful anguish usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, it usually happens to take a biographical look at the souls under the acting mask. We usually receive a mixture of genres: Check. But what we don't normally understand is an original insightful film that is credible, intelligent and moving. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, a curious little boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. He is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. The sepia image brings his grandfather (a strange resemblance to him) and the woman. To help her journey, travel guides are enlisted who include a hip-hop break-dancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), her apathetic and perma-oppressed grandfather (Boris Leskin) and her dog - Sammy Davis Junior Jr! What follows is essentially a comedy. There is a minimally invasive introduction with voice-overs. Alex's is especially funny while educating his younger brother in 1969, demonstrating how popular he is with chicks and break-dances, putting him as Jonathan's antithesis. <br /> <br /> Schreiber begins to break the characters as they progress and the play acts as an intentional veil to what is a story of three people connected to the Holocaust who do not really know each other. All three maintain the film with tenderness and authenticity that Schreiber would never have wrong and as charming and fantastic as the film, the horrors they are allowed to penetrate, that is, the past is presented in an almost satisfying tone (incidental music, cinematography) that make them even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> While the unlikely group finally finds the city they are looking for, they learn of the real atrocities that happened and find out a lot about who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elijah wood is authentic as usual, bringing its usual innocence and strength to the screen. Formally resident in Lord of the Rings and an evil Sin City resident, he plays Jonathan casually while being bombarded with cultural shocks and the search for truth. Even Boris Leskin as his grandfather expresses his anguish and frustration in young people with great humor and conviction while his past is revealed. However, it is Eugene Hutz like Alex doing the show. The director uses that old trade of translation misconceptions to create and maintain a humor that is actually amusing and not deceptive. <br /> <br /> Schreiber has made an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. The continuous soundtrack and beautiful photography create a fairy tale fairy tale around a story of identity, truth and family. If there were a complaint, it would be the speed with which the film changes direction; although this may have been intentional, it may not be suitable for everyone. Nevertheless, this is an exceptional effort that offers great comedy and a link between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of the Second World War in a whole new way. <br /> <br /> - Who & Ojo
