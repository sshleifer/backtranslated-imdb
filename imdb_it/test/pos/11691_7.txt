This film by the famous Czech director and collaborator Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for its peculiarity, but annoying and distracted in its details. Taking the theme and title from a poem by Robert Graves, it is a woman with several men and some hateful relatives in her life who is trying to survive and protect her two children, fifteen-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and a small blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik). The poem is very much in evidence, but the theme - it gets lost a bit. <br /> <br /> Marcela (Anna Geislerová), Beauty and Jarda (Roman Luknár) lost everything in the 2002 Prague floods and there is nothing left, apparently, but good sex, that go with so much vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the television, must keep their ears against the noise. Hrebejek appreciates this explicitness and skates to the limits of embarrassment or shock. There is no precise explanation as to why, but the financial desperation led Jarda to process stolen cars in the large garage that borders his apartment. His cohort of car thieves wipes out an elegant Volvo, while Benes (Josef Abrham) accommodating left with the keys in the dashboard while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but not stupid. His Volvo is wired for satellite monitoring in cases like this and this takes the cops directly to Jarda's garage and he and his group are in prison. <br /> <br /> "Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel, / Upon whom can count", begins the poem of Graves. But in reality this fight brings Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He presents it to sushi and how to drink wine and lets it fly with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, although born in Prague, owns a beautiful villa and lived most of his life. He is here to claim the house in Prague, now occupied by a couple with an elderly and sick mother, who allows her to stay. Every gesture of Benes is benevolent, even if it does not prevent Jarda from going to prison. <br /> <br /> In the circumstances Marcela must retire with Lucina and Kuba to depend on her mother's charity, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the much less tender mercies of Zdena's current husband, the diabetic skeletal Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer) - which, for children, who start when they commit the deadly sin of consuming their diet cookies, proves to be the uncle of hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point and never lets it go. Also in the final scene is a menacing threat figure. It is surprising that the hateful Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. He insists that Marcela needs to go out alone, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become unlikely allies. Unlikely - perhaps implausible. Why should he like Benes? So what is the whole story of Benes? For some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /> <br /> Clearly the "good angel", Benes is infallibly kind - and an elegant and handsome old man whose manner suits his Italian upbringing. It is only at the end, when he is pushed to the limits of his ownership of Prague by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one who will not lie down and be trampled. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the religious fanatic mother of Jarda Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard, are something to keep an eye on. But she is just another wild card that does not increase the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem was set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on the screen by singer-accordionist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a larger one staged in a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief friend. If you worship Hrebejk as an author, you might like this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel free. Also included are a number of Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova songs from the Oscar-winning Irish musical film "Once", including the latter's soundtrack, "Falling". They feel more out of place than they otherwise would be because of their familiarity with "Once" - even though this film came first. <br /> <br /> Hrebejk's people are arresting; even the little Koba has his moments as a Shakespearean child and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to expand too much. The annoyances owned by Benes can be useful to show that it has a difficult side. But such an elaborate demonstration was not necessary. Acting is fine, and there is something wonderful with oddity and specificity, but the fundamental themes of love, sex and money are lost in the confusion and conflicts of Marcela and how it resolves them never become clear. It's okay that there's no solution, true to Graves' theme and poetry that Marcela still has a sexual relationship with Jarda during a visit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her children. But too many questions remain about what to do with the hateful Richard or the annoyingly pious mother of Jarda (Emília Vásáryová). Why do we suddenly learn that Koba is receiving letters from "India" supposedly from his father, who is in prison? When did it happen? Interesting details, glued hastily. It looks like a world where you can't see the forest for the trees.
