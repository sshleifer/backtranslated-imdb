The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, from more or less traditional visions such as those related to art, to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the game along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructive lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me cold enough is that I had no idea what he was talking about. What is the vision / idea / concept behind this interpretation of Shakespeare? Previous reviewers don't go much further than the tragedy of revenge, the punk show, but surely there is more, isn't it? This does not mean that there is no vision here, only that it was difficult for me to find out. However, there are still things to enjoy. The punk flavor is refreshing and fun. Toyah Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I didn't care much about Williams as Prospero ... not enough magic, I suppose. The exchanges between the old monastery / castle and the (very English) outside world can be a bit scary at times, but I think it's intentional. All in all, interesting but not really the success that I hoped could be (in particular after having seen Jarman's Caravaggio).
