I think this film is the most misunderstood film in Jerry Lewis' career. He's a little slow starting, but after it started it's a lot of fun and the use of Jerry's irony like never before in his previous films ..., that is, Who's touching the store, The mad professor, etc. , The idea is clear, it's a fake of Dirty Dozen, instead of bringing soldiers on death row to perform a suicide mission like in that movie, you have 4, 4-f's and 2 tag alongs. Including the former L.A. All-star Centerfielder Dodgers, Willie Davis as Linc! FUNNY! I love that movie!
