Elderbrush Gulch's battle was Griffith's longest and most expensive short he had invented so far. In it we see him trying to perfect the large-scale action scene that would be necessary in his feature films, including all the elements that had made his previous short film of success. <br /> <br /> Does Griffith use the western format ?? already the ideal background for pure and simple action sets ?? as the setting for his first epic battle. Like many westerns of the '10s, is the starting point a character from the east heading west? a device that perhaps helped to lighten the public in the desert, and here the eastern ones are a couple of children, which was important for the type of image in which it develops. For Griffith, one cannot have action without a sense of vulnerability and here he stipulates it, with the children returning to the east, Lillian Gish as the distraught mother of "the only child in the city" and even some puppies that are at risk of ending on the menu of the Indians. <br /> <br /> All this paves the way for an extremely complex and stratified action sequence, merging the scenario of the trapped heroine and the race to the rescue with the battles that Griffith had been portrayed from his first images of Civil War in 1909. There is a phenomenal amount going on here, and Griffith does very well at keeping the pace exhilarating throughout and keeping everything coherent and logical. However, juggling x amount of items in an action sequence does not necessarily make it many times more exciting, no matter how cleverly they are balanced, and Griffith has created better tense endings before and after this. <br /> <br /> But even an image of Griffith so strongly focused on action would not be without its drama, its characterization and its atmosphere. In The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch, the emotional setting is treated briefly but economically. First, we have the scene where the waifs leave their home. The cart travels upside down from the camera, making use of depth and distance to express their distancing from safety and civilization. An equally effective scene is one in which we are presented to Gish's young family, Bobby Harron and their child. The people of the city threw the precious tot, then moved away from the screen, revealing that two Indians were watching them from the background, adding a sinister little note of danger. <br /> <br /> Of course, many viewers today have pointed out The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch, the offensive portrait of Native Americans (in contrast to the more sympathetic Red Man's View), but maybe that's not all it seems. First of all, take a look at the waistcoat of the Indian Chief's son? it is black and covered with shiny white dots. It looks like a pearly king jacket, maybe slightly modified for the warmer climate. Now take a look at the "war dance" that will perform later? has a certain "kneeling". These are not Indians, they are cockney! So it should not be offensive to Native Americans. Only the cockney.
