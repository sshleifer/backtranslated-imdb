The influences of other science fiction and thriller films and stories are evident throughout this film. The films that immediately come to mind are Alien, Aliens and Starship Troopers. The story itself is quite simple and not so original, hibernating that travels through space, crashing into the planet with no apparent life and a "deserted" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together towards their mutual survival, while the body count goes up. This type of film always tends to be fun, as long as it's done right. I think Pitch Black was done well. The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them the longer the film goes on, and I think people will be surprised by those who do it and can't make it. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotyped convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physical ability, high tolerance for pain, and can conveniently see in the dark. You know he'll end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because in the movie he says he actually might have a consciousness of things. <br /> <br /> Cole House plays the bounty hunter addict who is probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to Riddick, since his character is revealed throughout the film. He is very likely to be the bravest when the odds and firepower are in his favor. A very selfish character who eventually gets what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed ship, which is shaken from deep sleep because the ship has passed through a swarm of meteorites or the tail of a comment. Finding the pilot dead in his bedroom, he tries to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that character's potentially fatal flaw: fear of responsibility, responsibility and guidance. His character in the short span of history probably grows more, in the sense that in reality a little conviction grows, takes the lead, and does not sit waiting to be devoured by alien stalking at night. She in some strange way connects with the always remote human side of Riddick, who in turn, in the end, respects her for her choices and her adhesion with them. <br /> <br /> The story in some cases plays like you would expect, but I think you will be slightly surprised that the characters survive this harrowing experience. This film is a fun wreck to watch. Go see it! <br /> <br />
