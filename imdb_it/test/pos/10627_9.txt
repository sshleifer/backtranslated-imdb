I completely disagree with the comments of one of the critics before I rejected the film. Having read the book, I was struck by it, although this is a sort of literature that you can't really LIKED (similar to Hubert Selby's writing) I expected to be shocked but the effect was more subtle than this. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-level character. There are many scenes that focus totally on her and her subtle changes and I can imagine a few actresses who would do so well, with so much disdain for their reputation or image. There is this coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time there is this impotence, pain and pain. There is a person who is in control and at the same time controlled. Perhaps this is not realistic - even if reading the newspaper you will read much worse than this - but there is a truth that is very difficult to bear. I think it's an excellent movie, but I didn't like watching it. It's not boring, but there are times when I want it to end. By the way, his male counterpart is very well acted (and I think he is well chosen too).
