I loved it. In fact, I looked at it again and again and again, and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring. <br /> <br /> The concept of vampire has been revolutionized in this film. It's a job well done, great for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me whenever she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue offers a great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2 to arrive.
