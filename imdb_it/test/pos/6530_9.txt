This is a really nice movie. I had a huge sleepover (girls 10-11) and they loved this movie. They watched it twice! Don't let the judgment deceive you. You must be at least 13 years old to vote for a movie on IMDb, which eliminates the target audience for the film. If you have a girl (or a boy) between 7 and 13, I guarantee that they will love this movie. <br /> <br /> A sort of inverted genre "Notting Hill" set in high school. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who is failing her private private lessons. His mother sends him to a "normal" high school with the ultimatum, "passes high school or no summer tour". Following the advice of his manager (former pop star David Cassidy), he befriends the smartest girl in school (Alana Austin) with the intention of robbing her. Look for the humorous and insightful janitor (another former pop star Lief Garrett).
