After a couple of years of research for the Humphrey Bogart film, "Two Against the World", he unexpectedly appeared as a TCM offering with the title "One Fatal Hour", a first national film of 1936. The character of Bogey is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose program list is losing listeners. The owner, Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by committing them to hunt down Scott. <br /> <br /> In an effort to increase the audience base and revenue, Reynolds has the idea of ​​reviving a twenty-year murder case and offering it as a fifteen-chapter radio game. Scott enlists the help of Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the play and present it on the air. <br /> <br /> The Pembroke Murder case concerned a woman who was acquitted by the murder of her husband, the circumstances of which are unclear. However, Gloria Pembroke got married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is getting married (on the same day not less like the game of radio is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). To address the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs take a crusade to stop the program. At the same time, Edith's future in-laws respond by asking that the marriage not take place. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the final result, the film takes a devastating turn to shake the spectator. Edith Carstairs confronts the principals of the radio station, strongly warning Scott and Reynolds sniveling. While accepting his share of the blame for the result, Scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job, firing his secretary and dragging her out of the office, recognizing her for the conscience he once had. With a completely abrupt ending, the film leaves one disoriented and upset like any film that doesn't have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> With about a dozen films under his belt, Humphrey Bogart has the chance to be the center of attention with intriguing results. Without a name that supports the players, Bogey gets to the occasion taking control over the confines of the radio offices and manages the show as if it were his own. In an interesting characteristic aspect, he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands on his bowed head, anticipating a similar effect that we will see in "Casablanca" by half a dozen years. For Bogart fans, it's a real pleasure to capture an unexpected nuance like this.
