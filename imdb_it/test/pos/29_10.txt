<br /> <br /> What more can you ask for? A great script based on one of the most beautiful plays of the second half of the 20th century, two beautiful emotional performances by Courtney and Finney, a realistic vision of London's wartime, a great supporting cast. This film takes you on an emotional roller coaster through humor, sadness, loss and fulfillment. if you are at the theater it is even more effective. This is a real 10 on the rating scale!
