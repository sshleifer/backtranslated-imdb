(*** Minor spoiler ***) <br /> <br /> If there's anything in the world of dumb clowns that puzzles me, it's that Charley Chase never got his well-deserved "break through" in movies . Oh well, maybe it's not so weird, as he has never acted in any feature film. But when I think about it, an explanation like that makes it all the more mysterious - why the hell did Chase not get any offers to play the main role in the features? One explanation is that his character, no matter how funny, was simply too realistic to adapt to a longer story; without the burlesque elements that possessed Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon and other comedians, it can be assumed that the comedy he performed that worked so well for twenty minutes would become repetitive after a few more rounds. However, I do not buy it much, since the construction of the Chase gag is magnificent and, in my opinion, could best keep the spectators' interest alone for a longer period; at least I'm tempted to think that when MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE runs the show. <br /> <br /> Mr. The moose is not an extraordinary beauty, and Mrs. Moose is hardly a "classic beauty"; it has the front teeth larger than any human being on the planet, and has a remarkably large nose. Both take plastic surgery without the other being aware of it, and when they meet by chance a little later, they don't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband. A series of hilarious misunderstandings begins, with many intelligent gags to the very end. I don't think I reveal anything more, to make the vision more pleasant for you. Because if you are a fan of silent comedies, or even if you are not, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE offers so many memorable moments in such a short time that I would consider it a real shame not to see it; really silly, but not extremely fun.
