Every film that offers Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the supporting cast deserves to be seen, and comedian Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the exceptional talent he has recruited for his directorial debut in 2007, a sad comedy on a overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. Famous as Larry David's Jeff manager in "Curb Your Enthusiasm", Garlin plays James, a 39-year-old Chicago actor, still struggling, who still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's the comedic way he sees his single status involving his dilemma. If the plot seems a little familiar, it is because the film is in part a tribute to Ernest Borgnine's 1955 classic, "Marty", about a lone butcher from the Bronx who lives with his intriguing mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as the drama that James is desperate to do as he is so empathetic about the character's situation. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a sort of love story in this new version of the millennium, and Silverman plays Beth, a cold and sexually voracious waiter who takes him shopping. Their best scene together is in his favorite store where they improvise different characters in different corridors. Hunt plays a solitary elementary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They accidentally meet in a record store and then again in a career day at his school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of students, including his friend Luca's daughter, Penelope (played by the double of Dakota Fanning) little sister Elle). In a cameo that looks like Jerri Blank, Sedaris plays the school counselor who talks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a director of the retirement home, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy relationship that makes their friendship easy. The actress Mina Kolb, who plays James' pixilated mother with courage and heart, almost steals the film. <br /> <br /> There are also unexpected cameos from the young idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (don't ask ... but the set-up is fun), as well as the acutely played parts by director Paul Mazursky (like the snake director of a candid-room-type show, "Smear Job"), Tim Kazurinsky (as the unsuspecting victim of that show) and Dan Castellaneta (as the owner of the hard-love grocery store). With his sad attacks of insecurity and self-contempt, Garlin's comic sensibility resembles that of Albert Brooks, and casual dialogue at its best reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life". The only persistent problem I had with the film is the rhythm like some scenes dragged longer than necessary. The problem is more evident in the first half when Garlin is trying to establish the right time, and the lack of real conflict increases slowness. Regardless, what is good for you is to capture the sense of poignant despair that you feel on the revelation that life is not what it should be, that a significant other can be out of reach, and that a constant diet of junk food eaten on a the hood of the car is the only certain thing when it comes to gratification.
