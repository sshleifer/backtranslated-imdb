In a world very close to the future, a corrupt government constantly monitors everyone with computers and surveillance. A man has managed to evade assimilation, and works outside the system, fighting to preserve his freedom. An engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera jobs. There are some confusing and slow parts, but all in all, an excellent example of what a small crew with brains and talent can do with a small budget.
