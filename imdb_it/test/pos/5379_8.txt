This is a creepy creepy gem with chilling shows and a fantastic ending! All the characters are fantastic and the story was fantastic, and I thought the ending was really cool! The plot was great, and it never bored me, and even though the kids actors were bad, they made me shudder! This happened on the space channel a while ago, so I decided to try it and record it, I read some good reviews of other horror fans, I must say that I agree with them, it's very disturbing and full of suspense, in addition to Strother Martin, he was fantastic in his role as the worshiper of Satan. It has a lot of creepy atmosphere, and it makes you guess everything, besides all the characters they were very nice, and you really started rooting for Ben and his family! It has a lot of scary moments, and the movie really shocked me sometimes, plus, it's extremely well done on a shoestring budget! This is a creepy underrated gem, with chilling performances and a fantastic ending!, I highly recommend this!. The management is very good! Bernard McEveety does a great job here, with a great photographic work, creating a very disturbing atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace! There is some blood and blood. Let's take a severed leg, a bag of bloody corpses, a bleeding throat, slicing and dicing, decapitation and impalement. Acting is excellent! Strother Martin is great here! as the worshiper of Satan, it is extremely disturbing, very convincing, it was rather chilling, it was extremely intense, seemed to be having fun and did a great job in general! Charles Bateman is as big as his dad, he was very thoughtful, very nice, and he gave a good show!, I really enjoyed it. L.Q. Jones is as fantastic as the sheriff, he was fun, on top of things, he looked very young, he had a nice character, and he did a great job overall! Ahna Capri is as good as her girlfriend and did what she had to do quite well. Charles Robinson acted as extreme as a Priest and didn't convince me a bit! And that laugh was particularly bad. Geri Reischl is as decent as her daughter, she was quite nice, and she got on my nerves only a couple of times, I rather liked her. Alvy Moore was stupid, but very nice in his role as Tobey I dug him !. The rest of the cast is good. Overall I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 on 5
