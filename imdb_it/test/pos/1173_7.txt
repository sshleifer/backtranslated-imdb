with two old friends. I've always liked Lemmon and Mathaeu movies, and of course their team efforts are always worth looking at, and often hilarious. <br /> <br /> Even if I didn't do it I personally consider this film as in the hilarious category, it is certainly a competent and amusing vehicle for fans of the two main actors and 60s-style romantic plots. <br /> <br /> Brent Spiner could really steal the show in terms of laughter as the arrogant and tyrannical director of the cruise. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven demonstrates that older ladies can remain enormously attractive.
