For the most part, love films have never been my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few love films that I could not only sit down but really like. Nicholas Cage is outstanding in his first role and Deborah Foreman is pretty beyond imagination. There are secondary stories that tend to get confused, but not enough to detract from this film.
