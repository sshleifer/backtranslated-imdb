I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this movie. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was fine, the only problem was that Moog had a very small life, and the doc was well ... contained. Haack's story is full of all the salable tragedies that people buy these days, but they really care. Even if the film does not go so far into tragic things, it can be perceived that Bruce has accepted the price of making music his own way. There are so many elements that make up his IE legacy. invention of the Peopleodian, where Bruce could actually play music by touching people. It must have been challenging to document Haack's "spooky" release, which practically fit into every conceivable musical category (including rap music), but the director cut the piece very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. And the cast ... with which group of characters Bruce has surrounded himself, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, stumbling with children, fighting against the music industry. I recommend this film to anyone interested in the history of music, it's mainstream, but it's important.
