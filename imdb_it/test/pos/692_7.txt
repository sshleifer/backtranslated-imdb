This is an excellent jumper from the war years. John Mills leads an excellent cast of usual British B-movie supporters in a submarine assault on an imaginary enemy warship. <br /> <br /> Shot in black and white, it is well structured and also well positioned considering that a war was happening at the time. If nothing else, it shows how seriously the authorities have made positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission side of the film takes place in real submarines. Things are cramped and claustrophobic. The actors seem adequately dirty and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic taste. Other commentators have already drawn attention to small, authentic details like keeping the ship trim and forgetting to read the tools, as well as engine room activities. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first film in which debris (and a dead German) is thrown from the torpedo tube to trick an enemy destroyer. And it is the ONLY time I saw part of the ship exposed in a sinking fiction - a high risk bet if there ever was one. <br /> <br /> I am a little skeptical about whether or not a submarine could break through a wire mesh. Submerged speed was just twice that of human walking speed, and the network would have had a great deal of "giving". Moreover, the engineer was in the same workstation and operated the same levers both on the surface and immersed. This too seems implausible given that diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so I was told. <br /> <br /> There was a bit too much drama on the side of the shore for my tastes But then, this was a propaganda effort, and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to take care of their behavior as they could negatively influence the morale of the service and therefore the war effort. <br /> <br /> These prejudices aside, it's a pretty fun little adventure. Nowadays the films of this vintage tend to be shown in the afternoon, while the most modern and inferior films enjoy prime time. But then; it is no longer politically correct to speak of war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them have a guilty conscience), or of our left-wing fascists (none of whom has ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted). <br /> <br /> As an underwater film it is eminently collectible. Better than 'The Enemy Below', I think, although less demonstrative. Not as authentic as "Das Boot" by any means, but not so coarse.
