It's fun to see a young James Cagney doing his thing. He plays CheapSkope's boy of weights and measures who takes his work very seriously, trampling the tips of a group of crooked politicians. He is offered the world, but he maintains his integrity. He is defeated and deployed, but that's the problem. We never know if he is really in danger. They say he is in a position, but he still seems to have carte blanche to move and do what he has to do. Sometimes he is so arrogant that he doesn't do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department, but almost everything else is pretty corrupt. He perseveres (almost too good to be true), of course, and we pull for him. The problem for me is the lack of sustained suspense. It would have been much better if he had to cancel his name. He never goes deep, even when he is rejected by his wife. It's still fun with the bad kind of implosion. Just watch it to watch Cagney do his hard posturing.
