While all the "Superman" comics by Fleischer / Famous Studios are excellent, "Billion Dollar Limited", the third in the series, is probably the best in terms of animation, plot and rhythm. Because he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for best animated short for 1942 (Incredibly, only the first was) in unexplained. <br /> <br /> Here, Lois Lane is in charge of covering the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the US mint. The gangsters masked in their super-powerful car (for 1942) take off after the train, determined to get that gold. Without giving too far, what ensues is a thrill for both characters and the public, with truth, justice and Superman triumphant at the end. As did all the Fleischer / Famous Superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on the radio, have the honors work voice here, and Perennial Fleischer Jack Mercer gets some to do as one of the bad guys, as well.
