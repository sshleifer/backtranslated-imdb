Four young saints of the Mormon country go to L.A. to preach the Gospel to urban pagans. But one of the young Mormons is a repressed homosexual who "happens" to meet with a very young party boy. (What would it be to film the plots without coincidences?). These two, very different, young friends become friends and, in the process, influence their respective perspectives which, in turn, create an inevitable clash between gay and Mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> This is the premise of "Latter Days", a 2003 film written and directed by C.Jay Cox, himself a former Mormon missionary. The story of the film is obviously very relevant, especially in contemporary America. The variations of this story must be told, and told, and repeated, hopefully in future films ... because the underlying theme highlights the hatefully superior attitude that Christian fundamentalists often show towards gays. By its nature, "Latter Days" is provocative and I doubt that the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, although the screenplay is intelligent, sensitive and insightful.
