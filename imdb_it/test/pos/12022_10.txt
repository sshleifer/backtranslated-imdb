When commenting on this film, one must realize that it is based on a true story, and must therefore be reviewed for the quality and precision of his portrait of the events, as well as its entertainment value. It might be unlikely that Jack Shepherd surrenders twice to Jack Wild because Wild has captured Edgeworth Bess. Nevertheless, it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied on proven techniques. There have been occasions when Clavell has not had the security to follow the script as written. The film would be better if he had done it. And yes, I had a copy of the script (the copy of Stanley Baker - one of the five), which I recently returned from my father, Rafe Newhouse, the writer.
