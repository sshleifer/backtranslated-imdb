Seriously. If it had been Shack's first film, it would have been passable as funny, silly and stupid. Light satirical comments on the class system would make this a pleasant late-night rental. <br /> <br /> However, everyone wants to compare it to the first film, and maybe it's not right. The first film is a cult classic; what could follow him? Anything. So take this second movie by yourself, and it certainly has its moments. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is fun, doing his best Rodney imitation. Is he as good as Rodney? No. Are your lines good? No. But it's fun. The rest of the cast is in line as decent, but not exceptional. You'll recognize the faces of the cast and you'll wonder how they got to where they are today. <br /> <br /> Is the film predictable, but not in this genre? Again, it's not the best comedy you'll see, but if you like Cannonball Run fun, you'll like it.
