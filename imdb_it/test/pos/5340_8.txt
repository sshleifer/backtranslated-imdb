This scene shows how Wallace's experiment, using his invention to manipulate the brain, is terribly wrong, creating the "Were Rabbit". His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve the company for the better, therefore, he created a "Brain Manipulator" machine. He risked his life to help solve Tottington's rabbit problem and, more importantly, to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits collected and stored in his cellar. Though he thought his experiment had worked, however, the result was to put more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the Annual Vegetable Competition again put his life at risk. Gromit, who is a faithful and silent dog and a faithful helper, continually finds himself thinking of innovative ways to save his master, from his crazy radical inventions that go terribly wrong. What is interesting in this film, is trying to identify: who is more entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?
