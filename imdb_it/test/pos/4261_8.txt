Putney Swope is the story of a black man who is on the board of a large advertising company that was accidentally named chairman of the board when the company owner collapses while trying to stutter an apparently rather excited. Putney obviously takes his new role to heart and fires most of them in the agency, hires a new crew (all black except for a white token) and proceeds to churn out the most offensive and non-PC commercials can ask for. Now he is a rather heterogeneous crew that he has and nevertheless somehow manage to succeed while they rake in the money. I rather like the scene where potential advertisers are relieved of money and then told to "go out". And their commercials will follow later, like it or not. The story is good, but of course the highlight is the self-advertising, especially that for the "Face Off" acne cream. This is rather dated, but it's still a fun movie and full of hilarious moments. Robert Downey Sr. worked for an advertising agency by posting experimental announcements at the time and I imagine this was his middle finger in Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and pretty damn funny. 8 out of 10.
