I took this movie on t.v. at 4:30 am I had no expectations for this, but after the opening credits I knew I had something good. <br /> <br /> There are situations that have been left to your interpretation to "find out" what really happened so your attention is a key factor. <br /> <br /> The entire psychological situation of the thriller is very much concerned with character development and the way things are performed by the main character. <br /> <br /> - Conscience also plays an important role because through a series of events and dialogues you will be able to correctly interpret and generate an opinion. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Really good indeed. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she is a candy for the eye even though she is almost always in her white clothes. <br /> <br /> The fear factor is almost non-existent, but there is a lot of mystery and tension from which to dig. <Br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those who love supernatural and psychological thrillers.
