I probably wouldn't have bothered to comment on this movie if I hadn't been bothered by the continuous references made here in North America as a porn movie. Our obsession with what is, or should be, considered pornographic remains a relic of the "guide" given to the directors by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and now it is really time to relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed much beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now call "soft" and "hard" porn, with both bearing the same pornographic label. The time has come for us all to recognize that neither the version of R rated (soft porn?) Of this film, nor the version without rating (hard porn?) Available on DVD were in any way pornographic. <br /> <br /> legal terms pornography is defined by its ability to deprave or corrupt. Many classic books like Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Story of 'O' or Moll Flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content, judged by the jury and liquidated on the basis of this definition, but in practice the citizens most common are not interested in what they consider a legal misunderstanding, and apply a simpler test that is rather severe when applied to books or films that are very close to the line, but serves to quickly wipe out most of the others from any contamination of the pornography. Although the Hayes code would have judged the AIW unacceptable for both nudity and its depictions of sexual activity, in practice most people accept that the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of stable long-term family relationships in which participants find real fulfillment, cannot be considered pornographic (this does not mean that works describing unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognized as pornographic, only that they may require a more sophisticated assessment) . In AIW, we have a movie about a young librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing and keeps her suitor with arms wide open for the feeling that this is what morality requires to do. After becoming too frustrated by this and threatening to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams of being transported to a Wonderland (strictly based on that of Lewis Carrol) where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs. She is shocked, but she is a kind person who takes things as she finds them, so in a short time she discovers that her prejudices are gradually melting. He wakes up when his boyfriend returns to interrupt their relationship, but his attitude towards him has changed so completely that their relationship is completely restored, and the film ends with them living 'happy and contented' with their children in a home with a white fence and family dog ​​- a final clearly aimed at those romantics who remain very young at heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Hardly! <br /> <br /> Vision suitable for children? - Well, probably not entirely, unless they have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> Vote R? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Fun for viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the film has its flaws - these are discussed in many of the comments here on IMDb, however most commentators have clearly appreciated and appreciated. <br /> <br /> I think the only pornography associated with this film was the one denounced by an anti-pornographic "scientific proof" activist that a photo of Kristin deBell in a magazine was a photographic montage of images of the face of a child of ten years with various parts of the body of models for adults. These and other comments have seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress, but today the film seems to have become a cult classic, several home video productions have been released in both VHS and DVD format; the last was a DVD that contained both the classified and unclassified R versions of the film, distributed by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies of this were readily available until a few months ago, now they are almost sold out and mail order salespeople who have still in stock copies sell them their original price - a situation that usually quickly translates into a new DVD release. This continuous interest, almost 35 years after the original film was released, points to an almost classic status. <br /> <br /> Commentators of this database should provide viewers with useful clues as to whether a film deserves to be watched or even collected - my comments here were intended to highlight the ongoing damage to the industry which still results from the pressure on the main studies to respect the self-censorship recommendations originated by the Hayes committee. In this database these general comments are quickly reported by the readers as "not useful" and I rarely do them; but fortunately I still have room to add that, in my opinion, this film is rather unusual and worth watching or even buying it. It's imperfect, but Kristine deBell offers a great performance and the film offers a rather unique and rewarding visual experience. Overall I would rate it at 7 stars and buy a copy of the next DVD edition if and when it appears. If Mrs deBell is still alive today I would like to hear her comments both on attempts to suppress this film and on the belated recognition she has gradually achieved.
