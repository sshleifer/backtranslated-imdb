I was given the "Summertime" solo in fifth grade for our spring choral concert. From that moment on, a great appreciation for Gershwin's music arose in me. I love the poignant melodies of this Gershwin opera. When I was in fifth grade (around 10 years), I had the LP with which to practice and I also love the soundtrack. I recommend seeing this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, take it - sometimes you can find it on eBay - an old used LP. I searched and searched to try to find the soundtrack on CD. The songs on this have wonderful musical arrangements and I really wish they would have been put on CD for purchase and I would also like them to restore the film and put it on DVD. This is really a great job that I think present and future generations can enjoy and benefit from. Some might think that the film is slow and boring, but I find the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have dubbed the musical voices, I think the voices fit well with faces and personalities. The speaking voice and the sung voice of a person can be quite different. Porgy and Bess and the songs of this opera will always have a special meaning for me.
