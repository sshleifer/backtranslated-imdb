'A Tale of Two Sisters', or 'Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. Brilliant psychological thriller, mind-blowing drama and compelling horror in a single well-orchestrated package. From the intricate plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> For fear of revealing too much about the plot, I will only say that it is very satisfying. Although at first it may seem a little difficult to understand, in the end it does a good job of explaining. And whether you prefer the psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, it is almost flawless. The set, the cinematography, the lighting, and in particular the soundtrack, are all compelling. The waltz at the beginning seemed a bizarre choice, but it turned out to be a brilliant choice. As for the casting, we are talking about absolute perfection. Sono Su-jeong is totally convincing as the Su-mi, bold and restless. Mun Keun-yeong is just as convincing as his emotionally traumatized sister Su-yeon. These two girls were magical on the screen. I will certainly watch in their other films. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceptively cheerful and obsessively evil like his stepmother. Finally, Kap-su Kim offers an excellent performance as a tired and destroyed father. I really love this movie. If you haven't seen "A story of two sisters" yet, I strongly suggest you find a copy. It is a real gem, worthy of anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
