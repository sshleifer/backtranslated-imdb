Edge of the City of 1957, directed by Martin Ritt, starring John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It is the story of a troubled man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually emerges during the film. He has a connection that brings him a job on a loading platform that works for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real war man who takes the repercussions from his workers and drives them hard. Charlie has an intense aversion to a black man, the T.T. (Poitier) who holds the same position. T.T. invites Axel to work on his team; Axel challenges Charlie and does it. Axel finds a place to live and socialize with T.T., his wife (Dee) and their son's white teacher (Kathleen McGuire). When the tragedy strikes, none of the men on the loading platform will talk to the police, and Axel has to deal with his values, what he represents and the meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> This is a really excellent black and white film that curiously isn't really about being in black or white! It really is about the limits that one imposes and knows who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the dock. T.T. teases Charlie and gives the best he gets. There is no question of T.T. and Axel spend time together or the child of T.T. having a white teacher with whom the family socializes. What Axel, a loner, finds difficult is to accept any friendship or confidence in anyone - these things he learns through TT <br /> <br /> Poitier absolutely shines in "Edge of the City" - he is warm, energetic, loving and intelligent, a man with a real enthusiasm for life, without fear of anything. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a totally opposite character - hidden in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever it is, he is now a different man. <br /> <br /> Film strangely underrated and unknown, perhaps in the shadow of many angry young films released at that time.
