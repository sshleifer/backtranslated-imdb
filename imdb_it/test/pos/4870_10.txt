OK, so, in all the Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner comics, we know that WEC will prepare all sorts of traps for RR, but it always changes in various ways. This certainly happens in "Beep, Beep". Predictable? I guess it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show how the more you try to hurt someone else, the more you get hurt; a bit like Daffy Duck always tries to undermine the integrity of Bugs Bunny but Bugs sees it around. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another classic of the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes, I think if we really wanted to ease the tensions of the Cold War, we could have let the Soviet Union watch Looney Tunes cartoons; I'm sure they would have loved them. Another big one. <br /> <br /> PS: I learned about "Jeopardy!" that Wile E. Coyote's second name is Ethelbert.
