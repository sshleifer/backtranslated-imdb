I was lucky enough to see him at this year's Tribeca Film Festival. I was amazed at how well done it was and how fun this wonderful little movie was. Director Griffin Dunne did a great job assembling this film which has several characters and different narrative lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly. The main story involves the family and is a very stimulating and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, but it still has that commercial advantage - an "indie" movie for the masses, if you will. The cast's performances are excellent, but it is Diane Lane who shines the most. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be nominated for an Oscar. The first few days I know, but Lane puts on her socks.
