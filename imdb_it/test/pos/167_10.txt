Bloody Birthday plays on the alleged innocence of children and shows them as bloody monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, credited as Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), were all born on the same day during an eclipse. In addition to sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they are not picky about who they kill). The young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy interpret the parts of these monsters quite well without emotion, but they also know when to put the charm. But they cannot continue to deceive everyone. This is a beautiful horror film, it's not too realistic, there are some good moments of suspense and the boys play the roles well, (the big ones are quite beautiful). I would say that it's worth seeing (I have a copy too).
