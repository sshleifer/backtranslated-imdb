"Hey, I didn't order any taxis!" "Yes, well, you have one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop who was a taxi driver with a heart of gold. If you were able (and fortunately for American television viewers ... one person a week) to penetrate the cold and hard surface of Hack's exterior, you had to see a caring man dedicated to vigilante justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms exploded in goose bumps when our dear friend Hack would get out of his taxi in another dark alley ... with nothing but his fists ... ready to avenge an abused civilian. A smile would burst in my face when the screen showed me a criminal in the facial expressions of a dark alley when the lights of the Taxi of Justice lit up his face. Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to bask in the warmth of Hack's brilliance. I've never seen a better show and I mourned the loss of one of the greatest American treasures when the show was canceled. In other news related to Hack, I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are waiting for Hack Koen to come into the world in about three weeks.
