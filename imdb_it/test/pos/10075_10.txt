Watching this little movie is a real pleasure from beginning to end. The story is always fun, the tension never loosens. The whole cast is wonderful. The Walken and Bracco team works perfectly, it's almost an echo of a classic broom love story. Bracco is very sexy and very funny as the scam artist who fights for his independence. For some reason have they given Walken a very strange makeup and the strangest haircut I can imagine ?? it's kind of a parody of what Burt Lancaster had in Elmer Gantry. For me he added to pleasure. It is the first film in which I saw Miguel Ferrer, probably one of the least appreciated film actors of his generation. He is very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp. Jamaican thugs are also a sight to behold. I highly recommend this movie.
