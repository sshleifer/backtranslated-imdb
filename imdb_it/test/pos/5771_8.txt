This release of Knotts includes one of his best ever comrades, Frank Welker. Welker makes the film. Knotts and Welker compete for laughter and both receive a lot. Knotts works for a small "no where" town where the city is run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong the city fathers, allow Knotts to make the fall. Frank Welker's character makes friends with Knotts and together they stumble together to clear Knott's chaos and good name. This film shows the usual frightened character of Knott that made him famous for years on television and in cinema. This may have been Knotts' last good exit. When you have 90 more minutes, you make a good old-fashioned laugh with a great icon, Don Knotts.
