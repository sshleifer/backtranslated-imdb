Looking at this on Comcast On-Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this musical, I am stunned by the songs ... one show-stop after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is, for me, magical. The songs shine ... the voice, the orchestrations and the choreography are extraordinary for a movie "made for TV" ... better than many versions of stage I've seen. <br /> <br /> The debate on Bette is just not meaningful She is the mother. His voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother who lives through his daughters. In the end I still have tears when he finally has his moment of glory, no matter how faded that glory. <br /> <br /> The duet / dance of Tulsa / Louise is now available. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of musical theater. His lyrics move like a silk tongue ... Styne's music is perhaps the best ever written for the stage / screen. <br /> <br /> Thank God we have this masterpiece of the American Musical Theater captured on DVD.
