This is a small underrated thriller, which has a thrill: very, with a good story, Sandra Bullock is terrific! All the characters are fantastic and I was surprised at how unpredictable it was because there were only a few predictable moments, and Sandra Bullock is simply fantastic at that! Jeremy Northam has played a terrible criminal, and I know what Bullock's character is in this, because I'm kind of the same kind of person (I almost never go out), plus this one is pretty well done and written for the most part. This should be higher than 5.5 in my opinion, plus Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene in which Northam terrifies Bullock on his boat was quite suspicious, and it was one of my favorite moments, and I also liked the scene of the chase in the carnival, plus I liked the ending too, as it was pretty well In fact, even if I did, I think Northam was defeated too quickly. There are also many other good chase scenes, and it's also clever at times, plus there are also some shocking moments, this is a small underrated thriller, which thrilled a lot, with a good story, Sandra Bullock is great, I highly recommend this !. The direction is great! Irwin Winkler does great! I work here with excellent photographic work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The acting is fantastic! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and she's fantastic here, she's extremely nice, hard as nails but vulnerable enough, and I was able to try for her because, like I said, I'm like Angela, I almost never go out, I really liked her I work in this movie! (Bullock rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is excellent as the villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and very threatening, he was exceptional. Dennis Miller is surprisingly OK and not annoying in his small role, and has managed to bring some comic relief. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall I highly recommend this!. *** 1/2 on 5
