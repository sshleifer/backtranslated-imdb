I can't believe it ... after all these years I finally tracked down this ... it was meant to be called 'The Great Pretender' during production. I lived in Oz at a time and through a friend I took care of one of the places in the house through filming ... I was the one who showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I realize now that one was Russell Crowe! !! It took me all these years to track him down, I wasn't even sure if he ever went on the screen while I was leaving Oz the following month after the closing party. At that time Russell Crowe was not the required actor that it is now and I had no idea it was him until I saw the previous comment and then thought back to the days during the shoot ..... amazing ... Really happy with myself now! !!
