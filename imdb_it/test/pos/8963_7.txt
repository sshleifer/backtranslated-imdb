Summary: based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, a member of the American Congress, who (according to this film) was instrumental in the secret US war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Comments: A rather funny film about things not so funny, especially because they were real. But focusing on the film, Hanks behaves very well as an evil Congressman with a good heart who becomes the champion of the secret war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the entire film, especially Philip Seymor Hoffman, has a rather humorous tone. So much so that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But the story that tells, and perhaps the end, is really serious. <br /> <br /> A story of what happened with some questions about what could have been. So the movie works like a comedy, if you want one, and much more serious if you want it. Something for everyone? 7/10
