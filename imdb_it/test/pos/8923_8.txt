This is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. The characters are well designed, with Phil the greatest loser of all time. <br /> <br /> The character of Adam Haddrick is the most evil thing I've ever seen on the screen since the portrait of Adolf Hitler by Alec Guinness in 'Hitler: The Last Ten days. '<br /> <br /> I just hope they all got rid of it. But without giving too far, there are some situations you can't find.
