I can honestly tell you that this film is the most fantastic film ever !!! If you're in the mood for a comedy, I definitely recommend this movie! So here's the summary. There is this girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and goes on vacation with her father (Andre) who she hasn't seen for about two years. He expects the vacation to be totally boring, until he meets this guy (Ben), who is much older than her. So, to try to impress him, he says he's not on vacation with his father, but with his lover. This is a hysterical film from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it. So rent it and have fun !!!
