I remember ignoring the TV series when he debuted for the first time with his "look" with Jim Hensen's muppets. However, recently a friend allowed me to borrow his Farscape DVDs, and I'm just now realizing what a terrible mistake it was. <br /> <br /> As in any television series, there are episodes that shine and those that don't. I ride the adrenaline and the emotional race during the great episodes and I suffer through the lackluster ones. However, I resist regardless because of the main plot that links all the episodes together. What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their mutual love. Let me warn you, it's something that is absolutely irresistible to watch. I can't remember any other TV series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that has cleverly and intelligently created a race so heartbreaking (at times) and suspenseful. <br /> <br /> I think that by the end of the fourth season, things were finally becoming tightly focused and I'm shocked by the decision to cancel the series. I look forward to the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
