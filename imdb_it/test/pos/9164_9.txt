I would recommend it as the most successful attempt to make a film on the Soviet Afghan war so far. And it is a very honest and responsible image that starts from small details of uniforms and weapons to human relations, war and the landscapes of Central Asia. It was shot in Tajikistan immediately after the troop withdrawal in 1989, not in 1985. The Italian star Mr. Placido was perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters also seemed very natural, especially the always drunk club manager :-) The scenario seems a little jammed in the end, but it could be an impact of the civil war in Tajikistan that started right during the shooting of the film. All movie teams had to flee sometimes even under fire. The last scene is a purely "harakiri" type of behavior and reminded me of the final sentence of a famous samurai movie: "We won all the battles but we lost the war". It could also be a metaphor for the collapse of the USSR - the great country that allows you to shoot yourself behind the little offended child.
