Although amiable and entertaining for the gay public, the film by Frank Oz "In and Out", about a gay teacher locked on TV by a former student, was disinfected and deodorized to attract the biggest and most profitable viewers that he sponsored "The Bird Cage ". Although the public probably pats on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to watch the film, the film revolves around Howard Brackett of Kevin Kline, who is a stereotypical homosexual. The film states that the tendency to dance in the disco, have fun in Barbra Streisand's films and dress well indicates one's sexual orientation. Like "Queer Eye", the film actually takes a straight man's slap and stereotypes them like sloppy, dark and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the center of the film's humor is a somewhat pathetic character. Howard is middle-aged, profoundly isolated or self-sacrificed, and evidently never had a sex life. A three-year commitment for a female teacher in the school where she works is described as a series of sunsets, long conversations and the vision of "Funny Lady". Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intention, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the whole show. Most of the movie's funniest moments belong to her, even though Kline's attempts to resist the dance during a tape of instructions on macho behavior are hilarious. He is a talented artist, but the film only gives him a few moments. Matt Dillon also stands out when the student becomes an actor, and the clip of the Oscar-nominated movie about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the film's gay theme, there is no boy-meets-boy novel, and only a male-to-male kiss, and that smooch is as erotic as that between Michael and Fredo Corleone in "The Godfather II". <br /> <br /> Although well-intentioned, "In and Out" fails to address the injustices and prejudices it illustrates. Howard is fired from his teaching job, despite his outstanding performance and credentials, yet a small outrage occurs. Most of the characters are more angry at the canceled marriage than at Howard's self-realization, which seems to happen overnight, and for his abrupt and unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, fondly portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students stand up to support him. However, the sugary finish is embarrassing for the audience as evidently it was for Howard Brackett in the film. The film would have been more refreshing if it revolved around a homosexual who dressed like a bum, he was a huge fan of football, he drove a station wagon, he listened to country music and he lived on fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, "In and Out" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether they are positive or negative, stereotypes should be delivered to the dustbin of social history.
