Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon-funded film directed by Tobe Hooper. It is a very interesting film that deals with a couple of space vampires that were accidentally reported on Earth during the last space shuttle mission. Steve Railsback is the only survivor of the tragedy. But in reality the film is a simple showcase for the natural beauty of Mathilda May. She is a hot smoking number. The director was a big fan of Female Vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill). Miss May recreates the main role of Lina Romay The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There are a lot of gore effects to keep genre fans happy. <br /> <br /> I have to give this film a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during this period (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars). If you like science fiction / horror movies, Tobe Hooper or Mathilda movies, this movie is ready for you. <br /> <br /> Highest recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Mathilda May is smoking a lot?
