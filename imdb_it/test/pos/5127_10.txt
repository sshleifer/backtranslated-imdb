I saw the movie "Hoot" and immediately decided to comment on it. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant species on this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want, which is probably how, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves, they would do something useful! This film is not just about children, this film shows us that children are usually the ones who care most about adults. When I was twelve, I saw some water lilies and I knew they were protected by the law and I didn't even dare touch them without fearing the law, but fearing that I could really hurt them. (I am currently 15) What happened is that the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie !!! and enjoy it!
