The plot of this game is very jerky where it seems that the authors of the game have tried to find ways to justify the way a character appears in some areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. That being said, this is the only complaint I have about the game. <br /> <br /> The initial FMV is spectacular with breathtaking scenery and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and your own martial arts discipline. There is also a second-plane mode that compensates for the embarrassing Story project by Tale of the Souls. <br /> <br /> Parts of FMV during Tale of the Souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your character a certain degree which is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With the many combinations of Characters you can create, the various paths you can explore in Tales of the Souls and the Chronicle of Swords Story mode, this game will keep all Beatem up / RPG fans are have fun for a while!
