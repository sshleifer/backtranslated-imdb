I thought One Dark Night was great! Worth a 10! As for a statement made by a user, the dead were actually zombies in this film. A dead person brought back to life It is a zombie, regardless of the method or cause of being brought back to life. The "zombies" of this film are used to frighten girls, not to feed on them, like traditional zombies. This film is a well-defined star among the horror films of the 80s. The soundtrack and the atmosphere are quite disturbing, and the audience is kept open-mouthed during the mausoleum scenes. Actually, acting is convincing, with genuine expressions of horror at the sight of the undead. Although I like all the zombie movies, this film is a refreshing change from the typical "carnivorous zombie" movie.
