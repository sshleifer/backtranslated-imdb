Sublime - perfect - profound - a true lesson on the idealized meaning of life. We find ourselves completely involved in the life journeys of Martina and Phillipa and of <br /> <br /> Babette. Their desires, desires and sacrifices resonate long after the film is finished. Seeing it years ago - because it was gaining a lot of notoriety with the audacity of its subjects - half of the film was a single dinner - the audience was "oohing and aaa" while some of the courses took their finale glorious, laughing at the reaction of the guests, as they were totally seduced by the gustatory pleasures that Babette presented to them, and to be totally surprised by the turn of events at the end of the film. After watching the film years after my twists and turns, I realized how deep the film is. In this vision the tears flowed freely. The meditation of the film over the passage of time and the way in which it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life, love, art and generosity is really something to love.
