This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is quite interesting if you know nothing about the way in which anime studies were handled. In addition to episode 3, this was probably the least audacious, but had an interesting interest in the girl, as well as a surprise meeting by others in previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have been only because it was the only original script for the show that was not based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well, leaving us with the good feeling that Kentaro is permanently 25, studying up. Watch the rest of the series to the end, you can buy the entire series for $ 17, you can watch it up to about 2 hours and a half or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes of free time (which I do if I have a lunch school.) good series, take a look.
