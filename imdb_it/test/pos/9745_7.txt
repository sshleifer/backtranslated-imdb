Flash Gordon is, without a doubt, the best of all American serials. On a date of 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertainment story, and twenty years later, when I first saw it as a child, it involved me in a great adventure and emotion. Buster Crabbe was the hero we always wanted to be in our childhood, and Jean Rogers the beautiful girl we always dreamed of being in love with. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. Charles Middleton was a great presence like Ming, the Merciless. A true predecessor of Starwars by George Lucas.
