News broadcast {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although it lacks the emotional punch of Brooks's debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) it is a superlative film, with exceptional performances by each of the three protagonists and a script that seems genuine and well studied as a news bulletin. As far as we know, this is a film of character in the first place and a satire in the second place. In my mind he succeeds on both levels on his terms. The characters of the film have a surprising depth and dimension, while the satire remains clever and never bitter. Network comparisons are not necessary because the films have two completely separate objectives and attitudes. Even though it's a great movie, Network is cynical and tired work; in other words, he is mad with hell and fed up with the state of television. The satire style of the network seems more extreme and guerrilla. On the contrary, the characters that populate the Broadcast News editorial offices love and live for their work (sometimes at the expense of their love lives.) They take pleasure from the stress and satisfaction of the news, just as the audience gets pleasure by watching this sweet masterpiece and romantically realistic.
