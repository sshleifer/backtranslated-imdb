... and normally I don't like surprises !! Watch this movie by chance at a motel in South Africa, the second week of a three-month motorcycle vacation in ZA. Besides being well turned and acted, he helped me to understand the problems of the countries tremendously. I just saw "Million Dollar Baby" and I had to look for Hillary Swank because the name sounded a little familiar and her acting was superb. He did not understand that he was the lawyer for the "Red Dust". Well, now I'm not worried that it will disappear like so many other Clint helpers before ... Now I am asked to write ten lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for writing what I wanted to write. OK, here it is: I think that if you come from a western country, especially from Europe, watching will help you understand a little better why what is happening is happening there! So I hope this will fill ten lines.
