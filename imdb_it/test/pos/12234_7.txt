Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would have been nice to see a real biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly as Herbert has a fair resemblance to him in recent years <br /> <br /> Jones and Martin sing wonderfully. Herbert's music is there to adorn the plot of these two musical artists. Jones's John Ramsay is a fragile character, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in the Showboat who also played Jones. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, it is a mystery why she has never had a good Hollywood career. He has made films with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell in addition to this. She behaved well, but the cinema audience didn't take them. The best musical moment of the film is Jones and Martin in a duet by Thine Alone. The recordings I have of the song are individual and was written as a duet. There is also a pleasant scene with Jones and Martin riding bicycles that exchange Herbert's songs as they ride. <br /> <br /> The real Victor Herbert with his femininity and his Irish patriot background and his musical education in Germany where he developed a love for all German would have been a fascinating study. He was also a cello virtuoso before devoting himself full time to composition. I have to make a strong exception to the reviewer who said that Coccole Sakall would be a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as an Irishman, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Nice film, but the real Vic would have been much better.
