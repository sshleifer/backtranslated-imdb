Oddly, the Independent Film Channel showed this film a week later that showed KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - even though the bear movie was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first !!! What were they thinking ?! Although all three of these films are based on the life of this great Karate Kyokushin master, you can't help but think that they MUST have embellished the story quite a bit - especially in this first film. Of course, the boy evidently fought and killed a bull and later a bear (in fact, he fought and killed many bulls during his career), but in this film set in the early 1950s, at the end of the film, the hero he actually fights around 60 boys and kills many of them brutally. I can't imagine this actually happened. So I did some checking and found that while many details are correct, part of this film is pure bunk! Yes, he killed a man in self-defense and YES followed the widow and his son and spent a year working for them - trying to convince them to forgive him. But the end of the film is fantastic to watch, but it's tough. Seeing one of his adversaries getting his baton stick on his head and all the other gory details could not have happened, otherwise the Japanese government would have blocked Oyama to protect the company! The film is fun and the fight is excellent. There are no complaints about the action or the acting. The only minor complaint is the camera work - which is a bit neglected during some combat scenes. Despite this minor complaint, this is a very funny movie. In many ways, the theme of the Wandering Master of Karate is reminiscent of Zatoichi's films, which are also very fun to watch, but many of the exploits are really impossible. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is an English dubbed version of this film entitled "Champion of Death" and I have just seen it. It's not a bad dubbing and has been literate (a big advantage), but I still prefer the subtitled version.
