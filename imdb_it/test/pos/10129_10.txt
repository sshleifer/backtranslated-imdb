The radio is a true story of a man who did what he felt, in his heart, was the right thing to do. The viewer will be forced to wonder what he would have done. The adversities that both Jones and Radio faced both were tragic and predictable. People didn't understand; nor did they want to understand. But in the end, the power of circumstances forced people to understand and appreciate much more than they did before it happened. The radio is a mentally challenged young woman who understands very little, besides three of the most important things that too often are forgotten as we mature: intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the difficult situation of the loser who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way he knows how. It was sad the way coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that terrorized Radio's life was enough to make you want to punish severely, not just the guys involved, but every guy who knew what was happening and didn't do anything about it. However, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would have affected so many lives in the way many of us believe it only happens in movies. This film is a real fairy tale of life and not to be missed. Ed Harris was his usual genius. Gooding was impeccable. Radio is an inspiration.
