I used this film in my college ethics courses for over 10 years (also "Crimes and misdeeds" by Woody Allen - another terrifying and multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> It's fiction. I don't focus too much on the unrealistic features of "Foreigners" because all fiction films are obviously fake on many levels. I love the film as a playful comedy, told tense, with lots of ironic twists and visual pleasures - even if it's "incredible". The story is told so well that I don't even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part for me - too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition). <br /> <br /> Some problems presented in the film that promise realistic moral education and ethical discussion: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical passivity: some weaknesses of Guy's character are intended by Hitchcock. A primary ethical view of the film is the danger of being unable to articulate one's moral positions. The boy is unable to effectively block Bruno's crazy proposals at the beginning. An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave passively, in an ineffective way? One possible answer is his depression due to his intense and complicated divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Communication error: Guy initially commits another failure: on the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But the literal meaning of Guy is opposed to its curved and sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes on the literal meaning as an agreement for cross-killings. Guy takes on the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder deal. To a certain extent, at the beginning, Bruno could partly pretend that an agreement was reached, to drag Guy into a network of complicity. Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno the chance to put a "strangled" ethics on Guy. Bruno who manipulates Guy can also take on other meanings. . . . <br /> <br /> 3. Secrecy: some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. It seems ridiculous at first, especially since Guy appears obviously heterosexual in his relations with Miriam and Anne. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - recalls 1951) effeminate, especially in relation to Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in conflict (playing "against himself"), at first apparently physically and physically strong, but then shows some "effeminate" traits (Bruno's fashion and work, his emotional enthusiasm for Guy in different situations; Bruno desperately kisses and caresses his mother's hand, other more subtle gay stereotypes that contain a cryptic meaning from Hitchcock's point of view). I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarify its intended meanings here. <br /> <br /> 4. Dishonesty and distrust: Guy makes some colossal mistakes in hiding the truths about Bruno from the family and the police. The boy cannot fully understand that admitting guilt quickly could be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Once again Guy is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear - and perhaps a hatred of himself that is closer to Bruno's self-contempt than we care to see or admit. Both Guy and Bruno recite their parables of impotence. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of evidence: Guy feels a problem gathering evidence to absolve himself. While going quickly to the police would solve a huge problem, Guy gets caught up with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on behalf of Guy; the obsessive need to appear politically unpolluted; and other personality factors that make Guy feel helpless. He is as dysfunctional as Bruno - not as dangerous (yet one can partly accuse Guy's murder for Miriam). <br /> <br /> 6. Illness and mental disorder: an interesting question is how much is Bruno legally responsible for the murders? The most ethically incompetent Bruno is like a sick sociopath, the most guilty boy can be like someone healthy who failed to stand up and act morally to prevent crimes. Guy's failure is like a man who cannot call the police when a sick friend threatens to commit suicide, and death ensues. It could be argued that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally limping accomplice. <br /> <br /> These and many other features of the film make "Strangers on a Train" a gem of a game of morality, a diamond for philosophical and cinematographic reflections.
