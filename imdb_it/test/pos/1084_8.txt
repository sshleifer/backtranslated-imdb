Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard-working policeman, with the edges at the head of a white-robed criminal team that makes a name for itself by killing dangerous criminals in police meetings staged rather than locking them up in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question, but a fracture arises when one of his officers, Imtiaz, is frustrated by Sadhu's high status and is secretly competing with him for criminal killings and status. A new recruit is also pushed into fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the initiative in his first case. Further changes come in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets involved in domestic politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-directed action thriller from India. The work with the camera is excellent, the plot is well told and the tension is high when the drama takes place. The acting, the rhythm and the political subterfuge convince the spectator to be a fly on the wall that witnesses blood, sweat and tears from a close and personal point of view and that the events are based on the reality that is undoubtedly the reason so we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film, although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, took liberties with factual reports. However, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely refined film.
