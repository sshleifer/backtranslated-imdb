I am a funny operista, and the works are full of sex, blood and death. It might be useful to know the booklets of the works whose arias they really want to appreciate this film: my mileage is very different from that of Tug-3. I'm a fan of classical music, and I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment and would love to see him produce Turandot, because the work should be overwhelming, really a multimedia experience, but then I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and knowing the booklet so well could be the reason why I don't find this segment the Tug-3 disguise. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible to average spectator - it's likely they recognize the tunes, and it's a classic bedroom farce. I like farces in the bedroom, so stupidity didn't upset me. <br /> <br /> The "Liebestod" segment is so exceptional that I advise people to look at this one piece. "Depuis la Jour" was, for me, splendidly spiritual. And the recording of Caruso from "Vesti la Giubba" (aka I Pagliacci) with John Hurt as the clown was wonderful. But people who want only naked women can feel that there is too much music and not enough meat and sex.
