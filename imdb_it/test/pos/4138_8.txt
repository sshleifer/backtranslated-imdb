Gary Busey's best performance in a pleasant biography. Since he had a musical background, he was able to make his songs and really work. It's always nice to see the good actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith. <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey was nominated for an Oscar for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A low budget film that does not disappoint, with Mr. Holly's GREAT SONG. I hope this made a lot of pasta. Busey has never been so popular for various reasons, but fortunately he has this great in his resume.
