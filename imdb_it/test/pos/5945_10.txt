It's a profoundly stupid humor ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this film. Bérénice Béjo is cute. Make fun of all the secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! It's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. I've seen it three times already and I still want to see it again. Buy the DVD as soon as possible. You will not regret. It's the kind of movie where you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody. The only flaw is that OSS 117 is too short. It is a jewel. It is not very common to see a French film succeed in the United States, but I think this has everything to be successful. Trust me!!!
