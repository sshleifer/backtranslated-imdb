I really enjoyed watching Hell to Pay. I have been a fan of Westerners for as long as I can remember and this reminded me of many westerners of the 60s (although I was too young to see them at the first release). The only thing that bothered me about the film was constant music. Sometimes distracted. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how many other Gunsmoke fans noticed, was the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a game under the name of Doc Adams of Gunsmoke. Instead of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if it was his choice or that of Chris McIntyre? Anyway, I'd recommend this movie to western fans. Don't expect anything too "deep". Simply old entertainment.
