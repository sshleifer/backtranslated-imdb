This was the Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of this writing) and it must be the best horror anthology out there. I'm usually not a fan of horror movies - largely because of the volume of crap that was recently released. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the suspenseful gift of Hitchcock - unlike other contemporary films, he does not take every opportunity to frighten you foolishly, using instead prefigurations and "near-accidents" - incidents that seem to be the moment when the orgasm will occur in the previous instant, but turns out not to be. <br /> <br /> I didn't get "The Hook" or the first main segment, but from what I've read here, they were the two people you could afford to lose. <br /> <br /> 'People Can Lick Too' was full of suspense - this short keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders around her backyard and the house looking for her soccer ball and then his dog. He meets so many shortcomings up close that the suspense reaches proportions that break the heart before the culmination of the short, when the girl surrenders and goes to bed, thinking that her dog is below. She reaches out to let him lick, and feels the touch of a tongue on her hand ... before realizing that on his mirror, written in blood, there is "People can lick her too". I will leave the last few seconds for you to discover, my reader, because at this point the short may have taken any number of turns. <br /> <br /> 'The Locket', however, was the indisputable masterpiece of this film. Start with a man on a motorcycle, simply driving ... towards what he doesn't know, but he can feel himself approaching. While driving, a storm breaks out, and he is forced to find shelter in a dumb girl's house. The two quickly approach each other, but before they can do anything other than the kiss, the girl reveals through the writing that the ghosts live in her house. They quickly start packing to leave, but they are caught in the middle of a historical re-enactment of a scene that has been going on for decades: a father, who returns home to his daughter and her boyfriend who is preparing to flee, kills both and then suicide. I'll have to let you discover the ending here too - I couldn't hope to do justice to the story anyway, and what I've said so far is just a brief summary of the story - I couldn't hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that add it. <br /> <br /> 'The Campfire', being the common thread between all the stories, is a fairly interesting rehash of the theme of the car accident, and the girls are very attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this movie is good looking. However, despite the fact that it is belittled, the story is done justice, and the ending is hard to predict if you are worried about other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to The Campfire segments broadcast through the film, it is certainly possible to predict the ending, especially if you've seen movies based on the same premise. (MST3k fans, remember Soultaker? Same premise, but without the terrible writing of Vivian Schilling and most of the film. If you saw the first 30 minutes of this you should be able to predict the ending.) All in all, the best horror film I've seen in a long time and the only horror anthology worthy of a purchase.
