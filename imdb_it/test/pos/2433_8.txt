Making this short and to the point. This movie was awesome! I loved it! Actually I took this in Hollywood Video for 3 dollars on VHS and watched about 5 times in the last two weeks. I'm a big fan of Bogart and I limited myself to this movie. I thought the song was fun and now I have a ringtone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is very good and brings out a good Bogart. His nose is a little big, his voice is a Bogart-Columbo mix, and he does some things that are embarrassing but otherwise, it was great and this movie was wonderful. No one can be a perfect Bogart, but it was fantastic. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and he's not going to do everything he did. Mention many other films and do things that are never part of the real Bogart character. But it's so fun and fun and has a fantastic cast, including some beautiful women. Watch it and have fun!
