Meester Sharky, you look so ... normal. You would never have had a table in this luxury cocktail restaurant / bistro. I, on the other 'and eat grape and pate' every day. Do you like my fur coat with all the finishes? My huge golden gold rings? Or maybe you like these blondes, "how do you say?", Bombs, who are all qualified in aerobics and nude petanques, who decorate my long brown and velvety couch like so many boiled larks on a plate of foie gras and pan-fried figs. Do you like? You can't have! Zey are all mine. <br /> <br /> You never own 'er as I owned' er. Domino was the best, apart from Maman. You don't understand the art of making love. Look at your lower mustache. It is almost strange to me not to think of that ridiculous bump on your silly face, while sniffing around Domino's love hill like the pig looking for truffles in the forest, the forest that sways and sways in the hot winds of desire! Lose Sharky again. <br /> <br /> I know when I make love with women, Sharky, you know. Zey learns, learns until zey becomes the teacher. Not nano-mathematics, the arts of love. Domino was the plant I watered. I watered it so often. Everywhere Sharky. Its fragrant petals, its proud stem, everywhere. She will wither under your ridiculous hose, like the souffl√© removed from the oven five minutes too soon. <br /> <br /> I have to go now Sharky, I'm bored with your shameful behavior. You are the one who will be red as the stinker. <br /> <br /> Bon chance!
