If you like his show you might be a little disappointed. This film has some very funny moments and the laughter is pretty constant, but none is as memorable or fun as the show on the show. The start sequence is really stupid and fun, and a great start. Yup! Borat makes a cameo. <br /> <br /> if you are a fan then watch it! if you don't know it or you don't like it, then don't worry. 6.5 / 10
