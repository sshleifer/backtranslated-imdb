This film about a group of teenagers who decide to rob the local bank is excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to get out of his small town, just like Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life". However, unlike George Bailey, Brian robs a bank to finance his dream of attending art school, even though his father is not supportive. The offer to Brian is to act like a customer and distract the guard. It is a tempting offer that, if offered to many, I wonder what they would do. Anyway, Brian does it. When the sheriff (James Remar) and his strength surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. It is also a deadlock with the feds moving to kill children if they have a clean shot. The sheriff must stop it and try to end the stalemate peacefully. Unfortunately, the tensions increase and the teenagers turn on each other. Some are out of control. The paper cutter scene is macabre and difficult to watch. Very intense!
