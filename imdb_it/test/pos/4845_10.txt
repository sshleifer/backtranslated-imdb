Without a doubt, the film is a powerful medium, much more than ever, thanks to the accessibility of DVDs / videos, which gives the director the assurance that his story or message will be seen by millions of people. The use of this medium, therefore, gives the artist an innate responsibility, since the film can be educational, as well as entertaining, which states that some subjects must be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensitivity. A film like "Schindler's List" by Spielberg, for example, is important, as it keeps alive the memory of what must not be forgotten, and since history tends to repeat itself, Spielberg's film can be seen as a precious tool for prevent a recurrence of that tragedy. In this same perspective, this film, "Focus", directed by Neal Slavin, is important, as it illuminates the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which for years beyond the number has affected millions of people, is still unimaginably prevalent today, and like any manifestation of bigotry, it will perpetuate itself if not controlled or ignored. Born from a xenophobic strain, it is a disease that infects society that, without pause, could be terminal; and with its insights penetrating into the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that could at least help contain its proliferation, and hopefully can act as a step towards totally eradicating. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in the Great War, and has since lived a quiet and conventional life in New York. He has had the same job as personnel manager for about twenty years and owns the house, located in a middle class, middle class neighborhood, where he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is the kind of guy who manages to get along well by taking his business into consideration and refusing to engage in issues that are not (he feels) his concern. <br /> <br /> This is about to change, but as with the advent of World War II, Lawrence, along with the owner of the corner market, Finkelstein (David Paymer), is inexplicably found a target of the xenophobes of the neighborhood, which have aligned with the "crusaders of the Union", a national organization currently used to channel their fears and hatred against Jews, or anyone who even "seems" to be a Jew. And suddenly Lawrence discovers that he can no longer stand back and watch the game being played; because now it's the game, whether he wants it or not. <br /> <br /> Working from an intelligent and well-written script by Kendrew Lascelles, adapted from the Arthur Miller novel, Slavin presents a chilling scenario that incisively examines the effects of bigotry on those against whom it is leveled; and when we consider the fact that this is not just a hypothetical situation, but a representation of reality, it becomes even more disturbing, even disturbing. And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's obvious understanding of his subject, and his studied presentation, which is stimulating in its subtlety. In the opening scene, Slavin establishes Lawrence's "character", and very soon reaffirms him in another scene, which offers the public the opportunity to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's mind really works; the mental processes that direct his life. With this, Slavin is able to bring his audience along with Lawrence as his problems gradually begin to develop. In doing so, it effectively illustrates how the problem evolves, rather than merely stating the problem and facing it head-on, which increases the emotional involvement of viewers and ultimately improves the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> Slavin makes an important statement with this film, which is not only an accusation of bigotry, but also carries a warning message about apathy. And to his credit, he never hits you over the head or commits himself in a subjective point to create his case; instead, proceed with caution, making great efforts to be as objective as possible with all that you are submitting for your consideration. His approach is that of a film diplomat; and it is an approach that serves Slavin - and his film - quite well. <br /> <br /> As Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best leading players in the business - offers an extraordinary performance, establishing the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective representation. He never tries to circumvent the personal defects of Lawrence's nature, but instead uses them to create a decidedly three-dimensional character, which not only makes it convincing, but serves to reaffirm the integrity of the representation. What makes it so compelling is Macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his conscience, which allows the viewer to successfully share the experience of his personal epiphany. Ultimately, it is the strength of Macy's performance, more than anything else, that makes this film so significantly distinct. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the performance by Laura Dern, like Gertrude Hart, a performance that effectively integrates Macy's and Slavin's work. Dern gives an extraordinary substance to his character, capturing it both physically and emotionally, and his colorful zeal chests are in stark contrast to Lawrence's reserve which works very well, both for his character and for the film itself. <br /> <br /> And just as Sean Combs recently (in "Monster's Ball") made a good case against the direct dismissal of the acting duties of an established 'rock star', Meat Loaf Aday offers a powerful performance here , like Fred, Lawrence is the next-neighbor. It also shows that a true artist will produce, regardless of the type of canvas he has worked with. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs. Dewitt). The type of film that makes a filmmaker of his art proud, "Focus", offers a memorable experience that hopefully will prove enlightening even to those who are not aware of the fact that these conditions existed, and still do so, even in this, the land of freedom. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
