Maybe this movie is a little too long, but it still has a certain charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I don't care about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, especially with dark hair. The film deserves to be seen for the supporting cast: Flora Robson is formidable as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman with a black face, and can have an expression of evil or a voodoo lover. Jerry Austin in the role of a dwarf servant has a delightful role, which makes you giggle despite some scenes too long. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of those who are social partners. At the end of the film, I didn't understand the outcome of the railway fight, and the last scene was pure Hollywood catastrophe. It's strange when you realize that the film's title refers to a railroad rather than a bag!
