Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY has been invisible to the public for almost twenty or thirty years until the end of the 90s, when it re-emerged and also appeared on television. Meanwhile he had gained notoriety because the CITIZEN KANE BOOK by Pauline Kael had suggested that the script by Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles for KANE was based on Sturgis' script here. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb site, Kael overestimated his case. <br /> <br /> There are about six narrators alternating with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (which represents Ralston - Henry Luce's clone), the memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the butler. Everyone has his different inclination on Kane, which reflects their faith or disappointment or hatred for man. And of course everyone also reveals their mistakes when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping repetitions of the same incident. <br /> <br /> This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, as KANE is a legendary business leader - here is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who came up from below to become the head of the most successful rail system in the country. But there are only two narrators: they are Garner Henry's right hand man (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This limits the almost three-dimensional view we get in Kane's moments in Garner. Henry, when he talks, talks about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical audience - he sees only Henry's faults. <br /> <br /> Typical example: although he has started to make his way, Tom becomes more and more anti-worker in his last years. The unions are agitators, and they don't mind being slowed down by their cheating. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a great apparition, and how he worried him at the expense of his family life. But Henry's wife reminds him of how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the headquarters of the Union - killing many people). So we have two points of view on man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. <br /> <br /> I'm not really beating THE POWER AND THE GLORY to avoid duplicating the success of KANE (some movies do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I'm aware that the story is pretty well presented to keep their interest until the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the couple's worldly success is completely taken home. <br /> <br /> When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and family the benefits they never had. But in America the success of big business has a cost. Tom is deeply involved in the management of the railway empire (expanding it and constantly improving it). But he takes it away from home too, and loses contact with Sally. She also notes Eve (Helen Vinson), the youngest woman who becomes her lover. When Sally learns of her unfaithful behavior, she destroys it. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Tom also suffers a shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eva marries Tom and introduces him with a son - but he turns out to be Eve's son from Tom Jr.'s son Tom (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding leads Tom to shoot himself. <br /> <br /> The film is not a total success - the action sometimes jumps unconvincingly. Yet it seems that business seems real (note the scene where Tom tells his board of directors about his plans to buy a small line of rival trains, and discusses the use of bonds to finance the plans). Sturgis came from a rich history, so he could bring this kind of detail. So overall it's a first-rate film. No KANE CITIZEN perhaps, but of interest to film lovers as an attempt at corporate realism with social commentary in Depression America.
