Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-born animator who lived in France and did incredible things using stop-motion. I have already seen a couple of these films and present his favorite subjects: insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and realistic and even today they are incredible to look at - the quality is simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> This has a lot of stars and lots of frogs. They call upon their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Because they need a king, Jupiter wonders - their lives are perfectly fine now. So, to teach them a bad lesson, he makes the king an ego and one by one he begins to eat his subjects! Then, the frogs turn to Jupiter once again, which states the obvious moral that it is better to be happy with what you have! <br /> <br /> While the quality of the animation is incredible, this is a very disturbing film for children. I would think that this would terrify them both for the real appearance of animals and for the story itself which is not for the faint of heart!
