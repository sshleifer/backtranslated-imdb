I've loved this film since I saw it in the theater in 1991. I was 12 and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and my teenage crush. Now I'm 23 and I still love this movie. The best part of it is that everyone I meet also likes it because it's a macho movie! He is beaten with enough action and chaos to keep men with the shortest attention bands glued to the screen. I just wish it was available on DVD!
