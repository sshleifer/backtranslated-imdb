I just saw this short at the PlanetOut movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad film about two brothers in love. There is a great and subtle acting by both male protagonists. Often films with this subject seem to be too caught up in the controversy and the shock value of the plot that they forget that a true story exists. Fortunately, screenwriter director James Burkhammer does not, and instead lets the story unfold with honesty. The sequences of the two boys who first fall in love are very sweet.
