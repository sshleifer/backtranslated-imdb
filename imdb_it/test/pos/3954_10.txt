When I saw this film at a festival years ago, I was very impressed and started looking for it. Nothing to do, not in theaters, nor on DVD or Blue ray. Absolutely nothing !!! How can this really happen ??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the plot is intriguing and was filmed in a very original way, the music is perfect and James Franco is so hot !!! <br /> <br /> Please release this masterpiece and allow it to have the right life !!!!!!!!!! This is really a fantastic movie that people should see and deserve another chance !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edvard
