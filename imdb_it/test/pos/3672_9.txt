My partner and I had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot by choosing the title from a list of movies on cable without knowing a single thing about it. When he opened and revealed the cast, we thought, well, how bad can it be? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolded, we felt more and more tickled by our selection, and the film soon made us laugh out loud. This is not a "big" movie, but it is one of those rare films that has such a great combination of memorable characters taken through surreal events "the truth is stranger than fiction" that I couldn't help but love it. I had no trouble "suspending my skepticism" in some of the elements of the most bizarre plot, because the directors' intentions are so cordial while they still manage to entertain everyone involved. As others have said on IMDb, this is a comforting film and I too wouldn't be surprised if it became a cult classic.
