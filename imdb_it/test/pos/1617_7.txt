In defense of this film I have to repeat what I said earlier. The film is called Arachina, it has an unnamed cast and I don't mean any name like the actors who act in little-seen art films. I mean, no name like in your local high school has decided to make a movie with no name and could have a budget of 2 dollars. So what do you expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I heard that the film never took itself seriously, which automatically takes it out of the worst list of films. That list is only for great movies to cast all the stars that you take too seriously. The film brings to mind the Oscar, most of Sylvester Stallone's films. The two protagonists were not Hepburn or Tracy, but they did their job quite well for this film. The woman kicked her ass and the boy was not a crazy idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played a professor of anal retention was not Clifton Webb, but he did a divine job. And the Bimbo for lack of a better were interpreted by two competent actors. I laughed at 50-cent special effects. But that was part of the film's appeal. He played as a hybrid Tremors meets Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the film is like all the Giant Bug movies of the 1950s. A meteor or radiation raises the ecosystem and before you know it we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards that terrorize the locals. This time a meteor was the cause of the problems. I was very amused. I did not expect much and I go much longer than I served.
