This is one of Peter Sellers' best films. Why is it never shown on TV or in theaters? Will it ever be released as a home movie? Is it too derogatory for the medical field? I'd like to see this movie again. I wish my son, who is a doctor, sees it. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this.
