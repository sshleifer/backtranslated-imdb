I can differ from many people on this forum, but I like watching Mind Of Mencia. The reason I like Mind Of Mencia is that the guest is not afraid to speak his mind or exploit stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends but he is not willing to admit and then some. <br /> <br /> Mencia has no problem making jokes about any race, religion, sex or orientation. While getting a lot of flack for it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia doesn't care if he offends someone but he's not a racist and jokes about his own race. <br /> <br /> The typical format for the Mind of Mencia is this: there will be an open script about a person's fun or a recent event. Mencia then goes out and does a 5 or 6 minute walk where he talks about various problems. The show therefore has 2 separate sketches divided by commercials. In these skits, Mencia does a variety of things such as making fun of people, giving his personal opinions with a fun twist, or simply parodying people, events or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia comes out for a minute with a single skit or something else to say. <br /> <br /> People criticize Mencia for exploiting stereotypes and have claimed that his claims are overly offensive. Carlos only does what others think about certain races but is afraid to say. As much as Mencia is offensive, he's just talking in his mind. I find nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The show is not perfect. The scenes cannot be put together at their best and, at times, Mencia does not take his lines into consideration. For the most part, however, it is a show in which the comedian says what is in his mind, no matter what the consequences are and present himself in a humorous matter. So, if you are not afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone talking in your mind and often say what you wanted to say, then look at Mind Of Mencia. However, if you feel offended, you should not watch this show because you will feel offended or, worse, you might even laugh.
