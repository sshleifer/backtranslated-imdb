I think this movie is different apart from most of the movies I've seen. It was exciting in a sense, and regardless of what others say, I say, I was surprised by the final solution. I certainly didn't see it coming !! Even if it's sad, it's worth watching. I can't think of any movie that would be like this! The actors knew what they were doing. If you say this movie sucks, you probably say what most people would say. But if someone says that this movie is normal, I definitely don't agree. And Norman Reedus should be more noticed. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm weird but I loved it. It was a kind of disaster, but who cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
