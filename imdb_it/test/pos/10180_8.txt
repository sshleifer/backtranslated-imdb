When you look at the animated Superman shorts of the 1940s, the similarity of the textures can become a bit boring - the opponent is often a mad scientist in a hidden venue, threatening Metropolis with some evil invention - death rays, mechanical monsters , electric earthquake, magnetic telescope, what have you. <br /> <br /> This is pleasantly different. The bad guys go around in the car, shoot and bomb, but the center of action is the golden train (on which Lois Lane, as the only reporter in the press, seems to be traveling). The train movies have their typical ingredients, since 1903 Great Train Robbery on, and some of them are present here: uncouple the moving cars, run on the roofs, take the steam locomotive from the tender in the back, fight with the engineer, a switch turned to divert the train on a side track, the fall (of people or the whole train) from a high bridge ... it's all in the few minutes of this beautiful piece. <br /> <br /> But it wouldn't be a Superman movie if it didn't do some incredible feats (involving high-precision balancing and positioning) to finally win the day. If you are a fan of train movies, don't miss it. It is in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive.org.
