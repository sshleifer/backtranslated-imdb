Sometimes it is difficult to define what separates a successful and delightful comedy from the one that collapses. In this case, the forced plot of a rich and spoiled girl who proposes to take away her grandchildren from the "bohemian" of Greenwich Village who is raising them, just to fall in love with herself, is not promising. And nothing in the filmography of director Leigh Jason suggests that he was a great neglected talent. Yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed and happy atmosphere on the set that has been faithfully recorded in the film. <br /> <br /> He also had the good sense to correctly interpret this film. The only small flaw is Miriam Hopkins in a part for which Ginger Rogers would have been perfect. Hopkins is efficient but fragile, lacking the warmth and sensuality that Rogers would have had. It is further hampered by a pair of bizarre long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very beautiful Ray Milland could not be better in an exuberant and uninhibited comic exhibition of great charm. <br /> <br /> And best of all, particularly for New York City residents, is the Hollywood representation of Greenwich Village in 1937. Although completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary observer. Art director Van Nest Polglase has created a lovely mix of ramshackle stables and shared courtyards, which is the perfect backdrop for the collection of artists, irascible artists, smart-alecs and aspirants. The best in the supporting cast is Guinn Williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as boxer-sculptor-dressmaker, suggesting the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and otherwise) of life in the Village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby who play the girls. Simple, intelligent and full of humor, these girls look like real human beings and don't look like the professional child actors of the time. Of particular interest are a couple of memorable comedy scripts: Ray Milland the demonstration of vacuuming a woman with a howling child is played more spontaneously than expected (the child and his contortions are wonderful "found" moments) and a fake domestic "game" in a window of a department store that degenerates into an -all is also fun. The film slowly slips downhill with a direct custody process and then never returns to the track when the action moves to Long Island, but this film still deserves a visit.
