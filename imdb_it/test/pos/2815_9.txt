I miss the vision of the cable and I no longer have "DirecTV". So, being a rural resident, I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blondes, obviously I don't just have "Barb Wire", but I have "Stripperella: The Complete First Season". I haven't found "VIP" or a second season for Stripperella yet. I have the "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding" DVD. I have the problems of "Playboy" in which Pamela Denise Anderson posed. I could go on. I love Pamela! There is no one or anything that can make me feel guilty for having enjoyed Stripperella. But there are some elements that I don't like, but with which I live, for other series I also paint smoking and alcohol consumption, sometimes. But those are my personal limits and I try not to let them spoil the fun of a series like this for me. I was also surprised by the change in the style of animation, but I adapted. However, the amount of female nudity has diminished, and this is a great disappointment as much is expected of a series with a premise like this. But then again I adapted. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So obviously one of my favorite "Striperella" episodes is when Pamela and Tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin! If there really is a "Season 2", I hope to find it, because to complete, I need to complete my collection. I recommend it to other admirers of the female form and to blonde lovers. (Hey! Psst! "Blonde" and "blondes" are the feminine form for "blond" spelling! Your software should already know!)
