It's a damn good movie, with some amazing curves, a good cast and a fantastic script. Just a couple of stupid pieces, like the scene of the Rasta maniac (Is this guy a professional?) But that has already been commented. The fact that he had heard only one guy at work mentioning him before, and he didn't have many opinions or reviews to go on, made it even more fun. This gets a higher score than maybe someone thinks you deserve, but I have to take into account the low budget and the good work of the cast. It makes me nauseated that some films are made whose budget is equal to the GDP of a small country, with an exasperated publication, good reviews, an Oscar winning director and / or actors, and turn out to be so disappointing, with actors that sleepwalking through their roles and an uninspired direction, with predictable story lines and a story with such large holes, Sandra Bullock could drive a bus loaded with bombs through it. (Examples in my opinion are The Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department by choosing fantastic clothes for the cast, in particular Paulina Porizcova, who wears a rubber dress in a scene, and a jacket with " c * "on the back in large letters in another! A sex scene that shows her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses! And PLEASE, enough with Tarantino's comparisons, this did not remind me of a Tarantino coup ... and Tarantino borrows practically every idea he has ever had from other films! Even if this is your opinion, we are saying that once a particular film or book has been written or directed in a way, no one will ever be able to use the same ideas again? back down to earth. This film has its own style.
