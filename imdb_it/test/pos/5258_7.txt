I freely admit that I didn't see the original film, but I read the text, so I have some background with "the original". If you eliminate the fact that it is a remake of an old classic, this film is smart, witty, fresh and fun. Yes, casting decisions may seem strange, but they work. <br /> <br /> I am a convinced feminist, and I was not offended at all by this film - despite what other women might say. This is NOT a movie to watch for men (so please, sir, do not drag your boys to see it with you, it is simply cruel); women will get jokes, situations and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth that Annette Bening brought to her character ... she did an excellent job. Debra Messing was adorable and Candice Bergen was fantastic. I was less impressed by Meg Ryan ... he brought emotion to the table, but his way of playing the comic was less strong. The all-female cast is strong, and definitely a sort of loud laugh. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm going to go see it again with my mother. Women will understand.
