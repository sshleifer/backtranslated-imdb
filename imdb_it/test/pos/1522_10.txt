I took this movie late one night and I never knew what struck me. This was one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, yet it made me stand on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. Alan Rickman is an excellent "bad boy", but this character beats everyone else. I've never been so impressed by a movie! It's been 6 years and I can't forget "Closet Land" yet.
