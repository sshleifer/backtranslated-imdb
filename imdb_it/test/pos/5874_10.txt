What can we say about a film by Wilder if not what are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them, infects them, persecutes them. Billy created images like paintings that are forever reflecting the human condition. He paints good and evil in all of us. He also paints with love. I can't imagine anyone having a list of the best movies without a Wilder movie. They will last because they are real. I first saw this film on TV in the 1960s when I was a kid and had to leave the room because I felt tears growing in me and I was embarrassed. Now I'm old and I still feel the tears coming down but I'm not leaving the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew around them. Billy preserved them in this film and not in a "great generation", but in a very realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.
