All in all, an excellent film of that time and source (from Warner Brothers as it was reaching a peak of craftsmanship and style just before the Second World War), provided you don't take it seriously at all. The film has no claim to be historically accurate, and it is certainly neither more nor less accurate or credible than that of JFK. (This could actually be more honest in this regard, since it essentially admits that it should not be regarded as particularly based on facts, but rather as a semi-heroic portrait.) It is worth noting that the public of the time was no longer naive in history than we are today; the NY Times magazine admitted that the public would "liquidate real inaccuracies scattered throughout the film", described the biographical account of Custer's life as "imaginative" and pointed out that the presentation of Custer's reasons for the final events was in disagreement with various historical reports. They could be really exaggerated in building Custer, it is assumed, but they admirably manage to portray him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent, but adequately determined, inspired and inspired boy. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, making their eighth film together in 7 years (and the last), are so comfortable together, and they play each other so easily at this point, that it's not too hard to ignore how subtle their courtship is. With a first pair, it would be hard to imagine what might really attract Elizabeth to Custer, but these two make it work. The film also lacks their director from the previous seven films together (the underrated Michael Curtiz), but since he had worked with them on the Santa Fe Trail theme of the previous year, it is understandable that he chooses to give up this one. (They all left together with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both fantastic - so we can't really blame them if they started to struggle to keep everything fresh.) <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh, the director here , is certainly more at ease with action sequences - which are exceptional - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a bit more irregular, but the artisans of the studio manage to compensate very well, as well as the exceptional cast of "usual suspects" and new faces of Warner Bros (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.) . I would have liked it better if the character of Kennedy had been a little less standard (I generally like his work), but here it seems that he is hitting more or less the same notes in every scene; the part could have been written better - and I suppose they could have been unsure as to what he could handle, since he had only been in the movies for a year (Walsh probably took it for this after doing Alta Sierra together). <br /> <br /> The various salient points include the representation (probably imagined) of the genesis of "Garryowen" as a theme of cavalry. The last half hour is particularly exceptional, especially with the lead separation that echoes the end of their partnership with the screen, followed by the final battle scenes. An exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
