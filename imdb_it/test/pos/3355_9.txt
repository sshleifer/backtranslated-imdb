I saw this beautiful film that has just left college. While sitting there happily watching Alice pass from a repressed virgin to a sexual adventurer, I wondered why her sexual encounters were familiar to me. Then I remembered: Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lessons concerned the psycho-sexual phases of development, in practice the shift in time over which part of the body and its related stimuli receives our main attention, as well as the change of emphasis on what gives us pleasure. The first meeting of Alice is bathed, with emphasis on genitals and on the bottom. His next meeting is the oral one with the dingaling of the Mad Hatter. I forget the rest of the lesson and the order of Alice's meetings, but I remember well how they corresponded. It's interesting to see a leather movie with a little brain behind it, rather than the clich√© "I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's have a fuck." <br /> <br /> I don't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be ruined by this film, as was her first film. And Reagan's boring hypocrisies still had to ruin this land when it was released, but in a way that he and his henchman Meese had influenced Mrs. DeBell. When Meese staged his anti-pornography commission (to distract people from his criminal activities), Meese hired the services of an anti-pornographic activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with images he perceived as child pornography. He saw the cover of "Alice" which Ms. DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced that she had scientifically demonstrated that Ms DeBell was indeed a photographic collage of parts of several grown women and the face of a ten-year-old . Yeah, for sure....
