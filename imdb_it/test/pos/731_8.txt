As the late patron of drive-in thearers (70s-80s), there are many films I have seen and forgotten. This is one I could never forget. Despite its low budget and the film's style of exploitation, HISTORY was very well done. The isolated therapeutic kindergarten, where patients manifest their fantasies to cure their ficosis, the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene, the (alleged) assistant doctor who takes over, the various crazy people the revelation that the medical assistant is actually a patient herself, and, finally, the rescue of the young nurse from the simple Sam, who killed everyone else in the house so that he could escape unscathed, made for a great HISTORY, which he held the film together. I emphasized the word HISTORY because it is what makes a film good or great. No matter how much blood, blood, nudity, sexual problems or outrageous behavior put into a movie, if the STORY is not good, then the film is not good. The movie credits show the clips of all the actors, including the old witch with the last line telling you to go out and never come back, which is a fantastic ending for this movie. If it's on video / DVD, watch it and have fun.
