"Bad dreams always come back as unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives on a vast country estate in the middle of Victoria. "And last night I found myself in Limmeridge Cemetery: normally the people who died remain dead, just as normally the criminals are locked up rather than the victims, but then there was nothing normal about what happened to us. . "And we're out on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deceit and evil, based on the great Victorian novel by Wilkie Collins. It is a good idea to pay close attention, because there are plots within the plots, yet they all focus on a clever and ruthless scheme that involves, what else, money, a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are dedicated to each other. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion has no money alone; Laura will inherit wealth when she is of age. Marion has no prospects of marriage that we know of; Laura was promised some time ago to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), an aristocrat of all too fascinating. They are the guards of their uncle, a fussy, condescending, immensely self-centered hypocondriac (Ian Richardson). Everything seems quite normal, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is busy teaching them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he arrives at the local train station at night, there is no carriage, so he moves towards the estate. In the dark woods he meets a strange woman, dressed all in white, who turns and talks about things he doesn't understand, which then disappears. Are we uncomfortable? Yes, and so is he and the sisters when they realize that the strange woman looks a lot like Laura. Later, does love emerge between Walter and Laura? Blooms a bud? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter far and results in Laura by marrying Sir Percival? Can a cancer nibble? And the secrets are born slowly on the relationships between Laura, Marian and the woman in white ... we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions ... we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival's intimate friend, Conte Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and finally do we realize the dark depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, of which humanity is capable? We visit the Victorian asylums, see falls from the high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch the revenge arrive in the roaring flames of a closed church? <br /> <br /> Well, of course, and it's a great trip for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program features fine acting and exceptional production values. Adapting the novel of over 500 pages of Collins into a television program of less than 120 minutes means that it was necessary to cut or shorten a good deal and that some changes were more likely to have a greater impact in the limited time available. And yet, according to his terms, the production of The Woman in White works in my opinion very well as a moody, romantic and dark television story. Tara Fitzgerald plays Marion as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby in the role of Sir Percival runs the clever feat of making us slowly see the slime depraved under the skin, which still has charm among evil. Ian Richardson as the uncle of young women almost steals the show. It gives a performance so overbearing and pungent that it almost unbalances the story whenever it appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parties is Simon Callow as Conte Fosco. The Count is simply a monster, but extremely fascinating and civilized. Collins described it as of immense circumference. Callow does a good job, but I lack a bit of the monstrosity of evil. <br /> <br /> At one point, Marian tells us: "My sister and I are so fond of gothic novels, sometimes we act as if we were in them." He didn't know what was in store for her and Laura.
