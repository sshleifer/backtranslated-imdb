Here is one of Jane Austen's films that I found very enjoyable. I read the book before listening to it on CD and was fascinated by how a young Victorian could be persuaded to marry the man she loved because of her lack of luck or education. The joy of knowing that Anna is evidently united with a lost love. The fact that his godmother tried to marry her with a cousin who has nothing to do with money. Observing the snobbishness that comes from the upper classes and how class distinctions can divide couples from following their hearts. Captain Wentworth realizes he still loves Anne after seven years. His final understanding that Anne's love was constant for all that time and that he would not allow his family to interfere with his true happiness and his eventual marriage to someone he truly loved.
