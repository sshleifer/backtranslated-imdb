A big known budget flop when released. This Robert Altman-inspired comedy has some formidable moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Even if it goes on long and completely loses concentration, there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious spectator looking up to the end. If you are a fan of actors, actors and actresses, this will be a surprise for you; in this film you will recognize so many extraordinarily little-known actors (you may not know their name, but you know their faces), heck even the child of A Christmas Story comes in a small part. Rent from Netflix, if you read this, I bet you'll like it.
