Nice film. At first, I thought it was a mediocre hi-fi genre, but the ending totally surprised me. I guess the whole movie covers too many topics, each of which can be the main topic, eg. revenge, friendship and dream. But he mixed everyone without focusing on any of them. I think it would be a great movie if it's built around the end from the beginning. <br /> <br />
