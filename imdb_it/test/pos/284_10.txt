With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses, this was in my opinion the most beautiful series by David Jason. <br /> <br /> Arrived immediately after his TV debut on "Do not Adjust Your Set!", these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic times not seen since the days of old silent films. In comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and that horrible series 'Lucky Man' didn't come close. <br /> <br /> I think Jason banned the repeating series because it showed it in its crudest place. Shame on him A new generation deserves to enjoy this. The series actually flopped on the charts, but this is more likely because it was shown against "The Brothers" broadcast by the BBC at the same time, before the VCRs were on the agenda. <br /> <br /> BTW, I just noticed that his long-suffering assistant, Spencer, was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley off Coronation Street. I'm amazed he didn't try to kill Edgar Briggs !!!!
