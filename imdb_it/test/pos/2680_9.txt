"THE KING OF QUEENS", in my opinion, is a pure success of CBS! Although I have never seen every episode, I still like it a lot. For this reason, it is difficult for me to tell which episode is my favorite. Even so, I have to say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before concluding, I would like to say that everyone always gives good performances, the design of the production is spectacular, the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this show remains in syndication after it has been released by CBS, I strongly advise you to take it if it goes on air forever.
