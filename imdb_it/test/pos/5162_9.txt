"With all the misery of the world, how can we not get drunk?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A beautiful aerial view of a big city becomes threatening as a fleet of air bombers approaches; an irritated hairdresser who reacts to an alleged racial insult cuts a path through the thick hair of a businessman; a man dreams of being dragged into an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of his elementary school class because her husband called her a witch. These and about fifty other cartoons ranging from the simple depressing to the wild and humorous to the popular edifying by Roy Andersson, You, the Living, his first feature film after his critically acclaimed success, Songs From the Second Floor. <br /> <br /> You, the Living is full of the same kind of fanciful screenplays as Songs, full of black humor, surreal situations and strange-looking characters. Although a little too long and less concentrated than his previous works, what remains constant is Andersson's unmistakable style with his fixed camera, sterile-looking backgrounds and attention to detail. If there is a theme that ties the sketches together, it's that our time on Earth is limited and "tomorrow is another day", so let's treat each other kindly. "Along the way, we are entertained by the tuba music and drums of the Louisiana Brass Band, guest dinners in a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing an exciting song, and a house that turns into a moving train. <br /> <br /> Emotions range from the darkness of a daughter who tries to communicate with an Alzheimer's patient to the ecstatic dream of a young woman to marry a handsome guitarist named Micke with the applause of a crowd of spectators, while not "it is a continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches. It presents two burly individuals and their little dog sitting on a park bench, the woman complains that no one understands her or loves her, yet cheerfully ignores the comforting and reassuring words of man. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong mixture of irony: during what appears to be an executive lunch, one man tells another on the phone that the workers do not they appreciate quality and how beautiful it is to appreciate the money and things that can buy like good wine. However, when not looking, a man in an adjacent table quietly lifts his wallet from his jacket to the back of the chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very well hidden, You the Living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. It is a warning story that looks at the disaster in which we humans have gone but suggests that there is still time to turn it around, if we pay attention to the warning by the poet Goethe who opens the film, "Be satisfied then, you the living, in the your deliciously heated bed, before Lethe's ice wave licks your fleeing foot.
