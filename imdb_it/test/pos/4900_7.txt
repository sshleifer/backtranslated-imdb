A close-knit musical family, an irritable father and four lively teenage daughters, he is fascinated, first of all, by the appearance of Felix, a captivating young composer, and, secondarily and more profoundly, Mickey, his insolent and attractive orchestration friend. <br /> <br /> It takes some time for Michael Curtiz to float this piece of Americana. The first part seems almost a paraphrase of a cereal advertisement, not devoid of a certain characteristic charm, very bourgeois, and then John Garfield enters the scene as the condemned Mickey Mouse, making his first appearance in film, with confused black curls, Eyes sleepy and bewildered, rude and unkempt, the absolute opposite to that of Jeffrey Lynn, the charming, persuasive and madly fascinating Felix. Garfield is in complete, and EXISTS absolutely necessary, counterpoint to the rest of the family ("Nothing I would do would surprise me," he reflects), and suddenly the film becomes interesting, although I agree with the critics who find the insufficiently motivated. <br /> <br /> The four sisters are rather mildly played and seriously autographed, but Claude Rains as the pater familias has his moments. <br /> <br /> Watch it for Garfield, though, he's the only one really lasting thing about it.
