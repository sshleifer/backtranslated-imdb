I can never understand why people take the time to review films they haven't fully understood. I know people will read fierce reviews on these pages of this film, and will prevent them from looking for copies of this fairly forgotten 1920s-style movie from 1932, which should probably be called "Indecent", since this is the name on main titles. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, better known as a comic actress in innumerable kind roles, is uncomfortable in all of them. She was a real dramatic actress, something I didn't know before watching this movie, which precedes all of her famous roles. It is exciting and moving here, two things that have never been before the graceful and refined William Powell. I'm still pretty upset about his skill. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first three-strip Technicolor feature, is more familiar but is much more artistic and an adaptation. It is also very touching as an expression of a cinematographic style that was about to die. You can't believe me on the word, you have to see it.
