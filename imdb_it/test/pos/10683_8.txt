Fans of Gerry Anderson productions will recognize different UFO actors and vehicles (which was made after Doppelg채nger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. The excellent music of Barry Gray (mostly unique in this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think any Gerry Anderson fan would find doppelg채nger worthy of being caught. <br /> <br /> Judged simply as a film, it must be said that Doppelg채nger is defective. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suspect this is why there is a long plot that ends abruptly and that seems to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably time / budget constraints have prevented relevance from emerging! <br /> <br /> In a detached way, the special effects range from the exceptionally good - better than any other film of the 60s that I know of - aludibly negative. <br /> <br /> However, even with these flaws, Doppelg채nger's main plot is well told and keeps the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) busy. The ending is perhaps not what one might expect from Anderson, but at the same time it is typical of Anderson, and it is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean, you will have to watch it for yourself. :)
