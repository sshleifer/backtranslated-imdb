It's not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this film rules. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this film. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider who will make you collapse with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly probably plays the most serious character in the cast as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this film, probably playing the most serious character in the film. The actor that I liked most is Toby Huss in the role of Nitro, all the electric shots his character plays in the film is hilarious. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit bumpy, on Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge, who for years wanted to command his own submarine. When he finally gets the chance, instead of a brand new submarine, he gets a rusty Secondary World War Diesel Diesel, the Stingray. His crew is no better, misfit than the United States Navy. It is then inserted into a series of war games, which show how an old diesel engine can handle itself against the current nuclear navy. Things still don't improve when he finds out that his dive officer is actually a female officer, to see how women do on actual subtitles. To get the position of commander he wants, he must win the War Games and blow up a fictitious ship. <br /> <br /> The cinema fairs quite well, in fact I laughed relentlessly when I saw this movie in theaters. I loved when they were silent and Buckman farts, and everyone's reaction to the smell is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Overall, 9 out of 10, this film is simply fun to watch, it's nice to have a movie like that, I hate movies that try to be 100% serious.
