What can I say about this band, I was hooked in 68 years, I was a ten year old boy, I grew up in the Blues thanks to my father, then these Midlands boys arrived, a fusion of Country rock, Heavy Rock and Blues , I wish I had the chance to see them live in the early years, I was lucky to be there in 79 (Knebworth) which was the best concert I've seen so far, I hope a full version of that hot August night will be soon reality. This CD has given me the opportunity to see the boys over and over again, The Song remains the same, but this CD is reduced to the core. <br /> <br /> Long life at the Zepp.
