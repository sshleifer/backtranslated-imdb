This excellent film starring Elizabeth Montgomery is late to be released in DVD format. The same can be said for his previous film, also excellent, A Case of Rape. I can only hope that my comments will stimulate an enterprising soul in putting BOTH the films of Elizabeth Montgomery on a DVD to be made available to her numerous fans. I for one believed that the role of this excellent actress was unfortunately stereotyped from her role in Bewitched and, as a result, more serious acting roles had not been made available. I am confident that if these two films, perhaps even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, had been released in DVD form, his fans would have set the record directly on how highly they considered his acting skills.
