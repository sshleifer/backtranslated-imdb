When it comes to ANY movie made in or around the South, the characters are labeled as racist or Hillbillies or even worse in terms of RACIST TERM "Rednecks". This film was a mystery of murder, simple and simple. It was a great murder and showed some human feelings about every other race. The same kind of remarks made by black character actors towards the Whits in today's films. Before watching this film, one should get the "MISSISSIPPI BURNING" love at first sight from another's shoulder and enjoy the plot, the wonderful acting and the simpler sequences of moments that, while they are finished, will not be forgotten. Signor Falulino made his hometown of OXFORD, young lady. Justice having this movie filmed there. The producer noticed while shooting the film, his stereotypical perception of whites had been taken into consideration and he observed that whites, black citizens and locals got along well with each other in the same way. So relax and enjoy one of Mr Faulkner's great classics and try to figure out who the killer really is ...
