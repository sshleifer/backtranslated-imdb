The Curse of Monkey Island. Exactly released 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. You would think with the strange end of Monkey Island 2 that would end Monkey Island once and for all. But it all turned out to be a trick to attract Guybrush into captivity. But other than that, the whole jist of this is that Monkey Island is back, and the rumors are just phenomenal. If LucasArts were to make a Monkey Island movie / cartoon, this would probably be how it would be, and it would sound like. The plot is really good and everything is just fantastic. If you haven't heard of the Monkey Island series, buy Monkey Island Archives or The Monkey Island Booty Pack and play through all the games starting with The Secret of Monkey Island, then Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. Monkey Island 4 was really good, but this one surpasses them all.
