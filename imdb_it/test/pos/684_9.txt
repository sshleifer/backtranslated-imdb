"Shivering Shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of the "Our Gang" era of talkies. By now, Hal Roach's studios have begun to make progress in producing talking images, and "Shakespeare" is the happy result. <br /> <br /> The Gang appears in a version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy, the cop's wife. Children do not find the game very funny and are distracted by people in the theater and cannot remember their lines. Among the funniest pieces is Kennedy the Cop as the giant, who takes off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancer (played by director Bob McGowan's daughter.) <br /> <br /> Several filmographies mention that "Shakespeare" has the first pie fight in a talkie. This may be true, as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight. Buster Keaton's brother, Harry, is at the end of one of the cakes. Very funny and a classic Gang talkie in advance. 9 out of 10.
