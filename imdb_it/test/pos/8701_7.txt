King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel creature for his heart (which is quite obvious as soon as you see it). Three female students came to study local folklore, but find themselves drawn to the legends of vampires at the wrong time: Vladislav was killed. <br /> <br /> Who can say something negative about a film with an Angus Scrimm cameo? I can't. I mean, I had very low expectations after seeing other pictures of the Full Moon ("Puppet Master" in particular, and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the evil animated effects of demons, this film was really well done and very fun to watch. A lot of blood, a good plot and background (the story of Bloodstone was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles about the vampire myth, which you would think would die by now. (Maybe I'm wrong, but this is probably the first movie with a rosary fired from a gun.) Aside from vampires and blood, you get a part of the nudity (free, but welcome) and I had to note the excellent score by composers (I'm not sure who deserves credit, but those involved are Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka). This is Horror 101 all the way. Heck, you also have two sequels, which is the sign of a real horror movie. (Of course, some bad films also have sequels - did I mention "Puppet Master"?) The Romanian theme was well done, and the film even seems to have been made by Romanians if they correctly guess their origins. And the soundtrack - the music - I really liked it as a nice change of pace, very much like a setting. I like Richard Band, but I'm glad that another composer had a hit because he nailed the atmosphere on his head. If you like vampire movies and want a slight variation (one of the Eastern European varieties), it's worth seeing.
