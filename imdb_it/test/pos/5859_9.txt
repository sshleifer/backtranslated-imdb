I can be very tired of the mysteries of the murder with the exception of some really excellent TV series. Otherwise, there are too many themes of these murders. I don't like the theme of the two intelligent and selfish youngsters who kill as an intellectual exercise, I have no interest in Hitchcock that seems to have been associated with it in a way that I don't intend to discover. But don't get me wrong, the theme is excellent in itself, the whole movie is so well done and, of course, Sandra Bullock is as superb as ever. <br /> <br /> The character of Sandra is (as in Miss Congeniality) not rated by the male team she works with despite her obvious abilities, and the boss mostly ignores her ideas, eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to his male partner. Obviously Sandra understands what is happening and is almost killed in a dramatic ending. It is intriguing how the boy who elaborated the plot of the murder cannot allow him to be killed by his colleague - he has a conscience of some kind and perhaps could be "saved, while the other is a true psychopath. <br /> < Sandra's hard shell is caused by the misery in her past that is sharply linked to the case of murder. Her colleague, realizing that Sandra is solving this case despite being exiled from the intense upper, finally discovers what happened to Sandra herself in her adolescents, who now has to face and exorcise and the last scene shows that she is starting - let's hope anyway - to do just that. <br /> <br /> I can see from the few other reviews that I have had the time of laws that this film would attract an extended group - those interested in the two spoiled boys who scandalize their time with their macabre philosophical determination to deceive the police and get away with the perfect murder or, the relationship between them that is so cleverly painted, the horrendous connections to the heroine's past, a police theme, and some fumes and mirrors - as well as for Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who asked why Bullock's character must have a troubled past, I think this would be a much less interesting film if it was just a detective trying to figure out what was happening, with a volunteer helper and a chauvinist leader. The link between the murder victim and the detective is needed to show that the detective is becoming too involved or otherwise how could he lose the confidence of his arrogant boss and thus lose his life? This is certainly not an original theme, in fact it is usually an extremely irritating theme as this chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired agent to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly does not have enough skills to solve it even though the companion is. I was very worried about the end of what might have happened to Sandra's character, since her emotional involvement in the case and the special sympathy for the unfortunate crime victim made her dangerously drive alone with this case. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed by the relationship between Bullock's character and his partner. This is interesting and sometimes very intense. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is decidedly intriguing, if that's what you wanted to watch. I felt that he was held in low regard in some way because the filmmakers didn't want to get too into the friendship between boyfriend and girlfriend, or because we didn't have to think that emotions governed their relationship. The film makes you ask cunningly which guy is responsible for the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their immaturity at the base in various stages. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I wish had been clarified and that is what happens "after the end of the film" when Sandra's character arrives at the Court .... you have to see the cinema to know why it is there. <br /> <br /> Very well performed by everyone. I certainly can't agree with those who complained about Bullock's acting - it was superb. The part looked good on her, really. The plot is compelling even if the mysteries of murder are not your thing and they are not so often mine.
