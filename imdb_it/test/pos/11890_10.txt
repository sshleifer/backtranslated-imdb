I've seen this movie more than once. Actually El Padrino was one of the best feature films I've seen in a great deal of time. <br /> <br /> There was a large cast, Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa, who really shone a real star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard that this film was shot for less than two million dollars. I have seen films shot for 33 million that cannot be compared to the value of quality and production. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa why aren't you getting offers and more movies? EXCELLENT WORK!!!!!!!!!! I look forward to seeing the sequel, and I hope it has the same action. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly created a classic cult character with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa moves coldly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40s and 50s So tired of seeing these non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller get all these movies when there's a talent like this that has something to show. a great movie. <br /> <br /> GO GO GO KICK SOME BUT IN SALES EL PADRINO !!!
