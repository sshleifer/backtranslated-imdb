Fans of Pink Panther, Naked Gun or Get Smart will surely appreciate this farce that won a César and was nominated for another four. <br /> <br /> Jean Dujardin is the OSS 117 agent, a man who wouldn't know a clue if he hit him in the head. It is also a reflection of the colonialist indicative attitude of the West. <br /> <br /> All the Russian spies, the Nazis and the Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there is Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and the Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> The mysterious ability of OSS 117 to learn languages, play musical instruments the first time he takes them and sing like a native are all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he is still stupid.
