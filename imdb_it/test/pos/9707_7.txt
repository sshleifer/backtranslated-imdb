Johnny Knoxville has gone mad. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass delighted in practical jokes more than in the physical stuff ?? his gag at the opening of car rental and the next bit involving a horn on a golf course were more like some kind of extreme Candid camera ?? but in Jackass: Number Two is really out of the rocker. <br /> <br /> Starting with a sequence in which a bull is chased into a drawing room, or later when he rides a rocket (a feat that almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion on the side of the rocket), and especially when it voluntarily faces a defense mechanism and takes a spray of bullets to the stomach, Knoxville is a fool. In the first movie Bam Margera and Steve-O ?? infamous party animals ?? they were the most daring, but you know it's pretty ugly when you see Knoxville tempting them to do a stunt. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a series of stunts pulled out by boys consumed by testosterone, who constantly seek out one another. Will he eventually end up dead for one of the cast members? in Jackass 2 Steve-O almost loses a leg for a shark, Knoxville (as above) is almost impaled with a rocket explosion, and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed due to the success of 2, and frankly I can't imagine any stunt going beyond the bull run in the opening scene of this movie ?? it's an incredible film. It's almost unbelievable, and I wondered if it had been simulated, but apparently it was 100% authentic. (Which is actually a bit terrifying.) And in terms of extremes, Jackass 2 far exceeds its predecessor ?? it also feels more cinematic than the first film, with fewer common sense titles preceding the acrobatics made famous on MTV's original TV show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the boys have been given too much freedom here, and a good number of gags are simply lame exercises in rawness ?? I can occasionally enjoy the poo gag, but look at a man who relaxes on a miniature toilet, or see Steve-O take the beer on his butt (yes, honestly), then scratch himself after a while. Even the boys of the brotherhood in the screening that I attended? who was enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card on the back and was hit by a made-up chair? they were disgusted by some of the scenes in this movie. Isn't it a question of running away as much as possible ?? it's about saying "Is it fun or funny?" Many times, unfortunately, it really isn't. <br /> <br /> But for every weak stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people's faces, there are some brilliant hidden bits. The extravagant director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked, with sagging breasts and without shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, out for lunch with his nephew, letting him drink alcohol and smoke, and cursing and insulting people. This is the classic comedy brought to new extremes with the freedoms of an R-rating. Is it a pity that they had to ruin all the beautiful things ?? including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist joke ?? with jokes along the way. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough spirit and madness in this film to deserve a vision, and it has really brought the concept of ends in the cinema to new levels.
