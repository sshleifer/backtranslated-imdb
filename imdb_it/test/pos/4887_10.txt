Ok, I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler, so I just ticked the box to save the hassle. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair division. Personally, I loved it, although I have to say that I think some of the cameos were there for the sake of having a cameo. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I'm just grateful that it wasn't the show Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou, and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to direct the film, in particular Sir Goeff Tipps, probably the most fun of the deck. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is less than a summary more than something quite obtuse from a blog, but what the hell, the film was fantastic, and I think that's all that matters.
