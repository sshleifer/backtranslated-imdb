Everyone told me that this film was not at all good, and sick, etc. So in the end I rented it and I was amazed. I thought the torture would have been much worse, but in the end it was shocking, but it was all about it. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the category of Silence of the Lambs and / or Kiss the Girls. Sometimes he became stupid, but the rest of the film kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R - for severe torture, violence, language and sexuality
