A man named Jerry gets hold of an ancient Aztec doll. However, this creepy little figure is possessed by an evil spirit, who takes over Jerry's body and spurs him to shed blood ... I saw two other horror films "The Dorm that Dripped Blood" and "The Kindred" made by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow and I must say that "The Power" does not disappoint either. The plot is slow, but there are some effective and somewhat human goo effects. The scene of a female tabloid journalist being attacked by arms coming out of the mattress is a real hoot. I liked this cheap horror movie and you should do it too, if you're in the 80s horror genre. Out of 10.
