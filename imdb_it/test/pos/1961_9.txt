River's Edge is an excellent film and it is a pity that it has not made a mark in the history of cinema. There were a number of gritty movies based on schoolchildren in the eighties, but of all those I saw; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a plot that is disturbing in itself and adds the theme of slacker teenagers and their indifferent attitude towards things, which takes history to another level. The film works because the central plot is interesting and is interpreted by complex characters. The film begins with a murder. We then follow the murderer, nicknamed John, who returns to school and tells all his friends about what he did. Rather than giving the expected reaction, most of them hardly react and the strongest reaction the killer gets comes from Layne; who makes it his number one priority to help John clear up the mess in which he finds himself and pull it out. The other friends scold the crime, and soon one of them goes to the police ... <br /> <br /> River's Edge offers a series of great shows by his young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for acting in wood, and for good reason; but it adapts very well to this initial role and this performance is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is Layne's biggest standout, a little crazy. Glover always stands out in all the films in which it is inserted, and while it exceeds the upper part a little; he convinces well as a protagonist in this film. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film presents a very gritty image that bodes well for its nihilistic tone. The central characters are all of the "scansafatic / stoned" generation and the way they genuinely don't seem to care about their friend's murder is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to give to modern society is strong and well defined. The film is also quite funny, due to some of the characters' lines; but humor is pitch black and clearly this film was never conceived as a comedy. Overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing!
