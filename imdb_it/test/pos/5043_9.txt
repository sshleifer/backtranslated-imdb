The main cast: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> Director Vladimir Michalek gives this fascinating story of elderly people who enchant twists that make the characters attractive, truly universal. <br /> <br /> Frantisek Hana is retired and retired, his previous occupation unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty-four, Emilie. His son Jara craves the spacious apartment as a problem solver as he needs to host one of his ex-wives and many of their children. The son is not an evil strategist, only a boy with a wife who has gone too far and an eye on the attachment his father has for the apartment (where he moved after having given his son a previous residence). <br /> <br /> Hana and her close friend, Ed, spend more than ample free time doing small jobs not for money, but for the pleasure of embarrassing simple people like real estate agents. A favorite ploy is that Hana plays the part of a retired star of the Metropolitan Opera in New York who returns home in search of an expanding villa. And it is his companion as gullible real estate agents who fall by themselves offering chauffeur-driven limousines and excellent French restaurant dishes in the hope of a lucrative sale. <br /> <br /> When not involved in well-planned scams, the duo engages in quick actions such as pretending to be railway security agents in order to snatch kisses from breathless teenagers without a ticket trying to sneak in on the trains. Kisses chaste, that is: there is no lust here. <br /> <br /> Hana's long-lived wife is obsessed with saving enough money to ensure that the couple, individually and jointly, have a great funeral, a life-loving event Frantisek is in no hurry to experiment. <br /> <br /> Disagreements over money and the promiscuous arrangement of Frantisek's marital funds lead to a crisis whose resolution sounds both real and captivating. Michalek catches the emotions of the viewer but does so openly, honestly and effectively. <br /> <br /> "Autumn Spring", subtitled of course, is the product of an increasingly lively Czech cinema. It has not been shown widely in the United States, but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring this film to a large audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky recently succumbed to cancer, so this film is a promise of a good actor who imbued his character with a passion for the pleasures of life that must have reflected the actor's own values. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
