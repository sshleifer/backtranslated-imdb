Not being a movie fan, I am not familiar with the names of the main directors, screenwriters, producers and the like, but I can tell an exceptional film when I see one. <br /> <br /> The creators of this beautiful film may now be at the top of their fields, or it may come soon. I know the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> It takes talent closer to genius to show with such realism how a national tragedy like Vietnam has had an impact on the daily life of a typically American average family, and lets us see at close range because there are so many homeless Vietnam veterans. <br /> <br /> Without getting into free scenes of blood and bloodshed, it makes us understand why so many men have had flashbacks of what they had gone through. /> <br /> The dialogue is particularly compelling and gives us an idea of ​​what happened in so many families in the aftermath of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more beautiful films like this, not only on Vietnam, but also on other social conditions.
