This is a brilliant series along the lines of Simpson. Follow a family while they go through life and problems, etc. Slightly less realistic than the Simpsons, talking about a child and a dog to someone? The Family Guy goes where SImpson or Futurama does not dare, reaching the past in the sickest jokes and in the most daring gags. And believe me, it works! Almost all the gags hit the mark and they'll get you points (especially the random, frequent flashbacks!) When my brother first showed me this I wasn't hooked, but after a few episodes I was caught. You will be 2.20 for a really brilliant show. COngrats to Seth Macfarlane for giving life to this show. :)
