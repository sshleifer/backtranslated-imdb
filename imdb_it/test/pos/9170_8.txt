I have to admit that I liked this film a lot more than I expected. Will Smith has that neat charm that you can't help but like. The plot was a minor twist on romantic comedy's basic stuff, a bit reminiscent of "Emma" by Jane Austen. This guy Kevin James has a real talent for comedy times and physical comedy. I've never seen his TV show, but he was chosen very well in this film. Amber Valletta was pretty good. I can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this movie, but if she were to be an actress or a model, then the casting might have left something to be desired. I liked Julie Ann Emery, and I wish she had a bigger part. But, saving the best for last, Eva Mendes has more or less stolen the show. Her beauty, her charm and the right amount of solidity had glued me to the screen every time she was there. I hope to see more in the future. This film is definitely worth a try.
