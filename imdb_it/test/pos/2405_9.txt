Well, it took 4 tries, but in the end they got it right! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well first of all I applaud them for finally freeing Ralph Macchio. I heard he never served as Karate Kid. I would have preferred to see Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio revealed what turned out to be the best film in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put a girl! They have Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she's in. I personally don't care about his buck teeth, but this is a personal preference. But still, look at how Karate Kid 4 launched his career in orbit! A crazy Oscar won. Christmas Jiminey! Meanwhile where is Ralphy ?? He should release some amateur porn tape like Screech or something. <br /> <br /> However, my only disagreement with the film is that they have a girl who does karate. As a self-proclaimed teacher of Karate, I was the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls ... well, except for Judo ... but this is a bit gay. So, for the sake of accuracy, I think they should have stayed with another male for this role. I was thinking maybe about Dennis Franz. It would give the role the depth it requires. <br /> <br /> Maybe they will listen to my suggestions and we will make the necessary adjustments in Karate Kid 5. Even Pat Marita is not anymore. I was thinking that maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect substitute for the lovely Asian colleague Mr. Miyagi. It will give "Wax on wax off" a completely new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA fun eh? However, if you are looking for an exciting movie full of Karate and a triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don't waste time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for centuries!
