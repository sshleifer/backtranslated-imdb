A real comedy. The dialogue is fast and very funny. Eleanor Parker at his physical peak. Lynn as only Flynn can be "the fascinating rogue" .. even though it has now passed its first film. Most of the main scenes are short, the movie moves well, if you haven't seen this movie please take a look. You will be surprised by Flynn's comic timing. The scenes between him Tucker, Parker and "Cudddles" Sakal are hilarious. Only based on the clothes worn by the most attractive Parker, this film is worth a look. The love story of this 1940s movie will not be lost for those who are so inclined to watch movies from Hollywood's golden past. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye will not disappoint.
