This film was made fairly soon after Karen's death that perhaps Richard Carpenter and those closest to Karen felt a little guilty about how they could contribute to her health problems. Over the years (almost 25 to be exact) it must have become easier to deny any complicity. Richard spent the years after Karen's death, incessantly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I've read, he seems to be planning a new generation carpenter with his children. He seems to have regretted making this film, and this may be why it is not available in any form. It seemed like a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent of Karen Carpenter.
