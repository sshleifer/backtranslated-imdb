Mishima: a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best film by Paul Schrader to date. Hypnotic cinematography, accompanied by the mystical music of Philip Glass, has added a completely magical aura to the story of one of Japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully represented in this image. Like any gifted character, Mishima was tormented by serious personal conflicts, the main one being the conflict between the "pen and the sword", as the director puts in his final chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings, the life in a notoriously male society with warrior traditions long centuries, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the traditionally traditional side of Mishima itself. <br /> <br /> All of Schrader's films (and those for which he wrote scripts) are basically stories of the inner conflict within a man who does not belong to an environment in which he lives. This also applies to Mishima, who, apart from the education of the Japanese military school, grew up with a love of theater and words. His death consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was words and theatrical end in a life game. Movies like this come once in a while, and most will have to wait a lifetime to achieve this beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
