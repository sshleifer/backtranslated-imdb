For the reason that I love films like "Central do Brasil" ("Central Station", 1998), I love "Chop Shop". There is no coating for sugar, there is no attempt to make these people's lives more pleasant or beautiful. What you see is what you get, and it is often gritty and sometimes heartbreaking. But this is exactly what makes a film like "Chop Shop" so wonderful, besides the fact that the plot takes place in such an elegant and subtle way. For a young brother and sister, who are closer to the homeless like one would never get, working (and living) in a car repair shop in Queens, New York is the best he gets. Is it a good thing or a bad thing? This is the question that this film essentially asks the viewer. This film is really a fantastic piece of life that sometimes looks like a documentary rather than a drama, and it's a great thing, because it seems so real. In between, so many current films based on essentially surreal and often unlikely plots, tripping over "Chop Shop" is like finding a little gem.
