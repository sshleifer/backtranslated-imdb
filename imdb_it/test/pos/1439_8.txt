A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction, Sinatra is wonderful in this film. Just looking at his frantic writhing and screaming and destructive rage towards the end of the film is enough to make anyone think about trying heroin; perhaps they should show it to children in health class instead of the mindless things we are forced to endure year after year. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a man who is simply trying to make a clean new life for himself after being in prison, trying to get rid of his drug habit and his job of treating papers in illegal gaming operations, which is shot down, pulled back in the mud by the evils of human nature. He is exploited by his employers, by drug dealers and even by his enigmatic, astute yet stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't like the movie itself, it's worth seeing just for the soundtrack. It's all heavy and oscillating jazz with large sections of drums and brass. This, with its groovy but slightly sinister sound, helps to set the mood, along with drug and paper smirters, who always seem to hover like vultures around Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone - especially if you like film noir, zoot suits, fedora or jazz.
