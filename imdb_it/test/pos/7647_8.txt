This surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews in advance that they called it a good B series movie and it was prepared for the worst. Halfway through I suddenly realized that I was completely inculcated and enjoying myself a lot. There have been some really tense moments that have made you advance nervously fiddling with the remote control or any other object at hand. Overall, this film absolutely does not deserve the B-grade tag. <br /> <br /> Credit must be given to the director, Gary Ellis and the writers, Bill Boatman and Todd King for their film debut. I hope these kids continue with higher budgets and some studio support.
