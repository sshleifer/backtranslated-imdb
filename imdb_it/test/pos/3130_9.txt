Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to lead to deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who a feeling of amazement and profound satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a train of Mormon tanks reach California. Along the way they meet a medical man whose mules have fled, a group of bank robbers and some Navajo. There is a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail, and the film is full of fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The scenery, always from Monument Valley, is more beautiful than ever. Also, how can you go wrong with James Arness? The Wagonmaster may not be one of John Ford's best-known films, but it's still worth seeing if you get the chance. 9/10.
