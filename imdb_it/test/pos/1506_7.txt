Fulci ... Does this man wear one of the most glamorous and weirdest films ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few reasons why this film is one of Fulci's best films. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes fun of himself and his films with this. The main role of this film is none other than Fulci himself, who plays the role of ... director of horror-splatter-gore, who thinks he is slowly going crazy. It's full of black humor that unlike most modern horror movies works here. Since it is love at first sight, you must know that it is bloody. How much? Well practically. I've always loved blood in movies and I've never had enough, but Cat in the Brain really stopped my bloodlust, and believe me, it's hard to file. Even the Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about cold blood. Almost every scene revolves around Fulci, who after being hypnotized by * khmmm * the evil psychiatrists is seeing every kind of horror for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some scenes involve him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead he sees a rotten corpse lying on the floor, which begins to spit out some liquid from his wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2, this is the most gorgeous Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci is able to apply all those comic parts to the fiercest movie. He's such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happen from time to time, like the one in which Fulci says "making blood films is a kind of disease". The end is very good considering that Fulci (and most of the masters of Italian horror) knows he has no sense or many holes in the plot. If you're Fulci fun, make sure you take a look. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat "Its only a movie" ps. some of the gore scenes in this movie: Chainsaw dismemberment (full), torn tongue, torn eyeballs, larva-infested corpses, zombies, beheadings, face up in boiling water, fists in the shower (head), throat, many parts of the body and of the organs are roasted aside, the battered face ...
