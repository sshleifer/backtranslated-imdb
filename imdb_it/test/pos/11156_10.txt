The ultimate housewife and perfect mother, Donna Reed (like Donna Stone) could do everything. Arranging gaiters among children or neighbors, caring for his tiring husband and pipe smoker pediatrician, Alex, and still having a pile of pancakes, three types of breakfast meat and a glass of milk and OJ ready for children every morning before breakfast. <br /> <br /> Over the last fifty years we have lost sight of the idealistic mother at home, family meals at the kitchen table and the preparation of dinner for a tough-husband who works when he returns home from work. <br /> <br /> I would like the show to be available on DVD - it would completely interrupt my cable!
