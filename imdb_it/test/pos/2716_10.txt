I resisted looking at 15 Park Avenue despite the recommendations, dismissing the film as a clich√© of extreme emotional dramas and exaggerated acting. <br /> <br /> From time to time films like 15 Park Avenue arrive and sweep your feet away. <br /> <br /> The film catches your attention soon enough and there is no time to rest afterwards. Aparna Sen did a great job gluing the audience to each line of the film. The impeccable character development, the "right" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all ... <br /> <br /> I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi. She still beats the expectation after Page 3 and Mr. & Mrs. Iyer. Prof. Anjali's role is very well developed and Shabana does full justice to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman add an incredible taste to the film. I define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes in a movie that meditate in your shower indefinitely, until your wife / girlfriend / mom slams against the door. 15PA offers many "shower moments", especially the conversation between Anjali and his mother, in which the mother is cautious when she talks to Anjali about her thoughts. It immediately brings Anjali's personality to the public. <br /> <br /> The end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too westernized for the Indian public; but it provides the elements to promote the film from a "good" to a "big" state.
