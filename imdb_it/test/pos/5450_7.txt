This is a clever and funny movie about the behind-the-scenes battles that went on to choose a Johnny Carson successor on the Tonight Show. However, the film's supreme thesis, that David Letterman's superior comedic talents have been neglected due to its controversial nature, and the show diminished by the coronation of an inferior Jay Leno in the main comedy program on television is simply not true, like anyone have seen both Leno and Letterman perform can see for themselves. The hard and simple truth is exactly how an NBC executive stated in the movie "Jay Leno is America's Funniest Man". And David Letterman is not. Once this is understood, many of the machinations in the film become irrelevant. After all, the whole movie is little more than grapes for Letterman fans, who can't accept that the best comic was chosen by people whose business is to know this kind of thing. The final demonstration is that, despite the first role of Letterman, perhaps due to the clamor that emerged from the battle for the succession of Tonight Shows, Leno's show has always proved to be the most popular, therefore, at least in my mind, refuting the claims of Letterman as unjustly robbed of his legitimate inheritance.
