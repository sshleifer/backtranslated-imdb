The subject of this film is potentially depressing: a man in his thirties, without work, little education, three children from a failed relationship, who lives in his parents' house, but with a dream of directing feature films. But about half an hour from the movie you understand that Mark Borchardt has an endless bottom of drives and ambitions - it's just that it's all channeled into his need to direct films, and nothing else will make him happy. The movie jumps all over the emotional spectrum, but in the end you feel happy, because you've just met some wonderful people. Go see this - you will end up wishing it is longer.
