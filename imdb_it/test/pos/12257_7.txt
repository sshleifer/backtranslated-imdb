A good drama / comedy, with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he finds himself in. With a fantastic script, this movie goes up and gives everyone the chance to show off their acting talent. And even if Joan Cusack is not like that, but has a scene if not the most fun of the film. The highlight of the film for me was Albert Brooks's speech on the devil. Only one draws back is the fact that it goes a bit slow in places. And I became interested in the role of Brooks, not so much that of Hunter or Hurt. I give this a 7 out of 10.
