It is a work of soap opera based on an idea of ​​applied ethics. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good film. I did not get any emotion, the ideas are not new at all, the tension is lacking, it becomes boring towards the second half but towards the end I think it becomes rather interesting in a burlesque way. I mean you have this bald middle-aged, paralyzed boy who receives more women than Don Juan. He doesn't seem to suffer as much as you'd expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no problems with God (and you'd probably expect that too), the people around him seem to be perfect slaves (I can't get myself out of my mind Bergman's Cries and Whispers, similar to this in many respects, that simply bursts with emotions, and not all human.) This film is the perfect recipe for housewives who are looking for an emotional thrill but don't expect to be swept away. The film deserves to be seen among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical question without any desire to arouse the viewer. Amenabar does not give us a face and does not take sides, he does not want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. I still have no idea why this movie was so appreciated.
