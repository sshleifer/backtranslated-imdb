This is the first of Ma and Pa Kettle's gestures. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in whatever she does. It's fun to see Ida Moore in the role of Emily, the old lady bleeds on the train ... God was ALWAYS old; was in "Desk Set" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". Their new home is also a co-star here - it's the home of the future with some really interesting inventions that Pa doesn't care about. I love the gag of painting. Keep an eye on TOM ... she starred in "Tata e professore". Unfortunately he died really young ... strangely, his last role was in the series "Death Cruise". strange. Directed by Charles Lamont, who not only directed some of Kettle's films, he also made a couple of Abbott and Costello films, so he must have known a thing or two about comedy. Fun story, simple, simple humor. The release date was also the first of April, 1949. The story begins showing us what backward and peasant people are (neighbors are even Native Americans), but with the progress of the story, we have sympathy and respect for them.
