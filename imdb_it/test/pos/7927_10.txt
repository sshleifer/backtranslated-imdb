Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In the book, Nevksy was presented in theaters throughout Russia as a prelude to the Soviet invasion of western Germany. I felt I had to take a look. It was excellent! The cinematography was magnificent and incredible. I don't regret having seen this movie and added it to my collection.
