I'll be brief: I usually hate films like this in a poisonous way ... but there's only something about it that attracts me and won't let me go. Sure, there are some big flaws in it (some of the recitations are below average and the dialogue is sometimes so poor that it's fun) but there are enough features to make it watchable to the end. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, it has a little interesting plot - it's not absolutely original, but is presented better than other films of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) performed pretty decent performances that compensated for the lack of quality of the supporting cast (the fat cop and Coach Quinn really bothered me), and the script is smooth and witty ( even if he is poor in some places). <br /> <br /> The end result, however, is that this film is so CUTE: I smiled at it all the way and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer everyone up. You really have to be a little bored with no humor who doesn't like this (I SAY someone to sit without smiling !!!). I recommend this if you want a simple, fun, and - above all - nice watch. You will not regret! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
