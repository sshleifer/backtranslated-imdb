One of the best ever. Direction, photography, an exciting and dramatic story, a wonderful soundtrack and, above all, the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underrated actor of the "under 40 generation". After seeing this film, do I imagine if anyone could have any doubt about giving death to another man, despite the bad things he could have done?
