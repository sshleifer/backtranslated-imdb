While it is generally recognized as one of the first martial arts films to be played here in the West, the real impact comes in retrospect. The Lieh is VERY low key in all and many of the fighting scenes, while often hailed as innovative (which were at the time of the initial version of the film), they are a bit domesticated compared to what came next (particularly after Bruce Lee, which has become the instant standard with which all others will forever be judged). This does not mean that FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH / BOXER RE is something less than a classic in its own right, because it is. Like many of the protagonists of many martial arts films, the character of Lieh is low in most of the film for a reason - but, when unleashed, he effectively cleans the house. You can't ask for more.
