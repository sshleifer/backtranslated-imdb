I was totally surprised how beautiful this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was just slightly amused! I must say, however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor has not played a bigger and better role! He was a huge talent. <br /> <br /> There is great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been more fun. <br /> <br /> I am extremely happy that this photo was made because we will see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to good use. Brent Spiner shows that "Data" by Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. <br /> <br /> The plot is really simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this film and highly recommend it.
