Silent historical drama based on the story of Anna Bolena, a newcomer waiting for the Queen who captures the lustful gaze of Henry VIII, the irascible king of England who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court Jester, look at the rides and follow young beauties leaping out of cakes and attractive assorted females around the castle. Well, he soon canceled his marriage, married Anne, and told her it's his sacred duty to produce a male heir. He fails on that point and soon has his eyes on another woman waiting. Meanwhile, Anne spends virtually the entire movie looking hesitant, perturbed or even ready to burst into tears. He doesn't look like a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!). <br /> <br /> This film is a solid piece of entertainment, with an engaging story that has kept my interest for two hours - Plus I enjoyed seeing the luxurious medieval costume presented here on a beautiful sepia print. Emil Jannings is rather surprising and memorable in his well-made portrait of King Henry VIII: it really seemed to be Henry the Eighth. I'm not so sure of the performance of the actress who plays Anne, it seemed a bit exaggerated. The DVD of this film presents an appropriate and well-made piano score that fits this story perfectly. A nice movie.
