I saw it for the first time in the 1970s on syndicated TV and admired its production values, which were high tech for the time. The remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense than the pale 35mm TV prints. This film deserves more attention: it paved the way for UFOs, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly designed gadgets. Of course, the story of an alternative antimatter planet Earth has been recycled hundreds of times by Star Trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious European style for design: from Rolls Royce space engines to "Euro Sec" the letterhead, JFSS or Dopplegangers as it has been called in Europe is pleasant for the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of the Superpowers. The ambitious epic of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson becomes a bit boring when the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on the Doppleganger Earth, and everything is literally downhill after the poetically pretty shuttle boarding sequence. A mediocre story is aided by a great and lyrical classical score by the late Barry Gray, the John Williams of Great Britain.
