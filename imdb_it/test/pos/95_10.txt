The animated shorts do not go much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short film is dripping with Canadian references and, therefore, this film will probably be appreciated especially by Canadians. But the basic story is universal, and is lovingly told by the writer Roch Carrier. It's a hilarious story that I've known for some time, and recently I was lucky to see it again, so I simply had to write a warm recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece and a must see if you are Canadian or not.
