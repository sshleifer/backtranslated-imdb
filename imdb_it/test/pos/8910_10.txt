MONKEY is definitely one of the best shows ever shown on TV. I remember when I was a child, I went to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning and turned on the TV so I could watch MONKEY. I loved it. It had action scenes, special scenes, fantastic special effects, a great story, a fantastic thematic song that would never leave your head and your hilarious dubbing. But it is a bit strange that it is set in China and the actors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but this is not a problem to make this television program adorable. <br /> <br /> MONKEY talks about the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe) and of course the unforgettable and most amiable character, Monkey (Masaaki Sakai) who travels from China to India to get a bunch of sacred scrolls to save the world. <Br /> <br /> MONKEY is a lot of fun and it's magical.
