Paul Thomas Anderson's elegant and compelling interpretation of the 70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance encounter with pornography director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) began his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. The character of Dirk is based on the actor of real life, John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was famous for being extremely "well endowed". This is where Dirk finds initial success. <br /> <br /> The main themes of Boogie Nights are the obvious ones related to a film of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the issue of pornography with some control. It is no exaggeration and sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on the screen. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, cocaine is hugely abused and the film's setting, Los Angeles, 1977-1983, reflects the drug's popularity at the time, which the film captures perfectly. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes of addiction and overdoses. For example at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently, graphically, overdosed; blood flows from his nose and she begins an unconscious attack. The film, before this scene, was quite optimistic and comical, but from this point it prefigures the darkness that will occur. <br /> <br /> The musical scenes are performed brilliantly, from superbly lit disco scenes to Dirk asshole who sings terribly in his new musical career. The soundtrack is also excellent, with songs from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable Sound Experience. The prominent scene of the entire film is reduced to music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit the home of drug trafficker Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to earn some money from the sale of telephone drugs, but the Christian sister of Night Ranger , which is playing in the background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that music can bring much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is full of scenes like that, which makes the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic, but moody director. In the scene in which he attacks a boy for the making of his films, it is a complete shock for the public, because before that he was rather sweet and happy. Other noteworthy performances include Julianne Moore, Heather Graham in the role of the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg, who offers the performances of his career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original film, using themes but filmed in its own strong and realistic way. Anderson's approach fully captured these characters at a time when nothing seemed to go wrong, or at least until the 1980s. From that moment on, things become really obscure, and all the signs of the characters and the recognizable situations of the first part of the film are gone. This, however, does not reduce the high level of immersive entertainment offered by this film. Boogie Nights was not a box office success, earning only Â£ 2m in UK cinemas. But this is not the concern of the film or the director. Anderson recognizes the quality, not the popularity, which is evident in his other three films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a simple parable full of excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will understand that Boogie Nights is a story of simple morality, but that will remain in the mind days after watching it. Boogie Nights is both shocking, hilarious, devastating and visually and audibly exceptional.
