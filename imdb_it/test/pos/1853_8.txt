When I saw the trailer for this movie, I said to no one in particular "this movie is going to bomb". I also said it on THE MATRIX and I watch what happened there. Now I am not a box office guru anywhere, but I usually have a good intuition about what will be good and what will really suck. In this case I was blinded by my complete and total apathy towards David Duchovney. Let me put it in a different way: I don't like her as a person (from what I've read about him in interviews, he's incredibly pre-mad like him and he's full of himself considering all he's done is X -Files) or as an actor. PLAYING GOD was a really poor film, but it came out thinking that for some reason it deserved a lot of money on the big screen. But I'm happy to say that even if these things can still be true for humans, Return To Me is delicious and has the heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt directed a beautiful story and she told it with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen and although it may seem a little sad and mischievous in its premise, give it a chance and you'll be hooked. <br /> <br /> It must be said (and this makes me suffer in doing so) that the reason this film works so well is because of the plot and the cast. Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful and believable here that I honestly wanted to cry with them. There is a particularly powerful scene when Duchovney returns home after his wife is dead and collapses on the floor of his house. As always, the family dog ​​looks towards the door to wait for his wife to walk in. He does not and with the collar of his shirt still stained with blood, Rob (Duchovney) tells him he will never come home, ever. Then call the dog and they seem to share a cry together. The dog moans a little and then Rob cries. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I've ever seen in a character in any movie. You can feel his pain and at that moment I forgot that I was looking at an actor that I generally don't like, and I felt that I was looking at someone I knew because of the loss of his beloved. This is powerful stuff. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the supporting cast. Bonnie Hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of Irish and Italian characters who share a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. This is a delicious name all by itself. And to guide the diametric scale of the conflicting cultures is Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud old men who love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece (I think it is) respectively. And this is the character played by Minnie Driver. This scenario is ripe for comedy and Hunt loses nothing here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some fun moments together as a middle-aged married couple and Belushi gets better points as he humbly accepts humility and shows off his broad stomach barrel for laughter. With his family of three or four children, there is little time for him and his wife to have quality time. And yet Hunt manages it with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story of seeking true love, knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. Return To Me is a wonderful love story and although I still have no great admiration for David Duchovney, I must admit that he was perfect in this role and I could not imagine anyone else playing his character. He was sensitive and credible and the film was good for him, not only because of him, but he certainly added the flavor. <br /> <br /> If you are a sucker for a beautiful love story and you want a good cry, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I'll see everything that Bonnie Hunt puts with her in the director's chair.
