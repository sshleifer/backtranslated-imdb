This is the second film of 1985, the other was "The Wedding Singer". While the 'Wedding Singer' was playing the pop side of the 80s, 'Rock Star' is all about metal. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays her girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in one day. <br /> <br /> The story does not become too dramatic and only scratches the surface of a rock star's life. Sex and drugs are very limited in this film, but it's full of Rock'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are brilliant! The whole feeling of the concert is very well captured, since they used a real audience (no cgi here). <br /> <br /> Excellent direction and brilliant performance by Marky Mark, who acts like a real metal dude! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is all fun and if you have something to do with the old metal scene, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
