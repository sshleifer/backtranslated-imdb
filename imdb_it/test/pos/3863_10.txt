The twentieth Disney animated film is often criticized by many people as "mediocre" or of poor quality, but it's a great film. <br /> <br /> Too bad that "Gli Aristogatti" does not get the deserved credit. Personally I see it as one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being extremely undervalued, it is one of the most enjoyable Disney classics. It is full of hilarious moments (some of them, hysterical). <br /> <br /> Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the film but it is a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> Every scene with Edgar and the hounds Napoleon and Lafayette following him are some of the most fun you've ever seen, especially the one where Edgar rides his bike in the river and around the bridge with the dogs chasing him. It's hysterical! <br /> <br /> But classic humor does not come only from Edgar or hunting dogs. Other characters also have their moments. <br /> <br /> Regarding the subject of quality, it is not perfect, but remains at a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death, those artists kept true to the spirit of Walt and "Gli Aristogatti" is one of those examples. Nowadays they don't make them that way! <br /> <br /> As usual, legendary Disney actors give characters a voice. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> The characters are fantastic in general: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and his 3 kittens, the Roquefort mouse, the alley cats, the English geese, the hunting dogs and the horse. Even the human characters are included: the eccentric and kind singer of the retired Opera Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the old lawyer of comedian Madame Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! <br /> <br /> On the soundtrack, it has some pleasant and catchy songs like the Thomas O'Malley theme (but I can't remember its name), "Everyone wants to be a cat" and "The Aristocats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France), in the year of 1910. Above all, this is a joyful, beautiful and very pleasant film. A timeless classic that is often overlooked and forgotten, but very worthy. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
