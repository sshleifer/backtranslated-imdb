This film is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of eighties horror camp movies: low budget, no stars, many inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep kids in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three bad children play their parts well. A good starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown who exhibits her talents early in her career. This film will not be seen by many, but for fans of the horror of the 80s it is a must.
