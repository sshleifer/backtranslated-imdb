Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has written a fair number of Sherlock Holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective has ensured that the sequels in both the press and the film would go well beyond the author's works. <br /> <br /> In "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon," Holmes, Basil Rathbone, patriotically serves the British secret services to make sure that the sought-after Swiss scientist needs a viewfinder. The film is from 1942 and I wonder if the producers and writers realized how important the secrets of the viewfinder were (the American bombing Norden was guarded almost as zealously as the new radars that would have changed the course of the Second World War ). <br /> <br /> Holmes and his faithful but predictably uncertain companion, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, beat Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atwill. Evil as Moriarty has always been, it is a bit of a shock to see that he signed with Hitler. Does man have no trace of decency? I do not believe. But Atwill is deliciously evil. <br /> <br /> The story is fast enough because Holmes and Watson try to recover the stolen parts before they can be delivered to a U-boat. Rathbone is his usual sweet Self and several Holmesian disguises are well executed. <br /> <br /> This and other 40's Holmes stories are now available on DVD and oldies.com has created a nice set of four discs in a wooden box: this film is included along with a bonus CD of an interview with Elder Doyle. The set is on sale for around $ 26 in the major DVD and CD stores, but I found this and other sets from oldies.com in a warehouse club for $ 14.98. The transfers are very good. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and relaxing night vision. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
