Involvement of the entry into Europe of Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during the Second World War. It is always interesting as an American to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. There is nothing terribly original or revolutionary in the style in which this film is shot or in the romantic love triangle that sets the narrative. And yet, it is compelling to the end. There is a good balance between drama, romanticism, humor, action and symbolism that is underestimated by the director and the cast. This is a breath of fresh air after going through exaggerated and boring Hollywood epics like "Pearl Harbor". A solid production all around. This is definitely your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
