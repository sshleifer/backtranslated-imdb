At the beginning Coppola with a sublime cast that most people never could see (a pity). There are some wonderful things in this film - the best performance by Shirley Knight (an undervalued actress), a journey in the late 1960s, very sober and moving James Caan, Robert Duvall in a part from which he was born to act ( angular, solitary, motorcycle cop), and a moving script with F. Coppola behind the wheel. <br /> <br /> If this had been done five years later by anyone, it would have been a success (so much for the times). In any case, I recommend it to all people who do not need explosions in outer space and jokes about my bad mother or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold. Give this a chance if you can find it!
