Much more lively, and less dramatic and linked to the previous efforts of Gene Saks Barefoot in the Park (67) and The Odd Couple (68), Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but compared to most of the tired farces of 60s like the apartment, how to kill your wife, goodbye Charlie, a guide for the man of Married, divorce, American style, every Wednesday, Kiss Me Stupid, Boys Night Out, is a masterpiece. Director Saks and writer I.A.L. Diamond actually "opened" the success of Abe Burrows on Broadway, and the film greatly benefits from the filming of New York City and the excellent performances by Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks good and shows a certain talent for comedy. Hawn in his Oscar role has never been better or more attractive. Matthau is OK although it's hard to believe that Hawn's character is so in love with him. And in retrospect, Hawn's suicide attempt at the beginning of the film is out of character and incredible. Nevertheless, the film has a plausible plausible predisposition and, once it starts, generates a laugh. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti provide good support. The film is funny and fun, and Hawn and Bergman make you worry.
