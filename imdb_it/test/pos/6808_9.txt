A sentimental and heartbreaking film set in England in the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a lottery and decides to enter the Grand National; thankfully, former jockey Mickey Rooney is out and about to help Liz. Director Clarence Brown shows considerable control with material that may have been excessively rude in someone else's hands. He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves pay close attention to establishing authentic characterizations and developing the story in a natural way. True, there are one or two scenes that seem a little forced, but overall it's quite interesting, and beautifully shot in Technicolor. The race itself is quite electrifying and, like so many great classics, in the end there is a wonderful fade of three pieces. Liz proves that she was a real soldier from the beginning, and Rooney - who I usually find rather boring - is surprisingly subdued and really very good. Donald Crisp is as terrifying as Liz's grumpy father, and Angela Lansbury is a delight as his older, boyfriend's sister. Most of the recitative compliments, however, belong to Anne Revere, who won a well-deserved Oscar of support by playing Liz's wise and caring mother.
