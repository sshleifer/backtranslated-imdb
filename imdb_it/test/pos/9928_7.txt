Betty is a substitute in a production of Verdi's Macbeth who is asked to go ahead when the diva is injured in a car accident. However, in the great tradition of "The Scottish Play", the production seems cursed with problems, not the least of which is a madman who affects the crew. Unfortunately for Betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of many silver-saber-like films, in this case especially for the extraordinary photograph of the great British cameraman Ronnie Taylor. I didn't measure it, but I think about two-thirds of the shots in this movie are about pans, carts, trackers or cranes: the sheer volume of camera movement is simply amazing and makes the film ten times more exciting than a standard thriller . The imaginary is wild and dizzying - close-ups of the heroine's eyes forced to open with nails, a swooping glide around an opera house from the point of view of a crow, strokes of the writhing bird's brain , a bullet fired through a peephole, a chain swallowed out of a victim's windpipe. Conceptually it is simply fantastic and could only be realized by this director. The film is not without some shortcomings though; the cast is variable at best - both Marsillach and Barberini are both a bit shaky (and his dubbing in the English version is scary, even by Italian standards), even though the Nicolodi regular silver is fun and Charleson gives a weighted performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical (a horror director who is very defamed for his distance and reliance on technique). The material is a nice three-way mix of The Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and the slash flick, scripted by Argento and his usual collaborator, Franco Ferrini, with elusive suspicions galore and the usual contempt for boring exhibition scenes to explain what it's really happening. Full of all kinds of different music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and, of course, Verdi. The scenes in the beautiful opera were shot at the Teatro Regio di Parma. For some strange reason, the British press of this film has the alternative title Terror At The Opera.
