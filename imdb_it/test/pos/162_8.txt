Three children are born at exactly the same time, during a lunar eclipse. Just before their tenth birthday they embark on a murderous madness. "Bloody Birthday" is a typical slasher of the early 80s. It's a pretty mediocre stuff with a lot of nudity. bad children never generate any threat and there is almost no suspense. There are also no lies or scares in "Bloody Birthday", but the film is slightly funny. Unfortunately, no real explanation is given for the sudden murderous craze of children. rather horrible, for example, we have death with pistol, baseball bat, skipping rope and shovel. So if you're a fan of 80s slasher movies, take a look at it.
