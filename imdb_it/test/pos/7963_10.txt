How many times do we live our romantic life like on the big screen, with torrid stories and passionate encounters? Almost never, if what I see as normal life around me is something to judge on. Novels, as previously stated, are almost never upsetting affairs that leave you at the top of the world or beat and bruise. <br /> <br /> Romance, in its everyday form, lived millions of times around the world, is a slow, subtle and silent affair. Something that grows in you, always so slowly, probably without your noticing it slowly, taking over your being. No one can tell me when I'm in love. Because if someone did it, I wouldn't believe him anyway, because nobody, apart from me, would know. And even then, it's just a feeling, a certain awareness that proves this exciting emotion. That you want nothing but the best for someone, that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to endure a great deal of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say that I am willing to die for the loved one, because we are all human, and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us. <br /> <br /> Is the love between the main characters of the film always so subtle and discreet, no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet? Undeclared emotions, unspoken feelings convey much more than repeated cries of "I love you". The moderation shown by the leading actor, shown so intensely in the scene in which he looks at his love interest through the coffee shop window, yet he never moved to make himself known to her, it was simply heartbreaking to watch. Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden, knowing that his emotions and feelings could not be reciprocated? <br /> <br /> On another note, how will I manage my certain death? While I can claim to have been seriously ill, I cannot honestly say that I have ever come close to death. Will I be able to be so calm, to put all my business in order and leave instructions to others to take care of what I leave behind? I suspect I will be calm, because I will have little choice in this regard. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer must be negative. I can empathize with anguish, knowing that your life is lost, that fate has inflicted a fatal blow on you, and that future events, however small they are, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing but a series of small events, whose climax may seem grand to some in retrospect. But only very rarely.
