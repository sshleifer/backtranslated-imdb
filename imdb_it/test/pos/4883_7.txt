OK, why complain about this movie? It's fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see the biography, go look at it. This is an original fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. Obsessed people will complain about this, as every other deviation of facts does. Sad but true. I think making Kane Hodder the man the movie is named after was a great idea. At first I thought it wasn't so nice, I'll be honest. But that made it even scarier. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think this is a good movie. But if you're obsessed (like some other people), stay away from this movie and everyone else.
