Fantastic series, one of my favorites (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is right there with them). <br /> <br /> These guys don't wear frilly tights - they dress more like lumberjacks. All of this series breathes an aire of realism, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> Paints a picture of a Europe only slightly out of the reach of paganism, since most of the villagers still have their local gods, and there are nuns who worship Satan, and magi, witches and sorcerers who cast spells. <br /> <br /> However, what comes to the forefront more, is that it is a set of its time. Rather than the 1950s version, which was a lament against centralized government and the persecutions of the McCarthy era, this series is completely rooted in the 1980s, Thatcherist squalor, and has a strong environmental bias. Robin's protector is a nature worshiper called Hern The Hunter, who often appears with the head of a deer, and is a personification (like this Robin) of The Green Man, an alternate version of Osiris (the Egyptian god of vegetation and of the resurrection - it is interesting to note that in these series, Robin In The Hood is not a person, but a concept: when the old is killed, a new one is summoned telepathically from Hern - the person can die, but Robin In The Hood will live for always, hence the concept of resurrection. <br /> <br /> The music and the score are truly exceptional, and performed by the Irish band, Clannad.When I looked at it, I could not help but think about how it would be authentic Anglo-Saxon medieval folk music. :-) <br /> <br /> All this is beautifully filmed in the lush forests of Wales, which pass by The New Forrest. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that in the initial episodes of both series, the actors must overcome their own skeptic and be convinced that this is indeed a serious job. After that, they come on stage and the acting is fantastic! Michael Praed as the first Robin (the second is played by the son of Sean Connery, Jason), Judi Trott creates a beautiful and fragile red-haired Marion, Phil Rose in the role of portly friar and really kind of heart Tuck, Ray Winstone in the shoes of the bird and lover Scarlet, Clive Mantle in the role of the giant shepherd Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as the bumkin friend of Little John and his partner shepard, and Mark Ryan in the role of the ex-Hashashin / Assassin Nazir - all with great performance. Equally good are the fixed Bad Guys, Nicholas Grace as the sheriff and intriguing Sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic and bizarre companion (and Robin's half-brother, apparently) Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne. Designer Richard O'Brien is also really nice, like the evil wizard Lord Owen of Clun (Olliver Cotton) Gulnar (he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> The tenth barn of Bradford, on Avon, replaced the sheriff's castle. (Check it out on bradfordonavon.co.uk under "places of interest".) <br /> <br /> So, if you're in mythology, the Middle Ages, romance, don't waste time Xena or Hercules: that's the real thing, so get out and watch it! <br /> <br /> Alex
