For those who don't know, Asterix's books are a series of hugely successful comics about a village of indomitable Gauls that resist the invasion of Caesar thanks to a magic potion that makes them invulnerable supermen. There were several animated features (only one of these, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix really captured the intelligence and spirit of the books despite being an original screenplay) before a perfectly chosen cast, Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu played the roles main in two live action adaptations that proved to be of colossal success throughout Europe, but which made absolutely no impression in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The uncut French version is a lot of fun, but unfortunately it does not seem to be available in a version with English subtitles outside the UK DVD. While there is still no sign of a theatrical or DVD version of the United States, the Miramax version of Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatre is also on that DVD (and has played on TV UK), and you'll never guess what - it was completely resumed modified (at least 21 minutes gone) and dubbed in English. Maybe Harve took him for a Hong Kong film - after all, he never saw a foreign film he didn't think could be improved by heavy adjustments and shelving for a few years. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix Contre Cesar was lovingly nicknamed in English from a particularly good translation script by Terry Jones, but otherwise left unchanged, that sort of thing is not the Miramax way. The results are not good The film was the best attempt to get the mix of slapstick books, anachronisms and highbrow humorous classics on the screen, but many classic references have gone (like the great Raft of the Medusa sight gag or the references of Cyrano de Bergerac da Depardieu), next to everything that seems too French or could slow down the image, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real slogan. Missing several jokes for the sequences, the part of Depardieu has been cropped (his part was already rather small because of his serious health problems during the shooting: the American version was partially digitized to change the unhealthy pallor of his face in the 'original!) and, as usual, with dubbing, because the literal translations in English do not fit properly, the lines are so hasty that they are no longer funny or the dialogue has been completely changed (a couple of these changes are certainly amusing, like a character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in French and listen to words in English). <br /> <br /> It's not a total disaster, but very disappointing considering how good the full version is. It would be nice to think that Miramax would have done a Shaolin Soccer and released both versions, but since they shelved both films for two years after paying $ 45 million for them (another classic case of Harvey's chronic buyer reproach: gee , I wonder why Disney was so p **** to their disproportion) and they still have no release plans, it could just be wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> It is a real pity that such a fun and accessible film can now only be available to non-French speakers in such an awkwardly awkward version. It seems that the Gauls grays have been able to defeat Caesar's legions, but they are not up to the Miramax boot.
