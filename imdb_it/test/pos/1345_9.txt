OMG!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vibrant childhood memories of the 1970s. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula would swing on the swings, tell jokes they took from the laughter patch, dress up in costumes found in a giant crate called The Storybox and fight with an annoying pink squirrel named Sherlock who lived one of their trees. They could also play an acoustic guitar and sing a beautiful melody. This was a great show for children. Very 70s feeling. But that's the problem: they don't do shows like that anymore. Sin. It could be said that these two girls really had hearts of gold and they loved children, they were really sweet. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those shows that if they came out with a casket, people would buy it, because that's how MELLOW walks along Memory Lane.
