I always liked "DOA", 1950, with Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid, (Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and eventually discovered he was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and ended up having a night and somehow loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink that has bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems! If you like Dennis Quaid and you love Meg Ryan you'll have fun watching this movie, Meg gave an exceptional performance and kept this image worth watching!
