Skenbart takes place in the 1940s, just after the Second World War. The main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) leaves his job to have the chance to "make a difference" in the bombed post-war Europe. He packs a book by his favorite philosopher, Ludwig Witgenstein, and embarks on a journey that will ultimately prove Witgenstein's famous statement true: Nothing is what it seems. <br /> <br /> There are two main plots, and several subplots, to this film, which takes place on a train bound for Berlin. Writer / director Peter Dalle (who also played the role of train conductor) has assembled an impressive cast including Swedish legends such as Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Overall, the acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> Skenbart offers a rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with a subtler black humor (like the nun who loses her faith and starts to curse violently). It's like Killinggänget meets Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) in Schindler's List. I laughed during most of the film, and when I woke up the next morning I laughed even more. An intelligent film for Swedish comedy fans.
