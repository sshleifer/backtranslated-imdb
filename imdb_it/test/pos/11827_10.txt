This is one of the best and funniest comic series I've ever seen! All the characters are brilliant. <br /> <br /> Slatt (David Bamber) is a very irritated man, irritated by everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and manage situations in the best possible way, but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. Not supported by his wife Janet, who is just trying to get him deeper into his troubles (and he really doesn't need help!). <br /> <br /> All characters are played / portrayed brilliantly. Imagine sending your children to a school like this. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people don't like it (maybe some don't get the many word games, which are present many times per episode). <br /> <br /> It is also incredible that there is still no DVD version. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> So, please, release, forget it! So the fans will appreciate it and have fun! <br /> <br /> Try it, you might like it !!! <br /> <br /> Only a few names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Bitch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and many others).
