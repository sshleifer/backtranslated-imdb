George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard in the process. Months later, one of his associates is selling book fakes for large sums of money. One of the fakes is sold to a man who works for the Nazis. Not content with being caught, the Nazi frontman insists on getting his money back, while at the same time an investigator appears who works for one of the other scammed customers. The middle woman in an attempt to keep herself safe starts to play all sides against each other and organizes a meeting at the New York public library between the various parties, however when people start dying, the library is blocked and other murders (and perhaps some rare book theft) seems to be close to happening. Complex Mysterious Murder is a good little thriller with an exceptional cast (Saunders is joined by Richard Denning and a cast of solid supporters) If there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plot lines and all of them practically out for themselves. The layers of thefts, falsifications, murders and intrigues of wartime (this was 1942) are almost too many for the short duration of 70 minutes. It's still a little funny film with a darkness and a sense of inevitable ruin for some of the characters that distinguish it as one of the first film noir. As long as Denning arrives, we are among some fascinating thieves, we like them, perhaps even more than the hero, but it is clear from words and deeds that this will not have a happy ending, and they know it, even if they fight it. A good little movie that is worth looking for.
