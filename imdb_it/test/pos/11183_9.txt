The Curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite of the series. A vibrant visual appearance, an excellent soundtrack and a brilliant vocal cast create a memorable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> The graphics are certainly not a disappointment. Although some corners have been cut, the overall feel of the game is reminiscent of the Disney feature film animations. The gameplay is simple and even a beginner will soon take control. The game also offers a little extra for more experienced players with its Mega Monkey mode. <br /> <br /> Vocal cast is one of my favorites. The comprehensive voice of Dominic Armato makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is just as charming as Elaine. Earl Boen is an extraordinarily sinister and evil villain, LeChuck. Even the charm of the game is enhanced by memorable characters like Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my favorites Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck). My hat goes out even to the end, the great Kay Kuter and his memorable secondary role of Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> Michael Land's wonderful tropical soundtrack returns once again to the Monkey Island adventure, which includes some of the best business melodies. The game is not perfect and some places are not as detailed as others, but I had no problems with the simple ending of the game that I found very satisfying.
