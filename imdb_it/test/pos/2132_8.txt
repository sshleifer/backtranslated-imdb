Actually I liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and I think it's even better than The Deer Hunter, which has been overrated. Both this film and Year of the Dragon are very undervalued, although I could understand why someone wouldn't like this movie. At three and a half hours the film goes on too long and the second part of the film is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert but can't make up her mind which one she's going to be with. Sam Waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to kill who are said to be anarchists and thieves. There is a great cast who also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke.
