This film is a gem! It's the story of Juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning lady who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and Romuald, its president. He pays no attention to her, does not consider anyone until several plots to snatch his company from him all hit at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he finds Juliette. Like the cleaning lady, no one pays attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she's smart enough to catch and use to help her helpless and unlucky boss. <br /> <br /> I have been watching this DVD for years and to see a previous comment on its release in September 2007 has raised my hopes. Alas, I can't find a DVD, does anyone know if there is / was one?
