There is a new killer in freedom, and he is doing God's work. Yes, how not! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a brat, and Freddy Krueger looks like a rag doll against this guy. He is Jacob Goodnight (WWE's Glen "KANE" Jacobs), a 7 'monster wielding an Ax and a hook and a chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is tearing the eyeballs from the victims' sockets. This is absolutely methodical! When the meeting happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a novice policeman and mutilated the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. How the hell did Goodnight survive after 4 years? He is now in the condemned hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has a lot of stories to tell. I thought the film was scary and interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight checked one of the girl's tattoos on her back. And Goodnight himself is really unbalanced thanks to his manic mother. If you think that Friday 13 was something, it is better to think again. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat. And I think the tearing of the eyeball is chilling. This film proves it, and it was not a waste of my time. I liked it. The title does not lie! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!
