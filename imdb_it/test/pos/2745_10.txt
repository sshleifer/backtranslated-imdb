Every Saturday morning at 11am I watched Superstars. All the biggest events happening in this show at the moment. The challenge, which aired on Sunday morning, was decent, but all the great things happened on this show. The wrestlers would do all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live audience or they will talk alone on the screen in front of a background that promoted them. The games were usually pumpkins but sometimes you could see 2 squared mid carders in the main event. There were also interviews that usually led to violence creating a feud. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor and The Barber Shop. I don't remember the titles that change hands on this show. It usually happened on pay per view and Saturday Nights Main Event.
