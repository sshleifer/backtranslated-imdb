Although it's not the most technically advanced film I've ever seen, it's been a fun and entertaining couple of hours. The main characters are sweet and you really like them, and you feel something when Susie Q. has to go, but she feels good again when she comes back as Maggie. <br /> <br /> Lots of stock dialogues, and a plot artifice, but above all, VERY FUN.
