POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> No one is able to collect a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation of South Africa. Hilary Swank plays a South African exile who returns to his hometown as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is trying to escape the jail testifying before the Commission for truth and reconciliation. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Mrs. Swank makes no attempt to cover her unmistakable American accent. However she is the only well-known actor in the film and probably would not have been realized without her or someone equally well known. Does a passable job. However, Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in German with an umlat on the "u") are exceptional, like Jamie Barlett as chief of police, responsible for the murder of the companion and fellow prisoner of Mpondo. The torture scenes are shown in brief flashes, but they are vivid and believable. What is not credible is the process of truth and reconciliation, except that it actually happened. "Red Dust" should only be seen for this reason because it was and it is incredible that the ANC prisoners can actually forgive the torturers, and this is as close as possible to see the trial in action.
