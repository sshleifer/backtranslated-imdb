OK, so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but above all an interesting idea that works towards a tight ending. The acting is solid, in particular Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the central characters of this ensemble. It certainly has a screen presence and is interesting to watch. It has a low budget appearance that works for the thriller / horror genre that belongs to Four Jacks. The film does not try to take itself seriously, which adds to the general appeal. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) must be one of the most annoying characters seen on the screen by Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. It's worth adding a stack of weekend DVDs.
