Greetings still from the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates a life against all odds in this based on a true version of a man's struggle to control his destiny. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to see in his role as Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave little doubt about what's going on in his mind. Dream and fantasy sequences are not abused so they prove very effective in explaining why they want what they want. Rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question is: What is love? At every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The script is tense and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in a room. The supporting cast is wonderful and we really feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon's decision. This is a gem and deserves to be seen.
