Are you looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast? Well find this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great in this little plot. Don't forget the cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of the 60s, a touch of "Prince and the Pauper", and a hint of that local gold makes a small story.
