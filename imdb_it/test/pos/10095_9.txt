Three words: piece of art. This film is simply fantastic. It is beautiful, sad, frightening and stimulating at the same time. The soundtrack remains constantly in my head, the acting is wonderful, the scenery is scary and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was more by accident than on purpose that I saw this movie. At the time when I decided to watch this film I was just bored and I read lists of Asian films, which is probably good. Well, I saw the title "A story of two sisters" that seemed very interesting. Then I read the plot summary and decided "Don't just watch this movie, you have to buy it". No sooner said than done. I bought this movie and got caught from the first minute. <br /> <br /> The plot kept me interested from the beginning to the end; the twist towards the end of the film made me scream. I didn't really see anything like it coming. And the final scene made me cry ... it just made me cry. He was so sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot, with scary scenes and atmospheres. Although you should be aware that the ending is, as I said before, very sad. But this fits the mood of the movie perfectly, doesn't it?
