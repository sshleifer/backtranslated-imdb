I was very curious to see this release of Wajda-Depardieu, moreover the period of time is certainly fascinating. Being a fan of Wajda, I was disappointed, and this could be an understatement. The film has never taken the cinematic flight - there is no basis for the animosity between Danton and Robespierre, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script was weak (adapted from "The Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was masterful ... after all, it's Wajda! Furthermore, there were fantastic actors, BUT they never attracted the attention of the public as they should. Depardieu stands out as Dof, a bit silly and casual, not really the image we have in mind. Woijech Pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but once again the script sets limits, even the most talented actors can't collapse. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda jump out ... like Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you're familiar with Wajda, then you would know them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed with this highly praised film. Great cast, great director, but no quality base. Bad and non-dynamic script. We need to get into the mentality of Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) ... what are their motivations? Eh ... who knows? Does anyone like women, the other to dust? Riiight. Ok, so if you're looking for a great film on the French Revolution, I highly recommend "La Revolution Francaise" ... it's divided into two parts and oh-so-great! Excellent performance, in-depth script, juicy little pieces ... certainly a satisfying experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieu ... the wonderful Andrzej Seweryn seems to have taken notes from "Danton" and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre. WATCH IT! NOW! As for Wajda fans, you'll be better off with "Man of Iron / Marble", "Promised Land" and the like. Greetings!!
