I'm 13 and I'm writing this review in access to my mother. He will write his review later. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie of all time. It was shot in England in 1944. I saw it so many times when I was little that I wore the videocassette. I love this movie and it changed my life! The beautiful landscapes The powerful thoroughbred horse in bold. The simple little Irish village with the girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done competes in The Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse, The Pirate. It made me want to ride a horse (which I did for 7 years now) and learn everything I could about their breeds so that they could also draw and paint. It is a revolutionary film about winning against all odds, overcoming your fears, believing in yourself and achieving difficult goals by working very hard. Furthermore, the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and I saw many movies with horse races. I never tire of watching this movie. All is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!
