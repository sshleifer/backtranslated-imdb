I just had the opportunity to see "Nuovomondo" (until then known in the United States as "The Golden Door"), and was very impressed both by the dreamy and occasionally surreal fable of a family that emigrates from Sically in the States United in the early days of the 20th century. It also functioned as a middle finger (proverbial) embedded in the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably up to the third shin), depicting the mistreatment of foreigners who only want a better life than they were receiving from their original motherland. The cast (mostly) Italian, with few exceptions, works well. This is a quiet and simple film that is beautiful to look at (the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure), while the script is well written. This is a movie for those who are sick and tired of brainless loopholes from Hollywood that need little more than sell popcorn (not that I have problems with burning popcorn, mind you! --- I love things). You'd better find Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or whatever it's called in your area).
