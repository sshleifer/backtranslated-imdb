The Elegant Documentary - <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie ... if you're a physics and selfish student. This much less than a percent (tiny fraction) of the population might find that this show only tells them what they have already learned and already know. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! - If you are one of the massive people who fall into more than 99% of the population that does not study or already has a solid understanding of the theories of physics including Relativity, Quantum, String and M-theory. <br /> <br /> That brilliantly concocted documentary. Starting with a useful historical background you will be guided step by step elegantly in a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. I've always had a huge appreciation of mathematics. This film can easily give you an idea of ​​what a math of an exquisitely beautiful language is without making you feel like you are not able to pass the grade. <br /> <br /> The show is repetitive at times, since the original format was a mini-series divided into three shows. It therefore makes sense to give us courteous reminders of the principles presented. I found this immensely useful as it continued to remind me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this wonderful tapestry of our very existence. <br /> <br /> We are all (and all that surrounds us) is the vibratory energy with a natural tendency to harmony. This film can blow your mind - or at least help you understand that the universe is much bigger than what we see around us (even with the Hubble telescope) and much smaller than the protons and neutrons inside the atoms of where we learned about High School. The theory of M contains many magnificent "possibilities". <br /> <br /> It seemed so appropriate that all this elegance should be moved by nature (admitted by the many brilliant scientists who present it) out of the realm of Science and into the realm of Philosophy. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be religious at all to feel like this movie has taken you one step closer to God. <br /> <br /> Good Brian Greene. Well done indeed. <br /> <br /> P.S. If you are interested in feeling even more at ease and at ease in your place in the Universe and would like to have a more in-depth view of the "possibilities" Quantum mechanics combined with Spirituality (of all things) can lead to you then I highly recommend look also "What Bleep!? - Down the Rabbit Hole". Yes, I know they make some stupid mistakes by suggesting that a Shaman may not be able to see a boat if he has never seen one (my eyes work out the reflections of light just fine - I see things every day that I've never seen before ) and brain cells are cells of the body that do not actually divide. But if you can overcome these small obstacles and put down the things you don't like and hang onto what you do - there's a lot to appreciate in this movie. <br /> <br /> Then watch "The Secret" (2006 documentary on The Law of Attraction - search for the IMDb title "tt0846789"). This information could change your life deeply - forever. If you look more deeply, you may even find that the Universe is talking to us with thought (if you listen) - and some are - and this is really incredible. There is a modern day Jesus / Muhammad / Buddha (those, among others, that history suggests to have communicated with the non-physical) I live today and she lives in Texas. I know some of you know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> I don't consider myself religious for any traditional definition, but I have never felt more comfortable or at ease in the Universe as I do now.
