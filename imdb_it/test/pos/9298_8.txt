Let's face it, Australian TV is mostly terrible, but this is a real rough diamond that there are not enough people watching. The Chaser crew that makes the satirical newspaper and the CNNN try something new by mixing live comedies, pre-recorded sketches and political satire in a show filmed in front of a live audience, like Rove, but fun. They like to stir up controversy and this causes some of the funniest moments, especially Chris who tells his wife of "f-off" live on television and Julian gives a novelty check signed by Saddam Heusein to the head of the AWB. It must be one of Australia's most entertaining shows from the Micallef program.
