I just saw this movie again, I think for the sixth time. I will certainly see it many other times. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director Gilles Mimouni. For ten years he did not make another film, and this was his only one. The plot and execution of this brilliant film are perfect and they clearly pay homage to Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The timing of the movements is controlled with the same caution as the scene in which the side of a house falls on Keaton in "Steamboat Bill Junior", and is not killed for only a few centimeters. In this film, people lower and turn and inadvertently pass each other, and if they were a second away, they would have clashed. The plot thus walks on the razor's edge of random events so intensely that you can't look away from the screen even for a millisecond, or you'll miss something crucial. Peter Chase's disturbing, though intentionally repetitive, music is reminiscent of Hitchcock's "Vertigo", and the whole film has the same disturbing quality, but while Hitchcock had a woman and two women, Mimouni has two women and a woman, thus reversing the plot. are references that pass to other Hitchcock films, but it is "Vertigo" that is central to the inspiration of this film. The theme may seem superficially an obsessive love, but the film really talks about the magic of everyday casual events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is over-loaded with passionate love and desire, but desire transcends its object and struggles for something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when it is realized that it is Alice who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is finally "made" by Romane Bohringer. It's so fascinating that she overshadows Monica Bellucci, who is really something to pull off, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, while Bohringer is what English calls "simple". However, even in this first date Romane Bohringer had more than mastering the art of "domination of personality", so beautiful girls fall into oblivion and do not stand out because Romane is so charming that you can't take your eyes off her even look at pretty girls, and you just end up thinking about her. Many of us remember, I'm sure, his father Richard Bohringer lying in a bathtub listening to the work in the film 'Diva' many years ago. I prefer to look at Romane rather than Richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be a genetic secret to being charming, because Richard Bohringer is also fascinating and not even a woman. Romane seems to be able to turn into Anna Magnani when she is much older, and that means she will get an Oscar if someone can only write another "pink tattoo" for her. The girl has so much passion inside her, she could set the Senna on fire. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy joined? This film made excellent use of Paris locations. But where is this "Luxembourg Square"? It looked like Place Furstenburg for me. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the film six more times, just to study the accuracy of the times and who goes beyond those, and make sure I understand correctly. The whole thing is like ten giant simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a great master. What a thrill it is! Roman, you can watch from my window at any time! Mimouni, come on, we discuss impossibility, improbability, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is happening is invisible and how it affects the visible. And once again, we have here the spirit of Breton's novel "Nadja" embodied in a great French work of art. More! More! More!
