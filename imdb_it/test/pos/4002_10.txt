Wow, what a wonderful film production! Mr. Im did it again! <br /> <br /> His latest work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great movie, but this one is even bigger. Selected as an official feature film at the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year series, this 66-year-old director is improving more and more in what he is doing with a Korean culture. <br /> <br /> Simply, Chihwaseon speaks of a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up', considered a prodigy in the late nineteenth century. The basic story of this film tells the life of Jang, Seung-up and the historical background of his time. He was an orphan, but in his adolescence, he was picked up by a nobleman, named Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr. Kim becomes a mentor of Jang, as well as a lifelong friendship, and he continues to support his great talent that he knew in the first place. With Jang's great effort and natural talent, his fame grows faster and faster as the strength of his country, Korea falls. <br /> <br /> Jang's personality portrayed in the film is very complicated and one of the best actors in Korea, Choi, Min-sik enters Jang's soul. Suffering eyes reveal the struggle of a great artist's life. Sometimes he is very serious, but suddenly he turns into a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with courtesans at any time. Also, he said in the film, "without alcohol and a woman, I can't draw. (An alcohol and women are my only inspirations)" In the height of fame, to develop his style, he travels all around the country, and not never renounces his pride as an artist for authority or money. I don't want to give all the details, but I think you definitely had some idea about the movie. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing about this film is cinematography. It is so breathtaking how they have captured every beauty of the landscapes. Yes, every scene is like a work of Jang's painting. And the script is perfect too. It mainly deals with a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist. For example, Kim advises Jang in the film that "before a brush is held, a purpose must be set in life". This is a very moving and stimulating line, and there are many others. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie if you go to the Canne Festival. <br /> <br /> Chihwasun will be the biggest film ever made that deals with the life of a painter in the history of cinema.
