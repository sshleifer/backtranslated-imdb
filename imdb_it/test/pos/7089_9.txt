"One True Thing" is the genre of films in which the audience is inspired by performances of great inspiration. I am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting, because it is not. In fact, the film is downright depressing. I'm trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd. <br /> <br /> I cried in "One True Thing", enough to conclude that this is one of the most exciting powerful films of 1998. The characters were perfectly cast. The shows are all guaranteed nominated to the Oscar, in particular Meryl Streep, who portrays Kate's death very well. Her acting alone was enough to make the film excellent to the point of recommendation, and offers you a new perspective on her. I also thought that Renée Zellweger portrayed a realistic, single-free-wheeling woman, who must take care of her mother. The other cast members, including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott, were also superb. The script of this film was really fantastic. It's pretty funny how the concept of the film has to do with controversial events in my area. You see, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and right now a big problem here is the suicide of doctor Jack Kavorkian (sorry for my spelling mistake if that were so) the ways have just been outlawed. The public will vote on this according to their beliefs in November After seeing "One True Thing" it really changed my perspective on this topic, even though I always believed in it. Without revealing the end of the film, I will simply say that suicide is a distant topic in this film and I think it fits perfectly into the wonderful story. Overall, this film really has a more emotional impact than "Titanic", "Save Private Ryan" or any other tear-jerky published in recent years. I think it's because the main idea of ​​this film is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it better refers to an audience. And indeed, this could happen to you.
