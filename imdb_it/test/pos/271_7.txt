The third entry in the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three obscure sequels made for TV are incredibly dark and difficult to track down, while the original remake of the 70s and the blockbuster with Nicole Kidman are known and very popular. I did not see either the early 80s "Stepford Wives' Revenge" or the "90s" The Stepford Husbands ", but this" The Stepford Children "is a very charming and very funny little movie. It is practically the same film as the original; obviously less mysterious but much more cheesante and incredibly eighty to the nth degree. The main difference here, as the title suggests, is that not only the liberated wives, but also the rebellious and punk adolescent descendants of the city suffer the typical and highly effective "Stepford treatment", licensed by the local men's association. For some reason the scenario tries to defend Stepford's mystery until late in the movie, although no one is able to witness this sequel until you've checked the original and presumably everyone also knows about the episode. The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the frightening city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. In particular, Father Steven is excited about their new life because he has already lived in Stepford and has always wanted to return since his first wife, whose new wife Laura and teenage sons Mary and David know very little, died under circumstances mysterious. The city is almost too perfect, with picturesque neighbors and model students, and above all modern youth face enormous difficulties in adaptation. Their efforts to modernize the place and bring local Stanford youth in tow cause clashes with prominent citizens, particularly members of the Men's Association, and stress family relationships. David meets and falls in love with the latest "normal" Lois school girl, but when she too turns into a household puppet overnight, David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate Stanford's sinister secret. The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is at a slow and rather domesticated pace, but the ending is as trashy and shoddy as the VHS cover and, as indeed, should be like a 80s thriller. The modus operandi behind the secrets of Stanford is illustrated in more detail, and I think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate it. At least, I did it. The overall plot does not yet make much sense and the script is chock full of irrational aspects, but it is still a catchy formula and undoubtedly the one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear. Acting performances are far above average. Above all the arrogant and obnoxious members of the Men's Association portray plausible characters, and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff offer impressive shows. Recommended without hesitation!
