The second (non-animated) film about the only people who still refuses to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more exhilarating than the first film "Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar". <br /> <br /> Where the first movie got all the laughs because all the cartoon characters have been so perfectly brought to life without losing their Cartoon-like identity, this sequel (which is a separate story like all comics) is even better. Of course, all the ingredients you find in the first film and in the comics are present again: Obelix is ​​still dying to enjoy the "magic potion" that gives the other members of his tribe such enormous powers, Caesar and the rest of the Roman 'Empire is still the number 1 enemy, but some new and refreshing elements have been brought to the stage. <br /> <br /> Not only is it set in a very idyllic way (the most important part is obviously in Egypt), but rather than repeating film number one, some extras have been added making all kinds of references to other films ( Bruce Lee etc.). It's not all very new, but the unexpected combination of the known comic story (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to things that have absolutely nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix really works. <Br /> <br /> In this way the film develops further on a tradition of comic book authors Goscinny and Uderzo who did not hesitate to take Laurel and Hardy on stage and even devote an entire story to Kirk Douglas. <br /> <br /> If all this didn't convince you to watch this movie, I'm sure Monica Bellucci will play Cleopatra ....
