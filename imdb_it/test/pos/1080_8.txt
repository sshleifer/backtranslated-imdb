I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2004. Since I work in the wine industry, I was quite anxious to see this documentary, and I wasn't disappointed. According to news from more than 500 hours of filming, the good news is that Nossiter will release not only a theatrical cut, but a series of ten parts in ten hours of the DVD movie by next Christmas (ThinkFilm will distribute it). The bad news is that it's still a bit of a bulky beast. When it was shown at Cannes, it was almost three hours long. For Toronto, he cut about half an hour, but is still timed to 135 minutes. Now, for me, it's fine. I love wine and I love listening to the controversies that are raging in my business. But not everyone wants that much. <br /> <br /> Nossiter is unleashed all over the world, from Brazil to France, from California to Italy, to Argentina, speaking with winemakers and professionals, consultants and critics on the state of the wine world. The theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of wine critic Robert Parker are forcing a sort of identity on wine. Small local producers are bought by large conglomerates (American and local), or are pressured by market forces to change their wines to satisfy the palate of Mr. Parker, who dictates the taste of most Americans (and the world) markets. <br /> <br /> It's a complicated subject, and I can understand why Nossiter wants his subjects to talk. There is Robert Mondavi, the Napa wine industry patriarch, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc have faced opposition from local vigneron and government officials. Aim√© Guibert, founder and winemaker of Daumas Gassac, iconoclastic adversary of Mondavi's plans and crusader of wines expressing local terror. There is the same Robert Parker, who expresses a certain unease about his influence by refusing to stop writing about his favorite wines. There is a "flying wine producer" Michel Rolland, consultant to dozens of wineries around the world, who advise them to produce Parker-friendly wines. There are many more fascinating personalities in this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you will want to look for the ten-part series and theatrical version of this film. But even if you're not into wine, the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the world's oldest and most established traditions. The effects on cultures and local economies cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
