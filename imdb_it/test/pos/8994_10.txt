I wanted to see this movie since the previews came out. I don't understand why everyone is so tough in this movie. It may not be technically true for the sport of rugby, but this film is not primarily about sport. It is a rugby team that is taught to be more than the world expects from them. He is taught to become men, and not temporarily vain boys. Hollywood is never 100% correct in their productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something funny. The story of Coach Gelwix and what it has taught over the years is simply incredible. He teaches about service, honor, integrity and moral cleanliness. How many other films are they teaching our young people these days? I was proud to see such an incredible story that taught reverence and respect.
