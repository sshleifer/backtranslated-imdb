The quality of the animation here is decidedly lower than IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't. <br /> <br /> This might seem fussy, but considering that the city of Olympus is populated almost exclusively by living machines, would you feel comfortable there as a human being? Would any machine have so effectively emulated human arrogance, myopia and greed? I doubt it. There are some indications on this in the film, but only when the team can be disturbed to insert them, on the whole the "bioroids" (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with the human characters. It looks sloppy for me. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to have some sort of emotional entanglement, even if there is no light on this. Little light pours into the background, a real pity. The short duration of the film, combined with the focus on mecha and crime, means that we don't see any depth of character. The basic work is all down, yet there is no finished product left. A cropped version of this OAV would have made a great television episode, once some character sub-frames had been established. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are the drawings of the mecha and the action / espionage. <Br /> <br /> Defects really begin to be felt once you've had the chance to digest everything that happens, so I couldn't recommend it for owning it, but it's certainly worth watching it or two! Although this review is mostly negative, I really think it's worth spending some time on it, but it's not something to rush and buy. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: a weaseable, watchable opportunity.
