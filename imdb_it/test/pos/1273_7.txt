If Christopher Nolan had realized Memento before following, all the defects below would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan built the switches perfectly over time. We were able to tell when the past was, when it is current, etc. However, Nolan has experimented a little and does not work. Although he had a limited budget and could not use color (which is a way Memento worked), it was too difficult to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a function that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I was going to write my review after looking at it, so I hope it made more sense, but obviously it didn't work. <br /> <br /> You can't blame Nolan for not having invented original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow people randomly on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), which particularly interests him. Soon, Bill becomes Cobb's friend and goes with him as he breaks into the houses and robs them. Then, a pert young blond (Lucy Russell) enters, and the film gets even stranger from there. <br /> <br /> The Following finale is one of the most shocking endings I've seen. Of course, the Fight Club had a surprising ending, but the way in which the finale of the Following took place was surprising. I felt like someone hit me in the head and gave me a concussion. Nolan has one thing to make good endings (well, maybe not, I could guess the insomnia a mile away) and can really build a great story. Following may not be the easiest to follow or watch, but it's such a finely original story, with a shocking ending that you'll probably want to still watch all of its 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Vote R for the language and a bit of violence.
