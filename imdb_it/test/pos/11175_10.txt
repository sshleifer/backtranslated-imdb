First I played the second island of monkeys, and I liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound. Then, a few months later, I discovered that a new game had been made. I tried it and loved it. The first thing you notice is the great graphics. The areas are huge, colorful and detailed, with a lot to explore. The game requires you to use your brain, a lot, as always. The game is challenging, with all point and click games frustrating. The jokes have not aged a third time. Even the animated scenes are a great addition to the game. This is the best MI game out there, maybe even the best P&C game! If you like comic games that play like a movie, take this game!
