"The Honkers" is probably the best performance of Slim Pickens of all time. When we were shooting, everyone who connected with the production thought that Slim was an Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond photo out at the same time and didn't pay much attention to "The Honkers". I personally think that this film has been underestimated by most critics. "Junior Bonner" by Sam Peckinpaw was released at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Furthermore, Cliff Robertson released a rodeo a few months before our release and this may have hurt us too. The photo deserves to be seen, if only for the video of the rodeo, one of the best ever shot, shot by James Crabbe. The director and my co-writer, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the photo was published, cutting off a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife Sally, his daughter, Gaby and their newborn son, Stefan. Please give this movie a shot. I bet you say it was worth it. I thank everyone who has taken the time to read this. Stephen Lodge
