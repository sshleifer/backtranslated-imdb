at least for me. and rather unexpected - as a subject. a film that challenges your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. that helps you see the world, we live through a lens - or a multitude of goals ... a moving, surprising and haunting film. <br /> <br /> and benefit from one of the best performances ever Kevin Spacey. very well detached from Jeff Bridges. there is no false note in this tango. it's a perfect dance. perfect 'to the end. <br /> <br /> What does the ending reveal? well ... anything you want ... <br /> <br /> a movie you'll want to see again. maybe not right away. maybe after a few days. months. years. but it's something to go to - or come back to -.
