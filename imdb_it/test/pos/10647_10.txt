Based on real facts from 1905, the silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an imperial Russian ship in which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by the condition of the ship, the citizens of the port city of Odessa gather to support the mutineers - and consequently find themselves at the mercy of the imperial forces, which attack civilian supporters with wild force. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and achieves its incredible power by showing the clash between groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily displayed and modified. Surprisingly, each of these sequences succeeds in overcoming the previous one, and the film actually takes power as it passes from mutiny to the citizen's demonstration to the massacre on the Odessa steps - the last of which is among the most famous sequences of the whole cinema history. Turning largely where the real events occurred, the vision of the director Eisenstein is extraordinary as he builds - not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment in each sequence - some of the most memorable images ever made for cinema. <br /> <br /> Describing POTEMKIN as a great film is an understatement. It is an essential absolute, an absolute necessity for anyone seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, rarely equaled, never beaten. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
