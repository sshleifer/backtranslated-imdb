This era was not only the dawn of sound in cartoons, but of a cartoon character who would go down in history as the most famous mouse in the world. Yes, Mickey makes his debut here, in this happy life story aboard a steamer. The animation is good for his time, and the plot - although a little simple - is quite cheerful. A true classic, and if you ever see it on video, you won't regret it.
