'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination doesn't really matter. In my opinion, this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images that other things do not really matter if they do not distract us. In fact, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Let's start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. The way it works exactly doesn't really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientists including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe this method could work. Catherine enters the boy's mind and talks to him there, in a world completely created by the boy. He hopes you can let him do things that will ultimately work. <br /> <br /> The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just downloaded the body of one of his victims. FBI agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are in this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that moment, after a forensic research on the downloaded body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur 1. Carl has just entered a coma; he was ill for a long time. 2. His house and home with his last kidnapped victim are not in the same place. In a sense this part of the story is pretty standard. <br /> <br /> Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine must enter Carl's mind. This is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Carl is an unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts to believe that Carl's mind is the real world, then her mind can convince her body; she could die in Carl's mind. A tape on how the last victim was killed, a fate that this girl will have in about twenty hours, ensures that Catherine will try to get the position out of Carl's mind. <br /> <br /> It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth seeing. The director Tarsem Singh, who made music videos before this, in a sense returns to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists from beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style seemed completely new, the way "Three Kings" had a new visual style a year earlier. If something like this can make you look like a movie, "The Cell" won't disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can still appreciate this movie. The story itself, without the big fantasy world, is pretty good for that. I think you need to be a little open, obviously events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very funny movie with nice ideas that looks fantastic.
