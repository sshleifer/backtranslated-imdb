"Let me ask you another question" Ha! how nice soon ... this movie was a fantastic acting, a fantastic script. The only reason no one noticed that it was because of the low budget everyone agrees with me that it's a cult like "Donnie Brasco" that shows a young Joe Pesci once again as a gangster, this movie is their with the seven. he had some sopranos and some good friends had his idea for the sopranos when he saw this and Scorsese found Joe Pesci watching him, which shows that he must be great I am right or wrong 'eh? I have to admit that they showed a brilliant scene in which they were throwing peanuts at a field pianist "Stop with peanuts".
