There is a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to adapt the film around the character of a star, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprisingly, Ford considered all of these as favorites of one kind or another. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of cute cowpokes come together to drive a Mormon train to a valley in Arizona territory. Along the way they are joined for the first time by a group of players left on the ground by a medical show and then by a family of runaway outlaws named Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot. <br /> <br /> Had Wagonmaster was also made 10 years earlier, with the strength of the two interpretations presented by Johnson and Carey, both would probably have had a substantial career as an image cowboy. art to imitate life. Johnson was a true rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a series of horses for John Ford to use in Fort Apache. Ford was impressed by his presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But the day of the western B was ending and Johnson and Carey had great careers as two good actors. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs' Mormon leader. Bond is a recent converter and has difficulty remembering not to use some four-letter words. But he is the leader for his strength of character, not for his impeccable theology of the Church. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. <br /> <br /> In portraying the Cleggs, Ford only had to go back four years to his My Darling Clementine. I am the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who after Clementine refused to work for Ford, would have been willing to see him interpreted by Shiloh Clegg the breadwinner. Given that Charles Kemper did a great job, this is probably the role for which he is best known. Shortly after this film was made, Kemper was killed in a car accident. He could very well have worked for Ford in the future. <br /> <br /> Ford here makes Mormon pacifists and I don't remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. However it works here, the idea is that these people who do not carry weapons are innocent when dealing with evil people like the Cleggs. It takes some cowboy rifles to dispose of them properly. I think this post World War II film is trying to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another reporting from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray who plays the same kind of role he did there as head of the medical show company. Part of that troupe is Joanne Dru, who is doing another round as a woman of elastic virtues, just like in Red River. Dru used to do so many westerns that she wanted to be out of gingham and some modern fashions. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I'm willing to bet in Utah, it's a very popular movie.
