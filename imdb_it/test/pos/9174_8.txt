Hitch is a light comedy that will entertain you with beautiful interpretations. Will Smith will perform a believable performance as a Date Doctor cloak and dagger that must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. Smith was excellent, he never broke it too much. <br /> <br /> The best acting piece goes to the actor (I don't know the name) who plays this accountant who fell for this woman who is out of her league. This actor did a great job developing the character while listening to Smith's directions, but in the end, it can't be what it really is. <br /> <br /> And in the end, this is the main message of this film. Be who you are in love and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive woman and the Doctor of the Date savors his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman. I don't know her name, but she was very pretty too. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a delightful and light film that is definitely worth seeing.
