Although it is not exactly a comedy in the usual sense, this is more rewarding than any film full of laughter but lacking in substance. I don't think Bergman's films can be easily classified into restricted genres, even the lightest ones are rather complex. This film, despite its light touch, poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames begin to die, etc. I don't really communicate personally with all these problems, as I'm sure others do. But the atmosphere of the film is extraordinary, I almost wish you no end. I have to admit to having been swept away by the Bergman of the fifties, having known most of his last and revolutionary efforts. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman etc. The master has produced some of the richest, warmest and most touching films I've ever seen. Although it is a long shot, I saw this kind of love for mankind, in its complexity, only in Fellini's films of the same period. A Lesson in Love alongside Smiles of a Summer Night is worth seeing for Bergman fans, having the complete image of man's abilities and for those who love cinema with a heart. May she rest in peace!
