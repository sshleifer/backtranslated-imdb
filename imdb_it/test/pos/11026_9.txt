There are many things to admire about this film, but the thing that made me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse, the kind of role that Hollywood loves and romanticizes but that here is absolutely convincing and different from any character that I met in the film or in life. Also a very convincing and disturbing representation of Tourete syndrome
