OK, first of all, if you're not a fan of the low budget horror genre, don't worry about it. You really need to be a fan to get the gag. <br /> <br /> The move is basically about snakes ... in a train. Many of them. <br /> <br /> There is an ancient curse and a crazy ending that won't hurt. The effect of blood is full and real icky ... but the film is mainly a great gag gag on snakes that frighten to death a group of people trapped on a train. <br /> <br /> The suspense is built well there are some memorable and well composed scenes .. some of the acting are a bit "hammy" (look at the surf guys) but this is not really the point ... Check out this movie. Know what to expect and you won't regret it!
