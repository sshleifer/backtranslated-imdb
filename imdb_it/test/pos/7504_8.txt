Another black comedy that won an Oscar for best screenplay. Played by George C Scott, this redefines the phrase "snatch a new hole from $$". In this case, the goal is America's Medicare and the large hospital system. Throughout the hospital, patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are changed. Scott roars, screams and blows his workers and bosses as they fail more and more. His comment on Dachau to one of his many leaders is sure to arouse laughter. He even beat and raped a hippie three times. This is one that must be seen and heard as monologues and soliloquies are the key points of the film.
