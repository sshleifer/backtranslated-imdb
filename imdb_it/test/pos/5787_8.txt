The End of Suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming "peak" of world oil supply. As the world population grows, the demand for oil and energy also increases. As we extract oil and energy, we come to a "peak" in production. The more oil is required, the less oil is generated. The inevitable result is conflict and major changes. <br /> <br /> This film will be disturbing and alarming if you are new to the subject. You can react at first with anger and rejection because the implications are bleak. Viewing should be required. Beyond politics, beyond optimism, mathematics is undeniable. <br /> <br /> The periphery is the focal point, because our suburban areas of life will be the most affected communities when the price of energy will skyrocket. While intuitive logic would say that big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis, the widespread nature of suburbs will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our transport vehicles. <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a topic of discussion for the survivors and the madmen of the woods. This problem will be at hand sooner than we think. This film is a lucid and consistent appearance.
