On June 14, 1905, during the Russian revolution of that year, the sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated by the second-level treatment they receive, and in particular from the worm-infested meat they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the influential Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decides that the time is ripe for a Revolution. And so begins the moving classic of the Russian propaganda of Sergei M. Eisenstein, "Bronenosets Potyomkin / The battleship Potemkin." <br /> <br /> The film itself is overflowing with shining examples of breathtaking visual images: the spectacles of a destroyed captain dangling delicately from the lateral rope on which he had been thrown; the corpse of a deceased mutine lies peacefully on the shore, with the sign on its chest that reads "KILLED FOR A SOUTHERN BOWL"; close shots of the clenched fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the Tsarist regime; a rebel caravan career along Odessa Steps while desperate onlookers watch with bated breath (this scene was memorably "borrowed" by Brian De Palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his "The Untouchables"); the canons of numerous canons are threateningly turned towards the battleship Potemkin, far more numerous. <br /> <br /> However, is the film itself best analyzed? not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes? but as a single film, and, indeed, every scene is extremely memorable. Although divided into five quite distinct chapters, the entire film flows forward wonderfully; at no time do we find ourselves losing interest, and we are absolutely never in doubt as to who we should be in solidarity. <br /> <br /> The film is often referred to as "propaganda", which is exactly what it is, but this does not necessarily have a negative connotation. 'The battleship Potemkin' was produced by Eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and it perfectly accomplished it in every way. Designed by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the failed Revolution of 1905, "Potemkin" was planned to be a popular film in his home country, which symbolized the revitalization of the Russian arts after the Revolution. It is a bit unfortunate, therefore, that Eisenstein's film did not work well at the Russian box office, which was beaten by Allan Dwan's 1922 Robin Hood movie in its opening week and ran for only four weeks. Fortunately, despite having been banned on various occasions in various countries, "The battleship Potemkin" has gone more admirably abroad. <br /> <br /> The film turned out to be a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test his "editing" theories. Through the rapid assembly and the distant shots of the multitudes of extras, the public is not allowed to sympathize with individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein briefly breaks this mold, however, in a scene in which Vakulinchuk escapes from the ship's officer who is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the famous Odessa footstep sequence, while our heart beats for the horror of life of the unfortunate child in the rolling wheelchair. The soundtrack that accompanies the version I saw, largely with the orchestral works of Dmitri Shostakovich, served wonderfully to increase the emotional impact of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest films of the era of silence, "The Battleship Potemkin" is a triumph of phenomenal film production, and is a significant slice of film history. The film's highly exaggerated events (including the other things, there has never been any violent massacre in Odessa Steps) they have become so completely etched in memory, that we are often uncertain about the true story behind the events represented. This is a great achievement.
