<br /> <br /> Crackerjack, with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy - both part of the cast in the early 1990s in the Saturday night comedy "The Late Show", Bill Hunter, an icon of Australian cinema and John Clarke, that we still regularly see Australian TV with Brian Dawe. <br /> <br /> Crackerjack, losely talks about a 30-year-old boy (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who pays his annual participation in the local bowling club to get some parking for which he uses himself and rents the others as parking in the city center. <br /> <br /> The club falls in difficult times and puts together all the resources and all the memebers possible, Jack receives a phone call telling him to show up at the bowling game next Saturday or to lose his registration (and in particular its parking). <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the rest, but the film is fun, light and contains everything a good Australian film should be. <br /> <br /> If you are not Australian, then some jokes and humor will surely confuse you, if you are an Australian - do yourself a favor and sit down at Crackerjack .. It's now available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Impressive shot! <br /> <br />
