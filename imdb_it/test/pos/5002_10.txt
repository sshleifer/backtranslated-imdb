"Who dreams? Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about the * theater *!" [Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing beats a great theatrical show ... nothing! And Harry Crystal lives this belief. A stage actor still waiting for his big break, Harry brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but didn't know until he he met Harry). <br /> <br /> With scenes and songs from many of the classic American musicals ... Those lips, those eyes convey both the ups and downs of the people who, for 2 hours, take us to a fantastic land, but who succeed to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long! <br /> <br /> Like Artie ... once you saw those lips, those eyes ... "You're hooked, boy!" [Harry Crystal]
