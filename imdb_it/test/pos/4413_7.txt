Snap, crack, pop! The grinding sound of every change in the corner of the camera. And this not to mention the white flashes and the terminations cut out for almost every sentence pronounced. What the hell were they doing in the editing room? Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Surely not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all its technical shortcomings, this is an interesting film that describes a day in the life of Joe, a hustler, determined to earn $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is as exceptional as the cheerful, passive, relaxed young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talk while listening with a faraway look in his eyes. <br /> <br /> the story is meager and sketchy, documenting the uncertain life led by a man who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and child. One thing is certain, Joe is uninhibited when it comes to undressing for sex or posing for an artist. Understandably so, because it has a beautiful face and an equally beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film that is extraordinarily effective. There is no sound, no dialogue. Joe, completely naked, crouches on the floor and sends cake crumbs to his little baby. There is a beautiful serenity and tenderness captured in these quiet moments. Another scene of fun interest is one in which Joe desperately searches for a loan of $ 100 from a friend of the gym, going so far as to ask in a very tortuous approach. <br /> <br /> Joe tries to seem interested but hesitates in his conversation when an artist gives him a non-stop resume of Greek and Roman art. It is preliminary to another occasion where Joe strips himself of his clothes and stands as the discus in pure classical style. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film we have the impression of knowing Joe quite well. After all he discovered more of his soul.
