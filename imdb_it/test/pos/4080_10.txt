If you're interested in learning more about this kind of thing happening in modern civilization, there's an excellent book called "Outlaw Seas" or "The Outlaw Sea", and describes, story by story, how these things happen. The illegality of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One, many of the world's merchant ships are of questionable record (nationality) and it is difficult to fail to enforce international laws when ship owners do not have an office in a real country. Two, many lines of ships employ crews from poor third world countries. The crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into conforming to questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also among the crew members themselves. The crew is rewarded for their conformity and their silence. Four, once an illegal act has been committed, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a new coat of paint. However, it is a fascinating read. <br /> <br /> Horrible story, excellent movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important films? Hollywood has trouble releasing enough Oscar-worthy films in a given year, so that many of the top 5 contenders usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I really liked the perfidious performance of Sean Pertwee. I too, as usual, loved Omar Epps.
