This is another one of those films that I remember being up late to watch on TV, scaring the hell out of me around the age of 12 or so and making myself after a life of obsession with horror movie. This is a GREAT film, and it is living proof that realistic effects existed before the CGI. <br /> <br /> Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version almost seems to take up where the original version was (The Thing From another world). American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base a few miles away. Everyone died and only the half-charred remains of something unidentifiable left to smoke outside the complex could offer answers to what might have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing is dissolved and extinguished, not only by killing anyone and anything that crosses its path, but also by absorbing them, making themselves into anyone and whatever they wish. The film then turns into a brilliant piece of paranoia. Everyone is suspicious, anyone can be The Thing, and nobody trusts anyone. The strength and security is over when humans unite despite their differences to fight a monster. Group splinters and fear are dominant. Who's the thing? <br /> <br /> The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messianically realistic. I could have done without the dogs opening like a banana peel, but this is only the lover of animals who is finicky: killing all the humans you want, but leaving only the puppies and the puppies. Mental health and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, human beings are absorbed by the shape-shifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat is inside, and it's scarier because it can't be seen or detected easily. When he is forced to hide, it is a huge anger and the results are horrible. <br /> <br /> This is one of Carpenters' best films, right there with The Fog and Halloween. All actors give strong and realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful as to be their main character. This film has something for every lover of the horror genre. Not to be missed.
