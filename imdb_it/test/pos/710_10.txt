i love to watch Jericho millet. I mean, watching Peter Peter run for the mile is like watching a 100 meter wind. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and should make another running film. he is lightning fast and has great energy and can run a mile in less than 4 minutes and that my friend is incredible. no man alive can outside the rain race Murphy want to say that the man runs 80 miles a week no one does it except him. I have looked at Jericho's mile hundreds of times and will look at him 100 more. big movies are watched more than movies that are not. I thank the creators of this film for giving years of life to make it. They are fantastic people and I bless them all. Thank you for letting me get my word back thanks to all of you.
