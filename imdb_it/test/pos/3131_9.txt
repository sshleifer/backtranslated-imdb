It was recorded that John Ford made the films "big, blockbuster" so that he could afford to make the "little" movies he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his little films. Position shooting, floats, intricate work with horses and the inclusion of Indian plains are all Ford's trademarks. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great influence of the Russian director is seen in this film. The supporting cast, including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell, is excellent as are the many minor character actors used by Ford, including his brother (the one who plays the drums). While Ben Johnson won a well-deserved Oscar for supporting The Last Picture Show, his co-star, Harry Carey, Jr. did not reach those heights. Although his father, Carey, Sr. became a Western protagonist in Ford's early films, Carey, Jr. spent most of his career in secondary roles. For John Ford fans, and fans of western movies, this is a must.
