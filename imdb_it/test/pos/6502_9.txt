Wow - most of the audience seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary of pure magic on the screen. <br /> <br /> The transition from the early days as a black-American phenomenon based in New York to the present day as a racially diverse subculture (and largely based on the West Coast) are well profiled. <br /> <br /> The humble turntable has no respect for any traditional musical instrument, but can be much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs take the skills required for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among the others - and apply them to a new technology with many more variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qbert's comment that he imagines what "music" must sound like on advanced planets and then solving it, seemingly silly at first, makes more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create! <br /> <br /> Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain "stars" and wastes the opportunity to define the broader hip-hop culture. One movie at a time people!
