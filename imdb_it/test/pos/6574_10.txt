Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses his parents and other family members in a terrible car accident. He begins to live alone as an independent woman without receiving any help from his relatives. He has a boy named Rahul (Anuj) and is about to marry him, but retires due to the behavior of his future mother-in-law and the lack of trust shown by her boyfriend. Anand (Raja) joins his neighborhood. And it begins to make Roopa feel comfortable and safe. The rest of the story is about why Anand - MD of AP's richest corporate house - chose to reside as a neighbor of Roopa and what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This film has a freshness that rarely seen in Indian films to it. Even if the story progresses slowly, you have a sense of familiarity with it. Congratulations to the director shekhar kammula for such a fantastic direction! Brilliant soundtrack and background composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan adds to the quality. Kamalini mukherjee like Rupa gave a wonderful performance. I think it was the best choice for this role thanks to its non-glamorous looks and its incredible histrionics. Anand as Raja did well too. I saw this movie three times and loved it every time. It's a class apart from the daily dose of action movies we get here. Highly recommended!!
