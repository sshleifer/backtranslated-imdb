Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. He really performs this, beating to the right and left comedian comic Tom Dobbs. From the previous it looked like it would be a festive laugh. And it was fun. But there were many serious parts in the film that I didn't expect. I would describe it as a drama / comedy. But it's still worth the money to see, and I've still found almost everything I expected. Robin Williams is at his best, along with the famous Christopher Walken. They play an excellent team in this film and I was shocked to see how the two were able to work together. I recommend it to anyone looking for a carefree movie.
