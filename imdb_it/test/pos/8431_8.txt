It was heartbreaking, but the Chinese Syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when the theatrical release at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant was taking place. I still remember that the attention of the entire country was glued to the hourly bulletins coming out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And you wouldn't know, a scientist from The China Syndrome describes the worst scenario as making an uninhabitable area like the state of Pennsylvania uninhabitable. <br /> <br /> Less than a decade later in Ukraine at Chernobyl, the Soviet Union in its last days has faced such a crisis that has not been corrected in very little time. The China Syndrome has once again become a major film. <br /> <br /> The film is more about cutting corners for security than being anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who lived on nuclear power his entire life as captain of an atomic power submarine. What frightens him and drives him to create the clash that culminates in the film is the stupidity and greed of the executives of the electric company. Stupidity and greed, however, are raw materials found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society. <br /> <br /> Lemmon shares the stars with a couple of famous Hollywood sons, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a television journalist who is constantly assigned to comic stories and who is in a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. The cover-up of his own station and his subsequent meeting with Lemmon gave way to the chain of events represented in China Syndrome. <br /> <br /> The best Fonda scene that I thought was with Peter Donat, a manager of his station anyway. Take a look at his facial expressions while Donat moves away from the importance of history and condescendingly tells her that her own beauty demands that she stick to the mugs. Fonda knows he has something and puts it on. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays his iconoclastic cameraman, this was a typical part for him throughout the day. In his TCM tribute to his father Kirk Douglas, Michael said he opted for roles that show sensitivity. However, I could have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part. What to do for energy for industrial and post-industrial nations, an irritating problem that will ruin our government for a couple of generations to come. This film shows what can happen with a nuclear addiction. Our current geopolitical problems in the world stem in part from dependence on fossil fuels, particularly oil. Everything we use brings unforeseen consequences. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the film in my opinion is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end Brimley really approaches the plate. <br /> <br /> See The China Syndrome to find out what I'm talking about.
