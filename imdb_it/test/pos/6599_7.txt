This is a pretty good documentary. I'm not a skateboarder, I don't particularly like skateboarding or skateboarding. But somehow for about 2 hours this film made me interested in the subject. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't call it the most intriguing movie of all time, but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and we were skating in those empty Southern California pools, I was interested. <br /> <br /> I must also add that the music in this film was also quite good. I don't sit around longing to listen to other rock bands from the 70s, but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.
