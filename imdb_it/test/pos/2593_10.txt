In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to convince him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his agenda. Also, "Rabbit seasoning" makes an interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it might just be hilarious and really confuse your speech). <br /> <br /> I think probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. It seems that one of them would have been bold for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they do it perfectly, as they always did. All in all, this only shows what genes were the people behind these cartoons.
