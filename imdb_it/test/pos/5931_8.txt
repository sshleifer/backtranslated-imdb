Probably the best Royal Rumble over the years. <br /> <br /> Game 1 sees the Edge Shawn Michaels battle in a good but very long game. Forward on one of the worst roster wrestlers - Heidenreich faces The Undertaker in a boring coffin match. Game number 3 sees Bradshaw defend his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good race. The next game sees Triple H defend his tenth heavyweight reign against Randy Orton in a big game. <br /> <br /> The next one on Royal Rumble takes place where 15 Raw superstars and 15 Smackdowns! superstars hit the ring to try to win the roar and face the champion whoever is at Wrestlemania 21. Highlights included Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder getting kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All the superstars who defeated Muhammad Hassan and Raw superstars vs Smackdown! superstar! <br /> <br /> Not bad at all PPV. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. HBK - 8/10 Taker vs. Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs. Angle vs. Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 The Royal Rumble Game - 9/10
