If you are familiar with the work of author Johnny To and his band of film buddies in addition to Milky Way, you know what to expect from this latest production. All the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a policeman and a villain, the coincidences and the possibilities that turn into a coin and pay handsomely at the end, and the humor that also rises in the more terrible than situations. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours of life and decides to rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant in other films of the Milky Way such as "The longest night", "A hero never dies" and "Where a good man goes") portrays a negotiator / cop being held hostage by the thief , even if the thief creates a series of tricks and clues he must follow to get his man. <br /> <br /> Fun, moving and cool while being slim, "Running" is actually one of the most enjoyable Milky Way films to date. Do not miss the performances of the two protagonists, esp. Andy Lau, usually considered a normal actor who has rarely been so natural and fun to watch. This film is one that goes out of your way to see.
