We are taken to a general store where Nick is looking at the coins in his hand and imagines if he can get the special 20-ounce 20-ounce cup that comes with a puff pastry. He decides to go for the bigger size, which is obviously more expensive and doesn't qualify him for the cake. Try to discuss with the Indian clerk at the register, which maintains its position. With her it is a matter of principle. Well, Nick gets irritated by not being able to do it his way and proceeds to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is set from the beginning. The people we're about to meet are not good guys. There are Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas, and their partner Billy Hill. They are drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former crime partner, in Houston. He wants to make another transaction and then go to Paris with the profits from the sale of the drugs he is bringing. What he doesn't understand is that Casey went straight. He is an architect, married to Christine, and wants to adopt a child. <br /> <br /> Casey does not appreciate his former friend who carries drugs at home. He decides to get rid of things by rinsing them down the kitchen drain. The inappropriate arrival of Ice, a pizza delivery boy, surprises Casey. This man was sent to kill him, but before that, Casey brings out some weed to share with Ice, who has a talent for rap. <br /> <br /> It is at this point that Dr. Jarvis, the man from the adopting agency, arrives. Casey's application shows a gap of two years that he cannot justify. Jarvis begins to doubt his future father. Right now, Dallas makes an entrance. She is a woman who asks point-blank questions, like when she asks to know if Jarvis enjoys watching porn. Jarvis, who is excited, ends up exaggerating. Dallas has decided to seduce Casey at all costs. There's a surprise in the store when Billy Hill enters the movie and doesn't like what he sees, turning Dallas into the process. Billy Hill has also arrived on Casey, but is overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Casey receives a visit from Kasarov who wants to get his money from Nick; in his absence, he will take it from Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline and Casey decides to outsmart all these low lives. He has all the parts that come to his home at a set time and the different factions will take care of themselves. In the end, Casey has a better plan that includes taking Christine for a stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> Having never heard of "Thursday", we were attracted by the talent in it. Skip Woods directed his own material. This seems to be a film with good intentions. Sometimes the film reminds others of the same genre, not a sin of any shape or form, which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here on the IMDb site. For beginners, "Thursday" shows a witty Skip Woods who went on to write other films, in particular "Swordfish". The script is divided into chapters with suggestive titles, related to the action. Denis Lenoir works wonders with mostly internal photography. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane offers an excellent contribution to the film with her Casey. Although difficult to imagine, he beat the odds and did something by himself. This actor, recently seen in the television series "Hung", is one of the actors that we never tire of watching. Dark-haired Aaron Eckhart is a welcome addition to any film. He is a greasy criminal who shows no salvific qualities, or something like remorse and does not hesitate to involve his former friend in his plan. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Paulina Porizkova, a wonderful creature who is just a distraction, or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. We enjoyed Glenn Plummer, who appears as Ice. He does a media hearing on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
