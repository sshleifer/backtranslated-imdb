it's a good watch if you have time - it takes care of three friends who throw themselves into a bar fight aimlessly, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting with some shady people and they can't stand it. very, very disturbing representation of Japan, the arbitrariness of modern life ... some intense scenes, but a bit of a cocoon <br /> <br /> the spoiler was that the plot is not too light based on English subtitles. obviously, I don't know Japanese. <br /> <br /> the only other Japanese films I saw were the kurosawa, which is different and much higher than this modern genre. therefore, I can't really compare. otherwise, it compares better with most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the plot and the accumulation of stories. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
