In 1850 in Yorkshire, a boy's chimney sweep is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported to an underwater kingdom, where he makes many friends and saves the legendary Water Babies from an evil shark. Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a great film for children, half live-action and half-animation, which is both a dark and evocative representation of Victorian times and a terrifying and fun underwater adventure. They are really two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. The animation by Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful, as is the photography of Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great quality of rough diamond like fish (literal) out of the water - I love the moment when it is at the top of the villa, sees all the chimneys and shouts "Blimey !!" at the height of his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest and most annoying bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see true Victorian values, don't look at Sense And Sensibility, look at this), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who makes a thousand voices) and Percival are all excellent. Here's how a good children's movie should be - good old-fashioned fun, but just a little thoughtful, sad and scary. Cockallorum high !!
