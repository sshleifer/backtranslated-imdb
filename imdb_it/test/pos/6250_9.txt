I love this movie! When I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid, it scared the hell out of me. Probably because the mannequins also give me the chills. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. Use his facial expressions, especially his eyes, to play terrified. Chuck Connors is as fantastic as Mr. Schlausen. I was happy to see him play such a different role. The other actors in this movie are also fantastic! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future films, especially Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> So, if you love scary movies, but you're tired of seeing the same old thing, watch this movie!
