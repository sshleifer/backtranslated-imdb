I came across this DVD movie by pure chance through a Blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an excellent BBC 2hour documentary / drama about a future "grand tour" of the solar system. Struggling to adhere to current knowledge about planets and space flight, and about plausible extrusions from existing technology, this film tells the story of the astronauts on a journey to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. <br /> <br /> The special effects are excellent for a TV show. I found the actors as credible as astronauts. The situations presented are for the most part plausible, and much is learned about the science of planets and space flight! Only two minor complaints: I found some situations and a bit of dialogue sometimes maudlin. I'm also not sure if a single crew and a ship are sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once. More than likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. They would be / will be separate missions. <br /> <br /> They didn't try to skimp on this show with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of Chile - the driest area on earth and a dead ringtone for the Martian landscape. Sequences of weightlessness were filmed in a Russian transport jet. The producers could have helped one of these by using the studies and CGI, but instead they chose the real thing. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention in particular the wonderful music that was composed for this film. The exciting theme of Don Davis is the first thing that captures you when the film starts, when the magnificent shot of the Pegasus surpasses the screen and David Suchet intones "it is man's destiny to explore the stars ...". <br /> <br /> Watching this on a small TV screen is a regret I have. What a thrill to see this in a cinema, or even better an IMAX presentation!
