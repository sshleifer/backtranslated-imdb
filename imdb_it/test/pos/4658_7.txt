Somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells a song plays in my head. I can't forget it, no matter how hard you try. It's midnight and it will reach you! I wish I could find a copy of this on a 45rpm disk. Five disparate teams go out for a night in Los Angeles for a treasure hunt of clues instead of physical objects. A messy game master with two splendid assistants is the mind of all this madness that is about to be unleashed on LA All the teams are stereotypes (this film is from 1980, before political correctness ruined everything): the "good guys" , the "nerds" led by Eddie Deezen, the stupid beer-loving "athletes", the "non-we-need-a-man-type-ladies", especially the redhead. Even the giggling twins are a scream. And finally the "bad guys" with Stephen Furst as a leader. The furst is as exhilarating as the overweight cum Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a sticky mess. Movies like this are no longer made. These days, the films must have a "nervousness" with some obscure characters and other nonsense. Let's go back to the days when the "good guys" led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly in conflict. So download all the serious claims and go back to 1980. IT'S MIDNIGHT. . .
