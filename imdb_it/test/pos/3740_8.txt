Discovering something, the journey is much more fun, much more surreal and much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at your destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. You feel energized, invigorated and alive. You simply want to be close to that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice excites you and sometimes turns you on. Love and all the resulting physical and emotional side effects are pure happiness. Where it goes from here is anyone's guess, but when you start your journey together, nothing can compare it. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner, two emotionally scarred halves aged. In this film, they are about to embark on that mystical journey together, where love and the discovery of emotions along the way will help save them. <br /> <br /> Lane is looking after the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in his eyes, just because the woman he cheated on doesn't want him anymore. As much as she was hurt by him, as much as he really was sorry, there is a part of her that is really thinking about bringing him back. Why could you ask? Because in life and in love, sometimes comfort replaces intelligence. Yes, this man betrayed her but he has children with him, he built a life with him and obviously there is still a connection with him. Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and a foreign father. He also lost a patient while reacting negatively to the anesthetic. He has now been sued by his family and is full of feelings of guilt but has become hard on the issue. This is what brings him to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer had told him not to, he felt compelled to visit the woman's husband in Rodanthe. It remains to the Inn that Adrienne is taking care of him. Soon, they find solace in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life. <br /> <br /> Now it seems like a simple idea for a movie, and even if it could be something about you 'I saw or read before, Gere and Lane simply own the movie. Diane Lane turns on the screen with her smile. His eyes shine in the darkness and the life he brings to the character deserves to be seen. Gere's character is a little different. It's harder and harder. He takes Adrienne's pain and passion to take him out of his shell. He quietly blames himself for his tense relationship with his son and she secretly blames herself for the patient's death. Outside he tells anyone who listens that it's not his fault, and that he was a victim of 1 in 50,000. But basically, he eats it. They find each other at a time when they both need someone to listen. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane have already been in films together, but this is the first time that lovers play. They were married in Unfaithful but here lovers play each other when people in their lives have abandoned them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I'd like to see more movies with them. In fact, I'd like to see more movies with Diane Lane but this is a story for another time. <br /> <br /> Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. Both become better people, they both become stronger people. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to everyone, not just couples. This is a film about redemption, absolution and second chances. <br /> <br /> He will also ask you to bring handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> 8/10
