This is one of the suburban stories told by the Animatrix that is not directly relevant to the stopping war. A glorifying plot of the films, but Trinity, voiced by Carrie, appears in it. he is equipped with a private detective who is hired for a lot of money to look for a hacker named Trinity. we see his research presenting other PIs, only one he meets, who is apparently mad about his experience in trying to track down Trinity. eventually he comes into contact with Trinity, who naturally considers a man - told in the narrative and something that puts us firmly in his perspective, despite what we already know - in a hacker chat room, and solves a riddle that forces him to hurry to take a train. he forgets his hat but his faithful cat throws him in a moment of ridiculousness so absurd that it is exhilarating. <br /> <br /> he meets her on the train, but the deception is revealed when the agents attack; the agents were using it to get to Trinity and Trinity was trying to free the IPs sent after her, which he does not know, of course, and which is not explicitly stated in the animation itself, something common in the film noir, which often suggest a lot of interesting backstory, subplots, developments, etc. but don't show yourself more of the plot and of a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue. <br /> <br /> almost everything in this short film is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of the film noir and the unusual, antiquated but dedicated detective, is the perfect protagonist of a film noir. the trivia section of the title of this title on IMDb also presents some references that this title makes to hardboiled literature, something from which it also borrows a lot of, a kind of mystery for investigators, gangsters etc. who are committed to challenging conflicts promptly and often. appropriately animated by Studio 4 Â° C and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, it is a fun variation of the usual matrix plot.
