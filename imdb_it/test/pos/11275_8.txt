First of all, this is an art film and a good one for that. I loved the presentation and the way it was taken. Very nice Some scenes were some of the most graphic horror sequences I've ever seen. This film scared me, not because of suspense or shock, but because I was afraid of dying that I would soon see something really terrifying. This happened in some places, but mainly at the beginning. Also this film was dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long. However, if you are in the cinema you have to see this. To date, I haven't seen anything like it. 8/10
