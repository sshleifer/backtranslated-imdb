A prominent episode of season 1 is what Ice is. An articulated place, claustrophobic conditions and a general feeling of paranoia looming in the icy air makes this episode unmissable from the first season. Previous occupants of the artic station Mulder, Scully and four others have either killed each other or been killed. A virus is bringing out a murderous assault and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fear. Mulder and Scully actually start questioning each other's sanity. The voltage is so high. writers must be given great credit for creating the kind of scenario in which the atmosphere is so tense that Mulder and Scully come into conflict so directly
