Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's "The Thing" such an entertaining science fiction film are its elements that challenge the genre of mystery, suspense and structure. Embarrasses films like "Aliens" or "Armageddon" that are content to flood the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around acrobatics that grind the laws of physics, testosterone jokes, heroes with enough artillery to conquer the Iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject "meaning" into the burst on the screen with "emotional sequences" that serve only to further insult the public's intelligence. The supreme tragedy, of course, is that these lobotomized films are also the most popular. I think there's a cause for this, even if it's not very comforting. There is a growing tendency in our culture to passively "pass on" to the media - to immerse themselves in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to understand the statement the work is trying to make. This mentality is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once sacred media is being diluted, thanks to the abominable "reader response" theory that pervades our schools and the "tabloid brigade" that aligns our magazine racks whose mentality seems to infiltrate the mainstream press once venerated. Nowadays, just turn the switch and put our minds in "pause". "The Thing" is a "good" film? For the rare individual who still appreciates his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be "funny". His plot continues to guess, his end is intransigent, and he has some redemptive statements about human paranoia. In subsequent visions, a noticeable lack of depth in acting begins to be noticed, but the tense plot remains convincing. Of course, "Citizen Kane" is not, but then again science fiction has never been a kind of thinking man ...
