I like "Hack". He thinks the "Lone Ranger" has reincarnated as a taxi driver of the 2000s, a decent but imperfect boy, in Philadelphia who does his best, while trying to solve the problems of a troubled past, and you have the synopsis. David Morse is almost as perfect as Olshansky. Help people, but instead of driving "Silver" in the old west, drive a taxi through the middle streets of contemporary Philly, without distributing silver bullets. The supporting cast is first class and well above average. Sometimes, the witty dialogue almost reaches the level of that classic series of the 70s, "The Rockford Files". This show deserves a return, hopefully in a better time slot of 21:00 Friday (east).
