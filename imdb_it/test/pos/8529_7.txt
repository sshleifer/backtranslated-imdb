The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two rival James Bond films. "Octopussy", played by Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond series. "Never Say Never Again", made by a rival producer, is, apart from the horrible "Casino Royale", the only James Bond film that is not part of that franchise. His great attraction was that he brought back the original Bond, Sean Connery; the title derives from Connery's comment after "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never play the role again. Some complained that Connery was too old for the role at age 53, but in reality he was three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only did "Octopussy" in the same year, but also did another James Bond film, "A View to a Kill", two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to the resolution of a lawsuit on the cinematographic rights of Ian Fleming's work. It is perhaps a pity that the terms of the agreement included a clause according to which the new film was to be a remake of "Thunderball", as it was perhaps not the biggest of the Connery Bonds. (A remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" would have worked better). The plot is very similar to that of the previous film; the terrorist organization SPECTER, which acts together with a megalomaniac magnate named Largo, has stolen two American nuclear warheads and is trying to hold the world's governments hostage by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a large sum of money. Obviously it's up to Bond to save the world by tracking missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The film is lucky because it has not only one of the two most beautiful Bond girls of all, Barbara Carrera is the seductive but lethal Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger in the role of Largo's girlfriend, Domino, who defends herself on Bond's side after learning about his lover's diabolical plans. Some James Bond films have a plot that hangs on the hero's ability to conquer the lover's female accomplice - there are similar developments, for example, in "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "The Living Daylights ". In the official series, Bond's ally is normally considered the female protagonist, but here Carrera, who plays the wickedness, is advertised above Basinger, who at the time was a relatively unknown actress. Basinger, of course, has become one of the greatest Hollywood stars, while Carrera is one of the many Bond girls who have vanished from sight. <br /> <br /> Bad guys, Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld, the head of SPECTER, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too bland and non-threatening as Largo, except perhaps during the game "Domination", a more sophisticated variant of those violent computer games like "Space Invaders" that were so popular in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films like "Mephisto" and "Oberst Redl", but he does not come across so explicitly in English. <br /> <br /> One of the features of the film is that they both follow the normal Bond formula and sometimes come out of it. There is the standard plot of the genre in danger, chase sequences, a series of exotic places, glamorous women, sinister villains and a special theme written based on the title of the film. There is, however, no extended pre-credit sequence, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, the head of Bond M becomes a languid and arrogant aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is shown black for the only time, and the scientist Q is played by Alec McCowen as a disenchanted cynic with (despite his name typically bourgeois of Algernon) a clear accent of the working class. There is also an amusing cameo by Rowan Atkinson as a clumsy British diplomat. Although Connery may not have been a good example like in some of his previous films in the role, playing those changes on the family theme makes this one of the most memorable Bonds. 7/10 <br /> <br /> A taste. Rowan Atkinson's character states that he comes from the British embassy in Nassau. However, since the Bahamas are a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a High Commission in its capital, not an embassy.
