This is an unusual film because it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it is one of the few pairs of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had made films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) roughly when she did THIS IS MY BUSINESS, but Taylor was a contracted MGM player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to Fox - Some studies have done occasionally during this era. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because many people in real life have roles in the film, even if the piece is otherwise pure fiction. You'll see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can't remember any movie with McKinley or Dewey as a character, although I remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a couple of other films. Three applauses for seeing a "minor president" in a film as the main character! <br /> <br /> The film begins with McKinley taking a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) and asking him to be a special agent for him - and not telling anyone - not even the secret service. This is because the President fears that someone in the agency is sending out a gang that is doing a long series of robberies - all based on inside information. So it's up to Taylor (who is not known for his male roles - especially at this stage of his career) to pretend to be a criminal and find the gang responsible AND the internal man. <br /> <br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, while he is able to find gang members, one of the gang member's half sisters is Stanwyck. Taylor discovers he is in love with her, but he must also do his duty and hand them over to the authorities. Second, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, the SEVERE problems develop when McKinley is murdered and Taylor is on death row for crimes !!! <br /> <br /> The film did a good job in creating a story and placing it in a historical context. While today most people don't remember McKinley nor remember that he was murdered, the film is set in this interesting period. The acting is pretty decent, as the stars are backed by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, although I must admit that Donlevy's role was quite docile and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. Overall, it's very interesting, well written and not too sloppy in the romance department. A good trip for everyone.
