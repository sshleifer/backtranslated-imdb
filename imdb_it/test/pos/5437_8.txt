I will actually admit that I am a political addict, so this resonated with me, but the irregular nature of Ms. Green (yes, I know what they did to her), but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itself . <br /> <br /> Why can't Barry L and the crew leave us alone to ask us what he would do? Let's try to discuss it. <br /> <br /> Instead they have this ending of "oh I'm not worthy" and just shows that when the chips have fallen it's better to leave the table instead of doubling. Stop the Disney ending and put a bow on it. Life is not easy, they should have had the courage to give the main character a bit of a backbone. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the rhetoric of the whole movie ... and then he went crazy and stupid, a mindless behavior by Ms. Green (when the crap was out of her system) just made for an almost end ridiculous in the film that was the icing on the cake.
