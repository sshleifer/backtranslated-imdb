Despite the reviewers' pots, I liked this movie. In fact, I enjoyed it much more than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt. All the main actors of the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and half a dozen others (although most of them were in cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse of the Talamasca). Furthermore, despite the other reviews, I think this film and the music were faithful to the representation and ethos of Anne Rice, at least as I perceive it. Aailiyah was quite good as Akasha, in irresistible places (her first entry and her mini dance). The film did not capture the breadth of the book series, but I thought it was a nice supplement. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of this series mainly due to the style, sensitivity and treatments of Anne Rice. And I found this film a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
