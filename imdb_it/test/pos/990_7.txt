Although I know the poet Dylan Thomas very well, I don't know anything about his life. Whatever his life and especially his marriage, I imagine that The Edge of Love (based on the novel) manipulates things a little, but unless you are a historian or a poet, who cares. <br /> <br /> the film speaks less about Thomas and focuses more on the two most important women of his life. One is his wife Kathrine, and the other is Vera who was his first love. A romantic night on the beach as a young man is something they both tried to put behind them but they can't, now grown up they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this is set during the war. Vera gets engaged to Captain Will Killing who gets her pregnant and leaves for the war. While she is away, Vera starts falling in love with Thomas again, and Kathrine has never fallen in love with him again. He also brings another man's son. Things become even more complex from an emotional point of view when Capt Killig returns <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is a very soap opera plot, and takes shape in a fabulous and slow way, with perhaps too many sequences of sweetened dialogue . But all is not yet lost. For a non-Hollywood production, I think Edge of Love represents a fashionable image that can be achieved. It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary novels, Hollywood production or not. Part of this has to do with being set during the war, which creates an emotional conflict that seems more convincing and less artificial, a bit like the Atonement. this is characterized by acting and cinematography of equal talent for Oscar nominee Joe Wright, but it has a much greater need for stable rhythm and progression. Things are fine at the beginning and end, but the central section is where your attention span can be tested, unless you are deeply and deeply rooted in history. <br /> <br /> I doubt that The Edge of Love has that kind of effect on the viewer, but it's a good movie to check. he could also make a good night movie, considering that he is much smarter than the movies that boyfriends are forced to endure today.
