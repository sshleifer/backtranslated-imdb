Spirit and Chaos is a biographical artistic film by Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer active at the beginning of the 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and his fantastic beauty) and his difficulties in accepting a harsh reality in front of his idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The film has integrated extracts from Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students were powerful, especially in a scene where he offers everything he has to a newly captured student while he steals materials from the classroom. Miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson for all of us. Furthermore, Miyazawa's devotion to science was also well represented. At a time when Western ideas were still met with skepticism, especially in provincial cities like the one where Miyazawa grew up, he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance. The way in which the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer was really intense and well interpreted. <br /> <br /> I heard that the CGI integrated into the film, while innovative, clashed with more organic animation. It could be argued that this was intentional to represent a conflict within the main character, but I found it rather unsightly. I also want the film to discuss Miyazawa's Buddhist influence, but it worked without it. <br /> <br /> Although this film was very well done. I give him a 9/10, with the only point being deducted for the CGI. Otherwise the animation, the plot and the dialogue were all wonderful and heartfelt. I haven't seen any other Kawamori Shoji movies, but after seeing this I'll be sure to give it a chance.
