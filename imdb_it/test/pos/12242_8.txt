Spoiler Alert <br /> <br /> I've never seen comments on a movie, which I disagree with more than the comments made by people about this. You could learn from the critical visions of this film. As an educational film, I consider it very important because it teaches "how to be successful"! We don't watch films to learn; generally we look for entertainment. As entertainment, I judge it low: the ending is late and cerebral / intellectual. This conflict translates into my eight-star rating. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the position of anchoring news on the air. Tom immediately enchants people with humility. Another potential has been waiting for years for its airing opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news, inside and out. <br /> <br /> The Network executive wants Grunnick to be on the air and Jane says, saying that Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They don't listen to it. Forced to blow up Grunnick, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news and broadcasts Altman's comments through a headset to Grunnick while Grunnick talks. We observe the strong contrast between the words of Altman / Jane Craig and those of Grunnick, while Grunnick skillfully resets all that Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, enjoyable and fun for the public. Altman has a chance live and network executives ask him to look for coach from Grunnick, the new guy. Is this new naive boy educating him? This is something that Altman does not see justified, but reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> Grunnick trains Altman and gets excited by noticing hundreds of Altman shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to panic sweat attack ("Flop Sweat") when on air. Grunnick eventually becomes the first anchor network and Altman resigns before being fired. But Grunnick fails in her attempt at romance with Jane Craig, because she discovers from Altman that Grunnick sometimes pretends to make circumstances like him. This turns her from him. This sends the message that in relationships we want people who are authentic and don't try to make us like them. <br /> <br /> This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it's especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people who comment on how this is the stupid TV News comment and how Grunnick looks good, but stupid or all the style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed very complex skills and intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of the mind to know exactly how it looks and sounds, when he is at the camera (teaches Altman to Punch a word in each sentence). The fault with Grunnick's relationship with Jane Craig is that he is too motivated to be nice and will fake a situation. Many people call Altman very clever or brilliant. Altman, played by Brookes, is not as clever as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind cannot handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is annoyed that he knew the news and Grunnick overcame him by convincing people to like him. There are also people who comment that these things are exclusive to the TV News sector. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular, but my experience indicates that it is true in most jobs. As an instruction on how to succeed, this film is fantastic, even if unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an edifying ending.
