Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and a few days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her, expecting to "clean up the fog" in their lives. Joline faces her marriage as an important end-of-life commitment, and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her on the Mexican border. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that he cannot change his decision, while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and starts going out with her, and in the end "life goes on". This film is very unpredictable, with a very different story. I believe it is an independent production. In some parts, it's a bit slow and boring, but there are some dialogs that make this movie useful. I liked it, and my vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rebeldes At√© or Fim" ("Rebels to the end") <br /> <br />
