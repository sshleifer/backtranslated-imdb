I will admit my ignorance of the existence of this film, until I saw it advertised on a cable outlet. I was very impressed by the novel's structure of the film. The film, which is in a language I don't understand, has shone with intelligence and nuance for me. I think this is about the quality of the film. It was visually stunning. The acting was visually entrancing. The traditions of Chinese theater movement, used to improve the distribution of dialogue, are so compelling after seeing the Western film, where actors traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action in this film comes right to you, without many explosions to get your attention. It is human action that is so affective here. The added advantage that the film taught me was the history of one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the harmonious clay army of the first Chinese Qin Emporer, was very impressive. It seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great ethical themes. This is a film that I can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.
