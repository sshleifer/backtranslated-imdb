I've always loved old movies, but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm, the charm of the 1940s, and a good old fashioned love story and it's hilarious! Barbara Stanwick plays a single independent woman who writes cookery articles for the home of a famous magazine ... on the premise that she is a married housewife. The president of the magazine is also under this illusion. Enter a nice GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan) just rescued from a raft with his friend. His simple wish is to stay in the Homey Inn, which writes eloquently and relax with his famous home-made meals. Now he must frantically find a way to save his job and his reputation ... adding to this that his boyfriend is in a hurry to tie the knot does not help. Humor is superb and the chemistry between the main characters is a lot of fun. Throw the character-actor nicknamed "Cuddles" (which perfectly fits this name) becomes even more adorable. This has become my must-see film, where I have a cup of cocoa every Christmas season. A wonderful and fun movie to enjoy at Christmas or whenever you want!
