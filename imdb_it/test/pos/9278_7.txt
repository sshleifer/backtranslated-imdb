I was looking forward to watching this documentary on what I consider some of the funniest movies ever made. Growing up in L.A. during the 1960s many of these old black and white films were shown in local stations. I even remember a Friday night show called "Strange Tales of Science Fiction" which showed a different Sci Fi movie every week. However, this documentary spent too much time on the opinions of the four famous directors and how they felt about classic films of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their film production. <br /> <br /> It's not what I was hoping for in this documentary. It could really have been a comprehensive review of the decade, rather than a brief highlighting of the most well-known films of the time. Anyone who has studied or is interested in these films has a certain familiarity with characters such as War of the Worlds, The Forbidden Planet, The Thing, The Day the Earth Stood Still, etc. I would have liked to see some less known film excerpts and perhaps some interviews with people involved in making these films. I should agree that the documentary was too focused on Spielberg's opinions and was a type of advertisement for his new version of War of the Worlds.
