I saw this film when I was very young. It's my all-time favorite. I hadn't been able to get a copy until recently and the visualization brought back so many good memories. I loved the portrait of Sidney Poiter by Porgy, his character with such strength and courage. The part of Pearl Bailey, although small, was no different from many members of our family. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, Do not Let Him Handle Me" and of course "Summertime". According to the guidelines, if I am interpreting them correctly I am unable to publish where I managed to get my copy, Sorry. That's why I registered to be able to share this information.
