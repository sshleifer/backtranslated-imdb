This epic brings together a superbly gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth greater than most novels, wonderful music, a philosophy and a connection with LIFE that I find difficult to explain. Diving in Die Zweite Heimat is similar to a spiritual experience for me, similar to the wonder you get when you look at the stars in a clear night sky. The language and the use of segments in both color and monochrome add to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the places, including Edgar Reitz's office. From that moment on, I promised to improve my German skills - after Die Zweite Heimat I feel almost German, as if I were in the heads of the characters. I also try to match the piano by Henry Arnold (Hermann), but this is the only thing that I will always miss! This drama is unmatched and I was lucky enough to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The sequel, Heimat 3, is currently shot in Germany.
