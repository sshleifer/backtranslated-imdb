Small film of great success (in 1955) on an important topic. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from Sinatra's performance and I was pleasantly surprised. Beloved Kim Novak! She was beautiful! <br /> I loved the Elmer Bernstein jazz soundtrack! Fantastic like that of Lazlo Schifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that it is not available on CD (if anyone knows the availability of the soundtrack on any other format, it should post it here somewhere!). Preminger's management was, as usual, impeccable. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the novel by Nelson Algren and I have no idea how faithful the script was. Frankie's subplot as a "hot" card dealer was also a surprise, like some other things. But look at yourself. It is really worth seeing ...
