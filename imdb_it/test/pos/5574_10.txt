After 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, I eventually registered with IMDB just to give Farscape a "10". The writers, cast and crew proved to be the ambiguous masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who don't like science fiction should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance! <br /> <br /> The virtues of Farscape are simply too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all; the quality of the writing is incredible. I haven't heard so well from "Blake's 7". In fact, Farscape looks very much like a "Blake's 7" with good special effects and a little more romance. <br /> <br /> Everyone, have fun!
