The original story and funny and engaging characters went very well for a lazy (2 times) movie for girls. I loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, with no boring scenes drawn. He is violent and has some language (although most are covered). It's a great movie. David Strickland was an exceptional actor. Ron Eldard gave a wonderful performance. I always watch it with girls.
