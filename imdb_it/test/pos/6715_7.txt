The life force begins in the space where HMS Churchill follows Haley's comet and his equipment detects a 150-mile alien spacecraft in the head of the comet, unable to contact Earth because of interference Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides that this is the only possibility to investigate. Going out in the space suit Carlsen and some members of his team enter the mysterious spaceship and find the remains of a bat as a race of creatures and three perfect-looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger and Bill Malin) and a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) everyone who takes aboard the Churchill. Thirty days later and again on Earth, the Churchill is detected on the radar, a rescue mission is sent only to find that the ship was burned and that all the crew would die. The rescue team finds the three humanoid aliens and brings them back to Earth, where they come back to life in a London space research center and literally begin to suck the life force from human victims who in turn must do the same to stop transforming themselves in dust, things look gloomy while the epidemic spreads throughout London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was produced by the infamous Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus who was responsible for a lot of money The low-budget action films under their production company Cannon usually played Chuck Norris and they wanted to move in the big time and the director signed Tobe Hooper on a contract with three films (which were the remake of Lifeforce, Invaders from Mars (1986) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), a sequel to Hooper's classic, which failed and practically failed both the Golan and the Globus & Cannon no longer existed. ia a commercial flop at the box office, I have to say that I think Lifeforce is a very funny, if rather silly, sci-fi horror. When it was originally distributed in cinemas in '85 Lifefore was reduced to 101 minutes by Golan & Globus, but in recent years the cut of longer than 116 minutes has almost replaced it on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc and TV even if the cut is apparently Hooper's original film worked for 128 minutes, so there's even more footage out there somewhere. I will base my comments on the longer 116-minute cut, the script by Dan O'Bannon, Don Jakoby and the unaccredited rewritings of Michael Armstrong and Olaf Pooley was based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires" and has many extraordinary ideas, its scope is really ambitious and it feels like it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of entertainment. It moves like a rocket and in the heart there is a really interesting story here, even if the film gets tangled up. There are also some hilarious moments in Lifeforce, the scene in which the security guard tries to convince the naked female Vampire to surrender by offering her a half-eaten cookie is a true classic of the field, the horribly agitated hypnosis scenes including the one in which Railsback ends to kiss Patrick Stewart and many, many more. I don't know, call me weird, but I thought that Lifeforce was very funny and very funny in almost every way, from stupid dialogues, strange dialogues, strange ideas that never come together and some extraordinary images Lifeforce is certainly not a movie that will bore you. <br /> <br /> Director Hooper only had more money to play with him than he ever had (twice what he had for Poltergeist (1982)) and he uses every part to bring this spectacular film to big screen, John Dykstra the star responsible for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and more recently Spider-Man (2002) was introduced to manage visual effects and in general they look fabulous. The sequences set in space with spaceships in particular seem great, there are also some really fantastic visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London, as hundreds of blue souls fly everywhere. There is a bit of nudity but not much blood, there are some withered corpses, some gunshot wounds, someone's skin comes off by hand, blood gushes from someone's eyes, nose and ears, there is a severed arm and some zombies. Even the special effects of makeup are generally very good. I wouldn't say that Lifeforce is scary as it's more of a science fiction film than horror, I loved the way Hooper takes the outer space sequences as he continues to rotate his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness and which is not like a "solid" plan. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 25,000,000, it has made less than half of it in its theatrical version and has not even set the world on video or DVD, which is a shame because even if it is a a bit of a casino is a lot of fun to watch. Shot on location in England. Well shot in 2: 35: 1 widescreen, the 4: 3 cropped image is horrible and cuts huge pieces of information from both sides of the screen, this is most evident during the opening scenes set in the space where it is sometimes difficult to tell them apart what's happening and the sense of the vastness of space and the alien spacecraft is lost. Acting is OK in a very silly film, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski and Anthony Hopkins changed Caine's role. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a bizarre film, there are no two ways to do it and anyone looking for something simple and direct should look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a little different in the science fiction genre, gives life to Lifeforce because it is one of those nasty ones that is a good movie with some awesome effects and is by no means your average version of the mill movie.
