I gave this movie a 10 simply for my sick obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think she was the best actress to honor this land with her talent and all her films are absolutely wonderful (even when they're horrible) because SHE is in them. If it hadn't been for you and Vivien Leigh (as you had originally wanted me to hear) I would have given a vote of 9.0 Simply because I love Viv, but probably not as much as I love Ingrid. And any other actress would have done maybe a 6. It's a good story, two wild people who fall in love in a society where it's bad to be bad. It reminds me a little of GWTW, except with a more intellectual attitude. Gary Cooper is very handsome as usual and, of course, his voice never changes the whole movie, but hey Ingrid makes it look so amazing and fascinating and 20 times hotter than it probably should be.
