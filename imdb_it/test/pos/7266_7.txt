A very watchable film, and he was eagerly waiting to see the trailer several times. <br /> <br /> The whole affair seems superb, from the ridiculous efforts of the heinous bourgeoisie to distance itself from mediocrity, to the scum of the lower class who tries only to keep their heads above the filth, the film brilliantly captures spirit of the eighteenth century. Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, even if the part doesn't relax him, and Robert Carlyle seems a little wasted for Plunkett, the colleague of the author of Miller. <br /> <br /> The real protagonist of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays the role of Mr Chance (a sort of 1740 police chief) with a joy that took him away from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> A great movie, and anyone who loves the color and style of Peter Greenaway's films will love the look of it, even if the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours have passed. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
