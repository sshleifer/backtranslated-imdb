The horror genius Dario Argento is one of my favorite directors, and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" are at the top of my list of all-time favorites. "Opera" from 1987 is another tempting and ingenious film that no horror lover can afford to lose and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from beginning to end. This extraordinary and ultra-violent yellow could very well be described as the master's worst film, which is quite important considering that Argento's films are not exactly known for the docility of their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes the work a nightmare for film censorship. <br /> <br /> - Attention! SPOILERS forward! - <br /> <br /> Just when Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, is succeeding, an incredibly sadistic and murderous psychopath begins to haunt her ... The murders are really brutal and of a particularly sadistic nature . The killer attaches the needles to Betty's closed eyelids, so he must keep them open and watch as he brutally kills people near her in hideous ways. Once the slaughter is over, the killer frees Betty and leaves, only to return for other friends of his ... <br /> <br /> As usual for the Silver films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized . "Opera" is really a brutal film, and what an elegant and atmospheric film it is. This film is absolutely tempting and pure suspense from beginning to end. The performances are very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant in the head. Incredible beauty and great actress, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role as a talented singer, whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly driving her crazy. Other great performances include those of Ian Charleston in the role of a horror film director who is directing an opera, and the girlfriend of director Argento, Daria Nicolodi, who has a role in many of his films. The work with the camera is excellent as in all the Silver films and The huge Opera House is an excellent environment that contributes a lot both to the beauty of the film and to its disturbing atmosphere. The soundtrack, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal, is also great, although I missed Goblin's brilliant Progressive Rock soundtracks a bit, which is such an important element in most of the other Silver films. "Opera" is truly a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking experience of Giallo. This is an absolute must for any horror lover, and I highly recommend it to any other movie buff who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tempting!
