this was a thoughtful and well-made and direct TV movie that dealt with a huge theme with precision and intelligence, and gave it a cinematic treatment that would look perfect on a bigger screen - the palette is a bit mute for TV . if you are looking for a war action movie or "bosnia lite", this is not for you - it is a normal woman who has faced an extraordinary challenge for humanity. if you want to learn more about the conflict and how a woman's work has massively influenced the world, watch this film when it arrives. I do not see that many other TV films have faced the problem of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. the story avoids the obvious demonization of the "bad guys", and instead shows the denial and the daily hatred that has caused the death of thousands of people. I was moved to different places, and not in a manipulative way of Hollywood with driving music and flashy mise-en-scene, but I was able to discover the horror and implications together with the characters. this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself, and keep the graphics minimized to support it with dignity. <br /> <br /> The actors do an incredible job to bring the intense dramatic scenes to life. the scenes in which the victims give their testimony before the war tribunal is powerful, and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is horrible - no one else has given him the chance to play an Englishman, and when he finally has it, he blasts it! - and even if the body of John Corbett was born to play a soldier / commando, he is a little too fond of it, even if he does a good job.
