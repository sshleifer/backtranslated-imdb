I absolutely recommend this film to anyone who wishes to entertain. The direction, the acting and the story are brilliant. Finally up there with movies like Scarface and the godfather. This movie will make your heart beat. Damian Chapa and all the cast was incredible. I would certainly take this film. Damian Chapa deserves an academic award for his acting, and for the way he played the life of a gangster. This film is a film that will soon be classic and a brilliant film -making.Amato and I give it 10 stars. In one sentence the only way to describe it is a film without flaws. Watch this movie and see what I mean. 2 inches up !!!!!!!
