This is a slightly irregular voice with an extraordinary sequence involving an over-the-hill band that recalls the dinner that once - thirty years before - was their hiding place; a ho-hum duologist between two old musos rock; a noirish rapture shot in the head and an opening sequence (more epilogue) involving the heistabe artist Edward Baer and the current "hot" property Anna Magloulis which has its moments. No film in which Jean Rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here it shines as one of the quintets over the hill, in fact the film deserves to be seen only for Rochefort but each of the sequences has something to offer and is certainly worth giving a look.
