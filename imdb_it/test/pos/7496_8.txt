OK, so this movie is NOT very well known, and it wasn't advertised very well. I discovered this fairly brutal gangster who ended up well in a complete accident on one of Skys' millions of movie channels late on a boring evening, but they are happy The opening sequence of this film is fantastically comic in a very obscure way. This actually defines what I think is the general tone for the film. I think that many critics and fans of the film who have seen this film have been a bit unfair to write it as a gangster film of the lowest budget in the vein of Reservoir Dogs. OK, so there are undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other criminal genre films to which it has been compared, but in all honesty, I think this film takes on a much darkly comic appearance in this type of film, and the end result is a compelling film, well done, funny, if not totally original. Tom Jane is good at this, and deserves the recognition we now hope to get thanks to The Punisher. His performance as the bad boy gone well is realistic, fun and cool enough to make you believe that Casey was really a bad ass before he reformed. It has another thing that makes this movie stand out for me, the characters. In the Nicks band you get the weirdest trio of criminals ever assembled, a smooth, charismatic but very cold leader (Nick), a happy in love blood loving sexual predator of a woman (Dallas) and a psychotic poised with brains for torture (Billy Hill). Throw in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on the screen, beautifully played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... well for Thursday actually. Sometimes obscurely comical, sometimes brutal, sometimes not original, but always compelling and worth watching.8 / 10
