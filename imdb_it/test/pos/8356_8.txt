Where do I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie "Lady and the Tramp" is one of, if not possibly, my favorite in the Disney animation theater fee. The sequel, however, is ... to say the least, pleasant. I enjoyed the whole movie. It was, (protective flame!) Adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the type of film worked, and I was humming the songs for the rest of the night. I can, if you ask me, still sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the film was (really) good for me, it was bad in many other places. The entertainment was sometimes frightening. Whenever you saw someone's face up close, I don't know ... it just seemed scary to me. Besides, where the hell was Lady? In the end he gets two lines of dialogue and only a little dog hug. He gets 0% interaction with the plot and his only child! <br /> <br /> But all in all, I liked it. Compared to the original, does it hold up? No. The songs are not so good (though a bit catchy), the plot was much less engaging, Lady had almost nothing to do with it, and it's not as nice as the first one. But if you come in with an open mind, you'll have fun and maybe "gasp!" I like it?
