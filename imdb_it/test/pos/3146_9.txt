In the world of "shorts" (many of which are not), this film is a jewel. <br /> <br /> A silent and concise overview in the world of a young woman who is a blind woman's reader, here the stellar Elizabeth Franz - this film brings the plots, levels and visual narration of a still life sumptuously painted. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is minimal, cinematography is amazing and direction is safe, clear and compelling. I saw this movie at a film festival held in a noisy and crowded Tribeca bar - and in the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd dropped. <br /> <br /> It says it all.
