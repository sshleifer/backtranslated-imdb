Many other viewers say that this is not a good movie to watch because they feel it is not "realistic". How can it not be considered realistic. They feel that saying that the incest part is not easy to report, which is not common. I can guarantee you that you met more people than you think an incest had. Many of them will not go out and they will say it, and mostly they are victims. Moreover, many people are gay and are still the closest, because no matter how much they would like them to be, they know that they will be ridiculed and perhaps even abandoned. And tell me, how many children did you attend high school with what ended up pregnant or with an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and although pregnancy isn't incest most of the time, it's still easy to report to. Who can't refer to being an outcast or being bullied? always happens. and many viewers are probably involved in education like Marcus. being a stoner seems to be quite common these days. so there are many things to refer to. More than that, however, no matter how popular you become, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, not noticed, or neglected as the victim of suicide, how can you not feel able to relate to the movie? I find the film may have seemed useless to others, but I'd like to think of it as important. It's an interesting way to show that suicide happens and to be aware. it comes from people who don't show their unhappy thoughts, it's very surprising. People who show problems sometimes commit suicide sometimes, but when you hear about suicide, whoever would have guessed is usually going through most people's minds. <br /> <br /> The ending surprised me, I didn't expect it to be the girl who, until the end, was mostly an extra in the scenes, not even introduced. the story, even in its description, tells its 6 teenage lives, when in reality it was 7 years old. My only disappointment was that it was not one of the characters we learned to know, but at first glance it seems like the film was useless to see if the real victim was just a casual girl. until I thought more it made perfect sense to be a big surprise, since that's how suicides are. in addition, those who had to choose who among the other students had more than one reason than the other. <br /> <br /> Although this film has some negative points, most films have few, but I would recommend this film, as long as you can watch the tragic moments of watching suicide, and violence and bad words shown in this film.
