As a fan of Wm. Faulkner from college, I was particularly pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also called Clarence Brown as the director, grew up in the Oxford area having been born there in 1888. We attended a one-week family meeting in Oxford in July 1964, just 15 years after the film was shot. It still looked like in the movie but it was going through a period of upheaval for civil rights like Ole Miss's site. I remember being a beautiful university town in the summer, but I was just an 18 year old second year college and white. I was just starting to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but I still had a long way to go. However, it is worth watching the film, but filmmakers must have had to walk with a tight rope to make it work there and I'd like to learn more about that story. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Oxford is a larger and more modern university city with all the ills that accompany such things and I hope to come back again to see how it has to be changed socially over the last 40 years. Juano Hernandez should have been nominated for an Oscar that year, but Hollywood was still a bigot to make it happen. Other Faulkner stories have been shot in order to search and compare them. One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner from around 1985 starring Tommy Lee Jones. He really captured the intensity of the rural southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively so often.
