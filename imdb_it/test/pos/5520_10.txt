Look, this is a low-budget horror film that suffers from all the problems associated with low-budget films. But you only have to see it to see Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is SMOKING 'hot and a great little actress to boot! These types of horror films often bring to light a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing amuses me more than sitting in my studio with a Coke and putting it in this movie. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree. Lisa isn't just brilliant, she's a bomb. The film itself often trudges and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in this regard. But as soon as Lisa hits the screen, things really start to jump. The others are clearly not in his league. This is not the exorcist, but as I said, if you want to see a funny movie with a little actress, this is the one to see!
