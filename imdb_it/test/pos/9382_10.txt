Watching "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is like waking up in the hospital, two days in a suicide clock <br /> <br />, confusing but strangely stimulating. There are few cinematic equivalents to this disturbing but often entertaining lesson in mythology, morality and surrealist ideology. <br /> <br /> Cocteau's "Blood of a Poet" and the experimental works of <br /> <br /> by Maya Deren evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in DEAD BED. A close comparison is the dark adult fairy tales of literary genius - author Angela Carter, the short disturbing stories of Unica <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of the past <br /> <br />, but shows a completely unique and original plot. <br /> <br /> As a story, the DEATH BED is an incredibly simple but original vision <br /> <br />, something that only one in thousands of independent publications will be able to accomplish. This unpretentious film has its technical flaws but surpasses them all with a cast of beautiful non-actors <br /> <br /> and lost creepy places - a true independent classic from the 70s. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED also shows a unique, subversive, three-dimensional personality - a profound and continuous layering of images and dreamlike ideas that give it a kind of "fun house" construction. The passage of time told in the flashbacks and in the historical journals of the time, the bed with its sinister black humor, the rich yet discreet symbolism used in his imagination. The most welcome thing is the image of Aubrey Beardsly, the suffering artist, trapped forever within the frame of his painting as he comments and caresses himself with the "offers" of the victim killed as a gift of love from the spirit of the bed demented. - A sick refrain and wonderful element / metaphor for "the trapped artist" - Nothing but the most bizarre of POE or MALLARME can match it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates the spirit of independent cinema and yearns for the multi-level symbolist experience, or craves the surrealist concept of "convulsive beauty <br /> <br />" and gothic-horror trends exploitation of the low-budget film will dig this unique vision. A simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic nuances. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *****
