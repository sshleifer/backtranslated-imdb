The first "personal" film by Francis Ford Coppola, completed and published in 1969, was the last film he made as an unknown and rising director before The Godfather, and is in stark contrast both with that film and with the rest of his career irregularity. Apparently it is a road movie that involves a distraught young woman, bored with domestic life, and pregnant with a little girl who is not sure of wanting, running away from the traps of her boring marriage and walking the open road in search of freedom. Along the way he makes friends with a nice man, a former soccer player who suffered brain damage due to a head injury, played in an unexpectedly subtle way by a young James Caan, and decides to "help" him, despite being frustrated by his simple ways . His efforts to get rid of him always fail, either by fault or by accident, and eventually lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded policeman (Robert Duvall), who has his own ideas. The plot is worn, but Coppola does a great job in detailing the emotional life of these characters, and uses editing techniques to relay stories that were not at all common in American movies of the time. The shots are simple, but extraordinarily effective, transmitting both the lunatic desolation of the open highway, and the emptiness of American suburban life, infused with a sweet melancholy provided by the soundtrack of the film. Coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from the point of view of a woman in the culturally turbulent 1960s. Overall, a fairly low-key film that is not what the public expects from Coppola, but which is a small triumph in its quiet, unpretentious way. 7.5 / 10.
