"Nazarin", directed by Luis Bunuel, presents an extraordinary vision of religion in Mexico. As the director wrote and Julio Alejandro, his notable collaborator, this was a film that included Mexican cinema on the international map after receiving the Grand Prix at Cannes that year. It is a disturbing film because Mr. Bunuel delves deeply into what is wrong with the church. <br /> <br /> Nazarin, it seems, is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a squalid retirement of a city. He doesn't have enough for himself, but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears at his window asking for help. At the same time, she brings in her bedroom a prostitute who was injured in a fight with another woman. Andara, the woman repays her kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen going to the country to beg for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from her old city, follow him. Nazarin's life is parallel to that of Jesus. In reality, this holy figure makes a case of humility. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro took the responsibility of creating this film. It is ironic that Spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as a Christian quality, when in reality it is a bitter satire on the Catholic church and its ministers. <br /> <br /> Francisco Rabal, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. This was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal has worked extensively in his native country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, like Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrait of Beatriz. <br /> <br /> A great film by one of the film's master filmmakers: Luis Bunuel.
