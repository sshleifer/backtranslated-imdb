NBC was producing a lot of good products when this series came out, but none of them caught the attention of the spectators. At least according to their leaders who have wisely canceled good shows like Star Trek and My World and Welcome To It because of low ratings. NBC advertisers were getting a deal out of NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show stands out as the only time when James Garner was not enough to win over the spectators. It is true that this show had an excellent supporting cast from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in the Rockford files), to Neva Patterson to Margot Kidder. <br /> <br /> It was set in a western 1900 city. Garner played a sheriff who didn't want to use violence to perform his duties. It was small town stuff, but it was excellent. It wasn't long after Jim Rockford brought Garner back to success, but for my money, this show was pretty good, it wasn't the right time, the right place, or the right opportunity. <br /> <br /> The show was so beautiful that most of the people who worked on this project also found work in Rockford.
