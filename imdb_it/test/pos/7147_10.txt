I really enjoyed this film about love between two adults in post-war Britain. BBC TV's high standards are evident in the production and the excellent main actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make this experience uplifting. Bloom and Ackland have already worked together in the theater, and their chemistry and interaction is splendid. I recommend this version of Shadowlands for the film version of 1993.
