"Christmas in Connecticut" is a real gem and not to be missed for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, precursor of Martha Stewart, is a magazine articulator and the non plus ultra of housewives - the perfect wife, mother and domestic goddess. The only thing is, she is none of these things - a false total. Unfortunately for her, it's going to be discovered. His editor, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn from Sydney Greenstreet) has the brilliant idea of ​​inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas holidays. Only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. The comedy is about how Elizabeth has to keep her true identity hidden so as not to lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague John has a farm in Connecticut, so this solves the problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she doesn't want to marry him. He offers her marriage, even though he knows he doesn't feel the same way for him as he does for her. He makes the offer anyway and assures her that he is willing to wait. And here Barbara Stanwyck, like Liz, offers one of the most devastating putti I've ever heard. With perfect innocence, she replies: "Could you wait that long?" OUCH! Furthermore, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall is fun. They don't seem to like each other (even if one suspects they really do). They are rivals in the family and S.Z. Sakall's torn English is matched by Nora's strangled pronunciation of her name ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" It's amazing how these black and white movies are Christmas. Great character work by all the subjects involved. Don't miss this!
