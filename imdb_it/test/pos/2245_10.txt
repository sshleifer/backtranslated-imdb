Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods from the bucket load. He has a sense of humor ("You're just making up as you go!" "Yes, but I do it brilliantly"), action, monsters (in this case even more cyberman from donkey football), tragedies and intimidating tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of "getting along with it". So, calculate 3 of the last 4 episodes that made you laugh, then they made you cry and made you go "eek". <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, this is clearly Noel Clarke's (and Ricky's) Mickey Mouse. Being one of the Doctor's companions, you know he will do the right thing and might even suspect the way he does it. However, it is still an emotional tear when it confirms its future path. <br /> <br /> While "The rise of the Cybermen" has had more than the sinister accumulation of terror, "The Age of Steel" is an all-out explosion. Like "Alien" compared to "Aliens" - both true classics, but in different ways. Can the series continue like this at this level? Let's hope.
