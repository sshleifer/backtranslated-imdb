This is one of the best interpretations of Cassavetes. The entire cast is exceptional, as is the subtly minimized direction of Martin Ritt. The anger, anguish and desolation of urban trade union battles are beautifully told in a way that is neither intrusive nor patronizing. In a sense it is dated with his era, but in many ways it is gloriously timeless.
