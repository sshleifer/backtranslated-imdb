One of the best "kitchen sinks". Fantastic views of London and priceless fragments of working life in the 1960s. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet it doesn't judge - a taste of things to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it serves as a social film history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, your imagination, you want to take care of her, but keep your head to her self-destructive decisions and continue to follow her in some vain hope. Well supported by Terence Stamp, (fresh from "The Collector", it also captures "The Hit") and a plethora of English faces (all very young). Perfectly set on the delicious tones of Donovan. Timbro sings "Yellow is the color", in an adorable scene, which ends with him saying "Improve, it's not me" (song also used in "The rules of attraction" - I think) Look at the screen of Carol Whites mom ready ' go out and get a boy ', putting his false eyelashes to the sound of' Rosie 'on the radio - priceless. A treasure for whoever was around at the time and a reminder of how good life is now in England. Among other things, Soderburgh used clips from "Poor cow" in "The Limey".
