After watching this movie, I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying that it belongs to the top 250 of all times, but it's a great film of its kind. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like "Robin Hood" has become a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things should not be mocked with ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks did a great job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I also saw Robin Hood's original films, but I never had so much fun watching them as I did with this. It's just a continuation of hilarious moments and parodies of famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend to all those who want to have fun watching this movie. To those who think Robin Hood should not be messed up, you are wrong, but it is better not to look at him because you will probably be offended. I give this movie at 8/10.
