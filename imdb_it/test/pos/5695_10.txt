BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely overcome its limits (it is an independent film) continuously subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience. <br /> <br /> In the tradition of all good animal-centered thrillers, namely Jaws, The Edge, the original Cat People, filmmakers know that moderation and what is not shown are the best ways to make a fist. The performances are real and compelling, the crocodile is extremely well done, indeed if you believe that the site of Black Water is because they used real crocs and the location of the marsh is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a game of bign√† and crocor gorrea B forget the black water, but if you want a smart and suspenseful ride that will make you fear the water and ask me what hell I would do if I were on that tree then it is a must see.
