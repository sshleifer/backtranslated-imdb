This film is not bad bad. It can be a little long at times, but brought by a beautiful scenery, a love letter IMMEDIATELY beautiful and great actors, you forget about the time and have fun. The grand prize, however, goes to Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan as .......... well, that would be to say, but they are simply FANTASTIC!
