As a previous commentator, I saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of compelling story, splendid acting and dramatic soundtrack. It certainly contains some of Sam Waterston's best works. He and the writers describe Oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero - who was - but also as naive, passionate about alcohol and snob, a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype.
