One of IMDb's threads on IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth, about how they watched the movie only because of him. Obviously these were two young women; but what struck me is how little this film has been appreciated by the general public. The bright, and I mean bright, interpretations of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were not noticed, not only by the public, but by the Academy and by most of the critics. <br /> <br /> I think I know why. First, the plot - or actually just the setup - is a sort of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three intriguing daughters they will inherit. Their names also begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril and Cordelia: Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I imagine that "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear". The apparent idea imagined by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was to tell a story similar to Lear from the point of view of her daughters, and to say it a sort of realistic way of the late twentieth century not considered by the Bard. The problem is that, in the story of Smiley and Moorhouse, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a more despicable character, without much in the way of redeeming the qualities. His only strength was his ability to achieve financial success on the farm; however, we can also belittle the fact that his father and grandfather built the farm and inherited it before him. <br /> <br /> The second problem - and this is one that I cannot personally attest, having not read Smiley's novel - is that the film is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel. However, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one, with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen. The vision and the audio needs of the film drown the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints do not allow the full development of the character and motivation achieved by the novelist. Given five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made a film more in tune with Smiley's novel. <br /> <br /> A third problem is perhaps that of Moorhouse. He began his career as a director with the well-made Australian film Proof (1991) with Russell Crowe. He follows it with How to Make an American Quilt (1995) that celebrates women, particularly women of a certain age. However it was a bit heavy and clearly and definitely a chicken hit. In a sense, A Thousand Acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but it does so in a way that may seem politically motivated for some. Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad dad. He beat his daughters and had carnal knowledge of them. He ran the house with an iron fist. Jess (the character of Colin Firth) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a little fun. And then he goes to Rose, who clearly will be the power behind the new property, and ties up with her, while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are unidimensional characters without shades, the way they often appear in romance novels. I think most of the audience has been discouraged by the heavy incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that have been woven into the story. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was partial towards men, but in this story it had to be. I think that Moorhouse did a great job in making an exciting and engaging film about family dynamics that weren't all that good. And the acting of Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational. They seemed to feed on each other in a way that I found to be absolutely authentic and deeply moving. In particular Pfeiffer was compelling as he projected his anger and his hatred bent. The way in which Moorhouse allowed his character to be revealed gradually is a tribute to his ability as a director and to Pfeiffer's extraordinary performance. And the skill with which Moorhouse led the change in Ginny's character as she passed by a "ninny", as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she had left her husband was as shameful as anything else. He needed to go and get her and forgive her and bring her back. And even Robards in his intensity and madness was very good. <br /> <br /> I predict that this film, which was bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the coming years, as people see it on DVD. My question is, whatever happened to Moorhouse? His talent is obvious, but he still has to direct his fourth feature film. When he does, I hope he remembers going with what he believes, but also being honest. I think she was actually fair to the two protagonists of this film, but she didn't pay enough attention to the others. In addition to the unfunded father, Caroline of Jennifer Jason Leigh was unfinished, leaving us to wonder why she had done some of the things she did. And the husbands had to be something more than the dummies. They had to be involved and involved.
