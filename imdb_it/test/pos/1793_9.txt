THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first blow to traditional acceptance. In a turbulent career of only fifteen years, he managed to create an incredible job in film and theater, both as an actor and as a producer, actor and creative director. Although this film may not appeal to many viewers, the film has a lot to offer. The plot is quite simple. A man is ostracized from his middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and proves unable to control his downward spiral. THE FOUR SEASON DEALER is shot with a servile devotion to elegant details, and each set is carefully designed and built. Each object on the set seems painstakingly arranged to cause layers of emotional plot. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak desperately for Hans for a meaning or spiritual direction in his life. Much has been thought of how lighting and color have been used to counteract and improve the drama. Several times during the film, I froze the frame to admire the beauty of the composition of the shot. I streamed this film, and the print was almost flawless and second to none. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement "Anti-Natural" style: he does everything he can to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial way, and this creates a rather pungent effect, however, by doing so, he almost injects' hyper- reality 'to the narrative: more than the presentation of a banal melodrama, the almost absence of affectation of the militant actors forces the spectator to confront the film in a different way: Fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the rehearsal characters and tribulations. You are constantly outside, looking inside. This will be a disconcerting experience for many, but I found it a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
