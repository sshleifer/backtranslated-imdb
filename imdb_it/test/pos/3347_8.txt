I remember seeing this film for the first time with a friend while I was on vacation in Anaheim, California, in October 1976. While driving the streets full of tourists, we saw a movie ad "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX". So before we even saw the Disneyland version of the Lewis Carroll classic half a mile away, our curiosity won and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I also remember before the film began to surprise me seeing this type of film appear in the calm and ultra-conserved Orange County. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND in a local video store. I wondered if it was the same film until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of the beautiful Kristine DeBell in the lead role and I decided to rekindle some good memories. The subversive video, to their credit, has released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. Apparently, the version that my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite the original XXX advertising there. Seeing her the second time, I realize what gave a delightful puzzle director, Bud Townsend, on the screen. As an example of the reach of this man behind the camera, in his days of salad he directed two episodes of TV DEATH VALLEY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Miss DeBell, appearing on the Playboy cover of April 1976, is as ideal as Alice. Brings a new American innocence to the role of librarian in her early twenties who wants a better life. When her boyfriend is repulsed from taking their relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her turning point. This is a "musical comedy", but the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass instruments to compensate for the generally suggestive texts. Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice as she trills at wanting to be free. This is when the magic begins. The rhythm of this film is surprisingly fluid, given that the genre and supporting cast of Wonderland are there to allow Alice as she blooms into a woman. A special mention goes to TV veteran Larry Gelman in the role of the White Rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex since he is always late for an appointment or something. <br /> <br /> The special features include comments from the notorious feminist lawyer Lena Ramone who explains how to watch this film while attending college influenced her in choosing a career as a movie actress for adults after graduation. <br /> <br /> What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND a pleasant excursion is its garden setting. Partly resumed in the lush and natural splendor of Vancouver's B. Stanley Park, the film belies its pornographic roots. Do not come away feeling that you have seen a flash of bleak skin. At the moment, I haven't seen the triple version of XXX. The extra sex movie followed later would in all likelihood interrupt the general flow and remove the light and breezy atmosphere evident throughout. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Lewis Carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore Alice's adventures in Wonderland. However, for a time capsule representing the adult film archives of the 70s, it is worthwhile to follow that white rabbit for a running race full of miracles, ALICE IN WONDERLAND.
