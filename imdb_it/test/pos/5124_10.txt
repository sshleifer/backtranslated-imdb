I read the book before seeing the film, I knew the film would be good because the book was fantastic, I seriously recommend you to see this fantastic fantastic film. I know you will like it. when I went to see him I was there with my sister and there was nobody who was with us I was a little disappointed, but nobody I know came into that movie and came out saying it was a horrible movie. no one can be so beautiful I think everyone will like it (nobody wants to see anyone) anyway I hope that from what you heard about this film from me it will make you want to see this movie, I guarantee you that you will like it like me (I am obsessed) are literally me
