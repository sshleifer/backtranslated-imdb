Having read all of Sarah Waters' books, I couldn't wait to do a BBC adaptation of Fingersmith. Especially since Tipping the Velvet was done so well by the old family member Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed with the results, in fact I think it could be on par with TTV; both romantic and fun. And not as they will make so many ignorant people believe, a useless romp of lesbians. Having been a fan of Elaine Cassidy since seeing her carefree breakthrough in Felicia's Journey, I thought she embodied both the deception and the growing fragility of Maud. His transformation was credible and impressive to look at. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake of Tipping the Velvet, a small role especially for which I did not have so many expectations but she was stunning in the role of Sue Trinder. His eyes were hypnotized, transmitting everything from anger to utter despair. The two of them who got together, combining these talents, made this drama unmissable. Obviously Imelda Staunton was extraordinary as usual, she is unmistakably a national treasure and the supporting cast were all high level. Even the direction of the rather unknown Aisling Walsh used contrasting but beautiful shades of blue for Briar and Brown for London. <br /> <br /> However, the script must be praised by Ransley. Turning a 600-page book in which each line is of the highest quality in a three-hour extravagance is a huge undertaking. It illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace, giving us at the same time a lot of backstory and character development. He has my full admiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a brilliant adaptation in which all the actors involved gave 100% and making this one of the best BBC dramas I've seen.
