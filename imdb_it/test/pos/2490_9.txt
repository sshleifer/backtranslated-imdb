It is said that this film has been or has been banned in the United States since it was released. Since there is no information on IMDb, I have to rely on my other sources and believe it. If this is true, the film is even more painful and scary and it is anyway. <br /> <br /> The film is a so-called mockumentary, although I think the subject is too serious to call it that. It creates a scenario in which America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are immediately arrested without evidence. After a mandatory court they must decide whether to go to prison for a few years or choose the punitive park. In this, they must cross the desert for three days to reach an American flag, placed 50 miles ahead, while they are followed by the police and army troops. <br /> <br /> The film itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both courts and hunting through the desert, filmed by European film crews. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and they film everything. People look directly into the camera, screaming at it. It looks very, very real. Speaking of realism here makes no sense. This film is not about how to make a realistic film, but about what a film like that would be, if it were real. And it certainly would look like this. If it would still be filmed. In a "utopian" state like this, surely there wouldn't be a European film crew that is allowed to film those things. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. The defendants are people of all social classes. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They seem hopeless, rebellious or scared. They are not heroes. They talk a lot in the courtroom, knowing that it does not lead to anything, yet saying everything they said in speeches, books and songs before. One says he is not afraid to die. It's true? Well, you don't have to run through the desert hunted by cops. The defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between the prison and the punishment park, is not really a possibility. The way they decide in the end and the way the film ends, makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These courts remind us of many courts in the Third Reich. Officials use the same kind of idealistic discourse, ignoring all the defendants' arguments, starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet. They warn the defendants to "observe their language" and insult them much more. They ask questions of them, the defendants can't answer, but it's never expected they should. These scenes are a statement about what we call justice. <br /> <br /> The desert scenes are on a different level. When we see prisoners for the first time, we realize that they realize they don't have a chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and thirst, they have no idea how they should endure these free days. The film crew follows them and talks to them as they try to escape this madness. Do they argue, should they play, or run away, or rebel? Everything leads to the same and no one is surprised. Some will wonder if such parks would actually exist in such a state? Why not? Empty the prisons and allow the government to punish the revolutionaries as they wish. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before the concentration camps were built. The comparison is correct, since it makes no difference. <br /> <br /> The film is scary and depressing. The problems we are talking about are familiar sounds to ignore. These are not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that government and democracy as presented to us is not only useless but dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is certainly not the solution. The defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight them. They do things, but not at all. Although this does not provide us with any solution, it is still a statement. <br /> <br /> For me, the scariest thing is the fact of the prohibition of this film. Here we have a film that blames the loss of freedom, morals and peace. However, he accuses the government, a fictitious government, of being dangerous and inhumane. And such a film is forbidden. Think about it when you see the American flag next time.
