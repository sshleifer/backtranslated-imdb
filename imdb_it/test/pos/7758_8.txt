At first glance this is yet another high school anime with many excuses for "fanservice", but there is a lot more going on. The "fanervice" is part of the plot, the main character is a cynical tired (unusual), and above all there is an intelligent plot that links all the episodes together, and this poses some interesting questions. The episodes are deliberately not chronological, and it is certainly worth looking at the series again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> The series deserves to be watched carefully, because there are a lot of random suggestions that prefigure and explain things, as well as a good number of jokes about other series, anime and more.
