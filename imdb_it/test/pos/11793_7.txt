ALICE is the kind of film they made in the 30s and 40s. Never try to be an "event". I just want to entertain. And it does. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a clich√©, he made it real. The plot makes allusions to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A boy dressed in white crosses a hole and Kiefer drops one. Like ALICE the plot turns and turns, but with a freshness that is not seen in small films. I loved the management, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting movie.
