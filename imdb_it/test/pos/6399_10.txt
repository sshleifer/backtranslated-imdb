The biggest problem that the Key West television program has faced is that it was advertised incorrectly. If you saw the advertisements, you would think it was a way to squirm and you'll be deeply disappointed. It was a much more complex show than that. <br /> <br /> I happened to be in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew hit, and I think I found myself having a drink or two with the Rum Runners cast. Of course, that was before the show's success. I saw the sailboat that was in the opening pass a few times, and I chatted with the guy you saw cutting coconuts even in the opening. HE was a real local. Yes, I'd like to see it on DVD.
