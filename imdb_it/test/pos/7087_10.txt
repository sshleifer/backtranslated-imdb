Written by someone who has been there, you can say it, but only if you've been there. Excellent performances by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. <br /> <br /> Many people have said that it is a dysfunctional family, I think every family is dysfunctional when they face this kind of torment. NOT being dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! You are losing your family as you know, can something be worse? People need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change the way they do it. Perhaps they will see that the father is denying himself the precious time in which he will never have a chance again. Perhaps they will understand how difficult it is to die or see someone you love to die. They haven't lost much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
