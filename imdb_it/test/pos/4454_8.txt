In this first work by Fulci the director shows his more mainstream side and a talent for compelling storytelling and a more than reasonable explanation for the genre. Personally I think he was unjustly maligned during his career as a blood esthete. It's a pretty good procedure and it surprises me with its subtually rich narrative that shows its distrust of the small town mentality and police inefficiency, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this kneeling movie when it was released for the first time and could have given the director another direction so soon. The comparative lack of blood in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative for this film in its prevailing "mystery", but the blood and puppets it uses are put to good use here especially in the scene where an unjustly accused murderer is senselessly lynched by a crowd of men in a cemetery and left for dead in a spectacle of treacherous and antiquated vigilantism, cleverly choreographed with the modern melodies of a diegetic radio. <br /> <br /> Another example was the final scene (which was really fantastic) in which an extraordinarily beautiful priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is markedly shown in a middle foreground which accentuates his demonic appearance and its obvious ugliness. Curiously, considering his later works, Fulci also invokes the idea of ​​modernity caught on the village by clinging to his anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of ​​black magic is only that, a characteristic idea of ​​the supernatural evil that never ends for manifested by the voodoo dolls while making her witch nothing but a disturbed woman. Another thing that I liked is that it adds to these layers of characters turning a bourgeois girl into an ambiguous figure - is she the corrupter that the priest fears for his cases and perhaps more explicitly, for himself? This thriller lends itself to becoming one of Fulci's most personal and substantial films, as we get an influx of ideas from him.
