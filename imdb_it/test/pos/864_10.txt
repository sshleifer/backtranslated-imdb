Fun and low-budget comedy at best. This series of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a truly extravagant kid in the Hall. Prepare yourself for some of the most casual and recitative lines, full of ethnic insults and horrible language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedy like this around today. This collection of sketches on a DVD will ensure many views and reviews to appreciate some parts. If you liked The State and / or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for a little glory. If you are considering it even for a younger audience, I would say that every child on earth should see it.
