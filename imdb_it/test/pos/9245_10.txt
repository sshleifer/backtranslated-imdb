Nice docu Stuie! <br /> <br /> Even if it didn't work the way you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic job and a fantastic vision. <br /> <br /> It is clear how much you put into it. <br /> <br /> Also applies to all others. It's nice to see the warts and the whole report of the process without being "too good". <br /> <br /> I loved it! It is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> That penalty, the writer of the "original" film could not appreciate what you achieved. <br /> <br /> Also loves attitude. Great piece. I look forward to seeing the next job. <br /> <br /> Continue like this! paully
