Well, I expected, for all the hype and Oscar nominations, an epic civil war drama (and something with the "greatness" of the "English patient" given the director himself). This film is not of epic stature, but it appears that I was relieved that it was not. It's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war, where young people are sent to fight, deserters are tracked down and killed, and women and children at home are left to themselves while the men are gone. <br /> <br /> However I thought that Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about Jude Law, he was fine too. It seems that Rene Z. had the most fun part of the 3 leads and was able to brilliantly play an uncomfortable and gritty woman with great ease. It was also nice for me to see the actress, Kathy Baker ... someone who has talent needs to be more recognized / recognized. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen - I can't explain why really, but maybe because it's a slice of Americana. <br /> <br />
