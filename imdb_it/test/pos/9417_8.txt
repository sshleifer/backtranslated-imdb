The Sherlock Holmes films of the classic era Universal tend to range in quality. This range goes from very good to above average, with none of their outputs being abysmal or surprisingly bright. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit perfectly in the middle of quality and, as always, it's a fun trip that fans of the series, like me, will appreciate a lot. This film sees Holmes in the midst of a WWII plot by wicked Nazis to steal an invention of a Swiss scientist, which could prove to be a key element on the battlefield. The Sherlock Holmes films of World War II do not tend to be as good as those of The Scarlet Claw in which Holmes conducts private investigations, as they are often persecuted by too much propaganda or a plot that has more to do with war than mystery . This, however, remains quite far from both and by focusing on Holmes and his investigations, the film works much better. Maybe Universal saw what made the previous Voice of Terror collapse and changed the focus because of it. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, once again, performs an excellent independent performance as an ace detective and while Nigel Bruce does not present himself as very normal, it is nice to see him when he does. The two don't spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about Holmes's films; but this allows more time for Holmes to do showboats in various disguises, which is always very funny. Lestrade by Dennis Hoey is definitely my favorite of secondary characters, and while he's not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are grandiose and his presence helps to underline how great Holmes is. His scene with Watson in a car that follows the drips of paint on the street is my favorite moment in the film. It's nice to see Holmes's nemesis, Professor Moriarty coming back, even if it looks like he just got bum-fucked. Lionel Atwill's performance is not as good as George Zucco's in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, since he never really believed he was really a brilliant mind; but seeing him block the horns with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see him in the film to compensate for the themes of World War II, which are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The film begins as a thriller rather than a mysterious film; but once you go on, it's hard to put down and this is a more than solid voice in Universal's work.
