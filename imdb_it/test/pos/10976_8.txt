Manna From Heaven is a light comedy that uses the exaggeration of human weaknesses to entertain the public. Throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will emerge in every situation. The result is that the film-goer is sitting with this silly smile on his face, peace in his heart and high expectations for the human race. Watching this movie was a very pleasant experience. (I would venture to say an exhilarating experience, but some would say that it sounds trivial !!)
