It seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject, there is no shortage of stories that emerge from the Second World War. It is obvious that a conflict of such dimensions as the global war would capture the imagination of filmmakers around the world and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. Heading in a different direction than most mainstream war movies, Dark Blue World, a film that does not address the traditional main battles of the war, does not tell the story of many of its main figures and does not even focus on soldiers of a of the main allied powers or axes. Instead, Dark Blue World ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations. <br /> <br /> The film does a wonderful job in portraying the challenges faced by the Czech pilots flying under the British Royal Air Force, expressing the frustration they felt at both the language barrier between them and the other flyers, but also at be held back from getting revenge against the Germans until they are re-educated. <br /> <br /> Dark Blue World also works quite well outside the arena of war movies as a story of human relations. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an English woman who complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. This relationship is very well interpreted and develops in almost a father-son relationship in many places. <br /> <br /> Air combat in the film is among the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy and transmit commands and responses in an unknown language. The tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground, just as the tension on the ground continues to feel in the air. <br /> <br /> It may not be a movie for everyone. The war film enthusiast may find his exploration of relationships a bit daunting, but overall it is an excellent film regardless of the bellicose element or not.
