Martial arts films became huge in the 1960s in parts of Asia, but with the growing popularity of the infamous Shaw Brothers films, America was bound to take hold. This film was the first to be presented in America with the Warner Bros. label and has in fact begun a craze here that flooded the 70s with martial arts films. Many of the films that follow will pale in comparison, but some were fantastic and many like Enter The Dragon (which came out shortly after this) became huge success stories and made the superstars out of these fighters. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost 40 years later and this film still holds. Most of the Shaw brothers' films are as good today as they were then and the truth is that none of the films was made in this genre to compete with those produced by The Shaw Bros later in the day. <br /> <br /> I like to think that martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot, only the action, the same goes for MA movies and most of them are just a pile of big fights with a little story, this is an exception. It doesn't have a fantastic story but there is one there. <br /> <br /> The protagonist played by Lo Lieh stands out among the heroes of karate cinema. He never boasts and never fights just because he can, he is often seen as weak and less combative than most, but when he has to fight, he is damn the biggest one alive. I really loved this character. Many of the villains were memorable and the fighting scenes were presented so surprisingly. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as the huge Mongol, and Bolo is in my top 5 as the biggest martial movie star ever, he was also in the aforementioned Enter The Dragon. <br /> <br /> the production, as I have said over and over again, is wonderful, you can't beat the Shaw, the direction was something different from what I saw a lot in the films of the 70s, the use of color was well positioned and made this independent film over the others When the light shines on the hands of Chi Hao as it does with Iron Fist, its pure beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was also superb. Martial arts films were in Asia what westerns were in Italy, two separate art forms with so much in common. The countries that made these films had all the genres, but Japanese films were what was making itself felt like spaghetti westerns in Italy. With their many differences the styles of these two genders were head to head. As seen in films like 5 Fingers Of Death, the fights were easily compared to Sergia Leoni's cowboy attacks, and the music tied genres so well. The music here was borrowed a little from Ironside, but it was still very original. <br /> <br /> Many films have been inspired by this and when I look at it I can see anything from The Master Killer to Bloodsport being influenced. The most obvious film to have been influenced was Kill Bill, who for me is the greatest of all time. Many of the sets used by Quentin are complete replicas of those seen here and he used the music of this film, even though the music he used was the music borrowed from Ironside. And the fighting scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is sometimes exact compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese thug at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen many martial arts films, some even better, but this is a MUST-SEE for fans of the genre. You can't go wrong here. The film starts slow but in 15-20 minutes it resumes and does not slow down.
