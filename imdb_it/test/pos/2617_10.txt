Piper, Prue and Phoebe take Dr. Griffiths to the Manor to try to save him from The Source's personal killer, Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows for a spell to defeat Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him down the street. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a journalist and his cameraman using their powers and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done. Leo goes down to Phoebe and tells her that the sorcerers were exposed as witches. On the surface, Piper is hit by a witch doctor and Prue has to take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. So Prue must use her magic on the crowd and go to the hospital. Piper is declared dead and a SWAT team moves. Leo learns about Piper's death and goes down to tell Phoebe. Cole is asked to ask The Source to reset the time, and The Source agrees; only if Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will shatter them. On the surface, Prue and Piper are fighting against Shax. Prue screams for Phoebe, who unbeknownst to them is in the Underworld. Shax throws Piper and Prue through a wall and Dr. Griffiths comes out of a window. Prue is not declared dead until the season four season premiere episode, "Charmed Again, Part One". <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a compelling episode and made me sit on the edge of my seat. Sad that Prue is dead, but happy that there will be five more Charmed seasons. My vote; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
