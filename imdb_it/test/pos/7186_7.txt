The French are not known for being great film producers. <br /> <br /> Even if their Amelie got high scores at the Oscars. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a very different film than the one I'm used to from French. It is a fantastic film especially for children. The only thing that embodied me was that it was spoken in French and with subtitles. Normally with movies spoken in English (here in the Netherlands) I don't have to read subtitles. But with the French language you just have to read to understand. The story itself is simply fantastic with Obelix not remembering himself for being fat, but there are also nice details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the history of comics and this film shows most of the slides by scrolling through the book. Everything is inside, from Sfinx's nose braking until the pirate red beards lose three more ships. I would say a good movie for the weekend with the children.
