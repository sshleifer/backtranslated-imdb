A film so fantastic: I was paralyzed all the time and so emotionally passed in the end! The two young male actors of the film were more than compelling in their performances as their friendship and mutual support were quite credible and I thought that the confrontation / contrast between their respective domestic lives and health situations were so real between them . The success in giving life to this film was obviously a team effort so for actors, EPs, producers, writers, directors and the whole production, I say "WELL PLAYED!" Having lost the opening credits at the beginning of the film (which was shown on HBO), I was so very surprised that I actually had to search (albeit briefly) on the internet to find the title of this film - something so big I should have known from me - a clear indication that this film must be republished!
