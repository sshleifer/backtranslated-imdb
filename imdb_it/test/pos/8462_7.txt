I saw this movie when it came out and then a couple of times later. I'm looking at it now, 20 years later, and it's still a good story. Is it "movie life network"? Yes, but alas, life didn't even exist then, so some air was needed. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent. The story was a bit schmaltzy; two women become close friends and without the knowledge that one of them has a relationship with the husband of other friends. She was invited home for a dinner, and that's how she finds out that her lover is her best friend's husband. She is horrified and tries to interrupt the relationship. Shortly thereafter he is tragically killed in a car accident that is deviating for both women. Obviously his wife accidentally finds this out and wants Holly out of her life now, but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very nice story about big cast and perfomrances. I really enjoyed it.
