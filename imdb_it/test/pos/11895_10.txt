This movie is a perfect action movie / drama / thriller, every scene has sucked you. I watched this movie and was amazed by how many talented actors were in the film. Damian Chapa was exceptional, he played his role perfectly. the story was made for these actors. The characters make the film so realistic. This film gets quite simply a plus from me. Watch this movie satisfactorily, compare it to Scarface, but have a deeper story. This film not only gives you a good picture of the life of the gangster, but also gives you the emotional characters, and in the end you really feel for the main character. Watch this movie !!!!!!
