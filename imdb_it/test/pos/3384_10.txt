I really enjoyed the North and the South. I think it's one of the best and most sumptuous television series I've ever seen. The caliber of the cast is incredible, you have actors from the "golden age of cinema", people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80s like Patrick Swayze, James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genie Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. <br /> <br /> At the center of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, there is Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) from the south and George Hazard (James Read) from the North. Throughout the series, their friendship is continually threatened by differences in their backgrounds, particularly with regard to the treatment of slaves in the South (especially in the Orry plantation) but when everyone needs the other, they will forget the topics and go to help the their friend. I really liked the feeling between the two men and I was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war. I liked how the series showed what life was like before the war, so the public could see what the factors that led to the war were, what was happening at the time, then the devastation of a nation that had been cut to pieces and then the nation had to rebuild the country again. The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic for me. <br /> <br /> I think there is a great success in this, there are so many elements that go through it, romance, history, battles that would interest most audiences, there is something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the love story between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she stood up for the first time with her sister Ashton. The other novels were interesting because they weren't all the same, everyone had something different from the others that prevented me from looking particularly at the Madeline and Orry plot to see if they would eventually be together. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best American mini-series I've seen, the story had the right balance of romance and the most serious side of the story that was happening in the country at the time, but it's set just right. The characters are very watchable and the settings are beautiful and the music, particularly at the beginning and end of the episode, is so pleasant and works with the atmosphere of the story.
