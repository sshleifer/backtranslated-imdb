I wish I had met Ida Lupino. When people ask who you are if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century people at dinner, well, for me one person would have been you. I think he is now one of the great unknown and not profiled personalities of the film industry. His life story would be a fantastic film (Hey, Mr Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino was the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. I remember being saddened to see it reduced to a horrible part in a horrible AIP film in the late 1970s. It was bitten by a large worm at the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted her, since she died not long after ... more on the side than by the worm. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary thriller RKO On Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino was often the leading producer and actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff they produced many timeless noir dramas that are still very compelling today. One of these is JENNIFER which I think is the last film with a copyright of Monogram Pictures. Monogram formally changed the company name to Allied Artists in 1953 and JENNIFER has both company names in the opening titles. It is a haunted house thriller of superior quality as much as scary as The Innocents and The Haunting did 8 years later. Really chilling and very disturbing, this tiny film is exactly the kind of excellent film made by Ida Lupino and for which he was responsible. Try to find it ... you will always remember it and, as I feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
