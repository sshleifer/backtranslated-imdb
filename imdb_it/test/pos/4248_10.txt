I must admit I had never heard of this movie. I took it last night on TMC. I thought he was hysterical. I laughed so much and loved the ending. Imagine what a film by the Marx brothers would want if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then everyone left LSD. <br /> <br /> Funny and angular are two words abused these days, this film certainly has more than 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surreal to start. I had to be up at 6:00 and watch it until 2:30. I slept and lost my obligations. It is still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend owning it. It was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that the references are so dated and may not be obtained by the younger ones. Bare with it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I should put it in my best comedies of all time.
