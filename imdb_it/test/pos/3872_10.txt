of TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who plays Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, a cold-blooded criminal recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who killed his father. A week after his father's death, a preacher, Reverend Packer, died. Reggie had to be the only one who killed him, but is it true? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it an installation type? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes. See, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and J-Bone doesn't approve of his beloved demon. While J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie discovers that love is about forgiveness. But what is J-bone doing, is it working? Does Reggie and her girlfriend melt or get closer? I like this movie because it lets you think about what happens next and did this or that. I like movies with suspense! It makes you want to be in the movie so you can detect things. I also like this movie because everything falls on the spot, if you really pay attention to it!
