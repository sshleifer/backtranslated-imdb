When I was younger, and today, Mr. Bean is a brilliant work. Rowan Atkinson, three times nominated for the BAFTAs, interprets the almost silent (imitating) human-looking alien that fell on Earth causing chaos and trouble wherever it goes. He tried to do an exam, he put his pants in front of the blind man (he didn't know he was blind), he went to church, he tried to jump into a pool, he prepared lunch on a park bench, he saw a scary movie , changed to his car, picnicked with a flyer who broke in, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), took care of a child in Portsmouth, was in room 426 of the Queens Hotel in Portsmouth , won a competition with his Teddy, rode on top of his Mini in a new chair, and even met and knocked out the queen. Guests include Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock of They Think It's Over, Caroline Quentin, The Day Today, David Schneider, Richard Wilson, Eryl Maynard of the Fast Show and Roger Lloyd-Pack of the Vicar of Dibley. He was named BAFTA for the best comedy (program or series) and the best light entertainment program. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 of the 50 Greatest British Actors, was number 24 of comedian comedian, and was number 8 of Britain's favorite comedian. Awesome!
