I consider this story to be loving and sensibly written, to be one of the true masterpieces of the screen. After watching this film, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in Los Angeles, California, when it came out, many years passed before I had the opportunity to relive it. The beauty, the sober simplistic elegance and the tranquility of the film for me, put it aside from many, many others of its kind. Yes, tears still come to my eyes when I see it, and I hear the refrain of that song once in my life. perhaps again, today my number one of all the most beloved films. I hope this classic love story will be appreciated and appreciated by our future generations.
