This film plunges headlong into the realm of the surreal at Lynch and Jodorowsky - with a strangely compelling atmosphere, cradling the viewer with the dreamlike intensity of his images. <br /> <br /> The narrative is being savored - the narrator trapped behind a painting (adjacent to the bed), which often speaks for it, vocalizing his desires and his reasoning. Yes, Beardsley would sound that way. <br /> <br /> There are some flaws, but its strengths overwhelm its weaknesses. The sequence with the woman tearing herself from the bed and crawling on the floor, trying to escape, will leave you breathless. <br /> <br /> The film has an air of fin de siecle; and should be read as a disarming cry from the bowels of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and immerse yourself in it.
