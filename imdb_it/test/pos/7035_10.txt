This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is a film I could probably see every few weeks and still love. <br /> <br /> There is something timeless about this film. I loved other "successful love movies" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think they're up there, but there's something about Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Gray, the direction of the film, the INCREDIBLE dance, the warm summer atmosphere, everything about dirty dance is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic and I've never seen a movie like this before or after. <br /> <br /> I don't think there is a particular element that makes this film so loved but many things, one of which many are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summer mood, realistic characters, an honest and recognizable message combined with incredible music and dances, and that of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it until they show it. But I will mention that I have no interest in seeing "Havanna Nights", which they should have left alone.
