I had heard about this show for the first time in 2005, first online and then looking (and obviously buying) the book in English, generally beautiful. Then I took the DVD; did not disappoint! I had hoped for years that someone could do a science fiction program with an emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens, laser-gun fights and other Hollywood tricks! Thanks, Joe Ahearne (also for your working Dr. Who, and Ultraviolet - the mini-series, not the shitty movie of the same name)! What forced me to write this now (2 years later) was that I saw SUNSHINE last night. And what seemed to be in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY turned into (about 2/3 of the way) Freddy Krueger meets 2010! It was then that SPACE ODYSSEY stood out as a positive example of how to make a real science fiction film; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (like SUNSHINE) also addressed the shortcomings of the astronauts (Zoe's failed EVA, Ivan's excessive efforts on Venus, mission-controlled spats) and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unknown dangers (the peak of fatal radiation on Mars). I would have easily paid to see him in a theater (I-Max, anyone?). And to top it all off, not only were the spatial visions incredibly beautiful, but the characters were also well designed. I found their interaction more realistic than the histrionics hit on the wall of the crew of Icarus 2 of SUNSHINE (Icarus, silent name for a solar mission - someone read the mythology of Icarus ??). Sometimes you need a film that is not too good to force one to review a better movie. As an armchair astronaut, I exchanged my pass on Icarus for a seat on Pegasus every day. In all honesty, however, SUNSHINE's images are quite stunning and quite memorable. This is why I have been so successful that it has become an honest and good science fiction film. So, although this review is almost a review on the back of SUNSHINE, I hope it is read for what it was supposed to be; strong support for a BBC TV series that succeeds where the largest and most inflated cinema glasses fail. SPACE ODYSSEY (a.k.a. VOYAGE TO THE PLANETS here in the United States) whets the appetite for solidity, science fiction and distributes a banquet. I also really liked the pseudo-documentary approach. Regarding the time delay / low-speed quirks, they have been addressed, if you pay attention. Where SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY remains calm. If you are thinking of going to the cinema for another dose of SUNSHINE, stay; go instead for a real ODYSSEY SPACE!
