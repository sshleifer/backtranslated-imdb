The plot is predictable. It has been done many times in other films. You have summer camps competing in this: rich children against underachievers who compete to "brag about" rights in typical field competitions, while children and comforters pursue jokes, sex and "a good time!" "Are you ready for summer?" Meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for a wellness comedy. As others have published, it is not Citizen Kane, but this type of film is not meant to be. The film works thanks to the wonderful comic times and Bill Murray's classic one-liners. His scenes with a camper in which he tries to increase the child's self-esteem are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the film are a lot of fun. I also like that this film is not as dirty or explicit as many other "teenagers in the field" films today. There is some slight sexual allusion and perhaps one or two words of discontent throughout the film. But Meatballs is the kind of kid movie that is appropriate for the younger audience. It is classified PG. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you have to watch a couple of times to get all the jokes! When Bill Murray is on the screen or doing one of his classic "PA Announcements", you are attracted to the movie. Bill seems to bring the movie all by himself. But he does it so well, that when you see Meatballs, you'll understand that this is the movie that made him a star! A side note of this review is to avoid ALL the sequels from the Meatball movies. They are horribly bad.
