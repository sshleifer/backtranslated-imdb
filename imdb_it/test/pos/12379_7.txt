* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I don't care what anyone says, this movie is a bit hilarious. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a serial killer convicted of being executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying chemicals to manipulate DNA that make human DNA linked to dirt or this case, to the snow. The first film was simply boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him. <br /> <br /> Or so they thought. <br /> <br /> This film takes place about a year after the second. Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is ever given for the reason why they do it, they simply do it. Meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested Frost in the first will arrive in the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all. It has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in the mouth and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They also say "Dada!" like children I will have to give to the creators of this credit. Snowballs are some of the nicest little things you have ever dreamed of. I would like to have one as a pet. The frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman had the ability to influence the main weather conditions. <br /> <br /> Then there are the actors. There's Manners, the FBI agent for the first movie, except here wearing an eye patch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I'm an FBI agent! Yarrr! And then there's the stereotype of the British adventurer and the stereotype of black Jamaica with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The most fruitful man on the face of the planet, without exception. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but it's hilarious. I laughed my ass all the way, and recommend it to everyone who loves a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
