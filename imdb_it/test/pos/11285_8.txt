Begotten.The magic.The Terror. The slight boredom. <br /> <br /> That "Begotten" is for acquired tastes, it is obvious that you do not happen to watch it unless your friends are a real movie of you buffs.You have to dig the bizarre, the macabre, the bizarre. You have to dig fantastic movies. And you have to dig to find diamonds. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man. The visual part is something to look at, something that nobody can prepare for you. But since the film lacks any kind of dialogue, the visual part is practically the only part ... "Begotten" is a visual film. The soundscapes created for the film are magical and revolutionary but still ... the view .... <br /> <br /> God commits suicide in a particularly bloody scene, then from his corpse rises Mother Earth that is soaked with the sperm of God and gives birth to Flesh on Bone, a retarded child. Then he abandons him, and is tortured by creatures like the pagans. Mom comes back (did she do it to you?) But she and her son are killed by the horrible creatures. <br /> <br /> The film is about the meaninglessness of life and the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and die, and that when something dies something else is born etc. Nihilism. <br /> <br /> The quality no.1 of the film is obviously the graphics, the setting, those haunting images, this otherworldly quality .... After you It's so fascinating. <br /> <br /> When people say it should last 30 'instead of 70' they are right. They are not, it could last 40 "It's just that everything happens at such a slow pace. In reality, the summary of the plot that I provided is all that happens in the film, as if not joking. Again, it is .... I don't know .... Glorious ... <br /> <br /> ... Like a flame that burn away the darkness ...
