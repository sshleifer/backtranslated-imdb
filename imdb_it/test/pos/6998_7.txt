This movie starts badly. An incredibly banal monologue is immediately followed by an incredibly brilliant and truly fantastic spaceship accident. Then things go down again, while you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all fit too well into the role of monster-forage. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, preventing the public from getting to know the characters. You feel like you're watching "Deep Blue Sea" meets "Silence of the Lambs", minus the beautiful pieces. And unfortunately, the whole thing tries to be "Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter" during the daytime scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he is not Anthony Hopkins, and frankly annoys like the intelligent and hypocritical psychotic. There is at least one very beautiful scene involving an unexpected survivor - but other than that you could even cut the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But then things change. I can't pinpoint the exact moment, but the film will improve a lot soon. He also feels less cut off - the scenes actually begin to follow with a coherent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes a lot less annoying and is soon a thief of shows. The moment the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite pleasant. When night falls, it's fantastic. Exciting, terrifying and exciting. And the character development of most of the main characters is also well done. If you can sit among the poor pieces at the beginning, fantastic entertainment awaits you. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the images are pleasant and I sincerely admit: I love the color and tone of this film. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (may have been 9/10, if only ....)
