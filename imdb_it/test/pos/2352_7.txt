It is 1913. A boy in the studio discovers the actress who will become the next big star of Hollywood cinema and he is the director that is about to happen. After inventing the pie launch and the key police, his dream becomes reality. Being completely absorbed in his film, however, he fails to notice that he is losing his protagonist in another man. Several over-budgeted flops later, it is known as nothing but the director who rejected Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, faithful and compassionate Hollywood residents are not contaminated by ambition and ego. He'll be fine as long as he still has his friends. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a dizzying comedy typical of the period, and in the opening scenes it holds its with the best of them. He has a ludicrous lack of self-awareness that is seriously absent in most of today's comedies. In the film, however, he moves away from this comedy mode and instead tries to entertain us with the films of the film. They are silent comedies, well done but nothing out of the ordinary, and last much longer than is necessary for any public that has seen the originals. On his return, the film takes a dramatic turn. It's well written and the cast does a great job of transitioning, but the film really should have decided right from the start what it would have been. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, it turned once again - this time into a paean for the Hollywood twinkle. The small city of Los Angeles has grown to become the city that makes films that entertain the whole world. <br /> <br /> Despite the promising beginnings, this film has not aged particularly well. However, it has some strong scenes, a certain nostalgic charm and a funny subtext about the people who created it and the audience for which it was created.
