This is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's great to see in a group, I find. It's great for all Alan Rickman fans too, he does a great job. It's compelling, funny, very surprising ... you have to watch it twice, at least. I didn't look at it with anyone who didn't like it or at least found it useful.
