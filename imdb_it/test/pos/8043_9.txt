Smooth, tidy and well made old school version of how a great international thriller should be done. Determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as "Carlos the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Unlimited", "Space Cowboys"), a CIA agent and his Israeli counterpart, Amos (Ben Kingsley, " Gandhi "," Sexy Beast ") gets a naval nobleman, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn," Music of the Heart "), to become Carlos and use it in a daring plot to get the KGB to kill the real Carlos, because he took an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the film really belongs to Quinn here, who is embodied here (in a dual role). Director Christian Duguay and filmmaker David Franco provide another great asset of the film here with Hitchcockian suspense and great world views.
