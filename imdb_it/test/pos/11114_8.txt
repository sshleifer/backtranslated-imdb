Although at first glance this film seems to be the story of your parents' high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this film is WAY exceeded) ... and I admit that that was MY first impression .... but honestly the "lessons" learned from the heroes / heroines are final. NOT obsolete. Who doesn't want to be famous? And who doesn't want to be accepted by my peers? And the homosexual boy - isn't there any controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? This film, although published in the 1980s, still faces some of the biggest problems in today's world. However, this film has a bit too much obscenity and nudity for my taste. (therefore the vote 8/10)
