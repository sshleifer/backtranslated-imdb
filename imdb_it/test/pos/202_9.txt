In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are deeply in love with each other. With World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front the day before Veronika's birthday, and they have no chance to say goodbye. Waiting for news from Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris Mark's cousin (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and continues to wait for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heart-breaking love story in wartime. The director is excellent and uses ellipses throughout the story, including in the capital scene when Veronika is raped by Mark. Camera work is amazing, with sophisticated plans and angles and long journeys. The scenes of Veronika in the middle of the tanks, or in the train station with many figures are fantastic. The magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a moving and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti-war film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "When Voam as Cegonhas" ("When Fly the Stork")
