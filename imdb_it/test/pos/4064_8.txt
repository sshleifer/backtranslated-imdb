I'm not going to go too deep, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There were no funny slapping scenes on your knee (which I can remember), but it had its moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy brings out a rather fun performance. Rene Russo was fine in the film, there are no complaints. There were two characters in the story that I liked and didn't explain much. The first was a friend of Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) in the gym played by Ken Campbell. I assumed he was just a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character that I liked was Mitch Preston's colleague / partner (Robert De Niro) played by Nestor Serrano. I guess it was just another cop working with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if it was his partner or not. I think maybe I'm thinking too much about a movie, I mean after all, it's a comedy ... who cares about the characters? I think so though. I was very pleased to see that this was directed by Tom Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon. Since I saw that movie I couldn't wait to start his next job. I think he did a good job with this film, and I'm looking forward to his next job. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend paying the full price for a ticket unless you're a fan of Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo. It was worth seeing at the theater, but not at full price, I would recommend seeing it at the matinee price. <br /> <br /> Also, here are some interesting facts about the film for you. The guy who played the camera man, played by Judah Friedlander, is the guy in Dave Matthews' band's "Everyday" music video. He was also the employee of "Meet The Parents", also played by Robert De Niro. ... And what's more, he also played Derek Zoolander's brother in "Zoolander" (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller). Just some useless curiosity for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you like the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
