What a wonderful film, full of eccentric and unique characters that are wonderfully crafted by a great ensemble cast. The director has also done a great job keeping the story together, getting those wonderful performances (not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the main role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor it is, and although I liked it a lot on Law and Order, this really shows what it can do with a complex and full role. Macy Gray is exceptional, Mos Def, as usual, wonderful. Lou Gossett, fantastic. Jimmy Smits, fantastic, and doesn't try to focus because he's a star. A true piece of acting ensemble. <br /> <br /> Rent it, have fun, have fun and darling. Something special.
