Written in an intelligent way, well acted, intense and full of suspense. This show lives in the real world, not as fantastic as the "24" (and I'm a big fan of 24, by the way). It has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most of this genre. Try to present both sides of Islam. So far, I've seen the first 4 episodes and found the story more balanced. Terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. And as a result of that balance, the terrorists become scarier than the typical villains that are portrayed in movies and on television. Last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon. I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like.
