I know that to include everything in the book, the film should have been several hours long, so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and crucial to the story. I thought the casting was great, the kids who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were particularly touching. I thought the settings they used were interesting ... the scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China, and a scene that took place in Fremont, California (the graduation scene) was shot on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked as an extra in "Kite Runner" one day and it was that day, the day they shot the graduation scene. We talked about Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s, and then we took our seats in the audience. They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. It was nice to see the actors up close and even see the author of the book, who was available as a history consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the film to anyone. This is a moving story of friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. "There is a way to be good again."
