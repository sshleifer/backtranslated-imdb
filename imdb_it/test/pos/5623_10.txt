Let's face it, many bad movies are made all the time. For those working in the cinema, you've probably spent a lot of time and effort on many of these plot wonders. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, it is the act of simply making the film that is important to us. To tell a story (no matter how simple and unrealistic). Furthermore, the collaborative process is a key feature that is unique to film and theater. To produce a production of any caliber, it is necessary that the talents of a variable amount of people, depending on the scale, give life to its history. The most intriguing part of the American film, however, is not the film being filmed. He is the filmmaker himself, as a character in his own life, which requires our attention. None of them serves as a model for the filmmakers we know and work with. But, I will argue, they are archetypes of small parts of us trying to be part of this cult activity of independent cinema. (Okay, a very small part of us) These are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and just like that they get caught up in the romanticism of cinema. This brings me to my next topic. American Movie captures the raw spirit of the independent film. Bad stories told (nowadays) by digital films with neglected effects and horrible performances - because this is the best they can do with a budget of a couple of thousand dollars instead of a studio budget of several million dollars a day. This is the difference between low-level LOW productions and studio productions. The independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even non-linear story to run at best with the money he is investing in himself and the resources around him to see a finished product on his TV in ruins. Robust individualism materializes in every form of art. I find this film to be a brilliant document of truth for many directors. And no, I'm not full of myself. Friend, these people are fun. Their problems seem hilarious, their characteristics are hilarious. Best movie line: "It's okay ... It's okay ... There's something to live for! ... Jesus told me !!!" Said a million times from a funny old man. The hat goes to Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
