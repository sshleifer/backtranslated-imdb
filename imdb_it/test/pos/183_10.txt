This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in the history of cinema. Seeing this film, we can only observe retrospectively that the world cinema of the 1950s had a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and adequate use of sound image editing and almost the religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Thus, cinema was not only a form of art. It was much higher than ordinary life and gave many people the hope of living after the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso was moved and cried that a similar work of art could only appear once every 100 years! The audience was also different. I read that after seeing "Ikiru (Live)" by Kurosawa in its first release, a young couple said softly: "It's a good film, isn't it?". I think that contemporary cinema, although technically developed and open to a new narrative perspective, has lost the most important - public dependence. Once it was truly the most popular art and, unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music, it gave millions of people hope and ideals. In this view, "Letyat zhuravli" must be in the pantheon of all-time classics, such as "City light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
