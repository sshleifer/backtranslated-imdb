America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. She has an excellent hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals in the world of modeling who contribute to something they had not yet achieved: to present a real American Next Top Model. Obviously this is not something easy to do, so the United States and the world would already have 10 top models competing and fighting each other in this cruel world. <br /> <br /> But it is obvious that his intention is not to present America's next top model, but yes, the American Next Pop Model. The show brings together a group of models without any experience with different personalities and great personal, professional and financial problems, giving them the chance to give life to a dream or to make their life something worthy. It is obvious that Tyra Banks uses all this to her advantage, she gives the dream, but in exchange she gets public and more popularity. However, he deserves it, because he is intelligent and, if I may say so, a pioneer of this kind of show. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to give opinions based, differentiating himself on other models and hostesses of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, for example, Fernanda Motta is her hostess and model "once in a while". He doesn't even have 1/10 of Tyra's professional skills, which keeps Tyra Banks at the top. Tyra has a professional and personal knowledge of what she says and she is a great mentor because she not only criticizes, but indicates error and teaches the right path wisely. <br /> <br /> The show does not suffer from major problems, it does and realizes what it promises during the cycles. The models chosen to work on the show are in fact not the best unknown models of the entire country because Tyra Banks points with the difference, and she is right, because she (and a good part of her audience) believes that it is time for the modeling world. to change some straight parameters. During the cycles, she and her team really make the right reflections, where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new possibilities to demonstrate their abilities, but they must be quick to do it, otherwise they lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows how to decide who should or should not win even when it is against public opinion. He knows that whoever wins will be famous, but he has very little chance of truly being a top model recognized worldwide. In the same way he knows that, sometimes, the second place is more precious than the first, because the 1st place wins the title, but the second does not get the stigma of the title. Hardly makes mistakes when deciding the future of any model during the show. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas, it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines because it's getting boring and comparing the first few cycles we can see that she's getting bored too , so he needs to do it if he wants the show to live a little longer. <br /> <br /> However, the show explores fashion and shapes the world, but it's also fun for those who live outside of it. It gives the opportunity to some girls and even to the market, and also gives excellent advice to those from the public that shares the same dream.
