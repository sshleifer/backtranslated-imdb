Yes, it's a bit rough. But it's full of suspense and entertainment, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limits of the plot and the characters. It is interesting to see David Soul as "bad boy"; I thought it was quite credible - and rather chilling - since the increasingly paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a longtime favorite - I think he gives his character a good life; and Sam Waterston was the quality of the stars in everything I saw - film or TV. <br /> <br /> I watch this film every once in a while but our tape (a copy of the VHS TV I received) is of such poor quality that it's hard to fully enjoy it. This is a film I think they should publish on DVD; maybe it wouldn't be universally researched, but I'm sure there are many people like me out there who love this kind of movie so there would be a market for a DVD version. I will continue to hope!
