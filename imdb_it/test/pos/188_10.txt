Sick of the current film production, particularly American cinema, I tried to see Oscar-winning foreign films. That's when I came across this gem. Slow to start, it resumes well once the war is declared. In practice, an old girl-wait-for-boy-of-return-from-war-history, performances, cinematography make it so much more. Because Tatyana Samojlova as a young woman did not become an international star after this is beyond me (even though she remained victorious in her country). You make the journey with her: a young impetuous and provocative girl who, through the ravages of war, becomes a very sober and gloomy woman who keeps a glimmer of hope (her final scene is devastating). We love it as much as the camera. And work with the camera! Was this the pioneer of working with the portable video camera? It really adds an immediacy to the story. And its beauty (like when Tatyana's character is running up the stairs and near a slatted fence). I am humble and grateful to see this movie.
