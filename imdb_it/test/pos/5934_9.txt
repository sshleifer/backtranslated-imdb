Shawn Michaels vs. Edge-8 - Hard to believe Shawn Michaels is in the opening game but it's still a great match for both men, Edge, whether you like it or not he is a great performer in the ring, and Shawn Michaels is ageless when it comes to the his performance The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich. Casket Match-2- OK, after a good opening match, now this, what a bad game. Undertaker gave some good matches at the Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same type of match, but this is worse than that match. <br /> <br /> Kurt Angle Vs. Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6 Okay, I feel that all three men could perform better, that just didn't show them at their best. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs. Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship-9- Triple H gets a clean win, you can believe it, sure he pulls out the Sledgehammer but doesn't use it. Randy Orton was great when he behaved as if he had a concussion, but the way he got the concussion is really ridiculous. I really liked this game, this was the best performance I've ever seen from HHH. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7- This was a lot of fun and I didn't usually mark the game of real rumble this high. The winner is again, very predictable, but just this has had many moments that have been very fun to watch. The segments with Flair and Guerrero are hilarious the best segments I've seen in a while. <br /> <br />, this is a great PPV and a must for wrestling fans.
