Being the second historical drama of Warner Brothers with Civil War and Battle of the Little Big Horn, General George Armstrong Custer, MADE DEAD WITH THEIR BOOTS (Warner Brothers, 1941) was the more precise of the two; especially if in contrast to SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which really didn't put the level very high. <br /> <br /> BENCHE both images were protagonists of vehicles for Errol Flynn, there was a change in casting the part of General Custer. While it was "Dutch", himself, Ronald Reagan who portrayed the flaming and egocentric horseman in the previous photo, with Mr. Flynn playing Virginian and later General Confederate Hero, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took the part of Custer for THE HOMME DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. <br /> <br /> Once again, the inclination of the Warner Brothers to use a large number of reliable character actors from "Warner's Repertory Company" is used in giving the film is a kind of authenticity, and everything is really happening right in front of our own eyes. The main roles are played by better known actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), "Californy" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel), Callie (the bacon's maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is chock-full of non-accredited actors, though skilled as: Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe , himself), Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many others. <br /> <br /> The film moves very quickly, particularly in the early years; then a sort of slowdown by necessity as the story moves along the years of Post Civil War, Custer's role as colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the final destiny at the Little Big Horn, in Montana. Under the guidance of the director, Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film strikes a very diverse range of emotions; from the very serious battle scenes, compelling and convincing historical scenes; it looks like they were pictures of Matthew Brady's civil war. As with most of Mr. Walsh's films, it punctuates and accelerates the end of many scenes with a bit of humor; but do not overdo it and therefore risk the possibility of turning the film into a comedy (farce, in reality). <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this is much more real than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (the last time I'll talk about it, honest Schultz, Scout's Honor!). However, this does not mean that he was not without a few bits of "Artistic and Literary License, as indeed every Biopic will have: it would be impossible to make any kind of similar film if indeed every fact and the incident had to be attempted to be included in the screenplay Perhaps the most incorrect inclusion and the most obvious invocation of the Literary License is that the business on Custer was accidentally promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, however the "gag" helped the film to move, while it underlined the The whole light, the carefree feeling that permeated the first part of the film. <br /> <br /> DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated in giving us what appears to be a characterization of this legendary hero of the civil war who was very close to the real man of life, and they did it in addition to the recreation of an accident, being the massacre of the Lakota Sioux, the Cheyenne and the Fukowi of Custer and his 7th Cavalle to the little big horn. At the time of its appearance, on June 25, 1876, "The Last Resistance of Custer" was a great accident and a shock to the national psyche of the Americans as were the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic fascists at the Twin Trade Towers in New York and the headquarters of the United States armed forces at the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia, on 11 September 2002. <br /> <br /> ONLY like so many films of that WORLD WAR II period (and the years immediately preceding it), there were so many incidents in it that were, if not intentionally done, were demonstrations of virtue that would have been necessary in time for another Global Conflict, as we were in the moment in THE ROOTS ON I DIED in was ending its original release period. <br /> <br /> POOL SCHNITZ !!
