A long wait for the concert, Rush-in-Rio DVDs are both compelling and disappointing. This set of two clear discs shows Rush at their best. After 30 years of perfecting their unique sound, it's nice to have this record by one of the most talented rock bands ever. <br /> <br /> The concert features over two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs featuring a viewing angle. Packaged in a bi-fold support with sleeve and a small insert, it has a very good price for the amount of material it contains. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Rush in the late seventies and early eighties, and this DVD comes in big, with half the show highlighting the songs of that era. I won't list the songs, in case you want to be surprised. If you participated in the Vapor Trails tour, then you will know what will sound. <br /> <br /> Playing in Rio with their biggest crowd ever, Rush is a large audience of people here. In fact, this was one of the first things I noticed that was peculiar to this show. During most of this two-hour concert, listen and see the crowd, singing and actively dancing to music. At first, it is encouraging to see that fans give Rush a well-deserved answer. But after several songs, I was ready to listen and see more of the band and less of the crowd. This is in no way a slamming of the Rio crowd. More power for them! It is a criticism of the final modification of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my second and main reason "I hate". Video editing is terrible in my opinion. Save for the bonus cuts with multi-angle view, the whole show is a frenzy of visual chaos. It's as if the director wanted to see how spastic it can be to do it. I expect to change the camera angles, on average, between one and four seconds, constantly! After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. Which is a shame, because I would have liked to have witnessed the show, as I was able to attend last year's concert. Perhaps this fast editing is the latest craze for concert DVDs, but I really think it's a nuisance and a deduction from the general experience. As mentioned before, I wouldn't mind for a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this record is rushed, or RUSHed. It's really ironic, because all the previous concert clips I saw on Rush, mainly from Moving Pictures, are closely filmed, with just a few steps back and forth. It's almost boring, visually speaking. This DVD took him to the opposite extreme. I know that many wool dyed Rush fans won't agree with my statements, but it's just me. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: if you're a Rush fan, I'll buy this DVD regardless of my review or any other. I would have bought it again after reading my review. Don't expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the things mentioned above may not bother you.
