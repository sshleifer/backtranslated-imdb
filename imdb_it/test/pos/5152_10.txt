Roy Anderssons "Du Levande" is not entirely original as it is the counterpoint of Anderssons' previous film "Sånger från andra våningen". However, the film has an aura of total originality. Some cinema conventions are still thrown away: most of the actors don't look like what you'd expect in movies and the shots take a long time. Most of the time the camera doesn't move but people move around it. The shots start somewhere and many times the scenario develops in surprising proportions. W.G. Sebald comes to mind in literature with the same technique. Due to the time invested in each shot, the suspension is really high in many scenes. There is a story and it is not - it is left to the viewer to build in his mind. This film is positive. He is determined not to see all this in a negative way and at the same time will not go to social injustice. One of the messages I received was that perhaps all failures and accidents are not fatal, after all. Great movie.
