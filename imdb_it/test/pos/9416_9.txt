this film takes the voice of terror and makes it better. Holmes is protecting an inventor in Switzerland and is on the trail of Professor Moriarity, who has become a Nazi. this is a better version of holmes in a world war II world. rathbone does a great job with Holmes as a spy and detective. look at this if you liked the voice of terror.
