This is a very long film, really. But it is quite beautiful and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. An easily recounted story cannot be predicted in Les Amants RÃ©guliers, but every scene, every silence here tells more than a hundred dialogues. Touching, different, perfect in its images and in the soundtrack, it shows why the closure brought by the cinema as one of its main features has become the greatest innovation in every dramatic representation. Someone who is used to that type of film in which everything is told, and the action takes place at all times, will find it tiring. But it's worth watching, discovering other possibilities to hear a story.
