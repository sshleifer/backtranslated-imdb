Being a fan of the Bills, initially it seemed annoying to make a film about the Bills and the loss of four superbowl. But once I started looking, I really felt connected. Actually it was nice to see the "Bill" win the superbowl, and I have to say that for a TV movie it was really very well done. Gil Bellows like QB and Jon Voight as an old school coach did a great job. 8 out of 10
