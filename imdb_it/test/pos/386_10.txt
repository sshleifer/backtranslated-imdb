"Strangers on a Train" was one of those cinema classics I had always heard of but that somehow never managed to see. I finally saw it a few weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock film, not only has it stood the test of time, it has far surpassed most of the thrillers that are made today. You can see the inspiration for future action films here - the resounding finale with the carousel out of control and the two criminals who are dueling each other reminded me of the great action sequence at the end of "Speed" by Jan de Bont. "Of course," Strangers "has over forty years of" Speed ​​"and contains no modern special effects, but the visceral thrill is there - Hitchcock was a true genius. <br /> <br /> The gay not so thin side by Bruno (Robert Walker in an extraordinary performance) has taken shape in many other psycho-stalker figures in films of the future, considering him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female". He meets Guy before meeting him on the train - we almost the feeling that their contact is not random - and soon he is completely obsessed with him. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the oedipal elements in his films (see also "Psycho" for more obvious subtleties) and there is a lot of this here. Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. His effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped from censorship in 1951, when gays were not "authorized" to be portrayed on screen - yet Hitchcock succeeds to convey the message effectively when we see Bruno in the living room on the phone wearing a non-masculine robe, flirting with Guy and answering his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this film make it a fast-paced thriller that you can return to again and again - unfortunately it is redone as a high-budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original, honestly I can't imagine anything going beyond the thrill of this movie.
