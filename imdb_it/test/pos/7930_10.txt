Eisenstein was not only one of the greatest Soviet directors, Russians, but one of the great masters of cinema, including Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the most beautiful things of all his films was the very personal edition, and in this film he is exceptional. This was his first sound film and the use of the musical score by the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the battle sequence is a perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like a lesson or a lesson at the cinema, something that no director can afford. I never tire of watching REAL CLASSICS like this movie. I hope that in the near future more people will recognize a great work of art.
