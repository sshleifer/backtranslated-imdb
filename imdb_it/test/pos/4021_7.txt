Of the two films Slaughter, this is the best and though hardly a Schindler list in complexity is damn funny. All men are treats or villains and women are all only Hos and emotionally needy, eg. The skeletal daughter. It's also pretty darn fun and The Pro must be the best movie pimp of all time, you can't get enough of those hats, purple dresses, gold chains and jato patois forever. The best thing is where he has the Harem around him by going "FACCIA UNNASTAN". Everything about him is bigger than life and recalls the Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also shows himself to be a private cock for all the chicks and again he kicks his white ass in every direction. The auto scene is very unrealistic that they survive unharmed, but hey this is the movie. Definitely the best blax film and surpasses Shaft (1971). The first film is also quite good.
