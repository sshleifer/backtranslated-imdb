The Child's Play series is not one of my favorites, but Bride Of Chucky is actually a film in place. This time we have two Chucky dolls and his ex-girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they set out on a journey to find an object. There are some interesting scenes through the film like the guy who gets hit by the truck and literally explodes, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending that lets you have another sequel. It was not a direct horror, mixed a lot of comedy and was a kind of parody of the horror genre. This made the film better than what the comedy does with many horror films. All in all even if your fan is not a fan of the game.
