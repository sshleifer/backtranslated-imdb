I saw this film for the first time at a queer film festival. 10 minutes after the end of the film, a gay couple approached me and asked if I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a maniac. The movie is poor, it's bizarre, it's exaggerated, it's gay - but it's incredible. I think every character is plausible. Everett's character is bad for a woman who only tries to help, brutally throws his (terrible) friends, has a temper, can damage a fly, the "fly" that killed the love of his life, doubly so. Bates is a miracle, it's perfect, just like a role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she loves even the homosexual lover of her idol is for me the essence of true love. I even understand Max (her husband), he's bored with her life, has a mid-life crisis. He moves, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realize a) that is the really boring part of the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I love the fact that you come back to him in the end because I think it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. Because in the end she is her husband and may not be as exciting as Victor but she is real, she is the man she loves in a very realistic way. I've seen it about 50 times and I love this movie, all unconditionally. By the way, just read the autobiography of Rupert Everett and UL is the only film of which he talks about as one of the best films I've ever made. For me it's the best film I've ever made.
