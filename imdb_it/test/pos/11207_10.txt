For those like me who are used to watching and enjoying high-budget Hollywood movies on huge screens with surround sound, this movie seems to be so far away. However, I was surprised how close he can be to any human being when I look at him. It is so natural that it seems to you that no one has written a scenario or that nobody has directed it. You are the director and you are writing the scenario as you watch it. For me, the time I spend watching a movie is the only time I go to another world. This film is the first example for me that shows that it is not always necessary to watch millions of dollars of budget films, surround sound capability to go to another world. This film sends you to another world (or maybe makes you come back to yourself) without millions of dollars in budget or technical skills. I felt like I was reading Camus's etranger.
