2001: A Space Odyssey <br /> <br /> Is it a sermon? An account of the history of humanity? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to make technology destroy it? Does it concern the fragile balance between time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacle of spectacular effects; a Kubrick film made just to show us the unlimited possibilities of the film and present the truth that images are extremely more powerful than words? <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is all these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created, it's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous project of the plot and the events of the film, rather than actually watching. But it is left open to discussion intentionally; if Kubrick had explained the meaning to his wonderful 1968 classic (at No. 22 on the AFI list of the 100 best films ever made, my 21st favorite movie currently - and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Original Screenplay, Art Direction and Visual Effects for which he won) would have lost half of its charm, all its complexity and a good part of its cinematographic value. We would have remained only with technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising. <br /> <br /> Because every shot is worth taking the time to watch. And there's a lot of time. 2001 is very elegiac and also coldly distant; detached. Emotional distance and slow rhythm pay a perfect tribute to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with the ancestors of the ape of humanity, passing from scavengers of the planet to hunters and tool makers after discovering a giant monolith in the middle of their desert house, then (in one of the most inspired changes to the history of the cinema) like a bone thrown in the air and becomes a satellite, jumping forward two thousand years in space, where the astronauts discovered a similar object on the moon, and later the film follows the mission of a space traveler as they follow the signal of the monolith through space, accompanied by their unreliable HAL computer, which attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before finally the lone survivor is launched into space and time (in a burst of drug-induced colors that it probably gave to the hippie an epileptic shock in Aging, dying and being reborn a "Star-child". Wow. <br /> <br /> This emotional emptiness and pacing, is also in the net contrast with the most ironic scene in the film; the destruction of HAL. While the final explorer of the crew turns off the car, immersed in the sacred aura of red light, Kubrick has always used the motif of repetition, while HAL sings an enchanting melody, is a strangely emotional experience. And it's all genius. <br /> <br /> Other noteworthy aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece are the memorable voice of HAL (a quiet, somewhat sinister, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick wisely trusted his images to push the film, giving its actors only banal and useless lines, the most famous is "Open the doors of the bay of the HAL pod"), the satellites that dance in orbit around non-orthodox music and that first, impressive blow to the ground ; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it, played to the sound of explosive and triumphant trumpets. <br /> <br /> 2001 will always remain a mystery and will forever be a testimony of the strength of cinema: images are more powerful than writing. It's all about one of the most legendary and best directors in the history of cinema, whose unique vision has always been his. 10/10 <br /> <br /> "Open the doors of the HAL pod bay" - 2001: Space Odyssey
