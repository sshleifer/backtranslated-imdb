This film is a work of pure class from beginning to end, for a moment forget the famous 28 minutes of robbery without dialogue, forget that it is set in Paris and forget that it is Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make this experience pure gold .. it is intelligent and thought in a very detailed way, just like the robbery itself. Describes real characters that are not only credible but with which you come into harmony. It is a film that does not fascinate the notion of robbery but shows it for what it is ... theft. It shows that a robbery is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. Now all in all put yourself above a bold 28-minute sequence without a word spoken and set in splendid Paris with great attention to detail and a fantastic cinematography and that last scene ... when you look up and see those trees ... wonderful use of primary and basic shooting techniques ... it is a masterpiece in my opinion and I'm glad to have seen it.
