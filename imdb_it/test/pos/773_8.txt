Sweet and funny story of a young boy of 17 and a half years, controlled by a domineering religious mother and introverted father, and how he finds himself in his work with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well acted, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the boy well, proving that his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter film series. Laura Linney plays her ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption, so there is no room to please him. But the film is a very funny film, well made by the British in the style of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.
