It would seem a fact, but if a spectator forgets the context, he risks losing an opportunity for fun. <br /> <br /> From the elevated heights of the 21st century, it is easy to understand the styles and prices of the years of the Great Depression; but the intelligent spectator will remember that magic word, "context", and better understand and, therefore, enjoy "Accidents Will Happen". <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ronald Reagan has again shown himself to be an attractive and good-looking guy, and has again given a fair performance. <br /> <br /> A reviewer said earlier that Gloria Blondell played an evil wife, but that was wrong: she plays the concession clerk who has a crush on Reagan's character, Eric Gregg, but holds the hands away until he is married. <br /> <br /> Gloria was pretty. Not as beautiful as her sister, Joan, she was still attractive and a good actress. Perhaps his resemblance to Joan was a disadvantage for having a more successful career, and it is certainly our loss. <br /> <br /> Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg, and she played it well. <br /> <br /> Other actors included Dick Purcell, and the great Earl Dwire played something besides an evil cowboy. <br /> <br /> Once again, most players never achieved the "household name" status that many of them deserved, but they looked kindly on here, in a story that is still relevant today.
