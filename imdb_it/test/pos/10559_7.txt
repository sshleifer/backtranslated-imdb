I saw this series after Tipping the Velvet, for which I voted at 10/10. I had read the users' comments on this and I expected an equally good or, if possible, even better series. At this point I must point out that this series is good, and it certainly captured me all the time and so it's worth watching. However, I didn't like it as much as Tipping the Velvet, for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Less passion, love and related sexual content. There was surprisingly little emphasis in these elements, which I kept part of a love story. Fingersmith looked like a watered-down version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. Similarly, as in Tipping the Velvet, the plot had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part and the ending. The second part should have been the climax of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead it was almost totally skipped, perhaps due to the inability to make the content of the asylum shocking but credible. The series should have been in three parts, with two cliffhangers, with much more attention on the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. It was not given much weight to what the Fingersmith were and how it affected their personality. I found it rather annoying that the series did not adequately address this central theme. <br /> <br /> 4. The finish was much more hasty than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith has left several interesting plot lines open. <br /> <br /> Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series and worth 7/10. However, it is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
