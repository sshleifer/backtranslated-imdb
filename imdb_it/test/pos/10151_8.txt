One of the most beautiful films of director Alfred Hitchcock is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and their young son) who are on holiday in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world-famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an accident on a local bus. Later, the French whispers something in Stewart's ear after being attacked and dying. The rest of the film is a puzzle like Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The film is full of mystery and strangeness from the exotic venue due to the strange occurrences. You never really know what's going on in this movie, because people are appearing until the end and even then you're not sure. The final scene takes place at Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in the film that lasts 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock originally made this film in 1934.
