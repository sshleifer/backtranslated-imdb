When I first saw the trailer, I have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. But after hearing it, I decided to buy it. When I bought the entire collection in a casket, it was absolutely what I wanted to see. It was a lot of fun, and the characters were really cool. The favorite characters on the show are: Marion, Carrot, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked the initial and final initials. The show also has great vocal talents by Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. But anyway, this show is one of the biggest. So if you want to see something interesting. So this show is the only one.
