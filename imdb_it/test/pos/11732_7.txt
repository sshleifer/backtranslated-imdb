I haven't seen all the movies Burt Reynolds has ever made, but this (which I've just finished watching for the third time) could very well be his best! He suffers only some slow strokes; Burt may have tried to make it more "arty" than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual clich√©s in presenting the role of "tough cop" he plays (note, for example, the scene in which he tries to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time, or the fear expresses just before of the final showdown with the indestructible Henry Silva). In reality, Silva and those two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains in the 80s thriller thrillers. The film also has some unusual touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and gripping fist fight and many well-directed shots. (***)
