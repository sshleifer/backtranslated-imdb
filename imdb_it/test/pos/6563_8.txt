Wow .. I just watched this movie on the Sundance Channel, and it's really weird. I might not be a film expert, but it's probably the most bizarre movie I've ever seen, like a fan of average cinema. <br /> <br /> Whoever invented had a great imagination. I'm a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas, and there are often actors in dramatic films .. (Matsushima Nanako, for example, the protagonist of Ringu, is one of the main stars of the j-drama.) But it seems that this is the first films for the portraits of Kirie and Shuichi. I must say that if they are really making their debut here, they do a good job. <br /> <br /> Kirie was a very understanding character, I thought it was easy to relate to. She was kind and kind-hearted, perhaps not the most popular but prettiest girl to look for other girls. She was also pretty in a classic way. I hope he makes more films, but a couple of years have passed so maybe he has no such projects. <br /> <br /> The ending was strange. I'm not going to give anything, but the rest of the film's oddity was a bit shameful. <br /> <br /> Very bizarre film, but very imaginative and unique. I would recommend it to Japanese horror fans, although I warn you, it's much more bizarre than Ringu. <br /> <br /> However, I would give a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, acting above average, and being simply intriguing.
