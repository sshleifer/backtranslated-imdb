"Only the Valiant" qualifies as a good and gritty western. This cavalry by Gregory Peck against the Indian oasis is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor. Veteran Gordon Douglas led an epic and heartbreaking outdoor epic with an ideal cast of tough kids under considerable pressure; Lon Chaney, Jr., also registers beautifully as a powerful Arab soldier. Apparently, the writer of "Colorado Territory" Edmund H. North and the scribe of "A Place in the Sun" Harry Brown drew their script from the tense novel by western director Charles Marquis Warren on a group of die-hard knights cut off from any escape route that must prevent the assassin redskins from launching a devastating raid on defenseless white settlers. North and Brown stick to Warren's novel for the most part and last-minute revelation - when it seems our heroes can't survive another Native American assault it's a cork! This story from the beginning of the century develops a claustrophobic feeling effective in the second part of the action. Douglas and his company take the studio sets and make them look convincing at night. The sharp black and white photography of the cinematographer "Going My Way" Lionel Linden gives this western a dark look that accentuates its tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the villain in "Guns of the Magnificent Seven", is extremely effective in a small role of the hated Indian leader Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" opens with vocal narration by the Scout army Joe Harmony. "This is my battleground: I am a scout for the army, my work has been cut for me for a long time. Behind that step is the entire Pache nation. (There is a graphic of the territory with the mint head Mountains that stretch out on the screen with a bottleneck passage.) They came swarming out of the pass killing everything in sight, then we built a strong Fort Invincible, which connected the pass, just like a cork in a bottle. For a while it went well, but they "Paches is pretty smart, one day the bottle blew the cork plum." We are shown the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man hanging from a palisade wall and a spear sticking out of its belly. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of "12 O'Clock High") and his men gallop on horseback and capture Tucsos (Michael Ansara), and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") wants to shoot him on the spot. Harmony points out that Tucsos is "the guy who started the whole thing". Captain Lance intervenes: "The army does not kill the prisoners, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is amazed at this prospect. "It's not a common injury, it's right next to a god that a guy can have. If you shoot him now, things will calm down. Without Tucsos that excites them, the rest of those Indians will become reasonable, just like they can. You take him alive, you'll have every 'Pache in the territory that comes after him. We've had three years of this, you can stop him now. "Just as expected, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos and Lance's decision to take the part India's back puts things into action. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes of "Union Station") surprises Lance when he tells him that they should have shot Tucsos. As it is, they need to get Tucsos in another post. Everyone from soldiers to Joe Harmony knows that bringing Tucsos to Fort Grant is asking to die. The apaches are suspended between the mountains and the fort is under force. Meanwhile, we are introduced to the daughter of Captain Eversham, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton of "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"), and the young lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young of "Shoot them on horseback, isn't it?") And they play part in a great narrative complication. See, Lance and Holloway both want to marry Cathy. Clearly, Cathy wants Lance. Colonel Drum refuses to let Lance bring Tucsos to Fort Grant because Drum can't spare Lance. Drum changes orders and Holloway receives the mission at the last minute and everyone is shocked. Lance has never changed an order. Also, Lance saw Cathy and Holloway kissing in public, and everyone thinks Lance reassigned Holloway out of jealousy. In fact, an officer notes that rewrite orders are about how to rewrite the Bible. Predictably, Tucsos escapes and the surviving troops and Harmony report a dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum expects a rescue column of 400 soldiers to arrive each day, Harmony points out to Lance that Tucsos will attack. Tucsos has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength. Lance asks to take 6 or 7 men of his choice to protect Fort Invincible and prevent Tucsos from organizing a war party. The bottleneck in the mountains prevents the Indians from riding hard; instead, they have to go through one at a time. Lance believes his men can fight them until the rescue column arrives. Drum gives him permission and Lance chooses the worst men. They all hate him and would gladly kill him. <br /> <br /> "Only the valiant" exemplifies the new breed of military western after the Second World War. This is not a Western John Ford cavalry. In fact, the same men of Lance want to kill him and this prefigures the attitude of the troops during the Vietnam war when they divided their own officers. Lance bears the burden of everyone except the few who know the circumstances that led to the change of order that put Holloway in charge of the details. Black and white photography enhances the terrible nature of this western. "Only the Valiant" is equivalent to a last western stand until the last truce. Reportedly, Peck hated this film, but in Technicolor it is not a western spit-and-polish. If nothing else, "Only the Valiant" lives up to its origins Warner Brothers. It's small but significant and is smeared with a lot of unpleasant dramas and characters, practically a "dozen dirt" western.
