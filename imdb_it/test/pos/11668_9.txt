Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this film. I say this because he avoided the convention and the clich√©. He also supervised superb performances of Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more surprising, Robbins does not protect. It tells only the story and lets the events play in the mind of the viewer. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial issues of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in any direction. I can't recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
