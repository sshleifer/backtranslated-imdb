I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, while waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble for the praise I shared with him for this artwork, especially for his portrait of the young captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of the history of American cinema. "Charlie Do not Surf". The famous line by Robert Duvall (the other) does not need to be repeated as it has often become a repeated anthem and his character of Pattonesque will be remembered for a long time as a classic American war falcon in the tradition of John Wayne. It's a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
