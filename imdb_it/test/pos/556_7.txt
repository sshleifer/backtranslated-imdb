Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who is the working definition of the word "dreamer" and her solemn and pragmatic daughter. Adele, who wants to start over in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> Decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. Pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best thing he offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are pretty good at leads - even if their characters are sometimes one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> It could be better, it could be worse. <Br /> <br /> I gave this seven out of ten.
