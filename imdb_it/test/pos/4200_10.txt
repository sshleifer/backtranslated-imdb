I had heard of John Garfield, but I didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just took it at random. John Garfield is a boxer in the film. He had been in real life for which he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the film. Someone else killed a man. The character was blamed. He became friends with a family that has questions and isn't quite sure what to do with him. All the types of minor plots derive from this. My favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and a Dead End Kid couldn't swim, And none of them could go out. John's character saved the situation. Dead End Kids were fantastic like his friends and followers. One of them until the end. Ann Sheridan played the daughter of the family and the eventual love interest of John. It was credible, but not lovable to me, the only weak link in the film.
