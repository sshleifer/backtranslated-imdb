I don't play video games at all, but my children do it. <br /> <br /> I have had a great success. I'd like to see more of this type of film. "very nice" as the youngest would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and the general plot were interesting. Like I said, I don't play video games, but I think my kids would like this. It was not full of bad words and this is a pleasant change. This visual concept was different that caught my attention. Also, the soundtrack was pretty good. I could also try some of the games that my children play to see because of this movie. Who knows maybe one day I'll become a player.
