*** SPOILERS *** A well-made and interesting film on the alienated youth of America in the 1950s. In those days, many parents had taken a lot of money and lived at high altitudes, forgetting that their children, particularly teenagers, needed much more than a car and a large sum to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention, for their growing problems, which is what sixteen-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur, never had from his film producer, his father Mr. Tom Ditmar, James Daly. <br /> <br /> Never really connecting with his father, Hal becomes increasingly distant from him and his caring mother Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter and the company. After his father put Hal to talk about him wanting to borrow his car, a late-style luxury sedan, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, drove into Hal's brink and barley on duty in the 1930s local trotter to capture the latest western movie. <br /> <br /> Feeling as if he were hitting the world, Hal acts like a real first-class jerk, framing his smelly feet almost in the faces of a couple, Eddie Ryder and Jean Corbett, sitting in front of him and Jerry trying to watch the movie. This leads Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, not only to be thrown out of the theater, but with him to play the theatrical director of the theater, Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater, without even recovering his money, but when Grebbs tried to grab it, Hal turned around and tied it right in the kisser. <br /> <br /> Hal now in real boiling water, he is accused of aggression and drums, of enacting his act of "James Dean", at the local police station, acting as if he was too cool or just stupid to realize what he did; Mr. Grebbs almost knocked out. That's when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his father is coming for him when he finally regrets what he did. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has tried Hal to straighten up but is unable to do so because his father's low esteem for him. Plead with his father to understand that what he did, in Mr. Grebbs belting, was in self-defense Hal's father behaves as if he were there, at the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal as a thug of street instead of a young man who is seized and pushed without provocation. <br /> <br /> Not excusing what Hal did in putting out Mr. Grebbs, he was actually willing to admit his hooligan behavior, but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his father at least treat him with a crumb of consideration; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas in not even bothering to listen to him! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mother, to turn really even Hal slowly loses him only to have both sergeants. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to leave the assault charge. You might think that by now Hal has finally learned his lesson, but the real lesson, more than an extension behind bars, which Hal so desperately needs is a lesson that his father completely ignored! Being there when his son needed him most and in that Mr. Ditmar failed with flying colors. <br /> <br /> Things straighten out for everyone in the film only after Mr. Grebbs has laced up, ending up with a Butte of a shiner, again by Hal who, returning to the Grebbs theater, tries to convince him to call his father and tell him that Hal was defending himself only when he didn't hit him for the first time. In the end, Hal learned a real lesson to get along with people and not let his problems become other people's problems. But above all, Hal's father, Mr. Ditmar, learned the most valuable lesson of all on how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and behave like a father to him instead of a prison and a sugar daddy. As the song says "All you need s love" to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal that Mr. Ditmar, until the end of the film, missed most.
