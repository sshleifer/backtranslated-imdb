There are few cartoon films in which animals or something "non-human" portrays human beings and I think this film is one of them. Apart from some points of the plot and the characters, this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly with animals. Although - it's nice that someone hasn't done it - I feel that cats are very good in this film that portrays humans! :-) <br /> <br /> This film also focuses on a lot of adult issues - which is rather strange for a Disney movie. Mention alcohol *, show a dog that teaches another dog how to attack "tresspassanti" humans and shows a male cat called (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas) O 'Malley, who imagines a female cat, in a surprisingly human and adult. br /> <br /> As a cartoon film - or just for a film in general, I think this is a pretty good quality - the plot and the characters are particularly good. The film (in general) is set in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her puppies Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the old (rich) gentle who loves cats, the butler Edgar and an old man (who has CLEARLY lost his marbles) called George. The kind old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar overhears what he will receive from the will he will have after the cats have it. IT IS INCREDIBLY angry with this - and has an evil scheme in mind ... <br /> <br /> A very nice film for all ages - enjoy the "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Not including "Basil the Great Mouse Detective" and some others maybe I can't think of at the moment.
