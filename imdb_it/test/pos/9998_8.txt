I was extraordinarily impressed by this film. It's one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. The images in this film are exceptional. I love sequences where the camera keeps track of the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well, offering both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The recitations are excellent. I was surprised by the young Shia LaBeouf. He does well in this role. Stephen Dillane is also as good as the cupid Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth and Elias Koteas offer valuable support. The film is compelling and fun and for the first time in my life it made me want to attend a golf tournament.
