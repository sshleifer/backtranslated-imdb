MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a "light sports comedy", it really has a moving heart as human and universal as some of the most beautiful Capra. At the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a nice old American game, as played in Japan - shot with the American values ​​driven out and Japanese values ​​imprinted on the game. (Some of the superficial "sports comedies" derive from Jack's disbelief in the way "basi-boru" is played in Japan). You also have a main character who is presented as an over the hill baseball star, but who is actually quite immature - the professional ball has allowed him to postpone growth. And you have a main character who is abruptly resistant to the changes in his life that are imposed on him, refusing to accept the curved ball that life has given him, in the middle of a new country, a new manager, a new team, and a new girl, who all welcomed him and try to accept him. Sounds like heavy stuff? Not exactly. It is a fascinating comedy "clash of cultures" that takes place at a national, sports, romantic and professional level. But if you look at it quite sensibly, you will also find a great story about a man who must give up his immaturity and grow too late in life (causing a certain amount of personal pain), and find success in places he never expected. I love history, but I also have a great respect for Selleck's performance; he bares (literally) to paint an ugly American people, insulting and outbursts in public, so he gets us into this character to understand his dismay. It also doesn't hurt if you're a big Takakura Ken fan like me. MR. BASEBALL is a surprising "loss of innocence".
