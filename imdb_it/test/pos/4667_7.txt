The Italian Job requires hours of light and no experience is required. This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the cinema. The plot is good, but the real game of the plot is very simple and requires no reflection. They are chases, explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating "the villain" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, he seems to be content to portray exactly the same characters as his previous films like "The Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better screenplays. Warning: if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. If you are looking for cheap entertainment then you need The Italian Job.
