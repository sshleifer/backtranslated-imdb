Hal Hartley's entry into a series of European films is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and, fortunately, one of the few available on DVD. Just 63 minutes of running time, my only quibble would be with Hartley. I always want more, but never so much as this time. Martin Donovan is as amazing as Jesus. PJ Harvey is as beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the high point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley offers him an excellent dialogue and the possibility of using his resounding voice to full effect. Look for three scenes where a microphone is waiting for him, as if a devil of poetry was about to be won by the devil. I have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise around. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything (in front of sex), and / or very clever plays based on biblical ideas, take this as quickly as possible.
