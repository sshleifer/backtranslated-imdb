I saw the film in its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting a more epic film and ensemble along the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the film focused only on a much smaller number of characters. However, the film was solid, reflective and visually intriguing. There was a slightly jarring tone that shifts from the dominant and realistic tone of confused loyalty, intrigue and blood, against the lighter, more flamboyant martial arts sequences. It almost seemed that the directors could not decide whether the film should have been a martial arts "film" or a historical epic. History touches upon the question of the need for loyalty against the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and your friends' lives to be true to your master or is there a time when you have to submit to the winds of change? Is there more courage in leaving the old ways for new ones? How do you decide? These questions are raised in this film and, ironically, there is the suggestion that the answer given may be the wrong one!
