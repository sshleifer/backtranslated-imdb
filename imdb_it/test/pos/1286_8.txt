Great movie. No free makeup like in most Hollywood movies. Everything supported the suspense of the plot. B & w gave him a basic, no-frills feeling. In short, he was visceral in his simplicity of cinematography and cast. <br /> <br /> The following is an interesting contrast to Memento. The characters in the manipulation and subterfuges used are widely. In this sense, they both reminded me a little of "In the Company of Men", also highly recommendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier to follow, since the black and white scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do the color ones. I don't think it was true for the sequel, in which the scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I highly recommend the DVD, as it gives you the chance to watch the film a second time in chronological order, not only in the encrypted (though naive) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, in a second view, to put together the order for yourself, if you wish. <br /> <br /> As noted by another user, one of the best things about this movie and Memento is that none of the cast was famous. They were characters, not famous actors who brought characters developed into other films. <br /> <br /> Given some similarities in the plots, I wonder if Memento is a sort of remake of Following, but intended to reach a wider audience, like Edward Burns, he made She's the One the - The Brothers McMullan.
