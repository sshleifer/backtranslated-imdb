The VHS cover says it all: "Without a doubt, the most powerful film of its kind after the Chainsaw massacre in Texas." I'm a big fan of the 70s and 80s and I have to say that I agree 100%. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forester). There is a twisted atmosphere, which only TCM has, a surprising soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the locations of the most beautiful shots in the history of horror. This must be one of the most beautiful horror movies of all time! Jeff Lieberman as director of this low-budget 1981 film does an excellent job and, with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn) added, must be one of the most underrated directors in today's filmindustry.
