This short was the first short film released by Paramount Famous Studios and was one of many made by the studio that showed Popeye engaged directly against the enemy, most often Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, made short films that often described the Germans as sheets, most of Famous Studios' efforts focused on the Japanese. Given the naval ties of Pearl Harbor and Popeye, this is quite understandable. This is a medium short circuit. Seeing red, white and blue and spinach for Britain have aged better. But it's still worth looking at. Recommended.
