Calling all the D-sciples! Grab your friends, hit the theater and look out of this movie. From the opening sequence until after the closing credits, laugh at yourself breathlessly. <br /> <br /> This film is a wild ride through the history of D, and not just a list of things they have done, but a chronicle of their rise to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black), so of course I loved the movie. <br /> <br /> Helps you get to know the show they had and their first CD, but it's just as fun if you don't. From the hilarious and vulgar texts, to the oscillating rhythms, to the enormous quantity of pot smoke and cameos, to the total madness that is the plot, this is a film for D-sciples and beginners alike. <br /> <br /> Many of their songs are referenced, such as Two Kings, Tribute and Kielbasa to their many audio tracks as Cock Push-up, every fan in the audience will say that I remember that, in addition to new Arrives saying "This it's F'ing fun! " I highly recommend this film to any body that has ever been shaken. This film is certainly in great competition to be the next "This is Spinal Tap". One of the best ever.
