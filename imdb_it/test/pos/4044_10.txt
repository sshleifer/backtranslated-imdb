I thought the film started a little slow and bumpy for the first time. However, it has become more engaging, fascinating and surprising in the last two hours. Thus, as it begins as an economic horror film, it evolves into a fantastic and wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands out as the Snow Queen. This was his best performance and it is sad that this was apparently his last performance, since he has not played in the last 7 years. Absolutely personifies both the beauty and the coldness of Winter. <br /> <br /> My 14-year-old daughter found the movie a little scary, so if you show it as family entertainment, please be with your child and reassure her or him that's just a fantasy from fairy tale and don't take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> It really is one of the best fantasy films I've seen in a long time, slightly better than "Eragon" or someone from the "Lord of the Rings". It's as good as "The Golden Compass".
