"Radio Flyer" is one of my most beloved American films. <br /> <br /> The great work of two boys, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood, (despite the terrible interpretation of T.Hanks at the beginning and at the end ...) with a wonderful script by DMEvans and powerful and emotional direction by R.Donner plus. Absolutely incredible Peerless Music Score by H.Zimmer has allowed the "Radio Flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's movie ranking. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame that that great film has been underestimated by some film critics. <br /> <br /> I just can't wait to see it on DVD.
