does anyone know why this movie is called the couch journey? I was watching it and I'm still not sure why this title was chosen, the film was a lot of fun and it's probably my favorite performance by Dan Aykroyd who also beats his Ghostbusters performance that I had never heard of the movie before. to see it in a store I read the back and I thought it sounded good so I bought it and when I finally got the chance to see it, I thought it was better than what I originally expected. this film is as good as the animal house and the lampoon national holiday in my mind i wish the comedies that have been released lately were written as well as this nothing sad happened in it and the bad things that happen are also fun parts if someone else feels this way and would like to read a script for a movie that doesn't have a sad situation in it, please email me to killer2511@hotmail.com
