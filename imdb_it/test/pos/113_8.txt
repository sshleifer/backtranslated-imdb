This was a bold film to hit Indian cinemas when it was released. The first film that perhaps openly describes the lesbian tendencies among Indian women. The actress who stars in Indian cinema Shabana Azmi has added substance to the film with her passionate scenes with Nandita Das. <br /> <br /> The film filled with sexuality and the director had sex in the best possible way. Sex was not for erotic purposes but it was in the context of the film. The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity with her husband was certainly the first of its kind in Indian cinemas. <br /> <br /> Good acting of all the actors, in particular Nandita Das, among the critics of the Indian public
