I remember reading Balzac's original story in the French college. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine of the WGN-TV in Chicago who read it as one of his late-night shows. <br /> <br /> I have always liked history, but never believe that they could or could make a film about it. To my surprise they did it and they did it VERY well. <br /> <br /> Few of Balzac's stories lend themselves to drama, which is unfortunate, and - a cat lover, I always hoped it would be filmed without a lot of Hollywood having sex. This is as close to perfect conversion as could be done. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but this is the closest I think it can get to letting the reading imagination meet the reality of seeing.
