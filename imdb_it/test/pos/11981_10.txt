Don't be fooled by the judgment of 5.9 (as from this writing on 12-8-02), this is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how he got such an assessment considering being so solid at all levels. Direction, acting, cinematography: all right. The story is interesting and original and my only reference to understanding why the evaluation is such lies in the fact that it is probably the kind of film that people might not normally see. <br /> <br /> The equates to play modern rock for an 80 year old. You could be young, bred and loved, but he or she was not and as a product of a time and a different taste - he doesn't care. <br /> <br /> If you like movies and can handle films based on real people compared to those made up of unintelligent actions, huge budget flashy and mediocre talent, give it a try next time you see it on. .. <br /> <br />
