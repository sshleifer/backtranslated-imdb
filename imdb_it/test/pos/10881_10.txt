definitely the best game for N64 ever. I say more that I was very disappointed that tomorrow he never dies, but the world is not enough he promises to be better than goldeneye (according to the site). I love goldeneye so much that I find something to do every time I play. I even invented my level missions. Multiplayer is the best of all the games out there and the graphics are amazing even now. The first day I had this I remember that I would like them to come back and turn all bond films into games. Can you imagine driving the speedboat live and letting die and making those incredible jumps, or fighting ninja or fighting the jaws in the spy who loved me and the moonraker. (I think fighting him in those games would be more fun then in the game) what about chasing Sanchez in the gas trucks or chiselling St. Cerils just for your eyes. oh well, let me go back to the game. All levels are unique and make killing environments very fun. there are many places to hide to be able to tease about people (especially the statue park), and this game is not worthy of renting, you really have to buy it today.
