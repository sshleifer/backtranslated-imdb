The ABC version of the life of the late Pope: They put it a little earlier than the CBS version and may have suffered from it, but the program itself was excellent. He moved quickly because he only had two hours (with commercials that also took the time) to cover the long life of this great man, but Thomas Kretschmann was admired by the challenge. He did an extraordinary job of conveying the emotions and the struggle that John-Paul endured. Unlike the CBS biopic, he played the role from youth to old age and managed to look "realistic" on both sides of the scale. His credibility has never wavered. It has an incredible range and depth. It is a pity that the program could not have been longer and more detailed but working in the time they had, I think they did a great job bringing it to the small screen.
