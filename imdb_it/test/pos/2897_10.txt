This DVD will be treated with indifference by millions of classic rock music devotees around the world, because Rush is not really beautiful. It is a pity that Rush has had to overcome the disdainful contempt of most North American and British music journalists in their thirty years of strange history, as this has deprived many people of the chance to join a real band. All the last four decades are well represented here and what a catalog of songs it is! We have the seminal "2112", the magical "The Trees" and the lyric "Tom Sawyer" interspersed with high-energy and provocative pieces of the genre of their latest album "Vapor Trails". The musicality is almost impeccable, the theatrical show is spectacular and the Brazilian fans are simply crazy (at one point they sing along with an instrumental one!) Every member of the band plays at a level that challenges beliefs - true artisans who perform art. If you doubt try the instrumental voices "La Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" in size - and yes, the latter is a drum solo (which must be seen to be believed). <br /> <br /> Production of sounds and vision the values ​​are very high as is appropriate to the Rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angled set. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing performance and tribute to Canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy
