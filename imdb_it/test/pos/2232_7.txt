I said it on Turner Classic just because it was pre-code and it looked interesting. When I went around looking, I noticed that the "criticism" gave a star and a half on a four-star scale. I started looking at it with trepidation - even old movies can be bad movies - but I quickly fell in love with Mary Astor's story and performance as the brain of the business behind the rise of a simple salesman. It is not a truly exceptional film, too predictable, but certainly better than advertised. And I would have liked to see Ricardo Cortez more like the man who appreciates Maria but won't give up his rich wife. I would recommend giving him a look just to appreciate Astor and how long we've come, baby.
