<br /> <br /> This is the best fake documentary of a dog show I've seen for a long time. A very long time. Well, always face it. Isn't that part of the charm? The idea of ​​really going to the trouble of making a movie that mocks a documentary about an event that most people would find strange in the first place. Even if there were no great laughs, one would still be smiling at the thought. Every film that tries something new really stands out in my proverbial book. I loved dogs too!
