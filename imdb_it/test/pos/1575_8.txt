"What Alice found" was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is a combination of a road movie with a warning story, as well as a journey of discovery. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is a case study of a young woman who wants to break away from the unhappy life that leads to a city in New England. His excuse to leave will join his best friend, who is far away studying at a university in Miami. Alice is the product of the house of a single mother, one who struggles to make ends meet, in stark contrast to the easy life that her friend seems to live. In flashbacks we can see Alice's life before she goes on tour. <br /> <br /> Alice, like her namesake in "Alice in Wonderland", embarks on a journey into the unknown so life has not prepared it. American highways are full of predators in search of the weak and the innocent. Alice encounters disaster when her car breaks down and a friendly Southern couple comes to her rescue when a strange man approaches her in the dark with the excuse that she wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to come to their luxurious R.V. on his way to the south. <br /> <br /> Nothing has prepared Alice for what appears to be this couple. After all, in his protected life, he has not dealt with what Sandra and Bill, his new benefactors do during the overnight stays at the rest stops of American highways. It is a surprise for her to understand that the Sandra type is nothing but a prostitute who does her job among the truck that drives the people she meets in those places. <br /> <br /> Alice, brilliantly played by Emily Grace, is a study on how the young woman wakes up to the new reality that cannot escape. In fact, Sandra makes it seem so easy that Alice looks for her fortune in the oldest profession in the world to collect some money that is so much needed. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey performs a tremendous performance like Sandra. Mrs. Ivey is as perfect as the apparently normal woman, one could not suspect that she is doing badly with the clients she and Bill find along the way they travel. Mrs. Ivey is extraordinary when she reveals the truth about her life to an Alice charge. As a husband, Bill Raymond is good in his portrayal of a husband, who is actually a prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the film is not afraid to go to mainstream places films do not dare to go. Congratulations to this director who wrote a plausible story and collected the perfect cast to play it to our advantage.
