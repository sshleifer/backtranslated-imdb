China White (1989) was Ronny Yu's first international film. This U.K, / Holland / Hong Kong production was shot in English and has been slightly modified for the western public. The American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) should have acted together in the film, but due to previous commitments they were not available so another western actor Steven Leigh took his place. Several Hong Kong stars such as Tommy Wong (who plays a silent film) and the ever-disturbing William Ho appear as the director in an interesting cameo. <br /> <br /> The Chow brothers are in the Netherlands to manage the family business. They want family business to become legitimate, but other Asian gangs don't want and see it move like a savior move to please the "foreigners" and want to keep making money the old way. Others want to take their business even to a new minimum drug smuggling and what not. After the elder Chow was killed in cold blood, the brothers move against any family that is not with them. Can the Chow family prevent families from killing each other or while the streets of Holland flow with the blood of innocence and gangsters? <br /> <br /> An underrated film. I was surprised at how beautiful it was. I haven't seen the Hong Kong version. It would be a huge surprise for me. It is longer and has many more Hong Kong cinema stars involved in the production. Too bad this film is not available on D.V.D. The video-print I saw was faded and the sound reproduction was not great. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for action fans. <br /> <br /> factoid: this film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /> in the Netherlands.
