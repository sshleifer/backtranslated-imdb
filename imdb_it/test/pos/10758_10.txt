I went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York and I loved the movie !!! I am the first big fan of Diane and, of course, as always, he gave a magnificent performance !! I've seen each of his films and I must say that this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moving and took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly funny, but also a good dose of serious. Anton Yelchin is just a young and wonderful actor and gave an extraordinary performance. All in all, I recommend this film to anyone who can enjoy an excellent film. 10 inches up !!! I would certainly go to see it again and again and again. This is the best movie of the year so far !!!
