I've always loved that guy with a scratchy voice in all those westerns. It was the sidekick (Jingles) in the Wild Bill Hickock movie from the 1950s. In this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character. He is harmless and no one believes him, but he is not agitated and goes on anyway. When you have a guy like this, there's no challenge because the details aren't there to quibble with. Of course, in this episode, he is taken aboard a spaceship by a group of aliens who do not have a sense of humor and believe everything they hear. They do not have the word lie in their vocabularies. Apparently, it's so unbearable that they can't handle it; and then, of course, there is the secret weapon. See this just to see Andy.
