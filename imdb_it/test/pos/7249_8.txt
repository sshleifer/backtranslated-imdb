So it may not be entirely accurate historically. And there is little or no real character development. But for Jake (son of Ridley) Scott's first attempt is worth the ticket price. <br /> <br /> Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller looks as good as ever) can be a gentleman, but he didn't take the money or clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes on) is an outlawed pharmacist. The circumstances of their strange encounter involve a corpse, a ruby, and eventually a collaboration as street lords. As the tag line says, "they steal the rich ... and that's it". There isn't really much background, or even in-depth development, but the goal seems to be to alleviate the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the passage of the two Highwaymen to America. A small problem: MaCleane falls in love. With the chief justice guard, Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Who happens to have captured the attention of General Thief Taker. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite original, the cast is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as the drag queen Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - even together in "Trainspotting", they have not lost their dynamics), the costume it's fantastic, the trick is outrageous and the music is a tough-looking techno with a strangely classic undertone. Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good sense of balance between show and plot, and he's not picky about showing the most unpleasant side of 17th century London. And lucky for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially the eyes. Jonny Lee Miller's eyes. And also Liv Tyler, but hey, who is this movie about? Rebecca? No. Plunkett and MaCleane. But there is much more to this film than the beautiful faces. At the risk of sounding clich√©, it's a fast, furious and sometimes frustrating run with the noblest bandits since Robin Hood. Decadent, squalid and violent, Scott's debut film is a fun evening at the cinema. <br /> <br /> As MaCleane says, "I was fantastic, and it was a damn good laugh!"
