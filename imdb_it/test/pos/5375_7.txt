This wholly bizarre feature is a typical and prime example of a satanically shocking 70s horror. The events are completely confused and it takes a while before you understand what the hell is going on, but the gloomy atmosphere sucks you immediately. Precisely from the indescribably bizarre introduction, which shows a pair of mysterious children transforming toys into real life war machines, you only know that this becomes an uncompromising and gritty shocking. "Brotherhood of Satan" will soon appear as another episode in the alleged and unofficial "subtitle of the small city that hides a dark secret" subgenus. A young widower, traveling with his new delightful girl and 8-year-old daughter, stops in a remote town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. The villagers behave in a very hostile manner and insist that visitors leave immediately. The city is clearly immersed in a climate of fear and panic, while local children inexplicably fade away and unnatural forces keep everyone within the city limits. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently ruled by elderly members of the community. I really liked "Brotherhood of Satan". History reminded me of a novel written by John Saul, but I don't remember the title. He also dealt with a sect of elderly people who abused young villagers for their greedy merits. The film is mainly based on gruesome scenarios (such as dolls and relics of witchcraft), but a slightly more engaging and coherent script would have been nice. The topic often raises many questions and questions, and director Bernard McEveety cannot always provide answers. The climax is fantastic, very seventies (which means shocking) and unforgettable. Even wonderfully shot films.
