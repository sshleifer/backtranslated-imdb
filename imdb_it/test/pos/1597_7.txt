A film to divide its viewers. Only the criticisms focus on his funeral rhythm, on the snap slides that are too used and on the persistent and persistent looks between the protagonists. The supporters point to the great performance of Dirk Bogarde and the reference photography of Pasqualino De Santis in Venice. <br /> <br /> Considered completely, this could suggest an indulgent and romantic elegy to the nobility of homosexual love (at a time, 1971, when it was becoming consensually legal). In fact, Visconti managed to make a film richer and more complex than a vehicle with a single issue. He knitted his ideas - weaknesses and all the rest - in a meticulous arc. <br /> <br /> Within this, in fact, is the central performance of Aschenbach of Bogarde. Rather than a whisper, Johnny-as-recently gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer defeated by the tragedy and the misunderstood integrity that sees salvation in Tadzio. His hypnotized stagger around an increasingly infernal Venice after the boy is a direct metaphor of the artist's tenacity for the truth in the teeth of the amateur crowd (and is explicitly cut with a flashback of this type). <br /> <br /> Mahler's music is perhaps a little too much used even if it is appropriate. The Italian overdubbing is anachronistic, but fortunately the acting does not suffer too much. 7/10
