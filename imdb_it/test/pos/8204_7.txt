You could get into the core of this movie, and say how it could not happen, or how the main character could enter the offices and start using computers, etc. Without anyone noticing and really choosing the movie in pieces ... or you I could just sit with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live real life and I watch the news with everything that is sad and dark, so I would rather be entertained by my films, and see the bad guys get their right rewards. Don't take it too seriously, and you can enjoy this movie thoroughly.
