I saw this movie many years ago, and I absolutely hated it - I couldn't wait for it to end, and I would go out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this film, and more, I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. How many movies I cried and laughed in the cinema, then forgotten as soon as I hit the road, like ... see, I can't even think of one! Rarer are films like Death in Venice that come into your consciousness and act on sea changes. The French like to say that cinema is an art, and films like this show that they are right. I give him 10 stars, from the 3rd I gave it the night I saw it.
