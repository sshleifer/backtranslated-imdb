Even if you are not a "theater person", I highly recommend seeing it. Based on a homonymous play by Christopher Bond (which, in turn, was based on an old London legend), Sondheim did a great job bringing it to the stage of musical theater. The score is simply fantastic, by far the best of Sondheim, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The show was played very well, my only complaint was the portrait of Johanna by Betsy Joscelyn. It's beautiful, mind you, and it's a very versatile actress, but she doesn't sing too much "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird" too well. But apart from that, it's all phenomenal ... Angela Lansbury * has played the role of Mrs. Lovette, and does it so well. George Hearn was a good replacement for Len Cariou in the title role, and Ken Jennings gives a great performance as Tobias. The ending will give you chills. Top marks for a wonderful show.
