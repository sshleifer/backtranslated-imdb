I watch many movies. Many movies. Getting a degree in film forces one to watch 2-3 movies a day for years. It all becomes very grueling. Mainly because I feel I have seen everything. It is so rare that when I catch something, I especially hope to see something good as I expect. <br /> <br /> Death Bed is so different from anything you've ever experienced DVDs to vent on his genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the piece is psychotic. It is structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay out of the frame. It's not something like Halloween, with all its snappy editing and POV shots; The death bed actually presents itself as a kind of dreamer. The most pretentious way I can express is: this is Samuel Beckett making a haunted house movie. I mean, it's a manic-depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Out in the middle of nowhere! And there are the hands of bones! I can hardly express my opinions on this film. And yes, copping I like this will open you to ridicule. But things get real after a while. It is difficult to be a cinephile and remain constantly engaged. I can honestly say that this is a completely unique film up and down. From what it is to how it is put together. We need movies like that, movies that shake us from our complacency. Consider it as an existential field. it's funny and it's stupid, but also brilliant in its strange way. The worst horror of all time? Maybe, but at least it's not a guy in a mask.
