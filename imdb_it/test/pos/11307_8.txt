After all these years, I'm puzzled as to why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or an extremely famous comic star. She is one of the funniest females on the planet. In this parody, he plays Madonna which is one of his favorite goals. It's Medusa, a very successful singer, like Madonna who also had the documentary "Truth or Dare". Julie Brown teases Madonna like Medusa from Wisconsin, the land of dairy products and beer. I remember the segment in which he went to Wisconsin to visit his family and a tomb. I don't remember if it was a parent or his pet. I remember someone who said that Medusa didn't do anything original. He was just copying the others. I must say that I hope this spoof documentary is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others.
