I took this film during an OutFest screening in Los Angeles in July 2006. It's a bit rough (sound recording in particular is shaky) and often a lot of fun. The script is rather ghostly and ends abruptly, but Ash Christian infuses the film with a very sincere heart. It is also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay movie that is not the protagonist of lingerie models obsessed with the party and the hunt of straight guys. Props to a warm sympathetic Jonathan Caouette as Mr. Cox, a spirit akin to Rodney (Ash Christian), to the lively and lively Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend, and Deborah Theaker to Rodney's mother, who are awarded the best one-liner in the script and steals every scene. The film is like its writer / director / protagonist, lumpy and a bit strange, but also very sweet.
