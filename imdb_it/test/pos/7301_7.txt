A novel by Jane Smiley, loosely based on Shakespeare's KING LEAR on the Cook family and its dark secrets. The director Moorhouse seems tamed in his approach, allowing the characters to come forward and bow. And how could you go wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer, Lange, Leigh, Firth, Carradine and Robards?
