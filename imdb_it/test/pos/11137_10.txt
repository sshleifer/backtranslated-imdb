This show was incredible !!! I've seen all three and this is the best. This film has suspense, a bit of romance, acrobatics that will leave you speechless (GO BOBBIE), great characters and fantastic places. Where was this film shot? Will there be more? I loved the plot with his brother. Looking forward to Chameleon 4 and to see how the world is saved once again.
