My friends and I spent most of Saturday afternoon watching a selection of "bad" movies. Among the films we have seen, the strongest competitor (for the quality of bad films) was easily Jack-O. It's ridiculous that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed on IMDBs below 100. Although they are certainly bad films, they don't belong to the 100 below. They are stealing "Jack-O", and "Keeper of Time", etc., from the Bad Movie Greatness they deserve so much. <br /> <br /> So what makes Jack-O so great (in terms of bad movie)? For beginners, Steve Latshaw, the director, decided to entrust his son, Ryan Latshaw, with the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being carried out by a block of wood. The child, seriously, has no ability to emulate anything. The end result: the gold of unintentional comics. The boy could listen to a joke, or just a few moments to get his head screwed, and his expression is a "pitifulness" without emotions. <br /> <br /> The other aspect of the film that we found fantastic was the large number of "double dreaming" sequences. What is a double dream? Well, that's when a character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something equally nightmare happens, and then the character wakes up. Basically: they wake up after having dreamed of waking up from a nightmare. Smart device, isn't it? I think the character of Sean Kelly has lived no less than 3 double-dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Oh yeah! This film has a cast of thousands of people. It is really surprising to see how many language roles are introduced during the film. Best of all: almost none of the characters has anything to do with the story. They are both killed by Jack-O, or have no purpose. <br /> <br /> Jack-O himself was pretty sweet. Like most B-movie monsters, Jack-O has the incredible ability to apparently teleport over great distances. It is invariably hanging out, somewhere in the background, whenever you are dealing with an important character. What is puzzling, however, is that when in reality he is chasing someone, he is moving at an uncertain speed / stumbling, yet he is able to keep up with the people who are running. <br /> <br /> That's all for now. Concluding remarks: if you are looking for an unintentionally hilarious bad film, you cannot go wrong by hiring this beast. <br /> <br /> Bad movie Score: 7/10 Good Movie score: 3.5 / 10
