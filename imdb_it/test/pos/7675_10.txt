The many comments made by others have been very instructive and I join their appeals for the release of Porgy and Bess, the 1959 film. In my early teens I joined a record club and this album was one of the free ones which I chose to join. I knew some voices were nicknamed, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized in the album. Recently my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I think. The quality is excellent, so I am confused as to why it is available in Europe from CBS Records, Inc, when I had no luck in local stores. <br /> <br /> Actually, I've never seen the movie but for years they asked local video stores to get it. Now I know why it was never available. I add my voice to others who make up for the heirs of property and rights and who agree to release it, however imperfect they may feel it to be - the beauty of music and history has reached so many of us who would never have had the experience otherwise. <br /> <br /> Trudy
