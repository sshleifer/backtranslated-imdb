I saw it originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. However I saw it recently on Irish TV and there was an added narrative by Roy Scheider ("we will need a bigger boat!"). This ruined the film for me. His buzzing monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if something takes the film's brilliance. I wonder if the new DVD version that does not have Roy (for legal reasons?) Prevents people from buying it. Well believe me, the film is much better for this! <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Damian
