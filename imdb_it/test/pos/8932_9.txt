I saw this movie Sunday night and I have to say there is no better way to end the weekend. I am totally satisfied with the humor and warmth that this film offers. It just leaves me in a good mood. Watching this film means having fun and maintaining a warm feeling. <br /> <br /> The film offers a strong British black humor and seems very fresh to me. You really like the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so great. I don't know exactly why. She's too old to be a love interest for me and too young to be my mother. But I feel really comfortable when it shows up in the film. <br /> <br /> Some might say that the story was thin and predictable. But who cares? There must simply be a happy ending, dancing in the sun! Are the characters stereotypes or clippings? I don't know ... I don't care better! I just loved them and enjoyed watching them. <br /> <br /> Also, I have to say that I usually don't like romantic comedies. But this is exceptional: a black comedy with a heart of gold !!
