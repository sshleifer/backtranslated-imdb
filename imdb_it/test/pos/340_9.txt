Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere films seen in a long time. the story of a foster girl who on her ninth birthday learns the truth about her relationship. part in an effort to find out more about his real mother and learns that his mother is now a terrorist. <br /> <br /> the greatness of the film lies in its simplicity. mani ratnam generally has the tendency to create unreal and pompous overlapping characters in this film, every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere. this is why this ranks as one of his best films. <br /> <br /> the film is emotionally draining and tears at the heart of the viewer, keerthana as the 9-year-old amudha and simran like his simply brilliant adoptive mother. their relationship is the cornerstone of this film. there are some notable flaws here, especially the scene in which Amudha discovers that she is an adopted daughter is jarring and seems totally unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents break such news in the way they did it. another flaw is, surprisingly, brilliant songs. they seem forced again and stand out, they don't calm down with the rest of the script. <br /> <br /> having said that, this is still one of the most touching and beautiful films that have come out of India for a long time. this beauty is not only in the script or in the characters, but also in the technical brilliance, the work with the ravi chandran camera is pure poetry. all the characters behave well and realistic humor, especially in flashback scenes, is fun. <br /> <br /> a sincere 9 !!
