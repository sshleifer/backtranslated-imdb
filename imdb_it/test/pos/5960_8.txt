This is probably one of the best French films I've seen in a long time! This "pastiche" or parody of espionage films is very well done and will make you laugh from beginning to end. Some references to today's world are very subtle. The whole Moroccan context of the film must be understood in the light of today's French culture / environment. That said, all the jokes and - apparently - shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are allowed and accepted because this is a parody. <br /> <br /> I was told by my sisters that they had already seen this film that I should have gone too and they assured me that I would have enjoyed it a lot, and in fact I had it! If you enjoyed the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and even movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you will be delighted. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US ... Wait and watch.
