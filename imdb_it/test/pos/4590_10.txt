We just watched this movie in Austin, Texas, at the Alamo South Lamar, yesterday afternoon. It made me laugh out loud many times! The scene of Albert Einstein's thoughts on humanity struck me repeatedly and I could not stop laughing. Too bad it's not in more theaters, I know a lot of friends who die to watch this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great job for everyone involved! Also, if you see it, make sure you stay until the end of the credits! I will definitely take my family to see it again this weekend! If you are a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD then you have to go see this movie. It's a classic and nobody knows it's out! So if you're in the mood to see something fun this weekend, definitely take a look.
