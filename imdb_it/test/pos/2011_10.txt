This was a classic of modern TV! The story is like that, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a gem named Owen he works with. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes to walk around with Bob. Now Owen is around with Bob AND Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very prone to accidents. She is also, if you have not guessed it, she is a little lonely. She is also around with Bob, Alicia and Owen. Sometimes, Alicia wants Bob to have no friends. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first season, it seemed that Owen had finally found a real lasting girlfriend. Bob and Alicia went to drive the night before their wedding, making a small car and then stuck. Way out in the middle of nowhere! What happened next? And poor Heather? Has anyone got married ?? Sorry, the series is over. <br /> <br /> Not even a plea from TV Guide made the FOX think twice before resuming it. It was a great show with a fantastic cast. I loved Heather too. She looked beautiful with those glasses and it was fun. I really miss this show. It's like reading a good book with the missing ending ... sad.
