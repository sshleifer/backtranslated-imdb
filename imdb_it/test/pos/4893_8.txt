The best British comedy film ever! For years the television programs of the English comedy have turned into films and ended up on the flop, 'Are You Being Served?' 'Dads Army', the list goes on. However, the popular BBC TV show, dark humor; 'The League of Gentlemen' has succeeded not only in creating a film that has managed not to be a flop, but has also managed to be the best British comedy film ever! With its dark and horrible twists, The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse is British Talent at its best! His intriguing demonic plot written by the League of Gentlemen (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson) matches the Gents (and guest cameos) with superb acting! I hope this is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway! Don't think that if you haven't seen The League of Gentlemen on television, you won't understand what's going on. It's all well explained and at the end of the film you'll be happy with the result but you'll be hungry for more ... Mmmm, Special Stuff.
