"Classe tous risques" feels like the grandfather of "The Sopranos" in mixing the criminal and the domestic, and of the film friend of feeling contemporary as "Reservoir Dogs". <br /> <br /> Although these gangsters are affectionately entangled with wives, children, lovers and parents, they are coldly ruthless, and we are constantly reminded that they are, regardless of the warm situation in which we see them too. They can strip a child's hair - and then shoot a cold-blooded threat. The key is loyalty, and male camaraderie is beautifully transmitted, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even if their network of obligations and reimbursements of the past is restricted to suspicion and paranoia, as the old band is in various stages of conditional , retirement, out of bail or in new less profitable initiatives. An intense accusation is to send a foreigner to perform an old escape scenario. It is a great moment of emotion when a wife is told that she is not the one the gangster is friends with, while virtually the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when she remembers her wife. <br /> <br /> Streetscapes in Italy and France are wonderfully used, in a blinding light for dark water and highways, from the opening of a pair of brazen thieves - traveling with his wife and two children. Lino Ventura, robust and steep, immediately captures the screen like the criminal father. And the second hooligan is clearly a randomly reckless presence in their lives, as they easily coordinate theft and escape, in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles, in an easy tandem. This is not the cruel old clich√© softened by the big-eyed orphan; these are their jobs and their families and they intersect in horrible ways. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't pull punches unexpectedly killing characters, directly and as collateral damage, and challenging our sympathy for them, until the unsentimental end, which is probably why there never was an American remake. <br /> <br /> It looks so cool that it is not until Jean-Paul Belmondo enters almost a third of the film, appearing as clumsy as a young punk, who realizes that this is from 1960. Sultry Sandra Milo has a smart and terrifying chemistry with him, from an ambulance to an elevator to a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> While the Film Forum showed a new 35mm print with newly translated subtitles, it was not intact. The program notes explained that the title refers to a sort of insurance policy and is called "tourist class".
