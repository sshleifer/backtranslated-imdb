Duckman was a show he used to attend during the last hour before it was time to sleep about a decade ago. It was a contrast to many of the kid-like animations I was watching at the time; I was still a minor drug addict for Disney and Looney Tunes, and most of Saturday morning cartoons were still at the mercy of the peak times of Ninja Turtles and Batman. But even in this period I started to recognize that the most satirical, mature, surreal, obscene and (even if I didn't know the term at that time) satirical cartoon shows were more creative than those I was used to. Around the time of Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even The Maxx were broadcasting TVs via MTV, the United States released two shows - one of them was Weird Science, and the other was Duckman. I have always remembered some key pieces of the show, and some lines are very quotable for those who have not completely forgotten it. Fortunately, I found a tape recently with about six episodes that I recorded a long time ago, and the lines remained very fresh. And the delivery of the jokes is very rapid in the best episodes. <br /> <br /> In the voice department, the choices in talent are first-rate for the storylines, which are usually just an excuse for crude and fascinating parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and TV shows, music, investigative mysteries and dysfunctional family unity. Jason Alexander is a wonderful choice for Duckman, and his performance is a comedy from his days on Seinfeld (although there may be some similar features here and there). Furthermore, the voices of Gregg Berger such as the unmistakable monotonous and impassive Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as the exhilarating Ajax, and Nancy Travis as the unbearable and insignificant mother-in-law Bernice, contribute largely. Along with good writing - even when a joke is not sure, the wit behind compensates - the animation style, albeit far from some of the products renewed and enhanced by today's computer, is inventive and often abstract. It has that home-made, gritty quality that would later have Beavis and Butt-head or South Park. And, as in these shows, if you are a kid, I mean little like in the young of what I was watching the show, you might not understand most of the jokes (ie there are enough strippers and VD references to fill two shows sometimes). But it's creative to invent if it's on TV late at night and works pretty well in that time slot. One can only hope for a DVD box set. <br /> <br /> So, no one who is barely or even ever heard of this program, here is a general note: think of this show as if Dashiell Hammett had met Walt Disney and decided to go to the slum of Las Vegas with a free mini-bar and make a collaboration along the lines of Luis Bunuel and The Simpson put together. Not to mention, it's from the group that made Rugrats. (Forte) A
