In 1983 two James Bond films were made, one of which was the official Bond Octopussy film with Roger Moore, starring James Bond for the first time in Live and Let Die and the other unofficial movie of Never Say Never Again with Sean Connery who played the role of James Bond for the first time in Dr. No, that film was also the first 007 James Bond film to be made. Never Say Never Again is called unofficial because the company that made the other James Bond films didn't do this. Never Say Never Again is also a remake of the 1965 007 Thunderball movie, there are several differences in Never Say Never Again that let you know that it wasn't created by EON. One thing is that the opening is different, there is no sequence of gunmetal and no pre-credit sequence, another difference is the musical score. Some things in this film feel like a James Bond movie like gadgets and cars, plus James Bond always with women and the film has an opening song. Sean Connery still does a great job with Bond, even the acting of the other stars is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Never Say Never Again is a good movie that has just entertained the official James Bond films. Check it. 10/10
