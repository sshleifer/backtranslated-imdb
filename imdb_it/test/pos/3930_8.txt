I didn't expect much from this film when I went to the theater, but I've been waiting for it for many years. To sum up, it was pretty damn good! Chad Michael Murray was very good, I thought it would be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good but the best performance must go to Brian Van Holt. He played the villain too well, I mean he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The backstory among the brothers was good, and I also liked the fact that no murder took place until about 40 minutes into the film. He gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live and what you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was as good as CMM's best friend. I liked the way Chad cried when he found him dead, it was better that only he was like "Whatever, my friend is dead, who cares". He showed how he really cared. So, overall, this was a damn god slasher with some great effects. Good boy!
