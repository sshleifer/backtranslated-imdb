Congressman James Hacker did not expect he would be the next prime minister. Unlike America, the party is elected in Britain while we Americans vote for candidates regardless of their party. Despite the differences, the performance of Paul Eddington CBE as a minister transformed the prime minister almost overnight is aided by his senior adviser, Sir Humphrey, played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and even veteran actor Derek Fowlds returns on the scene. Now instead of pleasing some people, it must please the nation rather than its constituency. Now, he has a tough job to do even more difficult than before. Now, he must approve the list of honors and work regularly with His Majesty. Hacker is not the kind of hacking. It is rather than any man we like and does not want to detest and become a vicious or vicious dictator. Now, we see the prime minister's point of view and all the pleasure that must go beyond managing strikes.
