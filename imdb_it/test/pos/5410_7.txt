It is difficult to judge "Imaginary Heroes" without referring to the fact that director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25 years old. You can hardly believe that you see this film, which is not only a mature, professional and profound work, but also with some of the routine flaws specific to older directors. <br /> <br /> The setting is the American suburb, too familiar for "American Beauty" or "Desperate Housewives". As in "American Beauty", the film turns into a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the film, and we stayed to watch a middle-class family coping with the death of the talented sports brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent trying to cope with the loss, to find the reason and the motivation to survive. Harris guides his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in total, like the seasons of the year) create wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. It is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly, seems too tired and conventional, and I suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young writer and director, trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention. This is how this film fails to be a grim version of "American Beauty", with a different focus. I'm sure we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the coming years.
