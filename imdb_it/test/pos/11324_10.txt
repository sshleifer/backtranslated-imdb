I just wanted to say that when I was young my favorite t.v show at that time was the night heat. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought it was an excellent show and I still do it today. I enjoy watching replicas and I'm a big fan. I love the way the characters played each other. I always stayed up late to see my favorite show with my mother, who was also a big fan. Now I enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme of the song. What I thought was a good song for the show. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott. I enjoyed watching these nice guys make fun of bad boys.
