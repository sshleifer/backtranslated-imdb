"Quai des Orfevres", directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film to cherish because it is one of the best exponents of French cinema of the post-war years. M. Clouzot, adapting Steeman's novel, "Longtime Defense", shows his genius in the way he defines history and how he connects all the characters in this deeply satisfying film which, as DBDumonteil pointed out in this forum demonstrates how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French filmmakers owes his master, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> Armand Thirard's crisp black and white photography has been beautifully transferred to the Criterion DVD we have recently watched. Working with Clouzot, Thirard takes full advantage of dark tones and shadows in most key scenes. The music of Francis Lopez, a man who created light music and operettas in France, works well in the context of the film, since the action takes place in the world of music halls and night clubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in the part. This was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the French theater. Jouvet has clearly understood the mechanisms for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can deepen the soul of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from others. In an unfair comment from someone on this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared to Columbo, Peter Falk's television detective. Frankly, and without disrespect to Mr Falk, it is like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blier is perfect as a jealous husband. Blier had the kind of face that could be associated with that man consumed by the passion that his wife Jenny Lamour awakened in him. Martineau is vulnerable and does not act rationally; it's an easy suspect because he did everything wrong when he finds himself in the middle of a crime he didn't commit, but all the evidence points to the contrary. <br /> <br /> The other great character in the film is Dora, the photographer. It is clear from the way he interacts with Jenny where his true interest lies. Simone Renant is as tragically captivating as this tormented woman and makes a huge contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, who plays Jenny, is as attractive as the singer who suddenly leaps from darkness to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like Brignon, the old lecher. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best directed by Clouzot during his illustrious career and one that will live forever because of the way he brought together all the elements.
