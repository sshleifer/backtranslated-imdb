"The Mayor Of Hell" has the feeling of a Dead End Kids movie, but with a margin much more difficult and very few light points, which precede the first appearance of the Dead Enders of four years. James Cagney has a full screen opening credit, although technically, the "mayor" of the film's title is actually played by Frankie Darro, one of the many boys sent to reform the school during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a tough young man who makes friends with "Patsy" Gargan (Cagney), and is elected in the position in which Gargan has the opportunity to humanize the conditions in a state reformatory. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers has done a lot of these types of films, which attempt to provide a kind of consciousness in an age that knew all too well the effects of crime and poverty. This film is gritty enough, without excuses for ethnic stereotypes, such as in the submissive position of a black father in court or in the way a Jewish child manages to run a candy store in the reform school. The rules of the reformatory are quite simple: work hard and keep your mouth shut; overdo it and you answer personally to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). <br /> <br /> Cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, since despite serious efforts to improve conditions in the reformatory, he still nominally controls a criminal racket outside. The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy is not up to par, the finale attempts to end things in a clean package while Gargan awaits the outcome of an almost fatal shooting by one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of role that would be sought in a film like this. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers would have sanitized some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake entitled "Crime School", with Humphrey Bogart in the role of Cagney and Billy Halop as Frankie Darro. If you are partial with Dead End Kids you will probably enjoy the latter better, since it also offers familiar faces such as Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However the ending is a bit confusing even in that, with the Bogart character involved in a cover of a prison break. Both films offer a romantic interest to the protagonists, in 'Mayor', Madge Evans is a reformist nurse who falls in love with the character of Cagney. <br /> <br /> Curiously, many of James Cagney's early films are not commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on Turner Classics, or get the movie from a private collector. Personally, I can't get enough of this kind of thing and find interesting points of interest in movies of all genres of the thirties and forties.
