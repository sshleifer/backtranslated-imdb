"The Love Letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just a few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and aspirations of a sleepy city dweller . > <br /> It is not for all audiences. "The love letter", I believe, benefits from its simple and peaceful tone. It is never intentionally extravagant or fake like most romantic comedies, it is picturesque, picturesque and comfortable. However, for these same reasons, many viewers will be bored and uninterested. <br /> <br /> The cast is beautiful. It's nice to see Tom Selleck again and it's such an undervalued role. And it's hard to believe that it's the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". It's quite natural here; getting better in every role I've seen since I've torn Indy's nerves. And is it possible that Capshaw is becoming more beautiful and more beautiful with age? (What is Spielberg!?) <br /> <br /> It's not much; but after another noisy summer season I will probably look back with a brief predilection for this feather-light love story.
