"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant film surprise, and keeps the viewer interested. I knew nothing of what was done by the British until I read the other comments of the spectators. I can understand why he won a cinematographic award, because it was brilliantly presented and must have appeared magnificent on a large movie screen. <br /> <br /> It seemed to be much more realistic than most westerns, in portraying how the West was more truly won. As well as the complexity of the characters he presents. The character of Indian-Sam Waterson is particularly intriguing. He appears to be brutal in the wild environment to which he is conditioned, but shows a remarkable respect for the frailties he experiences in the white men and women he meets. She is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in her lands, but has a limit to her sense of revenge, even a pity when she is in a position of power and observes the withered white man determined to take revenge, just as the girl kidnaps after caught a stagecoach. As such, his character seems complex but congruent with respect to the harsh lands in which he lived and which were threatened by these intruders is not insensitive in his dealings with. <br /> <br /> The magnificent riding horse is a critical link & it is interesting to note how this Indian runs it, compared to the character of Martin Sheen who owns it in his power and power for a while. "Eagle's Wing" is an unusual western, a genre I am not attracted to, but I really appreciated this excellent offer, which I would rate second only to "A Man Called Horse".
