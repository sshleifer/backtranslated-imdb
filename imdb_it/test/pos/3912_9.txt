This is the top of horror films this year. "House of Wax" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. This version really puts the film's version of Vincent Price to shame. I only know some of the young actors in the film. The always annoying Paris Hilton; the pain in the know what seems to be more seductive than ever. At least, he didn't try to copy his infamy. Well, if you like horror, it's better than "Vanna White" by Wheel of Fortune. She beats Vanna HANDS DOWN! And the scene in which "House of Wax" was made was no joke. The house was made of wax, and the victims had managed to get out of there before they were waxed like their friends. Those twins Bo and Vincent (the deformed twins) were maniacs from the start. The parents raised them well, except for Vincent. And I think they have become equally deformed. How come the one in the other pickup was creepy, but not as bad as the other two. This is another story in the book. I think he had to follow his heart, and not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist "trap" for unsuspecting victims. This film is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this movie is one of the scariest in 2005! Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
