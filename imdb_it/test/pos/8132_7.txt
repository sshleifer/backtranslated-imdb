Although I saw this film dubbed in French, so I'm sure it lost something in the translation, lack of accents, etc., It was an excellent and fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room that represented with precision and positivity the complexities of individual sexuality, the gender role and the search for a place within the communities to which they are supposed to belong - male, gay, urban, 30-ish, etc. I was very proud of the French television to show such an honest and positive portrait of the gay community. While the fact that the gay protagonist ends up somehow "straight" in the end is slightly disappointing, it's life, and sometimes it happens. This is a great movie, alone or with a date! A truly enjoyable experience.
