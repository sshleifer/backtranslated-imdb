One of the most lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed, a fairly frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice. The final sequence, with that parallel between the crimes committed by the convicted Poncelet and his execution is simply superb. <br /> <br /> No, and the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It leaves you breathless, they are two giants and their performances reach the highest levels of emotion. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins has made it clear that he is not only a good actor, he is also a good director. <Br /> <br /> * My rate: 9/10
