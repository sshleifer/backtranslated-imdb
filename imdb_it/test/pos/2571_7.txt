In "Black Snake Moan", screenwriter and director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with strong symbolism that part of me has the impression of rejecting the entire film as pretentious - a suffocating Southern parable with some such risky themes. The film also contains a heavy spiritual subtext in which religion is dragged into the scene - again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darkest opening scenes, the film increasingly softens its edge until the entire production is presented with the artificial quality of a theatrical play (and I admit that the last 15 minutes go too far into the "Happy Ending" territory for my taste). And this not to mention the archive footage of the musician Son House, which mulls over love and death (and which strongly foreshadows things to come, of course). Yet, in a strange way, these demerits are also qualities of "Black Snake Moan", the story of the aging of Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently downloaded by his wife (for his brother, no less), who runs into a near - death nymphomaniac Rae (Christina Ricci, who easily gives the hottest portrait of the garbage of the trailer on celluloid as always); bringing the girl back to health, he chains her to his radiator to defeat his demons, and hopefully redeems his own fallen self. Although there is a decidedly modest appeal to watch Ricci fall from his skimpy clothes, her performance is risky and mature - it is not possible to find Wednesday's Addams tracks, and she easily holds it with Jackson, who personifies "the blues" in her portrait of an imperfect and God-fearing man. While it is heavy, the scene in which Lazarus sings Rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm / blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a blues jump club that makes you want to be there. The setting is strong, and a case can be made for literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange fuzzy man who persecutes Rae's libido) being a deliberate consequence of superstition and spirituality. And it is the conviction with which this spirituality is reproduced that lends "Black Snake Moan" to much of its strength - the committed interpretations of Jackson and Ricci make this film a film that goes from excruciating to edifying with, well, grace without solution of continuity. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot that I could have done without, neither he nor the sophistication of the bat can prevent it from being a fascinating and meditative film.
