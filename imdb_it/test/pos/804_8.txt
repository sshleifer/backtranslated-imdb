Shortly after moving into his new cottage in the English country, Hercule Poirot receives an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, the owners of a large villa nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is found shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a gun in his hands .... <br /> <br /> The mystery of Agatha Christie is a little skinny, even if the killer plan is still very clever. Exquisite filming and cinematography are what takes the story to the next level. This episode mostly retains the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. The cast perhaps includes the two most famous actors who worked on the series at this point, Edward Fox (like the butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell), although the prominent performance is given by Megan's amazing beauty Dodds. Henrietta: her face-to-face confrontations with Suchet shine and are the highlights of the film. Oh, and since an English police inspector gets involved in the case, I think they could have brought Philip Jackson back for this. (***)
