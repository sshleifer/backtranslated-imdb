This is one of the best lesbian movies I've ever seen! This series brought joy and sadness of true love. Being set in the nineteenth century was an extraordinary look at lesbian lives and the desires of lesbian women. The cast was beyond all expectations! Rachael Stirling is an extraordinary actress, I've never seen any of her other works but her portrait of Nan made me connect with her feeling her pain, her pains and her love. The only thing I feel most important is to connect with the characters in everything I watch. If anyone has any doubts about seeing this movie ... Think twice! This is a series not to be missed. Well done back to the BBC! We need more lesbian films that depict true love and wounds, like this one. Living in Canada I imported this DVD and I'm so thrilled I bought it.
