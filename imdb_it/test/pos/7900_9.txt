Vanaja is a film of superlatives. He has an exceptionally well thought-out cast, with Mamatha as the crowning jewel, a superb production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey through rural southern India through the eyes of a fifteen year old, an extraordinary blend of singing and dancing , traditional and modern, blend perfectly, and a splendid backdrop of lush colors of flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. What a great result for a first-time director !! The casting was absolutely perfect. I would like India to come out with more of these films. This film will remain one of my favorite favorites for my whole life. 9/10.
