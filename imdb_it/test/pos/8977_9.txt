I stopped watching "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and producing. It was not the same. Imagine my thrill seeing a movie that you wrote again. It's been a long time - The American president, A Few Good Men. His script was a nice mixture of humor and tragedy. It made a compelling story credible, and at the same time it made me cry. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was incredible as a small member of the Texas Congress whose voters only wanted lower taxes and kept their weapons. It's not hard work, so he had plenty of time to joke - and he did. His office staff looked like he was in the Playboy Mansion. As he reported, he said: "You can teach them to write, but you can't teach them to cultivate tits." Despite his sexist attitude, which perfectly fits a member of the Congress of Texas, they were fiercely loyal, especially his aide, Amy Adams (Junebug and Hooters' former girlfriend). <br /> <br /> Now, add a rich Texan socialite who wants something done in Afghanistan, played to perfection by Julia Roberts; and a CIA agent from the pain of his boss, superbly done by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> Exceptional writing, superlative acting and a story that needed to be said What more do you want at the cinema?
