The film by Anthony Minghela (writer / director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederation during the civil war, which deals with the politics of war in a very subtle and realistic way. While he accurately describes the brutality and inhumanity of that war, he also does something that many films relating to this period are unable to effectively manage - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out and portrays the changes between the non-possessors of common slaves war-beaten people. And, uniquely, Cold Mountain does not generalize southerners, Nordics or anyone else too much. <br /> <br /> The film navigates between genres as needed, without ever presenting a boring moment. It's a love story, a war story, an action animation and a historical narrative, all well intertwined in one. <br /> <br /> The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are impressed with each other for very simple reasons. As this young story begins to sprout, Inman enlists the Confederate army, bringing with him a book that Ada gave him and a photograph of him. The character of Ada is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience lives this film from a third-person perspective, but the story is clearly his from beginning to end. Ada is an intelligent southern girl and daughter of a liberal minister. The film begins as a dad girl expert in many of the arts that southern women who were surrounded by servants for most of their lives had to learn. In other words, as you admit to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a mistress of all that is useless. <br /> <br /> Ada's father passes and she is left to manage her modest estate alone. Without experience of this kind, she struggles and survives by keeping the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who was raised by a drunken and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities of Ada, and as they become inseparable partners, they grow up to love each other as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for reasons they do not really believe in and decides to desert. No one he meets comes to his aid as he begins the walk of thousands of miles towards Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, which follows both protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. A continuous act of will to despair preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it's his only source of hope in a world of pure despair. For Ada, it is more or less the same thing, but also a symbol and the rest of the old south - a world that is rapidly passing by. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong sense of history. The screenplay and editing are also extremely strong, emphasizing the wide class and educational differences reflected in the southern ante bellum dialects of the lower-middle classes. Perfection should be expected with the cast of this film. And the cast, mostly, is up to the occasion. My only criticism, however, concerns the accents adopted by the characters of Kidman and Law. It is probably not to be expected that an Australian and an English faithfully reproduce the speech of South America, but there are some occasions when these two exceptionally talented actors produce distracting vocal distortions. I admit my hypersensitivity to this, and I can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. Zellweger's performance is exceptional and creates a character that I will remember in my senescence. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
