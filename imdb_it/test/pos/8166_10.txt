First of all, I would like to say that I am only an amateur in commenting on films and that English is not my mother tongue, but that I felt a strong feeling that prompted me to write about this film; perhaps as a way to thank and congratulate C. Jay Cox, the cast and crew for such a brilliant production. Yesterday I saw "Latter Days" for the first time. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it might be similar to the movie "Priest", which I really liked to show a gay priest out of the closet. But "Priest", perhaps because of its restriction of Catholic ideological notions, did not provide the needs of my viewer revealing a profoundly sad end. <br /> <br /> "Latter Days", on the other hand, broke that concept (and some others, like the principles of Mormon); present a tender and cheerful story, bringing it to a happy and emotional end, and yet arousing a feeling of blessing and hope of God. A great film indeed! <br /> <br /> Somehow "Latter Days" made me feel L.A. like a city of angels. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who loves incredibly beautiful gay love stories!
