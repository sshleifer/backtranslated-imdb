I had the privilege of seeing Mar Adentro last Friday, and I am still shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of every single actor and actress, and Amenabar's incredible ability to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was well known in Spain for asking for a legal euthanasia, he lost the cause of the court, and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass with poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to continue to live forever immobilized because of an accident. <br /> <br /> Before watching the film I was already mesmerized by the strong symbolism of its title, which I would have translated as "Into the Sea" and not as some suggest "Out to sea", and which is taken from a poem original written by the man of this story. Then I saw the movie. Oh my friends. This is Cinema with a capital C. The narrative flows to take you to the heart of every single character: Sampedro, reincarnated in a Bardem that you have forgotten from the beginning, is at the center as a man full of a sense of humor and full of hope, and his hope is to die , because for him the life that lives is not worth living. The rest of the characters except one dance around him and respect his decision because they see him as an independent human being (forgetting that he depends on others for everything), even if they love him so much. And this is what the film is about: love. You can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of each character. You witness the growth of sentiment within three women who meet him in the film: Gené, the member of the association who defends his right to die with dignity, his friend, his story in the film is the hope for us the lucky that he can live a normal life in this world; Rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who have used and scorned her; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic fate with Ramón, and eventually behaves in a way that we can't, but only understand. <br /> <br /> However, before meeting these women Ramón knew what love was, because you cannot meet him without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his abnegated family: four unique characters in their humility and courage, each with his thoughts on his decision, every respectable thought in his own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that no one is to blame for what happened. Which, unfortunately, life is sometimes so terrible. From this familiar quartet I particularly appreciated the work of Mabel Rivera as Ramón's sister-in-law, Manuela: an exceptional performance. I would like to draw attention to three episodes that are for me the best highlights I have seen for a long time, and if you have not seen the film do not read it, pass this paragraph and re-read from the next one starting "Mar adentro", let the movie show you its secrets. The episodes I loved were: 3. The best love scene I saw in a movie, when I felt love invade the screen, is when Ramón dreams of flying to meet Julia on the beach and they kiss. 2. Gené speaks on the phone with Ramón, the day before he does it, and he tells her that it's better to say hello right now, so as not to get her in trouble with the authorities. And then she knows it's the last time they'll talk, and she fought for her right to die ... but she doesn't want to lose him, because she loves him as a true friend, and even though she is respecting his decision to at all costs. 1. The best. A young Ramón on the beach, looking at his girlfriend in the sun, jumping on the water from the rocks towards a retreating sea. We see the crash, we hear his voice remembering what happened and he says he should have died at that moment. Bardem's face, turned downwards, is shown to us from below. And the hand of a friend who pulls him from his forehead and brings him back to a life that will be hell for him over the next 30 years. There are many others, like the impressive ending, despite the fact that in Spain we know too well what Ramon did. <br /> <br /> Mar adentro did not deceive me, Amenabar never does, but this time he has to thank the actors who took part in the project and who perhaps took it personally, because this is not just a film, it is an elegy for a man who died alone when he asked to die "legally", which meant to him, as Bardem pointed out, dying with the people he loved and loved.
