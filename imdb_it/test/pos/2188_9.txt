Televisa in 1982, from a Los Angeles production, this is probably the best example of a musical on the stage that is likely to meet. Published on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite surprising. Hearn and Lansbury give the performance of their lives and the rest of the cast is obviously involved in the generated electricity. Obviously, it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make it possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of the American musical form, listen to him. The sets are bare, as befits the plot, and clever in allowing the rapid scene changes to be necessary and the cameras capture the action without erasing the fact that it's a theatrical production. A central, mobile and revolving platform is Mrs. Lovett's cake shop, with the barber upstairs. Around it there are various cranes and escalators to allow the rest of the action. The brutal tale of injustice that leads to revenge, murder and chaos is liberally spiced with dark humor and comic moments. Sondheim does for barber shops what Hitchcock did for the showers! An important American theatrical work is presented here with an electrifying performance.
