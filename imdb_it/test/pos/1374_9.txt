The other day I received it from Creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine while the family stopped at a hotel, had never heard of it. After reading it, it was shot on Balmedie beach, I just had to buy it. I used to take the children to the dunes of the movie all the time while living in Aberdeen. <br /> <br /> First out I am not a big science fiction fan (discovering Star Wars) I just wanted to see what they had done with this movie, I was actually surprised. This didn't turn out to be a science fiction standard, more like a mix of science fiction and survival horror. <br /> <br /> He had a good storyline, which was different, he had great special effects for the budget that was produced with Â£ 8000. Acting was better than average for a low budget movie. The way they changed the entire coastline to make it look like the dry desert planet they are on is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The weapons in the movie were realistic and the creatures were fantastic like the predators in invisible mode. <br /> <br /> All in all I will buy any future version of these guys, maybe a complete horror (Hint Hint). The DVD extras have been very instructive in providing the background to the producers, I'd like to see some of these short films included as extras in an upcoming DVD version. <br /> <br /> Great work keep it up
