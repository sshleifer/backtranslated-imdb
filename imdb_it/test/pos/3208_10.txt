Gilmore Girls is one of the most entertaining, acute, high-pitched, sarcastic and touching television programs I've ever seen (second only to my favorite television show of all time, F * R * I * E * N * D * S). The fast pace and many references to pop culture can leave some viewers confused, but once you realize the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be fascinated for life. Just a few random comments, recently (finally) I started watching the sixth season and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far. I love the Luke-Lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) hilarious. The only thing I don't like so much is the surprising negative attitude and the rash actions that Rory has suddenly "adopted". Unfortunately I don't find it very realistic and I hope it's not just a way to create some drama to keep the season strong. All in all a great season though and I can't wait for the next one to arrive !!! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly a.k.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
