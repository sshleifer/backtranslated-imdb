Do you want a movie that takes you to places? Well, this is a good choice. If you were a teenager in the era portrayed in this film - the golden age of Motown - or if you want to go back and see what your parents made so much noise, I suggest you take this movie and give it a watch. At the risk of sounding like clich√©s, you will laugh, cry, remember and remember. You'll come back at a time when school violence has been a fight with fists. You will remember your best friends from school with affection. It is a pleasant film with a hint of anguish, pain and realism - misconceptions, loss of friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone, regardless of race, age, or socioeconomic position, can get something out of this movie and really enjoy it. So take a couple of hours from a lazy day and take a look at this movie; there are much worse ways to pass the time.
