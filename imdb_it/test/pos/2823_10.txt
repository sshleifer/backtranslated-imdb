This movie makes you think. Show how a woman's weaknesses can cause nightmares for others. His physically aggressive behavior is more frequent in men than in women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable seeing how the leading actress behaved. I think women can think about this behavior, but I don't think they behave like this. The dark scenes added the sense of evil that had to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners fled. I was hoping that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but it is not. Maybe it's more realistic. Life seems to be running in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed that runs up the hill.
