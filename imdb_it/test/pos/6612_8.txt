I saw this movie at the Lowlands festival (23, 24, 25 August) after a friend of mine said this is a very interesting film about the history of skating. I don't have what to expect from this movie now. It was recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of interesting tricks, or it was a skating documentary. <br /> <br /> So I entered, after waiting for about an hour, without expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a nice piece of work on the start of skateboarding. It started with the Zephyr team, which is a nice group of surfers. This is happening in a not very nice area to live. At some point the waves are no longer so good to navigate. So try something else. skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the zephyr team at the time, you are one of the fantastic boys / girls. Because many people saw an escape from the place where they lived with the Zephyr team. So they were trying all the new tricks now on a skateboard. <br /> <br /> At no time has skateboarding been popular again. There were a couple of races and a national competition. The zephyr team participated in various competitions and also in the national one. But what skateboards were doing there was incredible. But the jury does not have now how to judge them. So they put the whole skateboard world on their heads. <br /> <br /> However I can tell you the rest of the film / documentary, but you have to see it with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the atmosphere of this movie. This film has a lot of style for me, so I rewarded it with a greeting from 8. <br /> from gijs and from the rest of the Netherlands. I'll see you.
