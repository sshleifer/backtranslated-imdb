Generally I love SRK as bad (how can you not do that?) And I think SRK and Juhi are a perfect match on the screen as both are actually nicer than cute. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for watch, even if it has some main flaws: <br /> 1) the good guy (Sunny) - not only is he so less attractive than Shahrukh (the one that in my opinion is so important in Bollyfilms) but his role lacks character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier <br /> <br /> 2) Kiran's reactions and Sunil for Rahul's actions are incredibly stupid and naive even for a Bollywood production <br /> <br /> But all this is not so important compared to the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, the great songs (really really great) and (let's say it again) Shahrukh as a villain, I only love him when he is so pagal <br /> <br /> A must-see (along with Anjaam, Baazigar and Duplicate)
