I didn't expect much because of the harsh reviews and as a result I enjoyed the movie a lot. Softer colors and less spectacular compositions of the shots of some of his previous films, in my opinion, have allowed the narrative to concentrate. Although the religious conflict in a vampire movie was commonplace, I felt like many of the other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her. <br /> <br /> very strong and well-acting love scenes. <br /> <br /> the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separates them even more. <br /> <br /> The strong differences between what it means to be "vampires" created by their previous life experiences. <br /> <br /> the lack of dozens of other vampires that appear or are created through the film. <br /> <br /> I have listened to and read several things about "tricks used in other films". Obviously. However, I feel that the tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel that it does it well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately, which I think is the case with this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
