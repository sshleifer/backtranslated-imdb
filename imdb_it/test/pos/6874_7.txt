An almost marvelous mix of comedy, romance and medical chaos has a swinging fifty-year-old doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with round heads, dating a patient of his age whom he met during his tours. The screenplay by Julius Epstein shows a good deal of refinement, even if it does not have enough material to fill the last third of the image and you can almost hear the film slipping. The subplot related to the hospital being investigated for its poor business has not been satisfactorily worked out, and yet it feels very well thought out. However, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a formidable team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney very supportive. Director Howard Zieff continues to peep out, and even when Epstein's one-liners feel rejected by Neil Simon, Zieff works happily. The results are captivating and occasionally rather sweet. Followed by a failed TV series. *** from ****
