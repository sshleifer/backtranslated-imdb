Why is it better? Because it's true for the dark vision of the comic. Because the imaginary is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this. The first had too much screenplay by Jack Nicholson, too much Prince music, and an embarrassing "novel". Here, instead of a villain, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the main character is more than a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the number 1 attraction of this film. His transformation is what drives the theme of running, tottering at the margins of sanity and madness, of good and evil. It gets really scary. The costumes and make-up are excellent. Danny DeVito's penguin is inspired and distressed, not just a fool. His circus band is the element of comic relief (in addition to that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character that I would have attenuated, Walken is rather amiable as the ruthless businessman. The soundtrack of Danny Elfman is perfect as usual, and the song Siouxie and the Banshees ("Face to Face") is easily the best among the songs of any of the films, a perfect combination of musical artist and film soundtrack . The least encampment of the films, is macabre, not pander, and requires a second and a third vision like a ride in an amusement park. Bravo Tim Burton and the cast!
