This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have a cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a soap for teenagers, you know, who comes out with those, that kind of thing. But it wasn't. It's surprisingly deep. He is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you look at it. It's a dramatic comedy, which is rare when it's well done. It's about the relationship between Rory and Lorelai. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, it's a story of the best friendship ... of a mother and daughter. The characters are perfectly expressed and they all do a great job. It's definitely the best TV program I've ever met.
