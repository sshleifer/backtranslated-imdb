This film should be considered one of the most entertaining films in history. His cousins ​​A strong wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are fantastic, but Best in Show takes the cake. <br /> <br /> A film about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively, is the complexity of the characters that make it so good. After watching the film about 75 times I came to the conclusion that there are no weak characters or actors in this film. There is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters, but this only seems to add to the beauty of the film. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and don't find it as fun as I am billing it, watch it again. The first time I saw it I thought it was useful but not overly hilarious. It's a movie that grows on you. Definitely a film that you will often find quoting. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + if you get the DVD watch how these characters are "born" so surprising that these two could hit him so on the head. And find out that they didn't actually go through a script and came up with the way they went. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: a cookie is particularly fun and does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) offers his standard stellar performance of the hilariously weaker half discombobulated. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A + Find me a more fun character than Scott Donalan, I GIVE YOU! For me it will always be a character like this character because it was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. Stefan (Michael McKean) was also very good and interact here (and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans) to show why he is always present in these films. A great actor with a razor like ingenuity. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper-B +, I don't want it to look like it's not fun, it certainly is, but being the only "Solo" act can't be as fun as the others above. Use the dog more than others and have other idiosyncrasies that do. <br /> <br /> The rest is fantastic too, there is no weak character. Watch this movie at least twice. Buy it, you won't regret it.
