It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the director wants us to do exactly the opposite: see them in order, Blue, White and Red, and consider them together as a complete work. It is true that they are distinct stories with distinct themes: freedom, equality, fraternity, and each of them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistic skills. Each of them deserves to be seen independently, but I think it is better to see them as one work. Collectively, I would classify the trilogy as a 9; separately, I put everyone in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The red color is the most memorable in the third film as a backdrop in a billboard ad, whose profile is the central model of the three characters main features of the film. The other two characters perform a double recognition of a different degree of recognition when they come across the advertisement for the first time, posts larger than life next to an intense city intersection. This announcement is not an important part of the plot of this film, however its image becomes surprising and it is one of the reasons why I called Red a mind-bending film. This is the third of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy, based on the Blue-White-Red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto, "Freedom, Equality, Fraternity". The films remain mainly focused on these themes, maintaining the basic levels of one, two or three main characters, but with each film the complexity of the plot intensifies as the three principles go from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality, White) to the social (Fraternity, Red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I give it a 9. It stands alone as a great movie, but one should see Blue and White first for maximum effect.
