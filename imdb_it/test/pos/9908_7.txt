This film was recently shown with untitled subtitles in the special broadcast service in Australia. I thought I'd read here that sometimes it's assumed that * Revenge of the Rats * is a sequel. In reality, rats take revenge for something that is done within this film, or in human history. There is no prequel as far as I know. <br /> <br /> Now, let's remove The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Maybe this story went through my mind while I was watching the movie, but that's all. There was the use of the word "casse" at the end of the film. A stunned mayor tries to justify his actions by saying "the boxes were empty". "Casse" is not a word you hear these days, unless you read the popular stories to your children, like I do. Since I saw * Revenge of the Rats *, I read two versions of The Pied Piper by Hamelin. Now I see the comparison. A metaphorical but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of mice. This is how I can follow the analogy. The children are not led to a door in a mountain, with a lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains, where it is always spring and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> There is a lot that is quite mainstream on this film. Romanticism and resolution in particular. Female characters have potentially powerful roles in society, but they are really quite powerless. Where this film is rather rebellious (compared to American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is fired by the mayor to "do good". The mayor and the local government are portrayed as corrupt and absurd to big money. Finally, a doctor from Frankfurt was assigned to solve an epidemic of a lethal and contagious disease. Apparently there is no national authority on infectious diseases to coordinate things or send backups. <br /> <br /> I'm not a horror fan, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. From the rat in the blood bank you can see that this will have the right balance between horror and comedy for most viewers; the huge number of rats is impressive and even the horror fans seem satisfied.
