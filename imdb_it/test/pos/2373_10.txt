I love that kind of movie. Blood, revenge, lots of action, lots of darkness, cheese and more. But this does not offer the kind that might be expected. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer in the past, I enjoyed watching them, but why not this? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime and is not hardcore and does not even expect nudity in this film. At least add some action to entertain the audience. Even the drama was not so beautiful. Well, I don't want to ruin the film or the plot. But I've heard that Dead or Alive: Final is a little nerd. So with nothing else to do. I don't recommend this film to everyone, but I recommend for people who love decent and well-directed souls. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine and University of Paris 1 Sorbonne Pantheon
