I was lucky enough to see this movie in pre-release last night and, although I didn't expect it, I actually really liked the movie for the most part. The rescues and the effects of the sea have been incredible to observe and have certainly provided an advantage over the moments of seat tension, probably even more knowing that there are boys who do this to live. The weaker parts of the film revolve largely around the use of stereotypical sets. I'm not going to ruin the film, but this really follows the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give it a cheese aftertaste. <br /> <br /> As I said above, this movie is pretty good and it's worth checking as long as you can get past the clich√©s.
