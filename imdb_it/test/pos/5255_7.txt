My sisters and my cousin (female) forced me to see this chick movie. It's not the kind of movie I'd rather see, but it wasn't so bad. I wouldn't want to see this movie, but after seeing it I couldn't say it was ugly, but not my kind of film. He was very precise in reciting what a woman speaks and does in certain situations. As a boy, I wasn't too amused by the jokes, but the women were safe. They referred to the film and yes it was fun to see each other on the big screen. "OH EM GEE I do that to HAHA" I have never seen the original, nor would I like it. If you are a girl, this is a must see, but maybe the girls would say that this film was probably sucked. I don't see a 13-year-old going, "Wow, I remember throwing it when I was 30." <br /> <br /> No man would have this in this collection, but I can't say it was horrible, so meh.
