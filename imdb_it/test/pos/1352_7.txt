Burt Kennedy wrote and directed this novel based on a novel. Kennedy was a well-known writer and director, mostly western. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum has been a star for over 20 years when he did this. This role was like many who had already done, you can understand why he was a big star for so many years. <br /> <br /> He filled this role easily as a well-used glove. <br /> <br /> The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father a good actor Robert Walker - he tragically died at the age of 32 - his mother is famous as an actress Jennifer Jones). <br /> <br /> Robert was a light builder and even though he was talented, he made only a few films. (it was in the last Rita Hayworth movie. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO SALINAS --- the same year and it went very well. <br /> <br /> It looked very similar to his father, but seemed to be missing his fascination with dad. He only made a few other films. He still lives and I wish him the best. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another son of a great Hollywood. Carradine, David, who is still making films, they made a good team. <br /> <br /> In westerns you always have a female character and usually she is a dancer (today they call them prostitutes), Angie Dickinson is wise this role is also attended by Western supporters John Anderson and Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> It was a film in Old Tucson) outside the center of Tucaon Az,. and the scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Typical of older westerns, there is not too much action, good humor and the usual ending ends up out. <br /> <br /> It's a nice 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> Votes: *** (out of 10) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
