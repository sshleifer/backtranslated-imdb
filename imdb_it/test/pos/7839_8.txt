First I would like to start by saying that it is a refreshing start to see a British drama that finally looks and feels credible. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart plays the role of justice (Ian Hood), the government's scientific advisor, with his constant and firm views on authority and thoughts on the future of "real world" science and on how he thinks it is either being used or abused by others. <br /> <br /> Not only has the cast been maintained throughout the series, but it makes the characters more believable than most other British Dramas. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen also offers first-rate performance as Dr. Hood's Bodyguard (Rachael Young), brings with it a refreshing vision of science, non-scientific, uninterested, and its constant battle with Hood makes it some very fun and memorable moments between them. <br /> <br /> The way the series keeps all the most realistic scientific elements I find positive and more engaging than the psychopath we are used to in other fiction or science fiction programs. <br /> <br /> There are, however, considerable disappointments with the series, every time an episode ends I find myself disappointed that they do not seem to cover all aspects of the plot and, sometimes, leave the stories open. <br /> <br /> While bearing in mind that this is still the first series, I hope that we will see a return to form in the near future, in which these open stories can finally have a meaningful conclusion that they rightly deserve. <br /> <br /> For those who like slow-paced science lines, this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to be credible and, more importantly, to the point.
