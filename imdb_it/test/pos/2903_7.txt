I would give this film a high score for photography and film performances. I have just read a comment from the user regarding the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who escapes Sinuoeh, the protagonist. I remember a mini-biography of this actress who followed the film the last time I saw her. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the film industry who had been taken with her extraordinary beauty. He died very young and in tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also exceptional in this film. Like the other neo-biblical films of the 40s and 50s, "The Egyptian" reflects the moral and values ​​of that time, but it is still great entertainment because the performances are fantastic and the story is told so well.
