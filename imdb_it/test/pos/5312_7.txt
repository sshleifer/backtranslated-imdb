The title derives from an alteration that a teenage inmate in a correctional facility makes on the cover of his school book on government, entitled "The United States"; he adds "of (his name)". <br /> <br /> Many features of this film work well - the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and Father Fitzgerald (Spacey) as well as with Leland, Becky and sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the main theme of this film - the fulcrum on which everything hangs - is Leland's character and motivations. He is a rather shy, passive, likeable high school student who boldly introduces himself to Becky who (we find) is going to an alternative school due to a past history of drug problems. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who is just graduating and is preparing to go to college; Julie's boyfriend, Julie's age (and whose parents had recently died) also lives with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with his mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and his mother have long been divorced and his father is a famous novelist. Leland is very perceptive. The boy from "The Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees the teenagers and recognizes that after years they divorce, that the pain will follow the experience of happiness of many people. BUT, for reasons that are never made explicit, his prescient gift seems to operate some times, for some people, some relationships and not for others. ??? <br /> <br /> The parts of the film feel a bit like a derivative quilt - borrowing from "American Beauty", "The Sixth Sense", "The Graduate" and perhaps from others that I didn't to recognize. It wouldn't hurt if only the character of Leland worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling did a great job playing Leland but the script and the story set limits. Would such a young observer and meditative ever be murderer? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the film gives a reason for this. I am a retired therapist with a lot of experience working with families and adolescents; while many of the reactions shown in the film work - this part, this essential element is certainly not. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one other element that, in my experience, would not be suitable for life even if it is not so important. The reason for the differences between the sisters, Becky and Julie, is never mentioned but it's okay. Once two brothers have started to take on different roles (one a good girl, the other a problematic one), the roles themselves can start to drive each other to more extreme positions. For the tormented, Becky, it's kind of "what should I do to be loved around here - give up being me and become Julie?" And the pressure of being up to the good and omnipresent child is no less intense with Julie. So why would he break up with his long-time boyfriend and whose parents so obviously approved of him? <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle was good as a Leland teacher; all the others were good at their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. What was missing was that crucial slip in the understanding of human nature. <br /> <br /> Good acting; imperfect history and psychology; worth seeing; not a total loss.
