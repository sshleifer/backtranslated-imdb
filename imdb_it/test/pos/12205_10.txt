I'm sorry to see that SURFACE was not withdrawn for the 2006-2007 NBC season. I imagine that the market demand for useless games and reality shows broadcast on television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has conquered a good story. I hope and pray that a network will take it back, so it will continue as STARGATE and it is spin-off. <br /> <br /> I also hope that the producers will find a place where they can produce the level of post production they want for an interview with the TV guide. Right now the replicas on Sci-Fi, the marathons, will have to do. I for one would like to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended episode 15. I would like to discover the mind of an efficient effort to hide the true identity of creatures. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
