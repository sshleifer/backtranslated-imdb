Ingmar Bergman's meditation on war concerns a couple who live an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (which country is not specified). Getting mad in the distance is a war they only know from the news. As they spend their day, the war comes to them and soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care. Gloomy glances at the human cost of war and those who are not readily engaged in battle but caught in the crossfire, nevertheless. It is a film in advance of its 40 years since the notion of armies in war was made in which most of the victims became adults. This is a dark disturbing film that is told from the point of view of the average person with the complete sense of desperation and confusion best expressed in the thought that continues to flow in my head, "what do I do now?". As an intellectual exercise, the film is first rate, this is a film that will make you think. As an emotional film it is touching but never completely moving. I was never emotionally moved even though the horror of the situation made my brain soak. (I must say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, but I have never been touched by his films. I am not a "fan". I have always been part of Fellini in the old cinema topic for those who were better off since had more emotions in his films). Reservations aside from this it is necessary to see above all why we live in a world where war, for most of us, is just a thing on a television screen.
