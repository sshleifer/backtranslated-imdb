I liked this series, but I heard that the whole thing was disappointed with sound recording / mixing. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, they had to employ a lot of what is called ADR, where the actors replace the sound of the original position with a re-recording of it in a sound booth. <br /> <br /> The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems in the place or because someone has messed up somewhere in the sound production chain. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so bad if the ADR was done right, but sometimes it's just distracted. It's not just ADR that is the problem - the audio mix is ​​not up to the quality of the performances and images. <br /> <br /> I'd be curious to know what went wrong.
