I have to say that I didn't expect much from this film, but it wasn't bad at all. The most surprising thing, of course, was the performance of Aidan Quinn. I would never expect to see this good actor as an action hero. The great thing is that he really built his character (Annibal). I mean, it wasn't like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis did it, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he is really upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clicks have been avoided. When Annibal gets his training, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and behave like any average American would do in such a situation, ask him what's going on and refuses to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional naval officer, he does not give up and tries not to lose his courage, in which he manages quite well, except for a short break on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I'm glad Aidan Quinn had the opportunity to show another side of him (in fact two, because he also plays the villain), even if the film was not a success.
