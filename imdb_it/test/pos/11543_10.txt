A genius. My genius. I remember the exact second in 1994. I was sitting in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact place. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer," the title said in the NME. I felt like someone punched me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you don't find something in one way or another, I will be amazed. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I wish you were still here.
