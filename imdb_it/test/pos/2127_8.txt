I thought this movie was perfect for girls. It was a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do more whenever they wanted. Most girls would like this story, even if there is the thought of death in it. Even if nobody dies, the king almost does, but the girls don't understand him, so he adds up to make a perfect story. All events add up, creating a great plot that can have meaning if you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls, and since it's a barbie movie, kids can have fun with them, especially if they have barbies. Anyone can have fun with this, because it's so cute and understandable. Overall, I think this film is a good movie for everyone, especially for girls, and will give everyone a smile at least once during the movie.
