Philippe Garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague, almost lost among the vestiges of its ancient splendor but ready to rise from its ashes if recalled from the past. Those who know a little about the director's subjects, on the other hand, may know very well how obsessed he is with a persistent sense of loss regarding the fickleness of reality. "Les amants réguliers", therefore, shows us the parallel stories of an "amour fou" and of an attempted revolution ruined under the direction of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May '68 in France evoked in a series of amazing sequences of plans, a sort of truthful cinematic style, which place the teacher's insurrection in something different from an enviable light on a pitch-black background. <br /> <br /> There is a lot that can be said about the peculiarities of black and white photography used to describe the battle between students and police, where the high contrasts give an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and the darkness turns closes on the excited bodies that surround them in mystery. The images, completely devoid of words, show the real consistency of the myth, made of raw violence, increasingly emphasized by the exasperated reality of the filming. The individual counts for nothing here: he tends to disappear into the mass. What really matters in these fight scenes is the significance of mass suggestion, the blind fury of youthful assault, sinister praise of the power of the crowd, even if conceived as separate entities from every kind of emotion, with the cold and distant gaze of an entomologist intent on cataloging his collection of insects. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described in a more peaceful and intimate way. On the horizon stands the distressing portrait of an egocentric generation in search of his lost time, completely disenchanted with the individual values ​​of men, inclined to rotate on his own axis among opium fumes and make a funeral oration in praise of his recent defeat . <br /> <br /> "Les amants réguliers" seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, revised and corrected by the particular sensitivity of Garrel without departing from the main topic, trying to expand on the whole perspectives on the theme of human disillusions which, although painful, can lead us to the truth. In my opinion, trying to penetrate deeply into the substratum of history, if a man lets himself go and plays things by ear, he will probably find that he can bring out the dark side of his self with terrible and irretrievable consequences.
