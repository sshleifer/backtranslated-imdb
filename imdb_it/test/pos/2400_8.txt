This film is engaging from beginning to end with excellent performances, an excellent soundtrack with original music by Douglas Brown and a script full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Filled with new and not so new faces, this film shows promising talents especially in the case of Craig Morris who plays the main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also co-wrote the script, shows a quiet force combined with a strong emotional performance while creating a believable character on the screen. Even a moving delivery by Paul Vario who plays uncle Benny with genuine warmth was so convincing that it made me go hungry while lovingly preparing his Italian sauce. <br /> <br /> Big new faces, great new music and a great new story - what more could you ask for. This film is highly recommended!
