This horror movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in my life and there are many reasons why. The plot is really beautiful, it has a lot of action and great horror sequences. The actors are not very good but they are not that bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor in this, but he has always been a good actor. The cast is very good as Kane as Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagans like Tye, Samantha Noble like Kira, etc. I must also warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but they are very creative but this makes it better and you can't have a horror film without blood and blood They also seem very realistic. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed by not seeing the evil because it's a really good movie. So make sure you rent or buy not see the evil because it is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Total score: ********** outside ********* * <br /> <br /> ***** out **** *
