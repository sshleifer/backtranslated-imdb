Klaus Kinski appeared in a considerable number of spaghetti westerns in the 60s and early 70s; it was usually chosen in secondary parts as bad villains. Kooky Klaus gives himself a juicy starring role in the role of Crazy Johnny Laster, a dirty, nervous and deranged sex maniac who comes up with a plan to kidnap a beautiful heiress in order to get his considerable legacy. Johnny and his band become wanted fugitives after the plan went disastrously upstream. Writer / director Mario Costa deftly creates a sordid and compelling portrait of a dull and seriously sick and twisted piece of life: the plot takes place at a constant pace, the tone is appropriately gritty and serious, and the exciting action scenes are staged with skill and panache (the shooting in the rock quarries is particularly exciting and thrilling). Ironically dressed in white, oozing with an oily charisma from every rotting pore, and jumping on beautiful women whenever he can, Johnny of Kinski is a charming and monstrous brute. Kinski is simply as spectacular as this gloriously repellent character; Receives the support of the seductive Gabriella Giorgelli in the role of the sweet and fiery girl Juanita, Steven Tedd in the role of Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as the ruthless leader of the band, Machete, Giuliano Raffaella in the role of lawyer Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella in the role of brilliant Johnny interpreter. The compliments are also for the soundtrack and witty of Stelvio Cipriani. Worth seeing for Kinski fans.
