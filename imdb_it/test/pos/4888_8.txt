Whether you are a fan of the series that inspired him or not, there is no denying that it is a fragmented work. But in the best sense possible. Eager to get away from the pitfalls of old sitcoms that made a disturbing transition to the big screen, Messrs Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith and Gatiss have taken a different path, addressing the problems of success with the addition of other creations and inevitably , reworking some of their most beloved characters. It is a pity that they are not limited to a more coherent League of Gents film because as inventive as including themselves in the script is, it weakens the finished film. Worth renting anyway.
