I haven't written a review here for centuries but looking at all the TV show below, the live shows and I felt that I had to make my opinions known about this movie! It is, I believe, the perfect comedy film. Missing the plot of love (I would not really call the emphasis on the breaks with Gina Carbonara true love? Or he and eddie who go naked ... not love) who pass the rest of the comedies from good to shit, Missing the usual dilemmas must overcome in most other comedy movies ... unless you consider the fact that they poisoned the guests and have to escape from the guests green vomit as a dilemma that is similar to other comedy movies ..... No, this movie has just come out and can do one thing and one thing: make people laugh. What is required from comedy movies? Laugh. This movie is filled with laughter and laughter, without filling up the laughter with serious bullshit like other comedy movies! So I call it the, so far, only a perfect comedy ever made and I'll never stop watching this beautiful movie! I apply rick and ade on such a fantastic genius!
