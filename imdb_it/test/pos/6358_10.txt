I was very impressed with this film by newcomer Dir./Writer Jose Reyes. The cast was excellent. "Jorge Cordoba" performed a powerful <br /> <br /> and a shocking performance as the star of "Rafa". It is exciting to see independent films with this level of talent. <br /> <br /> It takes talent, courage and determination to go out and make a quality film. <br /> <br /> I admire anyone who can take an idea, from concept to conception, and take the mile. <br /> <br /> It's easy for people to judge younger directors harder, but I applaud "Jose Reyes" <br /> <br /> and the talented cast for their successful efforts.
