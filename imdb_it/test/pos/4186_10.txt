A very strange, psychedelic, esoteric experience (and I said strange? :). <br /> <br /> But at least on one level - he did exactly what he had to do. He bridged the gap between the stupid, product, the teen pop idols' Hollywood look that was the TV show Monkees and the adult, musically growing and constantly evolving, yet still a bit silly Monkees of the 70s and beyond. <br /> <br /> The most important line of the film is that of Mike Nesmith: "If they think we are plastic now, wait for them to see how we do it". That the Monkees were tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a record issue. They repeated it over and over again in interviews. They needed to rebuild, and what better way to rob and hilariously the machine that created them. And at the same time, they commented on our entire society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why choose us - it's not all this stuff produced in one place or another". These are the Orwellian "proli" (the Monkees represented the persecuted "everyman" even in their most foolish in the TV series) pulling down "Big Brother" pants and kicking him in his well deserved seat. <br /> <br /> Loved the ideas, loved the music, loved the effects, loved the movie! But then, as Peter Tork says in the film, "So why should I talk, since I don't know anything?" :)
