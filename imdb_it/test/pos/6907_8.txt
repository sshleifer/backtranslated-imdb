I sell the dead around for the famous tomb robber Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and graveyard companion, Willie Grimes, has just been executed and Blake is preparing to follow him the next morning. While sitting in his cell waiting for his execution, a priest named Father Duffy enters and asks him if he will say everything he saw as a thief. He then proceeds to give Father Duffy a biography of almost his most interesting exploits. <br /> <br /> The plot consists almost of different incidents linked only by chronology. This prevents the viewer from getting bored, but also makes events less significant as it is possible to easily add or remove many scenes without realizing it. Although imperfect, I thought that in general this method added to the loving nature of the film and made it very funny. Most of the various stories are good, especially the alien, the Murphy, and the vampire, but the others weren't so cool. <br /> <br /> Acting is not surprising but I didn't find it bad at any point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance as he was serious when it mattered and he also plays very well in the comic parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The characters weren't extremely detailed, but they were all interesting. I also liked the way a certain number of villains were done in an almost comic comic book style. The background with the Murphy and their gang is priceless. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I Sell the Dead successfully combines horror, comedy and sci-fi into a mixture of fun and excitement. It's one of the most interesting and original films I've seen in a while, and it's a shame that independent films like this don't get any more awards.
