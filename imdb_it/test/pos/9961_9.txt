The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic film. He is very faithful to Shakespeare's original work. If you saw Jeremy Irons in Casanova and you enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! If you've seen Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco and you liked his performance, this is a movie for you! It's a very funny movie and if you're studying Shakespeare like me, this is a good movie to see !! The only problem with this film is that you can't let the little ones see it because there is a little bit of nudity in it. But apart from that, it's really a good movie !!
