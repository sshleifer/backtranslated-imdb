The trailer does not go anywhere and is limited to scratching the surface of the film and, rightly, also because it is not obliged to maintain its true narrative, but because what actually transpires will cause completely different lines of questioning, some of which I'm frustratingly not responding in the movie, leaving you in your way to interpret the series of events. Which of course means a lot of material for a discussion after the show. <br /> <br /> Metaphorically, the box refers to how we humans tend to unconsciously bore ourselves in situations or things in everyday life, and how our closed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, rarely outside the box. There is a speech pronounced towards the end by one of the characters that will leave you to reflect on this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film, and even on the thread of existentialism, where our bodies are simple vessels for the soul , and from the cradle to the grave he put more boxes in a way of living life. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about the movie, is how he tried to sound smart through the frequent name of secret government agencies like the CIA and NSA, as if there was something overtly clandestine about these agencies of which we should be aware. They have little purpose other than to put every action and every person under control, that nobody can be considered reliable, destroying the chaos in a sense both for the characters and for the public as we try to keep up with the issues of trust for help in the interpretation of the narrative. Having set it in 1976, in a NASA scenario of manned space missions, and in Langley, Virginia, it also provided that bold sense of distrust that will weaken your energies as you sit patiently. <br /> <br /> Based on the story Button, Button written by Richard Matheson and transformed into an episode of the Twilight Zone, the story follows the Lewis family, where her husband Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a foot prosthetic for his teacher wife Norma (Cameron Diaz), and you'd think it's all a happy family with their son Walter (Sam Oz Stone), until one day a mysterious man is named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella in a facial effect inspired by two faces) of which we were prevented in the opening, knocking and giving them a Deal or No Deal button in a box. He pulls the button and gets a million dollars (we're talking in terms of 70s dollars), although a stranger out there will die. If they don't, well the deal has an expiration date. <br /> <br /> History should dictate an agreement, which naturally triggers a mysterious sequence of events taking place, with characters even more sinister (which has a nasal aspect), some of which are inexplicably zombies like, apparently all under the influence, or employment, or Arlington Steward. Whether or not Steward is death, a clandestine government employee, a messenger of God or a representative of the Aliens after an anal probe, remains unanswered, so whatever the way you look at it, it's like delivering something expected , asking only that humanity shake off its innate greed so that its work can be interrupted and return anywhere it comes. <br /> <br /> If you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes that make up the narrative, the production sets and the artistic direction is splendid in recreating the 70's, while you try to understand the mystery of the consequences that derive from a result of not complete comprehension of the fine print. This examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification completes the circle, showing its result in long-term pain, confusion and other choices we will make based on true sacrifices. Nifty special effects come into play, although it leaves only more open space on the genre of the film. <br /> <br /> So is it horror, science fiction or a mysterious thriller? It's all in one, along with a sprinkling of philosophy. Just don't expect a simple narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end ?? this is like an episode of X-Files on steroids.
