This week I saw "The Reader" at a film festival in Manhattan. It touched my heart in a way that few short films did. In about ten minutes, he tells a moving story of two characters that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers did a great job capturing very real and tender moments about the film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story that fits the short format. These are really interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect period of time. It is no small feat. Have we not all seen short films that are simply longer stories compressed to fit the format or theatrical stories that have not been properly adapted to the screen? I congratulate "The Reader" on doing it really well, and I encourage anyone interested in cinema and storytelling to look at it seriously. Worth every moment!
