from the way you look at the other comments made, it seems that many people did not understand the point of the film. It is not centered on zombies, in reality they are not zombies at all, they are a device regenerated by the magician to scare the girls to death, his main goal is on Meg Tilly, who wants to help him finish work that died while he was doing it, first , and what you get is a great movie with a fantastic ending, it's hard to find on video, but occasionally shows up on HBO or Cinamax, take a look, I gave it a 10 and highly recommend it.
