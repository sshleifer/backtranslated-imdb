Since many other users have already explained and commented on the plot, I will not. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to reiterate that Bardem's interpretation is terrifying, as are those of the other actors and actresses in this film. <br /> <br /> Reading the previous comments I noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not show views that are contrary to euthanasia and that those little ones are ridiculed. In my honest opinion this is far from true. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that move in a gray area between the love of Ramón Sampedro and his desire to stay, and the understanding of his desire to die. The most obvious of these is the family. For example, Ramón's sister-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another character of this kind is Gené (the social rights activist) who, at the last moment, tells Ramón to rethink everything. The scene clearly shows that she doesn't want me to die. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters who are clearly opposed to euthanasia. Ramón's brother is clearly opposed, like his father ("There is only one thing worse than the death of his son, and he is having a son who wants to die.") Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramón is GOOD and the priest is BAD. Well, undoubtedly the scene is comic, but this does not mean that the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene derives from the fact that the priest is trying to persuade Ramón to continue living using arguments totally unrelated to Ramón's thought. The priest's speech goes on the line of "God gives and God takes", "We are not the owners of our lives, they belong to God" ... and so on. The play is born from the fact that Ramón is an atheist and all that the priest is telling him is therefore an absurdity. <br /> <br /> This film is the antithesis of Manichaeism, allowing the viewer to think about the subject and formulate their opinion. And above all else there is a song of FREEDOM.
