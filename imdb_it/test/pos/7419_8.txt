This film has one of the best club scenes, excellent soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music) <br /> <br /> some situations (like the main character that Carl starts taking drugs for example) are a bit out of reality, but the plot is fun, but the characters are all a bit superficial ... <br /> <br /> I don't recommend seeing this movie if you don't like techno music <br /> <br /> For the plot / acting alone this film is a 4/10, with really fantastic special effects and scenes and the club's soundtrack is a 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies just to listen to some good songs and grabs the feeling of a small club, it's a 10/10. <br /> <br /> special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (ie fast moving clouds / sun / moon, morphing background, morphing cuts) <br /> <br /> As much as I liked it, too bad there was no dancefloor in the cinema;)
