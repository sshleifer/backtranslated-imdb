This is the third Three Stooges short that the team has ever made, and like many of their first, this is absolutely and totally hysterical! Now own it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, whenever I feel like it, I watch this! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help everyone, but boy, end up making a mess of everything! > <br /> This short is another of my favorite Three Stooges shorts of all time, I'm also a huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the Three Stooges are the kings of slapstick! <br /> <br /> When I heard that he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Film, I became really curious about this, when I heard he had lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> This short is one of the three most fun marmots, I highly recommend seeing this hysterical revolt! <br /> <br /> 10/10
