I saw the first moments on TCM a few years ago but I stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed in the program at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto, and I promised I would make a 40-minute journey. The Stanford is an old cinema that starts every movie with the curtains still closed. Yes, they have curtains. They opened up as the fanfare of the Fox logo began to play. When "The Best of Everything" appeared in huge pink letters scattered across the New York City skyline, I knew I was right to wait. <br /> <br /> I shot this movie. There have been so many small moments that have added the look of the film: When Hope Lange first enters the publishing industry, the titles of the published magazines are engraved on the glass (The Teenager and Elegance); The elegant apron by Joan Crawford she wore to be able to serve her guests at the party without losing her clothing; the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy Suzy Parker was (it was almost sideways in one place); as Hope Lange continued to live in that dish she shared with others, although she was obviously gaining much more than at the beginning of the film (I suppose it was too outrageous for a single girl to live alone). <br /> <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful; so was Suzy Parker. And what about Mark Goddard in a non-speaking role. I fell in love with him when I was a child watching Lost in Space. <br /> <br /> Seeing this gem on the big screen prompted me to plan another trip to Stanford to see The Old Dark House. Incidentally, I bought a small drink and popcorn at the concession stand, and was surprised when the operator asked me for two dollars.
