*** SPOILERS *** Anything else can (or cannot) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted. Cinematography is simply amazing (to say the least) and fx is nothing but the state of the art. Conceptually, the show offers a bit of everything - and for almost everyone (parents, children, fancy fans and / or fx). CLOSE MEETINGS OF THE THIRD GENDER thanks to CREATURA DALLA LAGUNA NERA with some JAWS and GODZILLA launched for good measure, for example. And not even a single sharp note affected the acting; a surprisingly solid casting here. This SURFACEd series, apparently, from nowhere and, by dint of pure narration, brought the viewer for the better part of an entire season. All in all, a very well done job. I just hope that riSURFACEs next season ...
