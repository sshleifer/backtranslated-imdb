This is a beloved film from my childhood !! I can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat !! I remember being late to watch this movie with my father, usually two or three times a year. We have always referred to it as "Giant Robot". Although the effects in this film are crude by today's standards, they were perfect for the genre of this film. I'm also a big fan of Japanese "Monster" movies, so this movie has fallen into the right place with the others. It's been years since I saw this movie and I'd like to put my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8-year-old daughter.
