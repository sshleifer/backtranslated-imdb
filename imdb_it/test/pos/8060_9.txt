This is a film that every child should see before they grow and become distorted, often handed down from generation to generation of family ideas. I grew up in two different places, even if only 20 miles away. I went to school and had friends of every color and religion for the first 8 years of my life. Then I moved to a hilly country (though no longer) where it was very rare to even have an African American child in your class. My high school specialization class had 2 or 3 African Americans (god why can't I just say Black? You can call me a honky or whitey or whatever! All this political correctness makes me angry like most others do! ) back to the film try this to see what happens when people get a distorted view or just what ignorance or lack of understanding does to a culture or country! This is an excellent film that everyone should see, especially children.
