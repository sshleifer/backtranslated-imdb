Great show! About time comes a reality show that closes the gaps in the generation. Competitors have different ages, some look old enough to have watched the movie when it came out. And others, they seemed so young that perhaps parents or teachers have handed down the film hoping that it would touch their lives the way it once touched them. Grease has really become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining film in which young and old can identify. "You're The One That We Want" is sure to get even more followers of Grease. The only thing I wish was more is the story of the character, then again it's nice to leave some to the nostalgic fantasy of the 50s. I can't wait to see the next show ... and then on Broadway !!!
