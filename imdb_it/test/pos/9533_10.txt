Edith Nesbitt's best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, I love it. The film itself has a splendid cinematography and a good realization of the material. The ending is enough to have you in tears, because it's so well done. Lionel has directed some truly excellent films, such as the extraordinary Mr. Blunden, but this is his best directorial film within a mile. The costumes were absolutely adorable, which matched the beauty of the countryside, and the shining and conveniently faithful script helped things. However, it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together, since it is nothing more short than incredible. Dinah Sheridan is suitably sincere as her mother, a much-needed feature of the character, and Bernard Cribbins was as exhilarating as Perks. In fact, I preferred the Perks movie because it's not so funny in the book. The children were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett both gave lively performances, but it is the enchanted Bobbie portrait of Jenny Agutter that impressed me the most. Another special mention is the wonderful music by Johnny Douglas, the music of the title reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's smile. In conclusion, a fun and moving masterpiece, which is better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
