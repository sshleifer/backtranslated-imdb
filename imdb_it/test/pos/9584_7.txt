OK, so I admit that it often seems that most Sylvester / Tweety mates have exactly the same plot: Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but repeatedly fails and is always mutilated in the process, often with the help of a bulldog. I guess it's kind of like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never chase birds). "All a Bir-r-rd" has the same plot and puts it on a train. In a sense, the best part of these cartoons is to see what kind of schemes Sylvester devises to try to pursue Tweety. We know it will fail miserably, but it's also fun to see Tweety turn into a nasty ass (if you've seen his first cartoons, you'll see that he wasn't "cute" at all, but actually had a cruel streak). This mainly works as a way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought I saw - I mean, I tend - Sylvester passes a piece of luggage with the name Friz Freleng on it.
