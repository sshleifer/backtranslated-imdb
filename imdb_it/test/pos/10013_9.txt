I saw this movie at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This seemed to be one of the least popular films of the festival, however, as it turns out, even more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of an actor who tries to deal with himself and his environment after retiring from drug addiction is based on real facts. Moreover, the characters that play the film are the real people who relive this experience once again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a theatrical performance. Not only are they all good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are also actors in real life, the methods used to highlight their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some of the Chinese action films of the late 1980s that began in the 1990s. Later you can watch it in films like Frozen and Suzhou River. Between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and loses all drive to act or even do something productive, except to make futile attempts to become a guitar virtuoso. <br /> <br /> I like the way the writer of the scenario chooses to emphasize his behavior after the retirement rather than on the horror of drugs. We really feel the pain and struggle of Jia. At the same time, we hate him for the way he treats the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film draws the viewer into a tiring scheme. Jia seems to be taken in, dragging her parents and sister who are trying to take care of him. Since there are personal "interviews" with the characters, we feel like we are getting to know Jia not only through himself but also through others. <br /> <br /> The film has a heavy appearance, but Jia's scenes cycle through Bejing and celebrate with her friends lightens the tone. Thus does bitter humor in many events during the film. The music is beautiful and I stayed there for a while. This is a film that many people might not like easily, but for those interested in more serious and modern Chinese cinema this is a strong recommendation.
