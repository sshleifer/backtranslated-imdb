Apparently this drama caused quite a stir six years ago, when he made his television debut - not making lots of TV news, he went under the radar; but after seeing it, I'm not surprised it caused a sensation. Not particularly for the content (even if it is a little more "unusual" than the usual television fodder) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. However, this three-part series is based on a book by Sarah Waters and focuses mainly on lesbians, although the plot also has room to explore other "dark" sides of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan (abbreviation of Nancy) of Winchester. She is bewitched by Kitty Butler, female dragons hostess, after seeing her at a theatrical show and soon starts attending all her shows, ending up capturing the performer's attention and becoming her dresser. It is not long before Kitty is offered the chance to play on larger stages in London and to have become a good friend of Nan, who invites her to go around. The act gets bigger when also Nan gets on stage and the couple becomes a duo of stages ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart, bringing her into an odyssey into London's mean void. <br /> <br /> I must admit that my DVD collection contains no shortage of squalid and sordid films so there was nothing in this that was enough to shock me. Despite being rather tired, I must say that I am still surprised by those who say that this film has gone too far; of course there is lesbian sex and other things, but it is never exploited or abused and the film could not have been made without it. The main objective is always on history; and the story is really well done. The film is almost three hours long in total, but if all this is not long enough to get everything on one side. Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer and the film remains interesting for the duration. The acting is as solid as you'd expect, but I have to admit I found the lead actress Rachael Stirling awkward and hard at first; although she grows in her role during the film. The performance is a bit problematic and the director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too deceptive for my taste. The story is also a bit corny towards the end, which is a shame because this film is the strongest during the dark moments (episode 2 is the highest point of three for me). There is not really a definite point in the film - or at least not one that I could see. This is not important for me; however, Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and exceeds my expectations. It's worth a look for people who love this kind of thing.
