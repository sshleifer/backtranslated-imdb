I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, but, this imitates the reality of life in many ways, and, if you are really honest with yourself, you will resonate it at least in some scenes. <br /> <br /> Acting is not only credible, but convincing in a way that pays tribute to the characters. Besides, it's fun, without trying too much. <br /> <br /> And yes, I really believe a sequel is justified, here. Watch the movie, you'll understand why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
