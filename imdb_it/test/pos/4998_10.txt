I must have seen a different version than the first person in the user comments section. <br /> <br /> It's really, really nice ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are great together. Val Kilmer's character is very similar to that of the novel, although the emphasis is on Gus and Call and the Comanches. We will see what happened also to the mother of Call and Newt. I don't want to ruin it, but it gives a lot of information about Call's character. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge, I thought, to follow Robert Duvall! There is a lot of action, humor, tragedy. It has something for everyone. I can't wait for the air to come, my family is jealous and I got to see him soon!
