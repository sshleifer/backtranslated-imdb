The name "Lucio Fulci" reinforces the images of death and graphic mutilation in the minds of May fans. Thanks to films such as "Zombi 2", "The city of the living dead", "The Beyond" and "The New York Ripper", Fulci has a reputation for being one of the most glorious directors in history. And although many of his later films surely justify his reputation until the release of "Zombi 2" in 1979, Fulci's films hardly contained the amount of blood and guts he knows, in fact they were mostly bloodless. , instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing images at work. "Do not Torture an Duckling" hardly contains blood, but it is at its best. <br /> <br /> "Do not Torture an Duckling" is set in a small Sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic. Citizens are very wary of strangers and anyone else, often avoiding them. After a series of murders of children, although many people go to the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan) who tries to find out the truth about the murders while they continue to happen. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film. It is very well done with an excellent cast full of many favorites of Italian exploitation cinema. It also contains a solid soundtrack and many creative movements for camera movement or Lucio Fulci. But the real attraction of "Do not Torture a Duckling" is the disturbing nature of the film. Young boys, around twelve years old, are shown as retarded mockers, visiting prostitutes and sex proposed by an older woman. It also contains some very pungent comments on the middle class and the Catholic Church. It is for reasons like this that "Do not Torture an Duckling" was blacklisted across Europe when it was first released and was never shown in the United States. However, "Do not Torture an Duckling" represents a monumental achievement in yellow cinema and Lucio Fulci's best work. I can't really recommend this enough, check it out.
