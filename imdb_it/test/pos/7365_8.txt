Caught this movie as one of a bargain for five to $ 5 from a local video store, and it was a very pleasant surprise. It is a collection of four interrelated stories built around four children who have just had a car accident and are waiting for someone to collect them. These stories are told to kill time, and are occasionally frightened by flashing lights and funny noises that come together in an O. Henry finale that left me happy. A real discovery. Blood (and plenty), breasts and beasts complete everything very well ... Jacinda Barrett is worth the price of admission alone. This is a keeper - says Jim Bob, take a look. <br /> <br /> Strangely, even "Pumpkinhead" was one of our five choices and IMDB recommends it to anyone who loves "Campfire Tales". I will follow as soon as I have the chance to sit down and watch it. Joyeux Samhain!
