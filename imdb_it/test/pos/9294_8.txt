The exhilarating team that brought you "CNNNN" and "The Chaser Decides" are back in ABC with their new series, "The Chaser's War On Everything". Shot in front of a live audience, Chaser's team, once again, does what it does best: ensnare key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities. <br /> <br /> Satire is simply priceless, and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, the Chaser Team has chased each other alongside the Queen (during her visit to Australia) to try to have John Howard fired and asked Kim Beazley (Aust. Opposition Leader) to threaten them with kneeling. <br /> <br /> A The particularly amusing segment is "Mr. Ten Questions", which shows an overly enthusiastic journalist approaching celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks ten such stupid questions as " what is your optimum rice grain length? " Just for the record, Theron ignored him and left, and one of the Backstreet Boys became angry and "refused to give him dignity with an answer." <br /> <br /> A segment that had recently targeted me was when one of the team decided to become a "statues busker" to make some more money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in its place. THE PERFECT SCAM! He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (By the way, the show will not be shown for three weeks after Easter, because "even if the team is all atheist, they are also hypocrites").
