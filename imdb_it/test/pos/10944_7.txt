Well, don't expect anything deep to be significant. Most combat scenes are pretty decent. The two main women are rather endearing, but sometimes their lack of HK action background. The ending perhaps lacks something but I still enjoyed it. Humor like this will probably not please anyone who hasn't seen a lot of Hong Kong movies, but if you're down with that kind of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something insignificant you could do a lot worse than that . (OK, so you could do better but .......) <br /> <br /> Certainly on par with most of the Hollywood action movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
