This film is now much shorter than when it was released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium-sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In his day, SHOULDER WEAPONS were a great success due to the humor in the uniform approach. It's still very funny (Chaplin disguised as a tree, spying on the Germans, it's so ridiculous to be hysterical), but he suffers from being set in his age. Charlie has to do with the First World War, a horrible conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst (horrible to say) war of the 20th century. Chaplin would have lived to see that war too and he would have falsified his main architects in THE GREAT DICTATOR. But the latter is more accessible to the modern public because that film is a talking image. Furthermore, Hitler's goal seems more important to the public in 2008 than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his general staff. <br /> <br /> SHOULDER ARMS was to bring us through the drafting of the tramp, his training, his use for trench warfare and his actual combat against the "Huns" on the Western front. Much of this has now disappeared - a segment (when Albert Austin is a doctor examining Chaplin in his project center office) still exists and was shown completely in the documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. This is unfortunate, because the film is now about forty-five minutes long, and there seem to be gaps that these scenes have filled. What remains is top notch, but one lets more be desired ... and feels a little cheated. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman are right to support the parties, especially Sydney like Wilhelm. He had already done so briefly with Charlie for selling bonds, giving a militarist speech before being stunned by the bum with a huge hammer labeled "War Bonds". Here we see the tramp succeeding in capturing Wilhelm and the general staff at the conclusion. It was only passed by Stan and Ollie who conquered the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Chaplin actually had a serious crisis because of his war activities. He was not a naturalized American - not in 1917 or 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the United States because he was an alien enemy (Chaplin and his family were traveling in Europe - angry that Charlie took he was established in Switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he made COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG and when he went to Hollywood for his special "Oscar" career in the 70s). Since he was not an American, he could not be recruited by the United States. He then sold (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) U. S. War Bonds. But in Britain tens of thousands had perished in the battlefields of the First World War, and the public was appalled at Chaplin, who they considered a "idler" and a coward. Eventually Chaplin overcame this, but the remnants of the resentment followed him until his death. This does not detract from the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a film, but suggests why Chaplin did not make another modern war movie until 1940, and a more ambitious goal.
