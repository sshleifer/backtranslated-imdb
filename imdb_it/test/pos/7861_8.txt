It is difficult to know in which category this film is inserted, most of the films set in this period of US history are Western but here instead of in the vast plains of the West the action is almost entirely limited to a claustrophobic college for girls in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Amy, a young girl, who walks through the woods picking mushrooms, while doing so she stumbles upon Corporal John "McBee" McBurney, a wounded Union soldier, who takes over school. We know she's not a particularly kind person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from warning a passing Confederate patrol, even though she told him she was twelve. <br /> <br /> Once they get back to the school's opinions they are divided on what should be done with their new host, some think they should take care of him until his injuries are healed, while others believe that it is a betrayal not to hand it over to the Confederate forces at the first opportunity. The previous group prevails and gradually recovers. While doing so, his presence has an effect on all the girls who haven't had a man in place for a long time, including a young teacher and the hostess that the previous relationship seems to have been with her brother. McBee decides to seduce them, emotionally if not physically, this leads to considerable jealousy among the girls. <br /> <br /> While this film is rated fifteen, it is definitely not for younger viewers either for sexual content, of which little is actually shown but much is implied, and for a very grueling scene that has me made boil more than any other scene in every movie I've seen for a while. It's interesting to see Clint Eastwood play against the type, instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and most of the time at the mercy of the women around him. The acting is solid, not only from Eastwood but also from all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who plays Amy.
