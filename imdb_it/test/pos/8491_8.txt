Jamie Foxx does a great job impersonating the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. For the merit of the film, it shows both good and evil as regards the character of Charles and the choices he made, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant-looking film that gives you a rich feeling of the times when the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it looks good. I just wish there was more music here. When it is inserted, it is fabulous but not enough. Assuming, at least for review purposes, that the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed by Charles, which means that the story has left memorable impressions since I was writing this 16 months after seeing it. The main impressions include: <br /> <br /> GOOD - The immense talent of Re-living Ray and his foresight to go out and risk musically, like going to "country" for a while. Man had a supreme confidence in himself, but he never showed himself arrogant about it. Also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction - without help! It's just great. <br /> <br /> BAD - I also remember that in this film Ray easily managed to get the first place and was disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. A really sad comment is that his wife was more upset with him for losing his son's Little League games than it was for all the deception he was doing about her, even generating a child with a member of his group singing. <br /> <The only downside I had with the filmmakers was the excessive emphasis on his problems attributed to an early childhood event, the accidental death of his brother. That tragedy was used as an outlet for all of Ray's adult misdeeds, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their own actions. <br /> <br /> Note: There is an extended version with the DVD, but the word says it has been modified so badly that it is not worth looking at, so stick to the "theatrical version".
