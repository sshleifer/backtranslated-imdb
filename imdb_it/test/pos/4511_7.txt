Greetings still from the darkness. Based on the mega best-seller of the author Khaled Hosseini, the film gives us a peak on the ugliness of post-Russian Russia and the terror of the Taliban. Director Marc Foster adds a jewel to his resume, which already includes "Monster's Ball", "Finding Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction". <br /> <br /> The story of the young friends Amir and Hassan and the unknown bond they share in the next generation. This is a story of honor, courage and loyalty and is an unusual history of education. Some great scenes of the boys when they are children and then a couple of really incredible scenes while Amir returns as an adult to find Hassan's imprisoned son. <br /> <br /> This is a compelling and compelling story with a message. Acting is solid throughout, without an actor who steals the screen. Although it is not a pleasant story to see, it is certainly significant and felt. Also a quick shot of Midnight Oil in the billiard room is a welcome gift.
