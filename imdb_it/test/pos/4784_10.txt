A cartoon by Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE. <br /> <br /> STEAMBOAT WILLIE, a mischievous little rodent, neglects his pilothouse and makes his way into the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> November 18, 1928, a young man in trouble The genius debuted the first successful cartoon in the world with synchronous sound. There would be no second thoughts for Walt Disney or his alter ego Mickey Mouse. The financial struggles would remain, but in essence the world was their bed of oysters and Mickey would eventually rival Chaplin as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century. <br /> <br /> As entertainment, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch, with beautiful work images of the animator Ub Iwerks and shows a Mickey Mouse with all the passions and indifference of a small child. It must have something to do with a tyrant tyrant (Pete, without his iron leg, appeared in Disney comics since February 1925), a witty parrot (in a few years he would be a Duck) and a cute little mouse named Minnie. Together, the two rodents, however, play carelessly the living bodies of a goat, a cat, a goose, piglets and a cow (a precursor of Clarabelle) - all of which were comfortably aboard the steamer. The public screamed more and the model was set for the next Mouse cartoons in the coming years. <br /> <br /> ********************** ******** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney (1901 -1966) has always been fascinated by images and drawings. As a boy in Marceline, Missouri, he designed farm animals on pieces of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he designed comical figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, together with the artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated advertisements and small cartoons for local cinemas. Always the innovator, his series ALICE IN CARTOONLAND has started the creation of a live figure in a world of cartoons. Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother, Roy, became his lifelong financial manager and consultant. When a successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was ripped off by the distributor, the Mickey Mouse character leaped into Walt's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made the screen debut of Mickey, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a huge success with the use of synchronized music. SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing team of wonderfully talented animators quickly conquered new territory with full colors, illusions of depth and radical advances in personality development, an arena where Walt's genius was unbeatable. The mischievous and mischievous behavior of Mickey Mouse had captured millions of fans, but soon it would have been reached by other animated comrades: the extremely tempered Donald Duck, the intellectual Pippo and the energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's biggest dream - animated feature films. Against a storm of doomsayers, Walt persevered and in the following decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi and Peter Pan. Walt has never forgotten that his fortunes were all initiated by a mouse, or that the childlike simplicity of the message and hard work have always borne fruit.
