This show is my guilty pleasure to the end !! When I tuned into America's Next Top Model for the first time, I expected to get bored and find it very stupid. I didn't do it. This show is actually real fun. I read on one of the other reviews that I ask you if you have what it takes to be the next top America model. And so it does! Who doesn't love the charm and excitement that comes from being a model? On ANTM you can see what you REALLY like. And who doesn't like to hear each other's bitches and fight? Or would you like to want to throw something at that Mrs. Janice? <br /> <br /> Give a chance. Don't expect something smart or a show you can watch for a life lesson. Enjoy it for what it is. Serious fun!
