I love this film and all aspects of it, well directed like a comedy and like a drama. The acting is extraordinary, interpreted by a cast of famous actors who perfectly interprets the high society New York. The scenery is incredible, totally breathtaking. I also love history: a successful New York architect who is going through a mid-life crisis leaves his cheating wife and flees to a Greek island to hide with his daughter who chooses to go with him. <br /> <br /> I just can't express my romance enough about this movie. "Let me see the magic".
