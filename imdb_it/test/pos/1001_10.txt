Despite the title and unlike other stories about love and war, this film is not too sticky and pink, because love is like a rose: with thorns, that is. The four main actors have defined their characters realistic and with a good sense and a balance between the tragic and the simple. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of the cabaret / chanson-esquire songs (sung by Keira Knightley herself) drag the viewer more and more into the film, from one place to another, between brutal war and love Pacific. Some people may find it too much of a biographical film, but it is above all a romantic story, even if it follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship that is full of joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> London is displayed for another time from another angle, Dylan's bohemian life during the attacks on the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. Independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept away by both feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the end is too distorted and somehow loosely hangs out for the rest of the film, but all in all this is a great romantic story.
