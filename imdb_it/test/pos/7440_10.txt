hey I think this movie was great and that it has fantastic graphics and I was happy to have used Final Fantasy 7 I think that game was the best I've ever played, this is a great movie and I loved it. They should do another one but maybe they should use the final fantasy 7 again or the fantasy 10 final there are both fantastic of: Tyler Sheena I hope you can send me an email if you have any details if there is another one. people for anyone else reading this I suggest you see this movie is animated, but it looks pretty realistic and has some great fighting scenes that I haven't seen for a long time to fight fast in a movie. The game Final Fantasy 7 is also very nice, it's not good graphics but it's really fun and challenging
