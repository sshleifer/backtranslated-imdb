For those accustomed to television comedies now, whether they are sketches, sitcoms or animation, it's nice to see something truly refreshing. <br /> <br /> The Chaser must be the best comedy of this decade, Seinfeld is the triumph of the last. It follows the urban crusades of the landlords to fix situations, do 'public street tests' and try to get the facts from our politicians the old way. <br /> <br /> Despite being very controversial, at times, the shows are of excellent quality with well-established and really fun opening merits to sketch style investigations (sketch style only in time, they are not scripted, at least , not those on the other end of the joke) is certainly worth watching. Even the most cynical and intellectual spectator will not be disappointed, and the show deserves ten stars. <br /> <br /> All in all, well done to the ABC for showing it and I highly recommend it.
