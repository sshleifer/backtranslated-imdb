The 80s "My dinner with Andre", with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, is essentially a dialogue about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. "You Are Alone" from 2005 shows how common social events can destroy the soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. There is Daphne, a beautiful student who goes around practically every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as confident as Daphne is clumsy. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same character. Part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the first scenes in which Daphne approaches the door of an old hotel room. He stops and is obviously torn by the decision whether to knock on the door or not ?? but it is Britney who slides effortlessly into the room when the door is opened. <br /> <br /> On the other side of that door is Buddy, a middle-aged man with few, if any, personal qualities that nobody would find attractive. He goes so far as to confront himself with the profession chosen by Britney as soon as he enters the room. However, we soon learn that Buddy is Daphne's neighbor and has looked over the years as he grew from child to woman. This complicates things for the public. Is Buddy just a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If it's the sex that Buddy wants, here it is. Britney loves sex. Its definitions could be Clintonesque, but this does not make it a great enthusiasm. He prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic bracelets that his customers are encouraged to choose. Each color band denotes a specific act that will perform ?? but exactly which act is not revealed until after the group has broken the wrist and the choice is irrevocably made. <br /> <br /> Britney is, or believes she is, in control of every meeting. Even when blindfolded and tied up, as she is by one of her regular customers, she imagines that her arms and body are caressed by more men, but her legs and pubic area are caressed by a woman in blood-red lingerie. The images of the film continue to come. <br /> <br /> Buddy's pathetic life is one of acceptance. He lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies of the beautiful teenager next door. It is no coincidence that he has attracted Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room. There is a painting on the wall of a plate with only a fish head on the left. This is a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life; all the good parts are finished. So it's here, where did you bring your wife when they were still college students, that he took his position ?? to regain control of one's life, to make its affirmation. <br /> <br /> The director of 'You Are Alone', Gorman Bechard, knows his trade. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, assisted by a myriad of inter-cut scenes that add dimension to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, Britney asks Buddy if he should undress. He says yes, but undresses only for his underwear. A real prostitute will probably remove all her clothes (one of the five of the profession gets). But it is not Buddy who is teased, we are. As the film concludes, we discover that there are much deeper human emotions and motivations at stake. A tease does not work unless it actually provides. Britney does it, you're alone too.
