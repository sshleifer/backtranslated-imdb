Yes TV series of great worship. The great atmosphere, the superior script and the good performance make this candidate a class A candidate for DVD publishing. <br /> <br /> This is a leading tour de force of Australian TV history and has that incredible groovy vintage soundtrack with Doug Parkinson's gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70 years of Australian over the cathodic box as an incredibly long camera reveals the religion of the open road in all its Antipodean glory. This is a reminder of another era not too far away, and has the proud imprint of the powerful land Down Under from beginning to end, in all its sheer freedom and determination. <br /> <br /> Force ABC! Take part in the program and free this fantastic cult from the 70s that everyone can enjoy - or re-appropriate if you're lucky enough to have lived the dream at the time.
