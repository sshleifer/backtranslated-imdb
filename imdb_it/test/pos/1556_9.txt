I gave this 9 stars from a possible 10. If it had just a slightly more complicated storyline, I would have given it to 10. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless it is a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, playing a nice old flirt, should have received an Oscar for his performance. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (playing Alice), whom I had never seen before, also does a great job and has the sexiest body I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> In the blink of an eye for the old car, Alice lit up for Florida, where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and it's my fault, not of the film), and the high hopes of going to college, which she and her family cannot afford. <br /> <br /> It looks rather vulnerable out there on the road alone, and sure enough it meets some characters with a somewhat rough appearance and shortly afterwards it turns out that there is a hole in one of its tires. <br /> <br /> Is at a staging point at that time and is assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband, Bill, an elderly couple traveling in a camper. <br /> <br /> They will go south to Florida and take it under their wing, but they are all just like they are? Flashback and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new life lessons.
