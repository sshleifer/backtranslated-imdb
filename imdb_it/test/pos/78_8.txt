"Acrobatty Bunny" by Robert McKimson is one of the director's best shorts. Although the circus-based setting can evoke horrible memories of McKimson's terrible 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is actually not nearly as boring as that parody. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a fierce lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and fun from the start, not to mention extremely attractive to watch. There's a classic scene where Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the lion's jaws. In a brilliant Disney parody, he blocks "Pinocchio" in the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some cleverly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with, followed by an exhilarating and grotesque rendition of "Laugh Clown Laugh" which, as a child, I imitated regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence that gives the cartoon its name. I have never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and I find that it usually creates a series of boring and predictable gags, but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks from the mold and the result is a hilarious and amusing short film that stands among the best of McKimson.
