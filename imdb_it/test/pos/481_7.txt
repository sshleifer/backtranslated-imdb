If you want to see a brilliant performance by Mikado, played perfectly with timing and expert panache, don't look at this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle running around in the society of private clubs of the English gentlemen of 1930, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good introduction to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after that, run out and rent the Canadian version of Stratford. You will see the difference between good and great. No one does G & S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.
