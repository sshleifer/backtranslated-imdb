This film has set the standard for all rock biographies to follow. He achieved this through the energetic performance of the leads, the stability of the work with the camera (avoiding the clich√©s of the "rock-video" that were invented for the Beatles in their first two films), the tight editing and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as a human being rather than a symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are small holes in the plot, and random details that are a bit useless, and there will always be a debate among the families of those who are personally involved with the specifications. But the problem here, as in the much more recent "I walk the line" or the famous biographical film by Carpenter Elvis TV of the same era, is whether the meaning of the life of the performer, in his time and place, as a catalyst for ideals of fans and appreciation, manifests itself in the performance, and this is clearly the case here. We come away from this film to understand not only how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I don't see what else you could want from the movie.
