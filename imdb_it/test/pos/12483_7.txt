This film is so lovingly made that you want to be a part of it forever. The flic are straight but not without malice, the products are transparent and the wicked are not there. Even the "cabarets" are so naive as to make you daydream with nostalgia in comparison to all that is available on TV. Blier is fine, if a little one-sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you can't have better copper. He has the best line: "My father has cleaned the dirt of others, and I do the same". Susy Delair is unbearable, but I think part of it is the songs, the wardrobe and the hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the other hand, makes a great femme fatale, albeit a little silent. I didn't realize that she could be a lesbian as a IMDb dbdumonteil user and others rightly suggest.
