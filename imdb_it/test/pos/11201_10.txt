This is not a movie to impress you with high budgets, high-tech shots, rapid camera movements or sparkling costumes designed by an exaggerated and hungry director. But it is a film by a director who is also a great photographer, who has a great sense of looking at things as a human being, not as a half god unlike most filmmakers. This is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best "interpretations" with unreal gestures and imitations or, at the most, learned. Rather, it is a film in which they behave as real as possible. In reality, they are not professional actors at all. The dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are real as they can easily be yours in real life. You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid expressing in words. Show the same signs of annoyance to an unwanted guest. This is the same feeling of disconnection that is achieved in modern city life. And this is your chance to see yourself from the outside, personified by the main characters. I saw all the films of Nuri Bilge Ceylan, incl. his short film Koza (Cacoon) thanks to those who put it on the DVD. Many compare him to Tarkovskij, Ozu and perhaps Bresson or Bergman as he is emerging as a true author. And he is sincere in saying that his films are not about making money, but about making sense of his life. This is the kind of sincerity that you will find in Uzak.
