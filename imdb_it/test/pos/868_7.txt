This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. The type of title that ruins a film because it does not evoke the plot or the characters. A title like this makes a flop at the cinema, even the French title isn't much better. Too bad - Truffaut and Deneuve must have been enough to sell it .. <br /> <br /> This is a long film, but it's worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal advertising bride, her rich husband, a theft, a change of identity and an obsessive love. The plot here is actually very good, and takes us on an unexpected journey. <br /> <br /> The thing that works both for and against the film is the focus on the relationship. It is an interesting study on how these plot developments take place in "real life relationships" with these two people. Unfortunately, this is what boggles the film and makes it unsatisfactory. We like movies to have a real sense of purpose, and here it is missing. <br /> <br /> In many of his films, Deneuve has become a canvas on which directors can make their fantasies, and this time it doesn't work as well. Messy here, it's the fact that the director clearly wanted to have Deneuve take his shirt off a couple of times. Deneuve is an actress who always seems very thoughtful and reflective, so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script had to be worked out better before shooting, to make this film narrower and shorter and to shoot. But Truffaut didn't snap, did he? So - wander a little, but it remains interesting.
