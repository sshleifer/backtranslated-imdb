I'm so glad I recorded it on VHS tape when it was presented on Master Piece Theater. This is a film I can watch again and again. How to live in the early 1800s in England is not difficult enough, Prue was born with a "hare lip" and is excluded from birth. The people in her village welcome her a little, but they always fear that she is "from the devil's forge" and they are ready to light it. Especially when a lot of bad luck hits his family. She is strong and brave but moves away from Kester Woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. Partly because he fears rejection and also because he thinks he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as adorable as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and speaks his mind and follows his heart. The film remains faithful to the original story of Mary Webb and is compelling from beginning to end.
