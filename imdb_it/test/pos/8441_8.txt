Large companies vs. Conscious of making good. We seem to be witnessing events of this kind (both in real life and in the life of reels) all the time and most of the time greed wins by using all the (dirty) means necessary and the truth is suppressed. At least in this film Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) got his points and paid him a heavy price. We have seen many other films of this kind made in recent years, the most memorable of which was "The Insider" in which Russell Crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to blow the whistle by claiming that the industry has added more nicotine in cigarettes to make smokers dependent. There was also this corner of the reporter-protagonist in which the journalist is looking for the scoop of his dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma in which he must choose between justice and his livelihood and sometimes his life. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda performed Kimberly reporters perfectly. She interprets a reporter who wants to pursue serious news while her bosses consider her more an "eye candy". She and her crew (the cameraman played by the post-'Coma 'Michael Douglas who is also the producer of the film) witness an accident at a nuclear power plant while they were visiting. Cameraman Michael Douglas illegally / illegally took footage of that tape event despite being a non-photo area and taking him out of the station. The station refuses to broadcast it and informs the company that owns the nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile chief engineer Jack Godell starts his own investigation and discovers a lot of irregularities in the equipment used for the reactor. All this makes all the dirty politics of corruption and greed explode. <br /> <br /> This is a good thriller and has managed to create a lot of tension in the audience to the end and the funny thing was that there was no underlying score to suggest all the scary moments. Now it's great and unusual in movies. The performances were all good and I love Jack Lemmon. We know him mainly for his comic roles, but he is equally good at dramatic roles. I give this movie at 8/10.
