You can't see the same movie if you didn't grow up in France (or you spent at least 10 years like me). I don't know if he will ever be able to overcome the French cultural boundaries (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You can't translate his kind of fun - every name is a joke (how many people outside of Paris would understand the pun in "Couloirdebus", the name of one of the Roman legionaries?). However, Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
