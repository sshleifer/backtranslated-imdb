therefore, I will not disagree with the critics, but I was not really touched by this film. I was a little hesitant to rent it, since I'm facing some of the same things that the main character should try. however, I rented it thinking that I could experience some catharsis, or at least understand that I am not alone. while I understood the protagonist's irritation with his distracted cousin, I did not feel his inner struggle with isolation as I would have liked. I felt that much more emphasis had been placed on his disruptive cousin who only agreed to his welcome. it's a beautifully filmed movie and I really appreciated the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation.
