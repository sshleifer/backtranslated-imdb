I was very surprised to know that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this film. He looked very lifeless and fully educated from the 54 (!) Old Bergman in the scenes where they were side by side. If it had been written today, I think Bergman and young Ivan would have finished together (Ingrid is much more exciting than Goldie ...) and the two characters absorbed by Matthau and Hawn will be left out of the cold. But it was written in the late 60s and feels like Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the Park. However, Matthau's headshots, Hawn's innocence and Bergman's class performance make this all enjoyable to watch.
