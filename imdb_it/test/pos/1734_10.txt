I take a kick from the new fans of Who who call him, excellent, they are entitled to that opinion but the new series has not yet arrived, it is coming. It's definitely good. <br /> <br /> Good things first. The special effects are obviously better almost 20 years after the last episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield". <br /> <br /> One thing the BBC has always liked is Doctor Who (except when they tried to delete the 70s and 80s). However, the wait and the pressure was great, but I think the new series has passed the test, it's good, it's still not excellent because it has its flaws. Some of the "Dalek" stories were very poor. I assume it was written in a couple of minutes by an idiot who never bothered to redo the Dalek character or never bothered to look at the old series. <br /> <br /> "Aliens in London" was probably the best episode so far, he started a new story on Aliens that lasted through several episodes including "Boomtown". <br /> <br /> Now the other bad things, the partner, Rose, Billie Piper, is not great. It is actually quite annoying, but as is also Dr. Who that a young teenager must be chosen and got the part. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is quite respectable, he began to seize his niche. He tried to play the character, in a direct and amusing way, but the right joke is always missing, but he took it much more seriously and shows. <br /> <br /> Continuity wise there are still some problems that were not solved well, Paul McGann was still the doctor before this, but he was not restored. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, although the series is pretty good, I haven't missed an episode and it never bores me, so I recommend any Doctor Who fan to have a look and see the new series of Doctor Who.
