It is interesting to note that the metaphysics of Platon and Aristotle, the formal logic and the form of abstract ontology of those sciences to which most people do not care. But then, about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to usurp human thinking, and the humans who refused to reflect on issues other than biological, physical and chemical, suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that these computers would carry "overnight". "Welt Am Draht" by R.W. Fassbinder, along with "Solaris" by Tarkovsky and "Alphaville" by Godard, is probably the first film that took the philosophical issues of emerging computing as the basis of a story to be told in a movie. The confused questions about identity and reality are intelligently incorporated into several intertwined criminal stories that the public really tries to follow because it is interested in solving cases. Fassbinder was a master at selling highly abstract content to his audience by incorporating theoretical knowledge into practical and appetizing forms. The fundamental problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other hand, a reality also requires identity to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is known to us only from the point of view of psychiatry. However, logically spoken, the only reason we have only one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values ​​(right and false). Now take a logic with only one more value, that is, with three: So, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens now, when, say, Dr. Stiller is killed? Thus, it is quite possible that only one of the three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to save the individual from death. Another question is whether a person with multiple identities actually perceives these identities simultaneously. The idea, however, of displaying such sets of identities in a descending or descending manner, as shown in the elevator scene in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and therefore reality are not structured in Hierarchical, but in a Way heterarchical. Strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity" either, since each identity is defined on two objects that share all their characteristics with one another. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has a single identity is nothing but a consequence of the ancient two-value logic (a second identity would imply that a person exists and does not exist at the same time). But now look around and see that the same object (which by definition is identical to itself) is perceived by every subject in its own way. If therefore each subject sees an object in a different way, why should it not be possible for the individual to open the boundaries of his individualized corset to two values, with the effect that different people can exchange their different individualities? Fassbinder, five years later, will collect this subject in his masterpiece "Despair: a journey into the light".
