I couldn't wait to see The Guardian, but when I entered the theater I wasn't in the mood for that particular moment. It's a bit like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm not exactly sure what was dulling my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to Kevin Costner's latest film about the theme - Waterworld. Also, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him. Something like that bothers me. It probably has to do with its monkey characteristics. <br /> <br /> It took about two minutes for my fears to subside and my hesitations slipped away. The film immediately throws us into the middle of a tense rescue mission, and I was grabbed tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange facelift. My concerns were briefly raised to Kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort had been made to portray him as ridiculously cold and rebellious. Sunglasses, a sturdy toothpick in your mouth, and a smirk that would make George Clooney proud? Yes, we understand. I was totally ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my shots. <br /> <br /> I warn you, monkey man! Effectively combining tense, exciting, dramatic, humorous and solid rescue scenes, The Guardian is easily a film that I would dare say that most audiences will appreciate. You can quibble over its clich√©s, predictability and rare moments of hangover, but none of this detracts from the value of entertainment. I had the bad feeling that the pace slowed too much when Costner started training young people, but on the contrary, the training sessions could be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been represented on the big screen, so I hear the inside looking at what they are going through and how difficult it is to make it very instructive and a great way to get the audience to know about this sub group. approved. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Think about it: you can go on dangerous missions in cold, dark and choppy waters, and then you have to fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen while trying to help people in panic and panic who depend on you for their survival. And if all this is not bad enough, sometimes you can't save everyone, so you have to make the difficult decision of who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> Man, who wants all this responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it really was for these guys, and who would have thought I'd have an Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only does a great job of paying tribute to this rare race of heroes, but fortunately for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> Visitors who want to take a look inside what it means to undertake a daring rescue mission in the ocean may want to give the Guardian a chance . I saw it for free, but if I paid I would have felt I had earned the value of my money.
