This is the true story of the great jazz pianist and singer / legend Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, winner of Jamie Foxx). He was born in a poor African-American city, and became blind at the age of 7, but with his skills of touch and hearing, this is what later in life would have brought him to celebrity. In the 60s he had realized his dream, selling records in millions and leading the charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed his falls, including the separation from his wife and child, due to his relationship with a band member, his drug and alcohol use, and going to prison because of this. She also played Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Kerry Washington as Della Bea Robinson, Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown, Harry J. Lennix as Joe Adams, Bokeem Woodbine as Fathead Newman, Aunjanue Ellis in the shoes by Mary Ann Fisher, Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson, CJ Sanders as Young Ray Robinson, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun and Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler. It's a great story with a great singer impression, the songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlights. He won the Oscar for Best Sound Mix and was nominated for Best Costume, Best Director for Taylor Hackford, Best Editing and Best Film of the Year, won the BAFTA for Best Sound and was nominated for Anthony Asquith Award for film music for Craig Armstrong and the best original screenplay, and was named Golden Globe for Best Film - Musical or Comedy. It was the number 99 in 100 years, 100 Cheers. Very good!
