I can't believe the low scores of this movie. Probable reason has to do with the low number of votes which means few people have seen it. This is simply a fantastic movie! There are so many stories intertwined inside, but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the film and we experiment with them undergoing life changes. The scenery is simply fantastic and the credits are the best ever in any movie I've seen (just like a Shakespeare play). Yes, it's a bit dated (shot in 1982), but the problems faced by the characters are very current. It may have been filmed in 2002 without any changes to the plot. Raul Julia is incredible, the best role ever in a movie - this is her distinctive piece. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a carefree young woman and John Cassavetes is the force that puts it all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, watch it and have fun. Back on IMDb and mark this film among the top 250 of all time to which it really belongs.
