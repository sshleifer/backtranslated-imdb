And with those words one of the great advertising campaigns of the film came to a conclusion. 'Garbo Talks' and spoke these words in his first sound film, an adaptation by Eugenia O'Neil in the role of Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike other players and some other studios, MGM has taken great care in finding the right vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were comfortable in the universal medium of silent films would lose their careers because of talkies. Their heavy native accents would have intruded, some did not know English. <br /> <br /> It was no coincidence that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First of all it was written by one of the main American playwrights, it was the kind of literary property she would like. Secondly, since the main role was someone who was Swedish, the accent could be explained. In the end, many of the problems of early talkies were solved, even though Anna Christie still used the titles. <br /> <br /> Like most of O'Neil's work, he is short on action but long and in-depth characterization. The story takes place on the New York waterfront where Garbo, like Anna, came to live with his father George Marion. Marion fled into the sea years ago when Anna was a child and Marion abandoned her wife. Anna had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and this includes prostitution. <br/> <br /> Marion, of course, is happy to see her, she even kicked Marie Dressler, the old crone of the waterfront who lived with years to make room for her flesh and blood. Naturally both Marion and Garbo have their problems adapt to each other, not made easy when they shelter a sailor played by Charles Bickford who takes a big fancy to Garbo. <br /> <br /> Marion is repeating her role from the original Broadway production. The role of Anna on stage was made by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie ran for 177 shows in the 1921-22 season on Broadway. It is one of O'Neil's best-known works and one that is frequently used. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo's performance with perfect diction even with a Swedish accent was hailed and his future in sound films was assured. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the film also received nominations for Clarence Brown for Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. The Daniels should above all receive many compliments for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. And Brown created the atmosphere around the waterfront where the film is set. <br /> <br /> The work of Eugene O'Neil is timeless, so Anna Christie, although with many of the first sound films, does not have the same story as many films from that era, Garbo also shows that she has mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. Anna Christie is a classic, all around.
