I went to the pre-screening of "Rory O'Shea Was Here". I like this film better than I expected, because the excellent casts and powerful performances. It's a film about the friendship of two young disabled people. Rory is a young free spirit who wants to be independent regardless of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new friend, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly hypogastric. I suppose it's enough to start with a tearful drama. Well, it is. But with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. It made me look at my life for things I take for granted. What would I do if all I can do is move my two fingers? I should feel grateful for what I have and for what I can do. This is a good movie, although it could have been better.
