Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly expressed in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens's Christmas carol in his sensitivity. The film's success depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the character of Alexander Yardley. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercises control over his employees - until the Christmas spirit surpasses him. The role is a "walk in the park" for Greenstreet who had been one of the great Falstaffs of the stage when he was part of the Lunts company. Greenstreet had only entered the film five years earlier, when, at age 61, he was presented in what would become a film classic, the first and best film ever directed by John Huston: "The Maltese Falcon". Sakall 'Coccole' has probably never been better in its traditional role as the embodiment of Central European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used during most of the film is an eye-pleasing jewel.
