WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the script focuses on a young singer in the 1980s, who leads a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing his own music for the note, but he is also living the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of a certain originality, fate makes him a good turning point and is hired to replace the singer of idols. Has a dream come true? Well almost. As he begins to live the life of the famous, including the excesses of the drug and sex of the 80s rock scene, he will also have to face problems in connection with his supportive girlfriend and will eventually have to answer questions about creativity and have a way to say in the band's music. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, one of the reasons is that it is one of the first times that the life and music of hard metal rock bands are shown a realistic way. Fans of the musical genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The general idea is original and the questions about how an artist lives his life and creates his art are rendered in a reasonable and balanced way. Acting is pretty good, with Mark Wahlberg better than most of the other action films I've seen recently, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the role of a cute girl who knows a lot about life. The end is more problematic, which is quite conventional and could disappoint. It seems that the main character after having left the great and famous band has found his own creative path. However, in an ironic touch, the music that is playing in the club at the end is the worst of the whole movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you don't like this kind of music, you can choose to avoid this movie.
