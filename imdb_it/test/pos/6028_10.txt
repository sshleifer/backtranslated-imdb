I have to tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think that part definitely worked ... rather well actually. However, the film was also very good. Some parts of this film are really beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film also has a great action. The mystery is quite difficult to understand and Rose [McGowan] does some "Oscar" acting towards the end of the film, but I don't want to give anything. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also great in the film, along with some of the other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like mysteries, action movies, or just like Rose ... I absolutely think you'd like this movie.
