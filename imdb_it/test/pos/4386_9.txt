I've seen almost all the Coen brothers' movies now, and I have to say this is one of their best films. I would not dare to say that it is better than "The Big Lebowski", but it was very nice in its own right. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was very interesting and fun sometimes. I loved all the characters, particularly Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> There is really nothing negative to say about this film, but this film is not for everyone. It might be safe to say that if you enjoyed the other Coen brothers movies, then I hope you like that too. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you'll like the movie, but don't hold me back. <br /> <br /> However, I hope you like (d) the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
