The adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll story is much better than one might expect. Here Alice is a virgin librarian who falls into the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self-image. Made at a time when adult films were creative attempts with plots rather than just a series of sex scenes, this is a small film looking much more like the low-budget movies of its time. Despite what you might think, this movie actually has a good script with funny lines and good songs. It's a small fairy tale for adults. If you're wondering if my recommendation is good or not, consider that the film was only available in its non-hardcore version for the better part of the last thirty years, simply because the film resists sex, that's how I saw it for the first time the film years ago on cable TV. The relatively recent version of the home video on DVD brings back the sex (in horribly grainy clips inserted) which makes it clear that the removal of the shots was the absolute best choice. If you are an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy, I can highly recommend this little movie as a nice diversion.
