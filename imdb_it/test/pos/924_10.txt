I believe I share the same psychological view of the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not without metaphysics in the midst of total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps a poet prime minister, so that as a zone of low social and cultural pressure, Poland could play the role it played in the Second World War, being critical but Christian towards Jews but often not less critical of themselves. There is innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's vision of the world, like the symbols of Catholicism: the white against the black Madonna. In Rouge, the Black Madonna is the one the judge fell in love with when he was young. Flashbacks are magically intertwined with the present, even if totally random, like the camera that simply swings across the street or the young judge's red jeep passing by the young woman's car after she accidentally hit the his dog with it. That we have made a leap in time with those same moves is what we catch later. His love was unanswered, so that his life was not as he had planned it. He has lost his ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge, he actually feels spying on other people's lives and when he retires, he simply continues to do so, spying on his neighbors this time. The innocence and righteousness of the younger woman (literally) accidentally entering her life, re-installs her best judgment and it is thanks to her that she spontaneously confesses her spying behavior to her neighbors and the police, accepting and even clinging to the stones thrown consequently through its windows. In the process, the story repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves, even if this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski may have struggled with this piece because the old judge is his alter ego, and is said to be infatuated with Ir√®ne Jacob. Both women play the same essential role in his psychology, of that (!) Which possesses his heart and soul and therefore can do it or break it, just like an old man! It is as if the "powers in the air" were, or God is, bringing them together. The coincidences are * too * random to be just chance or even luck. There must be some mystical, supernatural or theological source that influences these unfathomably profound life decisions. The study book has fallen and opened to the exam question page is another example of this. Or the moment the old judge turned his heart to the young woman, the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams open the doors and breaks the windows. The gigantic image of the young woman seems to predict that on TV, after the drowning of the accident on her journey across the Canal. These moments are actually accentuated through the human voice of the liturgy or what it seems (Van den Budenmayer).
