I rarely like movies about smart teenagers who have problems with authority, but "Toy Soldiers" has grown on me with repeated visions. This is as much a movie about Billy Tepper growing and becoming as adult as I am, and I give credit to Sean Astin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. who don't make it a big deal, but let it be just explaining and sneaking up . The camaraderie of Tepper's friends, their grief over Joey's death and their joy at their survival, all are truly moving. And, I must admit, I take a certain patriotic joy (and perhaps a little straight) when the members of the United States Army finally enter and kick a drug dealer target. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic score of Robert Folk is the icing on the cake. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons not to love "Toy Soldiers", but until we take it too seriously, I don't see the need. This is one of the funniest "bad" movies in my pantheon.
