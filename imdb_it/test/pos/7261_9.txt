I've seen previews everywhere before deciding to watch it. And what do you know, I really liked it! It has a new twist in 18th century England. Although the music in the dance scene has obviously been modernized and also the colors of Liv Tyler's clothes (even if it's pretty!), They fit perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you just want a good time, you should check this out. Very different from other detailed 18th century films.
