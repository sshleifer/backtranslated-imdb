If it is not the best film ever made, "La festa di Babette" is certainly among the most affectionate. This is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor is mixed with tender desire; the characters are treated with honesty of research but also profound respect. There are meditations here on memory, destiny, old age and loyalty. Wonderful work with the cinematographer's cinematographer Henning Kristiansen: rarely did the wrinkled faces look so bright in the candlelight. The meal is accompanied by delicious period music, Brahms, Mozart and simple popular hymns. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, because as the general says: "Mercy and truth have met together, and justice and bliss will kiss each other".
