Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow forced them to grow up without conscience. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become shrewd and calculators of cold-blooded killers. Joyce Russel, a nice local girl, finds herself confronting these small terrors when most others fall in love with their angelic attitudes. <br /> <br /> Finding movies like "The Bad Seed" and "Village of the Bad Seed" Damn, the premise of this film of evil children may not be entirely original but is still quite disturbing. three child actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - are incredibly convincing: director Ed Hunt and his co-writer Barry Pearson maintain the unpleasant but irresistible state of mind for the duration of the film; admit to the girl the admission for an involuntary peep show involving the older sister (future stand-up comedian and MTV personality Julie Brown, whose striptease is a real eye). <br /> <br /> Name the actors Susan Strasberg, as a teacher of ice, and Jose Ferrer, with very little time as a doctor, add to the acts with their presence, while KC Martel, one of the young people of the original "The Amityville Horror", is very likable as his younger brother of Joyce and family members such as Ellen Geer, B-movie man Michael Dudikoff, Cyril O'Reilly ("Porky's", "Dance of the Damned"), Joe Penny ("Jake and the Fatman") and William Boyett ("The Hidden ") can also be seen. <br /> <br /> Touching these fears of the parents while the children play with the guns they discovered and locked up in the old refrigerators, "Bloody Birthday" is little more than a simple slasher variation with children as antagonists. Aided and favored by the soundtrack of Arlon Obers, this film sticks more in memory than some of his brothers, without a lot of blood to cover (although that arrow through the eye gag works quite well). <br /> <br /> Ugly, bad and unstoppable, "Bloody Birthday" is worth a look at the curious. <br /> <br /> 7/10
