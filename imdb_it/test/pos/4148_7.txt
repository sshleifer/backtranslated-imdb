An interesting look at the experience of immigrants, told like a fairy tale with some very strange images. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to this film because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine very similar to my grandfather at the time. Traveling in the wheelhouse to provide ballast for ships, I can't imagine it being very comfortable, as shown in this film. <br /> <br /> There were laws that restricted immigrants. I would say that these laws were more severe on those who came from the Mediterranean and from Africa. Immigrants had to be free of contagious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film, we see the physical and mental exams, the second due to the fact that low intelligence is heritable. Single women could not enter the country, presuming they would become prostitutes, so most of the singles already married in the country, as previously agreed, at Ellis Island before entering. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who organizes to marry a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He is trying to convince his family with a son who is mute and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) who is considered weak. By the way, she was fantastic in the role. <br /> <br /> You will also see the leading actor, Vincent Schiavelli, in his next appearance. I don't know if his latest film was released. He's a fan of weddings, and he's also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but funny movie. It is not for everyone, as I imagine those who have no interest in the experience of immigrants would find it rather slow.
