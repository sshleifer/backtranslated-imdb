I just watched this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I have to say that I thought it was great. The combination of humor and sincerity has made the film really useful. The film was about a seventeen-year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. Seventeen, Ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him girls, guide and life. It is very comical and moving. I honestly have to say that now it's one of my favorite movies. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. If you haven't taken one of the screenings at the film festival, it should come out in theaters later in the year. Please go see it! It's a great movie.
