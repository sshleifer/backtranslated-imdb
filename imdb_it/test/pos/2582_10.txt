I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I should have seen it. It didn't disappoint me at all in the film, which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken bluesman and the nymphomaniac who aims to treat not only for his own good, but also his ... yet it is much more than that. She is complex and rich and manages to drive you crazy in a dirty, sticky, sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bathroom later. <br /> <br /> The characters are (for the most part) multifaceted and very well written and executed. Accents and dialogue have been impeccably taken away. However, there was a weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can say for him is that he can pull out crying ... he is a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he was trying very hard. I would definitely give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rae (respectively Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci) have great chemistry and great respect for each other. This is one of those films in which no matter how good an actor is if the other is not up to the task and, fortunately, both actors were up to the task. <br /> <br /> The music was very good as you'd expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side, everything was brilliant as far as I could see. It was well cared for, well turned and well mixed ... everything was great. The character and the set were perfect, the casting of supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was perfect ... I loved it.
