Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and this is the "top ten of all time". I came across "Two Hands" by chance (maybe this made it even more special - no inflated expectations) on IFC one night, and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it. Now that Heath Ledger is becoming more famous in the United States, I'm sure it will be more available. At the time, I was telling friends about the movie, and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional IFC shows. <br /> <br /> However, in the genre black-comedy / gangster it fits well with my other favorite, and everyone in the movie really seems to end up with what they deserve. Bryan Brown is hilarious as the main gangster who does origami with his little son and plays scrabble with his henchmen. Even amusing is the fate of a car thief's rapid modification at random. Heath was also pretty good. At the time, I vaguely remembered a short series on Fox called "Roar". I hope Gregor Jordan will make another success, but as far as I'm concerned, this is his best.
