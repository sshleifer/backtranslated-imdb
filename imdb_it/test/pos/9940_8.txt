If you are comfortable with the extravagant work of the Italian premier horror director, able to accept his scandalous narrative lines and flamboyant style, then you should have a good time with Opera. If you don't, you won't. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a young and beautiful opera comedy which has been given a chance of fame (in an avant-garde production by Macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. As every player who has "trodden the boards" will know, Macbeth is a production that brings a curse and Betty soon discovers that the show in which the star is now is no exception: is a killer systematically firing the staff at the theater? and poor Betty is forced to look at the sadistic killer (who keeps the needles under her eyes to keep her from closing them!). <br /> <br /> With the help of a little girl who crawls air conditioning units, her director and agent, and some crows that saw the murderer's face (!!!), Betty discovers the identity of the murderer and the truth about his mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... The work is a crazy film, with its absurd plot wefts, the complicated scenes of death, and an ending that begs beliefs. And while director Dario Argento has never been one for, say, conventional plots, this particular yellow is so stupid, and presents so many of his stylistic touches (all soaring to the maximum), which is almost as if, with each film next, he is seeing what he can get away with (sometimes almost parodying his previous work). <br /> <br /> This is exactly why I find the movie so funny !!! <br /> <br /> The movements of Argento's camera are absolutely incredible: gliding, creeping and, in an incredible scene, even swooping around the opera house above the public; the power of Verdi's music combines perfectly with the majesty of Claudio Simonetti's synth score, providing an adequately grandiose accompaniment to the sumptuous visuals; and several extraordinary sets (with Sergio Stivaletti FX's fetish gage) go to show that nobody does death better than Argento (take a look at the splendid disappearance of a character, in which a bullet passes through a peephole in a slow motion door) , and directly in their eyes!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
