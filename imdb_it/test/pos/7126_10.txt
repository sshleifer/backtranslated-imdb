I was laughing out loud most of the time when people were staring at me because they couldn't hear my laughter. I literally fell off my seat at a specific point. <br /> <br /> I am a barman and a bouncer to live in the real world (note my use of the term real world, unfortunately it must always come first), and every time I say to someone that I play RPG, it is usually followed by one of two questions: 1. What, like D&D? I played it in Junior High. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I have been searching or a group forever! Have room for another? Very rarely people don't know what D&D and Gaming are. <br /> <br /> That said, almost every person who watches this movie can get something out of it. Even if you are not a player, it is likely that there is something in your life that "Geek Out" on which you can be lightly teased, and that only means that you can relate to hijinx in this movie. It's just a light joy in an hour and a half.
