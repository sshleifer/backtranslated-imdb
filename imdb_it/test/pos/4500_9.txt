This is a film that left me breathless ........ wanting to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. With today's "evil" mantra that obscures reality, it was a source of inspiration to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> The fusion was impeccable, the scenery simply wonderful. The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy neglected this (except for the music) is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful and such an exciting journey. Provoke a "bad scream" from this observer. <br /> <br /> A film worth looking at a second and third time.
