If we compare the film industry with an ocean, we tend to look only at the surface. Driven by the strong marketing force of Hollywood, we've all seen war movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But under the foamy waves, lesser-known pearls grow in silence from time to time. When you take one and look at it carefully, you wonder why this pearl lies almost unknown and why it is not already on the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is a real gem. Why, do you have a group of actors estimated by several million dollars? No. Do you have thousands of extras? No. Does it have breathtaking, spectacular and bright computerized visual effects? Not at all. So what's so special about it? Well, in a word, it is the pure reality of the past recreated and transposed on celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the bloodiest battle in history is here. Messy and injured soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, setting fire to villages, collapsed buildings, decayed suburbs, explosions, explosions, burning tanks, fired soldiers, burned alive, grounded by tanks in their graves or pieces - all. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are reduced to simple pawns, without the power to change anything. The soldiers we follow in the film try to leave the combat zone and fail. Civilians remain in prostration in the middle of nowhere, crying only for their sons killed. Merciful, the huge grinding machine of war fuses humans, equipment, villages, cities together - and you ask for more victims and destruction, again and again. <br /> <br /> In all this collective madness a group of German soldiers struggle to survive and maintain at least a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But, as everyone knows, a battle is almost lost when people begin to lose confidence and trust. We see how all these people are abandoned, how they intend to desert, how they struggle to take the last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some wounded soldiers were treated as simulants and fired, how they were forced to perform a small group of Russian civilians, including a boy, as they later discovered a place literally full to the ceiling of food and drink - intended only for some "superior" officers, of course. One by one, dead people fall. The end of the film is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching I've ever seen, all on the magnificent soundtrack of the Munich Philarmonic Orchestra. The war has destroyed everything in its path. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for everyone. A true movie buff should have it in his collection. The strong anti-war message must be a warning to us all. Unfortunately, humanity never learns, nor do politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be reasonable enough to stop THE WAR?
