This film offers many delights and surprises. When Achille and Philippa sing wonderfully a duet of "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the film, appreciate the thin layers of this excellent film. The story takes place in 18th century Jutland and the use of vintage music played on vintage instruments is just an extra touch. You share the exquisite joy of General Loewenhielm in his participation in Cailles en Sarcophage even if you are just watching a movie - but just want a little taste to savor. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share his creations so directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this film, the potential that food sharing must transform the way people see themselves and how they see the world, is very similar to the theme of "Chololat", but " The party of Babette "does not hit you in the head with its message. Citizens are conservative but not overly oppressive. You come to understand them, respect them and finally appreciate their humanity. <br /> <br /> Many questions have been raised to reflect on: the nature of art, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of the environment on behavior , taking life to give life, among others. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech delivered at the height of the meal. I was expecting profound profound observations, but I had vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact that I barely remember it. <br /> <br /> But this minimized film leaves a lasting impression. The heat it generates is in contrast with its austere backdrop. You will leave the theater to go out and dance under the stars.
