At 2.37pm in a bathroom in a high school in Adelaide a student takes his own life and the different worlds of six teenagers have changed forever. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a brutal, honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager. The film follows a day in the lives of six teenagers, all intertwined, all with their own personal dramas. While there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix ?? the beautiful aspiring girl who deals with bodily problems, super-obsessed with her grades, there are many horrors far from the main flow you can get, including an outcast who deals with a brutal disease and a young girl who seeks make sense of a devastating event in its past. <br /> <br /> The film is mixed with documentary-style interviews of the characters, which some viewers might find a bit out of place in the narrative otherwise seamlessly. The pace is also a bit slow, but it adapts to the feel of the film. The young Australian actors are all stars in their own right, in particular Theresa Palmer, whose heartbreaking performance earned her an AFI nomination. <br /> <br /> The film is very well shot, with a fantastic direction. Are some scenes a little hard to watch ?? in particular the suicide scene lasting five minutes, but overall it is a film that leaves a great impact on its "spectators". It attracts you directly from its shocking opening scene and leads you to guess which of the six main characters will end up in the bathroom. Ultimately, it is a beautiful look, but slightly disturbing to the life of a teenager.
