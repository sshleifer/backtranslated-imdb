25 sitcoms had big screen spin-offs. Most of these came in the 1970s. Here is a list of all: You are served, Blackadder, Bless this house, Below, Father's army, Father Dear Father, For the love of Ada, George and Mildred, The gentlemen's league, Love your neighbor, The lovers, Man about the house, the closest and the most expensive, no matter the quality you feel the width, on the buses (3), please sir, porridge, wet rising, steptoe and son (2), this is your funeral, up to death we are part (2), Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, What Happening to the Likely Lads and Whoops Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> So there was a spin-off for the big screen of my favorite dad sitcom. What the film focused on was when the men were drafted. He showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a great summary of the first series of Dads Army. At the end of the film they take some German spies into the church. The National Guard was dressed as waiters and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best part of the film was when they were showing a conference on HG and a German conference at the same time: German: on the phone on the phone, you would get 10,000 bombs, (CUT TO HOME GUARD) GODFREY: Mrs Mainwaring on the phone, you would get 1 / 2lb by Brussel Sprouts. <br /> <br /> It was probably the second best hit movie for sitcom, beaten only by Till Death us do Part (1969). It would have been better if at the beginning of the film it had already been formed, it was in the middle of the war. Although it is still an excellent film, good for the family.
