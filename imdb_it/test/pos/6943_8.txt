Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I moved abroad not long after, fed up with constant industrial unrest, the general cult of mediocrity - unless you are a sportsman! - and the satisfaction of many Australians who have chosen to ignore the fast pace of change that is occurring in the countries to the north. <br /> <br /> As a result I lost The Dismissal, along with many other TV dramas made in the 80s and 90s, such as the superb series Janus and Phoenix, which I have seen since then, along with Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me the filmed story of The Dismissal is right and, as far as I know, accurate. However, by public "outrage" it shows only one side of the image, not how families have been torn by controversy. I know, because my two brothers would never talk to me again for months. <br /> <br /> But the comment is, in my opinion, very one-sided. The inevitable fact is that, despite the fiery expressions of anger from a substantial part of the community, the Australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favor of Fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /> <br /> This aside, a historically accurate and superbly well-interpreted docudrama.
