The reason I'm looking at this is that the previous review was written by someone who came out of this movie, not even halfway through. Unfortunately for him, he lost a film of extraordinary beauty. Okay, the film was very slow in the beginning, in fact the friend I was with fell asleep briefly, I woke him up before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film developed from there into a love story, drugs and how it was to be young and free in the 1960s. Fantastic shows by the two protagonists and a great look at the film that gave it an authentic look. Be patient, as many great films are worth waiting for, and it is certainly a film that we will look forward to seeing again! 8/10
