I came out of the feeling of "Dark Blue World" (sigh) "so sad", but it was certainly necessary to make a film, and it is really well done by the Czech Republic. It's funny, despite the "sad" premise. It is full of feelings, the bond and the undeniable true friendship between the two protagonists - a mature lieutenant pilot (Ondrej Vetchý as Franta) and the young and increasingly eager budding pilot (Krystof Hádek as Karel), the inevitable love triangle and occasionally recalls the sad prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. It's all in a film put together, by the screenwriter father and the team of directors Zdenek and Jan Sverák (the previous success was the amiable "Kolya"). <br /> <br /> It is not as long as "East-West" (French "Est-Ouest") 1999, which was a harrowing and intricate story of a returned Russian doctor and the unfortunate attempts of his French wife after the second world war in Russia. The plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (Czech title) is quite simple and has a slight note of humor. Music, songs of the Second World War sung in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and airplanes in the sky - not elaborate like Hollywood - there is no need to be bing, bang, boom all the time when air battle scenes are shown. Sadness was explained at the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and summarized in the following paragraphs. The film is not entirely subtitled, only when the conversations are translated into Czech - the rest is in English, both in English and in Czech accent. (So ​​it is a foreign film with English language and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> The three head performances, in particular of the two Czech pilots, have been wonderfully delivered. There are nuances between the two, even if it is constantly mature compared to the avidly young one. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there is "Brassed Off" 1996 alongside Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; he remembered her from "Hear My Song" in 1991 alongside Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; in front of Hugh Grant in "Sirens" of 1994 and "The English Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain" of 1995, in addition to his appearances in the mini-series of PBS Masterpiece Theater. <br /> <br /> "So sad": the fact that the heroes who defend their country can be treated so hard and for so long (40 years). Thank goodness for noteworthy memories and the imprints of unforgettable friendship. From here the pause for a ray of sunshine through a window (ironic or casual that is of a church where the hard work took place) - symbol of hope, never give up ?? <br /> <br /> Other recent films that have stories to tell: "Kandahar" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, the Canadian from Afghanistan, who travels to Kandahar with a personal "mission" in mind) more what an eye behind a burqa of the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "Everything Put Together" (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother in front of SID - sudden infant death) the perceptive film by Swiss director Marc Forster, and his highly controversial film "Monster's Ball" with Halle Berry Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Watch movies without expectations or comparisons with previous films. Just see it.
