This show is fantastic! I love all the actors! It has great narrative lines and characters. It's the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have a great dialogue. Both can be really fun. I miss Vanessa Marcil at the General Hospital, but she's fantastic. James Lesure is awesome! It can be fun. Molly Sims plays very well with an idiot. The writing is fantastic! They maintain an excellent rhythm. The show can really leave you hanged, which is one of my favorite elements of a show. I look forward to the new season. This show arrives at the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show stays for a long time. If people know what is good, they will be. I never want the show to end. Never.
