Once again, we are lucky to see a wonderful opening scene where the artists' work has been completely restored and we see this old grocery store on the street corner with the snow falling gently. Inside there are the rich colors of all the goods, from products to canned and canned products, from medicines to sweets, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a story of those products that "come to life", such as animals on the labels of objects, a cake or even a pack of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole "show" is narrated by "Jack Bunny", an imitator of Jack Benny, with the music of director Leopold Stokowski, who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts, I lost count. A lot of humor is topical, so it's worth knowing who "Little Egypt" and other characters are. The "aqua" number of the Busby Berkeley type with the bath sardines coming out of the can and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! <br /> <br /> All of the above, and more, was in the first half of this comic strip slightly longer than normal. The second part spoke of a King Kong type that escapes the "Animal Crackers" box and terrifies everyone. That part wasn't much, and ended with a slightly stupid note. So ..... an "A" for the first half, a "D" for the second, making it a C-plus or a B-less overall.
