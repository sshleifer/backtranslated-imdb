SPOILERS A Jew Frodo? Yes, it will be Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> Since the final part of "The Lord of the Rings", Elijah Wood as Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to move away from that important role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young American Jew, Wood tried every way to escape this typecasting. Now, with "Everything Is Illuminated", he could finally have achieved this goal. Interpreting a role not as radical as the other efforts, he really manages to reach the soul of his character. However, it's not like Wood did this alone. Aided by a magnificent adaptation of Liev Schreiber for the first time and a wonderful performance by newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "Everything is Illuminated" is a magnificent moving film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, leaves for Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who saved his grandfather and helped him arrive in America. Arriving in the country, Jonathan meets all the speeches, everyone dances Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Traveling across the country, the three learn slowly more and more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan had never existed. <br /> <br /> It is a strange feeling when the film proceeds in its second chapter (in reality it is divided into four in general). The first part, although sometimes a little fun, is mostly serious and intense. So when we are given a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part, going from serious to entertaining is a strange step. It doesn't work, but as the film progresses, it surely learns the lesson, since this mix of humor and sadness blends with the passage of time. <br /> <br /> To the maximum recognition of all those involved, as the story continues, so we begin to fall more and more in love with the characters. Elijah Wood is magnificent, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that he raises questions about why Hollywood never noticed it correctly. However, the most notable of all is the newcomer Eugene Hutz. Interpreting a highly troubled character, Hutz is absolutely brilliant. Show the division between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect abilities, and when his character is communicating with Wood, you really connect with him at a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent, but with it, it reaches the next level. <br /> <br /> As the debut for the actor he became the director Liev Schreiber, the story is also a brilliant piece to start. A work of passion (Schreiber's grandfather himself immigrated to America), he really manages to embrace the emotion of the content, and by presenting us with a really beautiful scenario and some magnificent shots, he manages to really hit home. The last half hour, in particular, is so beautifully created, that it is a challenge for a tear that does not form in any eye of the viewer. It's a moving story, and with Schreiber's help it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Built with love by a passionate director, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A street story with a difference, it is beautifully played and wonderfully written. It's a movie that everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally put Frodo to rest.
