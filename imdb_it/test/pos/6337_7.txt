Episode number thirteen of the imaginative (excuse the incredibly gay terminology) The television series "Supernatural" relocates Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri where they were called by an old flame of Dean to investigate a series of mysterious murders in their small town. Apparently, a big pickup with an invisible driver is running for African Americans on a desolate stretch of roads ... While Dean tries to rekindle his past love story, other people in the city look like a roadkill. The cause seems to be due to a racial incident of the past in the 1960s, causing a frustrated spirit of redneck to remain in a ghostly limbo, trying to kill black motorists. "Route 666" is another nice episode (which is not uncommon, I noticed) that contains some noteworthy aspects of the main character couple like Dean fuck and Sam admitted that he regretted having left college ... truck killer does not present itself as the most terrifying thing in the world, however, for a one-hour show, it does its job well. Not a fantastic episode without hands, but a solid concept with more horror references.
