"Captain Corelli's mandolin" is an old Hollywood love story but with sex and nudity, and apparently without Americans. The story takes place on a Greek island during the Second World War. The Italians arrive to take possession of the island, but with German supervision. There is a romantic triangle composed of a Greek couple and the Italian captain. Beautiful interpretations of all the actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet.
