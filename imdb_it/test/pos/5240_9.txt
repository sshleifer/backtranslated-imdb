I just bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. It's a fantastic and fantastic film. I knew it by reputation, but I never expected it to be so magnificent. My version is the 35mm version and I'll talk about it later. When you think of the Western Myth in film, the names that come to mind are John Ford and John Wayne. Well, you only have half the team here, but the whole myth is present. Raoul Walsh has given us an extraordinary epic in which the real plot is the struggle to expand westward into the nation. <br /> <br /> There is a plot centered on a love story between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the main villain, Red Flack memorably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. But this has almost an incidental quality as the wagon train fights forward against incredible obstacles, both natural and human. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle and the crossing of the burning desert. In the aftermath of the battle a grim touch is given when a doll is placed on the grave of a murdered child while a faithful dog lies on its master's grave. <br /> <br /> Magnificent views are full of energy and activity. The opening scene while the wagon train is preparing to leave, the Square Dance interlude and the large buffalo herds are some that come to mind. Wonderful use is made of location shooting in everything. Another feature of this wonderful film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle to the west. Women work, fight and face the terrible adversities with the same strength of mind and the same strength of their male counterparts. The finale has a powerful and uplifting experience as Coleman and Cameron meet in the giant Sequoia forest to start their new life. <br /> <br /> Acting is quite acceptable all the time. I have already mentioned the performance of stealing Tyrone Power scenes. Tully Marshall is excellent as an assistant to Coleman and Marguerite Churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops inner strength while meeting her problems and those external to herself. The relief from the comic is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the enormous amplitude of the film. <br /> <br /> Have I read much criticism of Wayne's performance ?? even going as far as to blame his "wooden acting" for the failure of the film at the box office. I think this is unfair. Wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in "Stagecoach". But he still does a useful job in a role that will surely play in second place with the great general theme. After "The Big Trail", Wayne played in a large number of low budget western B's. I have a number of these and one can see the actor developing in them. When it came "Stagecoach" was ready and "The Big Trail" was a significant part of this apprenticeship. <br /> <br /> I have already said that my version is the 35mm version. It's still awesome, but to get an idea of ​​the 70mm version's effect, I set the TV screen to 16: 9 which doesn't cause distortion. While not having the full effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to make me want to get the second one. {also, the film shot in 70mm has some extra scenes not in the form made for the normal theatrical representation}. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film deserves to be on any list of the greatest Westerns ever made.
