I'm surprised that so many viewers haven't found all the symbolism in the film ... it's what made the film an incredible work of art! The story deals with some of the saddest content a film can contain, but it is one of the best films I've ever seen due to the need for your imagination and splendor in the plot. <br /> <br /> If you pay a lot of attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by his stepfather. The elder brother invented the story of the chariot that flew as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who could argue why he would lie to his children with history. For me the answer is because he doesn't want to share this ugliness with his children, or that he has blocked and replaced his memory of the horrendous event with the thought of his brother flying away safely. I have read some reviews that believe they are an only child and that he created his younger brother as an escape to face the abuses he suffered. Although this is an interesting idea, I love the imagination that came to my mind. I don't think he would have lied to his children about having a little brother. But, I find it plausible that he would have lied about the death of his little brother. However, I like the idea of ​​a final much better than the idea that the film had no symbolism. <br /> <br /> There are many different possibilities you can have in the film, but if you take the film at face value ..... two brothers create a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather - you missed it splendor. Being able to see subtle messages in the script is what made the film so incredible for me. It requires your own thought process and your imagination to make it work ... dig deep when you look at it. You will be amazed by the genius contained in the film. The only other film I saw near this in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville ..... but this is a comment for another film!
