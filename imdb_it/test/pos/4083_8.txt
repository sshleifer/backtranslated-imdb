I got it on the local Mexican television at 2:00 am and decided to give it a chance as it's based on a real-life case involving the murder of the typical All American family (a dad, a mom and a small child). <br /> <br /> Initially the indications indicate that Walker was the murderer because he had strong differences with his father. Shortly thereafter, when Walker and Luke are taken to the Sheriff's ward. to be examined by the lie detection machine, things turn out to be very different ... <br /> <br /> Furthermore, when Walker and Luke attend an appointment with their father's lawyer, they learn that Luke would receive $ 200,000 and Walker is out of heresy. Luke immediately buys a convertible. <br /> <br /> However, this is an excellent mysterious film that deals with betrayal, ambition, feelings and cold and very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real the names have been changed but the experience is always the same. Try this movie. I know there are ASHES of "based on real murders" or similar events, but this is really worthy. Pure quality on acting, direction and plot.
