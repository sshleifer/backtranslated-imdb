This film will not be considered for an academic award, but if you like a movie that you don't take seriously and just want the viewer to enjoy for ninety minutes it's not a disappointment. You'll have fun sending Darth Vader to the villain (the blowhole), a female Batman for the heroine (but much prettier with much less costume), and a running joke involving cigarettes and the police captain very funny. It is not at all a great cinematic result. But if you like campy fun, it's worth a visit. God help me, I liked it.
