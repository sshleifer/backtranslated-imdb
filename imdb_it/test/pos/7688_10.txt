"Porgy & Bess" was the very first film my parents ever showed me. Even at the tender age of 5, I was so moved by the drama I shouted aloud on the screen "Crown, PLEASE, don't take Bess!" I was lucky enough to see the only "Porgy & Bess" TV show so many years ago and now all I have are the great memories (and the record album) to remember this wonderful, wonderful film. I waited, hoped and hoped that one day I could have a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but it doesn't seem to be happening. What is the hold up? Obviously, there is enough public interest in this film to justify a release. After all these years, I remember and it certainly seems not to be alone. This film is full of human emotions: jealousy, lust, anger, courage, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried gem that deserves to be brought to light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to savor.
