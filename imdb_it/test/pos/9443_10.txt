Even an old cynical DOCTOR LOVING like me can be left out of breath by watching an episode of my favorite show. It happened earlier during the Eccleston finale and happened watching this episode. But it doesn't happen often, but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and television at its best. This is a fabulous television <br /> <br /> The Doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writings on the wall and the audience (many of whom will move behind the sofa) are immediately transfigured. A door opens and horrible monsters begin to haunt time travelers. This may have taken up an entire 25-minute episode on the original show, but all this takes place in the pre-title sequence. You could lose the longer format of the original show, but at least this new series is well traced and if we're treated to a disappointing story, at least it's usually only for a week <br /> <br /> nothing to disappoint an observer here. IT'S DOCTOR CHI is at his best traditional. The writer Matt Jones and the director James Strong have done everything to make a story that will be considered for years to come. They do it by building a damn fiction. The Doctor and the Rose lose the Tardis and are stuck with the protagonists in the distant future. It's interesting how many stories never release this kind of plot point where the Doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis, which makes it a more intriguing type of story. Without doubt the highlight is the scene in which Scooti goes to look for Toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and calls her out. Everything from the acting, to the makeup and the music of Murray Gold, makes this scene a real surprise for the public <br /> <br /> I can imagine immediately after this episode that the BBC switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for parents in trouble saying how traumatized their children were. It took several hours to bring them from behind the family couch and now they refuse to sleep with the lights off. To complain about this would be to deny the magic of DOCTOR CHI. Yes, it can terrify and yes such images will burn in the mind of a child, something they will never forget even if they live up to a hundred. But I bet my life that these same "traumatized" children would spend the week begging, regardless of what they will be allowed to see the next episode
