I don't know why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love for Korean art, culture and history. I thought this film would give birth to a very controversial and interesting character. Jang Seung-up is one of (perhaps the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the turmoil of the time in which he painted and his own conflicting nature, it is surprising that he has produced so much work, in so many styles and with so much skill. This film honors his talent while giving a direct look at his irregular and somewhat self-destructive personality. MY cinematography was beautiful, many of the outdoor panoramic shots looked like paintings of Korean landscapes (which I found a pretty presumption rather than "excessively arty") and I think Choi Min-sik played Jang Seun-up with an intensity necessary and unpredictability. I highly recommend this film to art lovers and movie lovers.
