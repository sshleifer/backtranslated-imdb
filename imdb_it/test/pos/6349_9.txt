A rich experience is obtained by watching this film. <br /> <br /> This is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil, Yiu Kwok, who will later become a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married with two children and things at home seem normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his children alternately fill him with pride (the oldest) and disappointment (the youngest). <br /> <br /> His passion for poetry makes him the object of infatuation for an elderly student in one of his classes. The student, Choi Lam, draws his photos during the lesson, significantly, one of them with a flower coming out of his mouth. She teases him more with his intelligence than with his sexuality, even if this is also an element. Obviously he is not immune to his attention, even if he tries for a while to keep the line between teacher and student. <br /> <br /> The reason it fails at the end is complicated. First there is a real depth in communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that he genuinely likes her, and it is mutual. Secondly, there is a longstanding problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of his wife and his wife becomes ill. The consequences of his wife's involvement with this friend, past and present, are almost sad to bear. <br /> <br /> Nothing is treated trivially in this film. All the characters have a vivid inner life and an easily discernible story. The two protagonists, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are exceptional, as is Karena Lam as the student Choi Lam, and Shaun Tam as the eldest son On Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservations.
