Bill Paxton opened the true history of US golf in 1913 and made a film that is much more than an extra-ordinary golf game. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches on the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both British and American institutions. But basically the film is about that perennial favorite of triumph against adversity. <br /> <br /> Acting is exemplary for everything. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the film's revelation is Shia LaBoeuf who offers a disciplined, dignified and very understanding performance as a working-class French-Irish kid who makes his way through the New England WASP prejudices. For those familiar with his slap performances in "Even Stevens", this demonstration of his maturity is a pleasant surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten-year-old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears. <br /> <br /> An old fashioned film in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear director and a great story that grabs you to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.
