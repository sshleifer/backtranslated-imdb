For a film like this, there is always something to follow in the years to come. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror film that is partly Goth, partly mythological and in the midst of all horror. "Nightbreed" are a group of mutants that only come out at night and roam the place called Midian. Now a man named Boone (Craig Sheffer) claims to suffer from hallucinations that go to this shrink Dr. Decker (David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone with his problems. Unaware of this situation, Decker claims to be a purist, who is only a hater of masked hatred. Boone, however, goes to Midian and says he is one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as a flesh! His bite however, spares Boone so after he was killed by a firearm glove, he is now one of them. After being misled by Decker, Boone does everything in his power to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun and also helps others in return. I liked the mutant lady who gives a smoky "kiss of death" and the Porcupine Woman who dreamed of Boone showing her power that is so seductive and lethal at the same time. I liked this whole horror movie, and the rule is that I never trust a shrink! Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
