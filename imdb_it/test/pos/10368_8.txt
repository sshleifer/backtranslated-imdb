Although I have certainly read this particular book by Agatha Christie at some point, I don't remember anything about it except the name "Abernethie". Which is a good thing, because seeing this story without explanation of how it will end allowed me to once again appreciate Agatha Christie's pure GENIUS: the way they deceive you and then pull the rug out from under your feet the main reason for its success and timelessness. In addition to his stories, the excellent production values, the beautiful locations, the wonderful music, the high level acting, the elegant direction, etc. These are the reasons for the success and eternity of this series - and all those virtues are present in "After the Funeral". A tip: be vigilant from the beginning - there are clues left everywhere even in the opening sequence! There are also rather unnerving moments, in contrast to the peaceful locations of the English countryside, and some small touches of humor. A must for mystery lovers, and just a great film in general. (***)
