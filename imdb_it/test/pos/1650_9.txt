With the war not going well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from prisons and used prisoners as assault troops. This is the story of one of these battalions. There are little criminals, political prisoners, soldiers thrown out of other units, veterans of the White Army with gray hair and some dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They were thrown into a badly equipped battle, untrained and facing the threat of NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and compelling. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing. The display of the show required the liberal use of the pause button and the explanations of a native Russian speaker.
