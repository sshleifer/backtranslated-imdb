Susan Sarandon is, for lack of a better word, unbelievable. In my opinion (and yes I understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses ever and should have at least 2 Oscars to her credit. I mean, it was an INCREDIBLE performance in Lorenzo's Oil (but then I think his performance is incredible) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what is it ??? And when he got this Oscar, he had been in the business for about 25 years. I couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more, especially for a brilliant performance like his performance of Sister Helen Prejean. But I repeat, she is above and above all of the artificiality of Hollywood and does not need an Oscar - people know she is still good at it. <br /> <br /> This film carries very deep and stimulating messages, so useless to say that it is not to be taken lightly. Tim Robbins, of course, cannot escape merit. You would think that because of his personal feelings against the death penalty, the portraits made in this film would not be accurate. However, both sides of the death penalty debate are given a uniform weight. On the one hand, we see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side that makes death quite piercing. At the same time, you see the way he has hurt his victims and the constant torment of parents understandably plagued by pain. A word for Tim - BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant film and, as I said, a well-deserved and long-awaited Oscar for Susan.
