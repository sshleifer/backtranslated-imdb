... there was "Broadcast News", and what a positive thing it was. This simply stands up and plays its barbaric barb in a way that resonates two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are moments - especially when it comes to punk music - when this movie gets a little too eighty, or even a little "Sleepless in Seattle". Fortunately, they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> A third social satire, a third romantic comedy, a third drama, with three imperfect but captivating people in the center, is intelligent, moving and almost incredibly funny. Holly Hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comic role. (And yes, I'm including "Raising Arizona", his other star turns from that era, into this evaluation.) <br /> <br /> A legitimate classic.
