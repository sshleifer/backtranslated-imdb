ANOTHER great performance by Kiefer Sutherland. I love his films, because he always plays his role very well. For a low-budget film, this was done very well, and kept me on the sidelines all the time. I love this kind of film and I'm glad I understood it. I will definitely buy the DVD or the tape. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
