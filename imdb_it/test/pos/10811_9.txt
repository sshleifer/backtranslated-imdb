French cinema has always been very strong when it comes to presenting historical topics. 95% of the time never make mistakes. This film is one of the best of the genre, thanks to the very strong acting of Depardieu and Pszoniak. Wajda's work as a director is truly a marvel. Everyone should see this great movie.
