I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. After seeing some of the previous comments, I think I would like to state first that I am not in favor of the death penalty. With all this, I expected great things from this film, but it was not a success. Dead Man Walking is very clean, with good all-round performance and a good script. In fact it is difficult to criticize him artistically. However, I felt that, although he tried to address the issues related to the death penalty, he seemed to be misled by the religious / moral attitude (hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun). Even though I'm not a ruthless individual, I didn't really identify with any of the characters in the story. If you don't take religion seriously, you probably won't see much in this movie. I think Peter Medak's Let Me Have It was a much more powerful and moving film, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of watching this to go see it.
