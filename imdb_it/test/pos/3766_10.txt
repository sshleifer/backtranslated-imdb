Coming from the "druggie" generation, I thought this movie was fun. It certainly brought Jekyll & Hyde up to date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed. I would like to have the film in my collection. I spoke to my two boys about the movie and they would like to see it. They are not drug addicts, but they know enough to understand comedy in the film. It's been so long since I saw it that I can't remember anything but a few things. I should say the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll took a nap on his lab table and inhaled the straw while snoring, then sniffed the powdered substance he had invented. The funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.
