It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are great together. He had a drama, adventure, sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus speaks. I wish Gus would have beaten Clara as if he were Inez. Clara has just led Gus all those years without the slightest intention of marrying him. She just liked playing with him. It was sad that he had spent his whole life pining for her. It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie, but she would have died with him anyway. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and kept them bottled. It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the raid on Austin when the rangers returned and he ran to keep her. Val Kilmer is excellent at playing strange characters. I loved his portrait of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the group.
