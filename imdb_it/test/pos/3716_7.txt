Pierre Jolivet plays a character Don Quixote, unable to speak, to live in a world incompatible with modern life. He relies on his homemade weapons - helmet, sleeves and lance - made of discarded hubcaps, seat cushions and office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, "Man" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives captured in the hard and humiliating modern world - which rises above the earth, away from the plague of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an attempt to straighten the wrongs of the world. Both characters are guardian knights of values ​​unfamiliar to most other characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the story of Cervantes, in this film we identify ourselves more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can only compare this alien and prohibitive landscape with the lush and beautiful world in which we live. Our reference structure is the realm of fantasy that perhaps the lone knight remembers. Our vision would be one that expects the main character to triumph, defeat, change his world (for the better) into a world of abundance that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> Let's watch this movie and see a real knight in a world of humans like animals. Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among animals. <br /> <br /> With Cervantes' story we can only see the dreamer, without really understanding the extent of his anachronistic shift. In the story of Besson and Jolivet we see the new world from the eyes of Don Quixote, because we appreciate the same visions and ideals as the main character of the crusades.
