I really liked this Minghella epic, not so much as "The English Patient" (a classic of our time). The first 20 minutes or so are embarrassing, but when Inman (Jude Law) embarks on a journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film takes a giant leap forward and becomes a very memorable and thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it is fashionable to hate Kidman at the moment, but I don't agree at all, and she does well here. Actually I think the love story between Inman and Ada is weakly developed in the script (actually they don't get much screen time to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman do their best and convince. Ada's journey is the crucial point of the film: she becomes a strong woman who knows how to endure almost everything. Zellweger at first seems all wrong as Ruby, but she continues to grow after all about you and shines in many of her later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but it never really captures the true feeling of a vintage piece. Jack White, in particular, has long, angular hair and the complexion of a pale rocker who looks completely out of place with the setting. Fans of Cillian Murphy will enjoy seeing the talented Irish actor at the beginning, and Natalie Portman actually shows she can probably act in the most amazing sequence in the film. It is a pity that in "The Other Boleyn Girl" is so inadequate.
