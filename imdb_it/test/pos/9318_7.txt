Nothing better than an android that boasts the technology of the 80s and a triad coming to pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind to the front and center to be captured by a wonderfully lovely cast. Growing up in the 80s gave me the priceless opportunity to see "not entirely human" replicas on many special occasions. Considering the fact that my parents had never been present during the vision, I imagine that I probably won't like it as much as I did as a child. So maybe this is a movie to dig up from your VHS collection and deliver to your kids, it can be found on the same tape as "The apple dumpling gang" and an episode of "tour of duty", ie if you recorded in LP Mode, of course .
