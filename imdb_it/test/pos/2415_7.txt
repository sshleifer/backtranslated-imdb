Another story of "overcoming evil", but with a difference. This includes learning self-discipline. When Julie goes with her teacher to a Zen monastery, she learns about herself. He also refines his karate skills. <br /> <br /> When Zen monks visit the city, some embarrassing and comical moments arise. It's not hilarious, but still fun. <br /> <br /> The next Karate Kid has a lot to say about how to look inside and improve what is there, in addition to using what you have.
