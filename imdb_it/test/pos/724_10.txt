I have seen many movies and this has completely upset me. The trauma, the suspense is simply incredible. I ended up so overwhelmed by psychological fear and philosophy, and relating it to reality. The films that play and challenge your mind are films that you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. Quality could be a problem, but this does not reduce the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea is brilliant and the end leaves you completely shocked and with the question you need to look for the answer. I really loved it! So many clues and contractions and puzzles. One of the best films ever, hands down.
