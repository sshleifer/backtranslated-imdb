When I started looking at "Surface" for the first time I was hooked. He had everything I wanted in a suspense show, action, mystery, fantastic plot and a great cast of characters. My whole family loved watching the show. It seems that when there is a big show on TV, the network usually cancels it as it seemed to do with this show. They go through Nielson's grading system which I think is stupid because there is a lot of junk that seems to look on what networks keep the air going. If only there was a way for everyone to vote on a show, then maybe the good shows won't be canceled. When I watch TV, I only watch good shows, so now I don't watch a lot of TV. I hope the network returns to the show, but when they decide to do it with a stupid decision they seem to stick to it. I hope there are a lot of people out there who feel the same way.
