This film is about two horse dealers who agree to escort a small group of Mormons across the desert. Along the way, they encounter a bloody family of thugs threatening peaceful people and putting their pilgrimage in danger. <br /> <br /> WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "little" John Ford movie, as obviously it did not have the budget or reach of some of its other Westerners. In particular, this film lacks the big name stars like John Wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to be the center of attention. Ford's long-lived actors, Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr., and Ward Bond all played leading roles and perhaps what came as "the" protagonist was probably Johnson - although the other two had almost the same screen time and attention. This is not a bad thing, since the film worked well without the big star - and it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Now, this does not mean that I liked the film. It was very good but certainly not perfect. In particular, as far as music is concerned, you will probably love it or hate it. I found the music of the pioneer children a little schmaltzy at times. It evoked a good mood but occasionally seemed to dominate the scenes. I think it would have worked a little better. Also, with the incessant singing in the background, I always waited for Roy Rogers to jump out at any time. Another small problem is that the plot was incredibly simple and the ending was pretty obvious. <br /> <br /> However, and I am pleased to say that there is a 'anyway', despite being rather formidable and sentimental, the film still worked well. This is mainly due to the beautiful direction of John Ford, as usual, as well as to the exceptional performance of Ben Johnson. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. Another advantage for me is that I saw it in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about Mormon migration. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit silly and excessively "holy" in his portraits, here the Mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people - with weaknesses and personalities. Oh, and talking about BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems that Jane Darwell was the "right girl" for Mormon-themed movies during this era, since she was a main character in both films. Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and was set about 20 years before the WAGON MASTER, this is a stunt! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if you want to see the famous Jim Thorpe, he is in a tiny role in which he plays the impassive Indian dance alongside Jane Darwell around the camp fire.
