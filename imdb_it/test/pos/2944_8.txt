This film was both fun and challenging. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it's Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can appreciate and lovers of serious films. Places in Ontario have aroused such a sense of nostalgia for the time. With so much junk and superficial clamor selling these days it's nice to see that someone could support an independent film. For every family that has grown up to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial problems or illness - this film strikes a resounding agreement! It approaches the idea of ​​the afterlife in a contemporary way - without capitalizing on all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become Hollywood and TV network basis points.
