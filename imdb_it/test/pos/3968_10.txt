When I saw this movie I expected it to be a cheap American movie made cheap with terrifying actors. I was really surprised to find that I was completely wrong. The film focuses on Bartely or B who has been rejected by all of his colleges - the actor who plays B is very natural and makes his character look real - and decides to create a fake school so his parents stop harass him. However, a lot of people see their fake website and join. Hearing their sorrows B cannot drive them away much to the disappointment of his best friend. College is the ideal place to learn what you want or do nothing. The school faces opposition from the right institution that ends up closing it. The film ends at a high level and I suggest you watch it. It has flaws but it is a good cheerful film with some unpredictable twists.
