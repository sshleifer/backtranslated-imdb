The film was good. The only reason I saw him was Alan Rickman. Which didn't bring out the southern accent, but it did very well. You know that Emma Thompson did really well, she definitely brought out the southern accent. I like the whole character, in my opinion, none of them hurt, another thing I noticed. I read all these comments and not one person commented on the shadow of Alan 5 0 '. Which made it even better and he practically had one in the whole movie. I would give the film a 9 out of 10. Another of my opinions is that the film would have been better had there been no sex. However it was fine. I love the scene where he says "Aw sh * t" when he is in his car and sees them in his mirror.
