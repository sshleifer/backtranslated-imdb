This BBC version of a book by Agatha Christie shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely. Christie's books tend to move at a gentle, sometimes even calm pace, and "Evans" is certainly what he does. He also has a solid school of red herring to confuse the plot. This version is extremely faithful to the book, which translates into a very slow and engaging story. As a Christie fan, I gave him 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to make his way through a relatively action-free story. I appreciate a little of the narrowing of the storylines that the BBC did for its subsequent Christie productions. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is a pleasant pleasure, underlined by the carefree waif Francesca Annis who brings a remarkable charisma to her role and plays very well with James Warwick.
