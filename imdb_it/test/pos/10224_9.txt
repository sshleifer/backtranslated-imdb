I wish there was a category in which to put this in Horror. It simply isn't. Sure, it has its horrible moments, but I don't think it makes it a horror movie. I will give that this film could have been better. A million small things could be changed to make it better. <br /> <br /> Saying that I love this movie. I'm often sad that people misunderstand the whole point. It has always been clear to me that the point of this film was to say ... things are not always what they seem. Sometimes "bad", it is not. <br /> <br /> Barker was at a Con that I went to and made a little speech then look at the movie thing. It was very interesting. Many things he wished to include in the film could not be, and a part of the film was cut off from the film he believed had long been lost. This was a piece that helped shed light on Boone and his girlfriend, as well as other details. <br /> <br /> I know that some people are annoyed by not having more information on the whole "race" in the background, however, I always thought that it gave the film a more "real" appearance. I read the novel on which it was based in addition to many of the comics. For this reason, the film has always seemed to me a starting point for the whole story. A much more involved story that unfortunately never had the chance to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws in the film, I think it has a lot to offer. The "monsters" are wonderful, very imaginative. While acting is sometimes a bit stiff, there are some very quotable lines. Every time I look at it, I find something new. Keep and observe Boones's chest towards the end. At one point Decker hits him and shortly after Boone falls on a game table. It ends with a card attached to the chest. This card stays there for a while even after Lori draws the knife. It stays there until Boone removes it randomly. I love. This was a small detail that I thought. <br /> <br /> Basically what I want to say is that ... if you're looking for a horror movie, don't watch it. If you believe that sometimes men can be more evil than any we have ever imagined. This is the movie for you. This is a film about how men destroy what they don't understand or fear.
