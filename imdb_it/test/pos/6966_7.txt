Seeing that this film was on IMDB Bottom 20, I simply had to rent it. <br /> <br /> SUPRISE! SURPRISE! I have no regrets about seeing this movie. In fact, I really enjoyed it. There is a field level in this film that puts the cult classics of the 80s to shame. Is it stupid? yes, but Jim Wynorski shows that the stupid is not necessarily bad after all. <br /> <br /> Rent it for a laugh that looks unintended but is actually meant to be fun. Wynorski is a genius. I hope you direct the next ninja turtle movie
