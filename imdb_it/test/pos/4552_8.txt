Well, the day Rob Schneider plunges further into the black hole of notoriously bad films by acting in the movie "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (it wasn't all wanted at all) (hmmmm .... there wasn't a film called Roadtrip which was it followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by the sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... I smell a pattern, maybe Spiderman will be soon: European networks are hotter ..... or not) I'm writing about this very vilified film (at the time of release). I was one of those wicked people, I have to admit. I also raised my nose while Chris Farley pushed cocaine on his nose and the SNL cast struggled for one of the worst seasons of their history in 1994-95, despite the Norm McDonald anchor. Movies like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep were released in the years following this period and we realized that there was a dark future for the caliber of the Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler films. However I saw this movie the other day, ten years later and 8 years after Chris died and I couldn't stop laughing. Yes, it's not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny who is Manny) but his motivational speaker "Van Down By the River" in which he complains that while he can't "wash enough" or "wear well-suited clothes" or "use the more deodorant "more than twice a week" translates here as the always-shy character who realizes he is not the most brilliant, not the most beautiful, and could endure losing a few pounds. its best to do what it should And David Spade just launches his lines to the basket as he did for "Spade's Hollywood Minute" and basically stings Farley's self-esteem. There's really not much else to say. the only scene where Farley surprises Spade by spanking himself with his monkey and then jokes about it for a moment, I don't remember which one is the first, but the second, they are lying in their hotel beds and Farley tells Spade: " Do you like baseball? "Spade mumbles something inaudible ile in response and Farley says "the YANKs of New York?" Anyway, Farley makes his embarrassing, painfully sensitive, engaged. If you like it, you like it. I couldn't stop laughing.
