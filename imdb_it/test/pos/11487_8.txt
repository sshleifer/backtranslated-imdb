It was sad that COMMITTED had only lasted two weeks in the theaters of Dallas. I thought this movie had a lot to offer. The script was fun, full of subtle emotional changes and had a good message. The acting was great. Everyone did an excellent job, especially with the subtleties of the script. Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, she has * expressive eyes *. Besides, all the actors were attractive! Because it didn't work well in its theatrical release, I don't know - apart from the fact that the studio didn't seem to have much of a boost behind it. But he deserved to do better, and I hope it goes well on video. It is certainly one of my favorites for the first half of 2000.
