This film, as my Chinese girlfriend informed me, features two famous Hong Kong pop stars. While this could make the film a mere marketing gimmick, I found the acting acceptable, and both are nice. <br /> <br /> The story is rather poor overall. Vampiric traits and weaknesses are, however, used in humorous ways, and have created unique and fun pieces. The quarrel between the two girls made me laugh, and this gave a good balance with the well-made action scenes to create a funny movie.
