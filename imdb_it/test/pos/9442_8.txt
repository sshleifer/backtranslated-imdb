If you really want to terrify people, choose the Devil as the subject. After all, a large part of the population believes that it is real. So you are entering a whole mass of pre-existing religious and mythological images. It is bound to cause some nightmares in your young audience. <br /> <br /> This episode has all the appearance of a successful Hollywood movie. In fact, after I finished watching it, I switched to another channel that was playing a recent James Bond movie and frankly I couldn't split a hair between the differences in SFX. With a minimal cast, limited by his situation on a space station; complete with overwhelming panoramic views of a universe that implodes, it was claustrophobic and intense like Alien or Event Horison. The black hole outside made it feel as if the weight of the black hole on the dark matter was pushing the station on the planet and on Whatever was sealed inside. And as the horror is intensified by the knowledge that Dr and Rose are blocked, the sinister Ood starts channeling a disembodied voice and then the characters begin to be chosen one by one ... <br /> <br /> This has it all the best qualities of the cream of this new Dr Who strive; Girl in the fireplace and the empty child. Emotionally engaging, frightening and witty without the appearance of cheese. This is much scarier than any amount of Daleks in flight. But it must be asked, does this vision really fit for children? This is not a family-friendly episode. Too bad for the poor parent who has to put his children to bed after this. I'm not even sure I want to see what happens next!
