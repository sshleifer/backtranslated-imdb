Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter - even though the F-14 is probably the second or third - but I liked this movie. The sequels (Iron Eagle II and III) do not measure acting and plot, but the first - along with Top Gun - has excellent flight and music, along with reasonable plots and recitations. II and III clearly have much less than a "flight budget", but their main drawback is the plot and the acting. I suspect that the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle over Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of Jason Gedrick over Tom Cruise. Another advantage (for me) is an appearance too short of Shawnee Smith. 7/10
