This is really a good movie with fantastic humor. Jim Verney as we know he was very good with facial expressions and he shows a lot in this film. This is definitely the best of Ernest's films. I would certainly recommend it to all Ernest fans. I find myself having a great taste in movies and I'm sure anyone will like this movie. In the film, (Ernest) plays 2 roles, bad and good boy and plays them quite well. I really like exaggerated humor where things seem impossible, like in the movies of naked guns, for example, and there are many in this film. I bought this movie immediately after seeing it. Good direction, good script, worth renting.
