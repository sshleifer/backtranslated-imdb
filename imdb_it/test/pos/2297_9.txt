I really liked this. (SPOILERS ??) He had a really good storyline, the female protagonist of this film is really kewl. <br /> <br /> Despite being the only one left alive and her dead lover, it seems to be a lot like Ninja Scroll. Another movie of kicking asses. ;) <br /> <br /> Watch it in Japanese with subtitles. I don't know where the idiots who learned to speak English are, but for some reason all the voiceovers receive an F in translation techniques. The subtitles are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Show: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10
