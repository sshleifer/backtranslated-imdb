I remember it in a similar way to young people. We went back to the pub and watched or recorded and then spent weeks repeating the lines with each other. <br /> <br /> We called one of our friends "Zipmole Watkins" after the brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock has a bit of a 'makeover' on his nose from the Back Street editor. <br /> <br /> A lot of big lines "Remember at 5:30 am you can only get a white bread from a brown man. It's easy boy!" - Gandhi as a local shopkeeper. <br /> <br /> Tony Woodcock was definitely there in the episode where they were teaching Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be a bartender "It's not nice Amanda, I will never do it as a bar man" Helen Lederer taught him to ask to the people of the game "See the game last night? I thought Woodcock sounded good." After a series of failed conversations, the curly-haired Arsenal star was sitting at the bar: "Do you see the game last night?" "Yes. I thought I had played well "<br /> <br /> We still do weird stupid schemes now -" Reg and Ralph ..... or ....... Ralph and Reg Reg, Reg ... Reg Reg Reg Reg " <br /> <br /> Many surreal surreal moments and surreal songs from the Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist a favorite from the grand finale - "And it will mark your" Return To Sender "packages <br /> <br /> Good old Danny Peacock - you've added a lot to the evenings of young ladies drinkers. <br /> <br /> ** Update - I found a couple of episodes on tape - I'm going to c aricare Gandhi's sketch on Youtube **
