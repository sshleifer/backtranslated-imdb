It takes a rare film to improve every time you see it. O brother does this and then a little. The first time I saw it, I have to admit that I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see him again, and now I'm in double figures with this great film, the most beautiful film of the Coen brothers they ever made, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy who came second and third for me. <br /> <br /> George Clooney gives the interpretation of his career by playing Ulysses Everett McGee, a prisoner who escaped from the annoyance of all the acquaintances who really don't know anything about it. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are Clooney's perfect helpers, especially Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a faithful fugitive companion even if uneducated. John Goodman is my favorite character like Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Even the favorites of the Coen brothers, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning, offer memorable shows. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win the Academy Awards every time they make a film, they just try to tell a story they want to tell, and it's fun. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this film is coloring. I saw how they got the dusty feeling of the movie and I'm still scared just thinking about it. Coloring becomes an important part of the film. Great movie.
