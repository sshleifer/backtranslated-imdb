In this film, astronauts sent to explore a newly discovered planet face different dilemmas and do it intelligently. The film approaches the main theme of the plot in a unique way, and explains it gradually, although it can be guessed in advance. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, even if sometimes rigid, as can be the acting of the 60s. It can also be a bit verbose and even melodramatic, especially after the plot theme is revealed. Visually, it has a scene reminiscent of "2001: A Space Odyssey" from the previous year and which tends to date the film. Some of the actors played on the 1970 TV show "UFO", which is deliciously campy and worth trying on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, the same space flight is realistic, and considering this was 1969, even the scenes inside the cabin of the spacecraft had a realistic appearance. (Also look for the video technology of the 90s / 2000s in use!) One thing: I suspect a love scene has been cut, but I can't prove it! It would have been a distraction anyway. <br /> <br /> Unlike most sci-fi movies, this movie will make you think of the plot, and it's worth a look. I'm glad to have this movie in my video library.
