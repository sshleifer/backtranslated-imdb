As soon as I saw the announcement of "Changi" on the History Channel, I knew I would like it. He captured the ANZAC spirit in a fantastic way - you would die if you didn't have companions around you. The characters of "Changi" were strong and each brought something different in the story, and the Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but were represented as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just as the Australians were doing. The direction, the script, the acting and the setting were made wonderfully, with a clear and easy to follow plot. Humor was the key to the survival of the soldiers, and it was nice to see a mini series about the war that actually has a kind of humor, which is usually hard to do without offending people. From what I read about the soldiers in the Changi PoW camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years spent by those Australian, British, New Zealand, American and Dutch men. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in the war or not. 10/10.
