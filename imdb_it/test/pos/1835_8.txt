I think Bonnie Hunt (Jerry Maguire) writes well and I'm so happy that she gave the elderly actors the opportunity to play such important roles in the film. This is really clean, in a society that loves wealth, health and youth, it was nice to see a film about normal people. The film reminded me of a lot of "While you were Sleeping" that I love.
