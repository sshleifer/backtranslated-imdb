My daughter has already written a review of this film in my access ... but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br /> ?? National Velvet 'was one of my two favorite child movies. (The other is "The Wizard of Oz ??."). Cinematography, acting, screenplay and music have come together. Such a wonderful heart felt the drama that can still bring tears to my tired eyes. Based on a book by Enid Bagnold, the script followed the book quite well. The characters are so designed. It is easy to become emotionally involved with the whole family and the quaint little Irish village in which they live. The premise ... the complete outsider believes in his horse and herself enough to try a test in the biggest horse race in the world ... it's a source of inspiration for every young person, especially a girl in the 40s ... a time when girls were sometimes ignored as human beings, not to mention athletes. You should be terribly hard for not appreciating the merit. <br /> <br /> But the perspective that fascinated me most about this film is integral innocence in its moral message. The way in which "mum and apple pie" were the movies was almost magical. I was really surprised by the IMDB reviewer who asked ... "Has the world ever really been so confident?" and then proceeded to punish the director for his complacency with regard to the nightly journey without an escort involving the two main characters. My answer to your question is an unequivocal YES !!!! The world of cinema was to trust the 40s. My grandparents remember bringing my mother to this movie when he was released. Then my mother took me to see him when I was young and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch her repeatedly on video tape. Now we have it on DVD. It has been a favorite of families for generations, although generations of horse lovers. It was never sex ... it's about becoming an adult! It's about believing in yourself and working hard to achieve your goals. Also, so old-fashioned it wasn't even about the cash prize! It's about the little girl who realized that her horse had what it took to be the best. "And yes, the director was really worried about the lack of physical development of Elizabeth Taylor because the book made a big deal on Velvet Brown (the character by Liz Taylor) who had to cut her hair and tie her chest so she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the Grand National Steeplechase.This was a sport just for boys then ... I think there were only 12 women for compete in this race It is almost insulting that someone bothered to think about the Lolita thing about this particular movie ... besides, anyone who had anything to do with a teenager and her horse would know that the only thing to who have ever thought with the stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now for a good deal of curiosity ... the stunt riding was performed by the now famous "Horse Whisperer ", Monty Ro berts. I think he was mentioned for his role in the film. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 10 out of 10! I never tire of looking at him again.
