Shtrafbat is the story that only the Russians could tell about the Second World War. The biggest front of the entire conflict was, ironically, the less showy subject on the big screen after the war. While the war effort of the Western Allies was illustrated in almost every detail and manner, the East was left out or the work was left alone with old propaganda films of little more than the value of historical footage. <br /> <br /> There is no possibility that Shtrafbat can compete with the Band of Brothers in every detail, but neither do you want to look at the screen by examining small visual effects in mind. That the soldiers are Russian is reason enough to forgive the less appealing battle scenes and you can focus on the story that is the most interesting. Very different was the war on the eastern front and the nature of the Russian army, which you might want people to produce more dramatizations from other fronts and armies. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat is not absolutely perfect, but it has some rare specialties that increase the general evaluation. It tends to crush the myths that people have about the Second World War, the real heroes were the Russians and not their leaders who sent them on missions where they could only die. Another great myth is that it presents the enemy, who does not take his gun, as an equal human being - an advance that has been difficult to prove even in many acclaimed films. Shtrafbat shows how the war on the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of -isms puts people in the dust.
