I think I was one of those who found this other of Roth's pearls. his performance, as rewarded, was staggering. the story that was told eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, takes place very gradually and leaves room for the development of the characters. Roeg demonstrates once again that it must not be a war environment to be affected. In a wonderful position there is a history of contrast. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness should become your best friend. It shows a more sinister past than a small golden age that lands on a coast full of wealth for a first world country, if the right men are sent. All in all a beautiful film directed by Nicola's Roeg with a sublime cast.
