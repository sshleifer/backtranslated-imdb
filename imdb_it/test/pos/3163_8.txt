The whole shorthand for being apparently more aware at this strange moment is that you are "Blue". The Blue State mentality. This should get us out of trouble for what is happening in our country (the United States) in recent years. It does not take away anyone, but it makes us feel better, as if we are not benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good things that an American citizen gets simply by being a US citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so sick of complaining about this. It doesn't do any good. I haven't done much action lately and I wonder how many people have. Maybe I'm down because my job was "outsourced" last month and now I'm looking for work in the field of increasingly restricted technical support, where most of the work is going quickly in India and other places abroad. I'm thinking that soon it won't pay to be a citizen here with the ruined infrastructure and the shrinking labor market and the obsession with war. These days it seems that anyone who speaks is mocking and wondering about "patriotism". Anyway, back to this review: USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me understand that some people have taken action, whether through politics, protests or the arts or the media. The director is obviously passionate, expert, willing to go out of the norm, frustrated, unique, astute and so on. <br /> <br /> I looked through the whole site that is linked to the DVD and got lost in all the articles, essays, etc. that there are. The DVD also does this, it has references to different times, points of view and historical points. Sometimes someone does something out there.
