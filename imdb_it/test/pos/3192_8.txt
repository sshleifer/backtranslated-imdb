I saw Love in Limbo for the first time playing late in free-air TV about five years ago, and since then it's a movie I will always remember warmly as one of those movies you see and are forever influenced by. <br /> <br /> For the uninitiated, the Australian film has a long history of out-of-choir comedies on lovely losers, and Love in Limbo is an outstanding example. While Russel Crowe is the only actor with the name (although he needs a movie these days), the rest of the Australian cast is good - he still steals the show as a nervous, nerd, virgin loser. <br /> <br /> The general premise is very similar to American Pie. A group of friends who want to fuck and become men. As one would expect, the whole film focuses on this (with a secondary plot on the protagonist's mother and various other episodes), and is full of humorous situations that push him towards the inevitably sweet ending. <br /> <br /> If you liked the American Pie, don't expect this to be the same, but expect the same conventions to make appearances. Love in Limbo is not a coarse romantic comedy, but it certainly has its share of laughter, punching moments when the good guy wins, and the situations in which every boy, Australian or not, can identify. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you liked it: American Pie, Almost Famous. Strengths: good Aussie cast, easy to relate, good value pervades. Weaknesses: predictable in the points. My vote: 8 out of 10
