Sure, seeing some boom mike doesn't mean anything, does it? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin have really put this together, right? I laughed a lot, as often happens in these types of films, but I don't know what I should have laughed because I laughed at so many other things. I'm not saying the film was bad, but I'll say that a little more editing would do wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I don't think it was horrible, but I know that "The Human Tornado" has been several times better than this. I think those who manage to get past this movie may need a Colt 45 or two later. I mean, it really helps you not to notice the boom microphones when you look at it again.
