The Box is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. To explain my experience, allow me to use this image of words: Imagine that you were stuffed with goblin sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing except Twilight Zone replicas. The resulting coma falls into a hospital, where the nurse seems to get out of the adrenaline in your IV. The dream you have during the coma will be something like this movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. Give them a box with a button on it. Press the button, they'll get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die. I will try not to ruin anything, but from there things turn into a plot so intertwined, complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. But hey, most of us have been sane for a while now, and the change is good. <br /> <br /> PRO: incredible plot, good general acting, not a slow moment, once it starts. He asks questions about human morality that are rarely, if ever asked, in popular culture. This film is profound, has a meaning. Its not summer has special effects like fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that); this film has a relatively low budget and has shown in some places. But I think it's just that thing that makes me so happy. <br /> <br /> CONS: The first twenty minutes, before it starts, are really quite slow. At the end of the film, you'll be so confused that you just have to sit and think for a good half hour. I can guarantee that this film will not get rave reviews from your colleagues or most critics; it's too weird and there are no explosions every three seconds. In reality there are no explosions of any kind in this film (besides your brain that breaks out of trying to understand exactly what the hell just happened). I personally don't think it's a bad thing, but many will. <br /> <br /> RATING: Easily a 9/10. I've never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can't give him a 10/10 is that he's too wrapped up in himself. There are several great things that in the end are inexplicable and that continue to annoy me as I sit here writing this. But overall, this is the best experience I've had in a cinema for a long time. But be careful, you won't like this movie if you can't sit down, turn on the suspension of disbelief at around 150% and get your brain ready to do awesome stunts. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com for other reviews
