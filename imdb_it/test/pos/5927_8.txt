I've seen this movie several times over the years and I always find it a fun experience. As a retired airline pilot, I am interested in most aviation films and this is one of the best. I know that Lindbergh was only 25 at the time of his historic solo flight to Paris and that James Stewart was almost 50 when he made this film, but I can overlook this fact because Stewart was always one of my favorite actors of all time and makes one of his usual exceptional performances like "the solitary eagle". <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the film and a good use of flashbacks. It also helps James Stewart to be a real life pilot in both military and civilian life.
