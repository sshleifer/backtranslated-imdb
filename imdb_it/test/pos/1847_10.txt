This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I don't think I would get tired of seeing it. We hope that other films like this will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink "I Never Got to Say Goodbye" is the song that comes to life. Surely you will laugh and cry for the whole scenario for sure. I'm just surprised I never saw him before last weekend. I think it's worth seeing, and your heart will shine. It would be nice to curl up with your "honey"; sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in each other's presence. There is so much heart and emotion sometimes you honestly don't know where to turn. You will know exactly how the character feels. True family expression is available to the full. In fact, sometimes you even think you're part of that family or part of yours. Watch it!
