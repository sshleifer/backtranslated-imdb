Certainly, this is one of the lightest stories that Bruce Willis has ever seen and yet, - it is still moving. I really like Bruce's style and personality, I have not loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to "Big-time" for me in almost all his film efforts. <br /> <br /> The story begins ... He is power, security and style with an 'S' capitol. Drive a Porshe who lives well, in a sumptuous estate with a grand view of the proud city. That's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those who are at the top or who rise. His applause is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to do it. It just seems that while life is moving forward quickly and established by an ally, there is a problem, an intruder in his home, the alarm has been activated! <br /> <br /> Russell cannot understand (for the moment) what is happening to him. It is different and yet it is somewhat familiar. A little boy, who looks exactly like ... - him. As their lives tighten together, there seems to be a reason that is screaming at him: "You have unfinished business to deal with now!" <br /> <br /> Amy, the supportive young woman in the story is probably the best balance I've seen and had in her life. She works with him, supports his "ego" and yet, is in love with Russell. So much. With Rusty his "I" now in the picture and talking a mile a minute, singing too late at night, everything that has been fundamental is becoming like jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is fun, self-centered and sometimes crazy in this lovely Disney classic of today "The Kid" and adding his small heavy side kick Spencer Breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling history. of childhood to the adult and return to the adventure of childhood. Chi McBride is an inspirational supporting character, as he is the heavyweight champion, teaching "little" Rusty how to box to defend himself against bullies in the playground. <br /> <br /> All in all, he is a true film winner with Lillie Tomlin as Russell's secretary and assistant. I saw it originally in 2000 and then again years later, with equal pleasure. This is a brilliant family comedy that has an excellent ending that will warm the hearts of every Disney fan. Highly recommended (*****)
