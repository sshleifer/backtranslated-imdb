I have the logical common sense to know that oil cannot last forever and I am perfectly aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemicals. I have been an avid consumer of new technologies and continue to run out of powerboard space, so I know that even the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil will change my life appreciably. <br /> <br /> The End Of Suburbia shows, in a rational and amusing way, how much the lifestyle of my whole family will have to change in my life. I am particularly concerned about future generations who will have to collect the card for our excesses, however filmmakers offer a glimmer of hope as they recognize human resourcefulness and determination - and the sense of community that tends to be generated through shared difficulties. <br /> <br /> There is no point in trying to pretend that Peak Oil is an unfounded propaganda - or treating it like the radioactive cloud arriving in "On The Beach" (ie with suicide pills ready). Even with our best efforts, times will become increasingly difficult, and I hope there is enough compassion and humanity to go around.
