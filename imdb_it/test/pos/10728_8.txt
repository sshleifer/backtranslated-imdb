I thought this movie was good enough and funny enough for a movie that was heavy for emotions. I agree with what another user has written about the script being likeable to the three main characters. I think this is what made the film good. Neither Mr nor Mrs Kramer was nasty and it was nice, I think, to see two people essentially solve the problem for themselves and eventually do the best for Billy. And, even if it was a bit strange, I actually liked the music in this movie too. For some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey in which the three main characters had embarked. This film flowed quite well and did not fade, as some emotionally heavy films tend to do. He faced a serious situation but did not take himself too seriously. He simply told the story directly and it worked quite well.
