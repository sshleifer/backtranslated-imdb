Let me just say: I love the horror genre to the extent that I see every single one I can get my hands on independently (except the horrors of really low quality b-movies I could do without) and I recently became a big fan of Oriental horrors I didn't know that a Korean horror would be the best on my list by beating heavyweights like the Japanese Ringu (or the American Ring), or even quality American films like Sixth Sense and The Others, and the acclaimed Hong L ' horror of Kong 'The Eye'. <br /> <br /> Previously "The Ring" was my favorite horror, but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of "The Tale of Two Sisters" every day - the story is Extraordinary and rather open to the interpretation that allows then to repeat the visualizations, even if it is likely that you will want to see it again and again just because the film was shot in a masterly way ... the story is probably one of the best of its kind to date. The acting is top notch even for the entire cast and the fears when they arrive have the potential to make you shake like anything inside the Ring - I found myself glued to the screen in those points unable to look away. <br /> <br /> I'm still happy that he didn't come back to haunt me later that Sadako / Samara did from the Ring - after all these feelings are unpleasant and The Tale of Two Sisters leaves you with a feeling of unease, but one that I hope will not leave you without sleep but will leave you satisfied that you have seen something very special. But remember ... if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing, a repeated view is more than recommended .. Personally I didn't have time for this since it was late, so I flipped through the scenes on the DVD, some many times until I had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net, it seemed that I had almost nailed it to the widely shared interpretation. And the satisfaction of solving such a riddle is wonderful. <br /> <br /> All in all - a masterfully crafted horror that will hardly produce the same "level" remake (it was bought by Dreamworks) simply because of the Korean Content and everyone is invited to take this in theaters or on DVDs while they can ... it's one of the best you can get. Unfortunately, due to the type of film this is, there is no way to talk about the story without spoilers, so it is better to do what I did - look at it without knowing a single thing except that it is a "story of two sisters"! And be ready for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.
