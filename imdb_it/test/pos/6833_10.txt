Surprised to know that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and bored by so many predictable films, I was delighted by the script that showed so many little stories and ideas scattered here and there. Directed with black humor and taste, I loved the tension between the Boggart Rickman and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Every member of the band deserves attention, Gil Bellows is at his best. Gugino is remarkable.
