Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. As an ex-boyfriend tried to kill her and, in fact, left seriously injured, she is determined to bring to justice those who harm others. As a result of her pre-death experience, too, Cassie is in favor of one night and doesn't trust anyone. One day, a woman is found dead in the woods near Cassie's community. She was killed atrociously, severely beaten and left to die alone. Of course, Cassie will stop at nothing to find the killers. Assigned to help her is the official colleague, Sam (Ben Chaplin). He soon discovers Cassie's relentless attitude and devouring instinct when she asks him to collect a sample of vomit that was left on the scene for analysis, among other actions. The path soon takes them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Could these adolescents really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect killing of "joy"? This is an intriguing film, but viewers should be warned that the topic is really sad. Killing for the "sport" of it is rarely the theme of the films that are of the "all sweetness and light" variety and this is no different. That being said, the cast is fantastic. Bullock, without a hint of his talent for comedy, is as formidable as the police officer whose past forces her to block the wicked of the world. Chaplin is also very nice as the detective who is attracted and repelled by the powerful Cassie. As for Gosling, it gives a memorable performance like a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. Even the production values ​​of the film are good, with suitably adjusted costumes, settings and photography. If you are a Bullock fan looking for a laugh, this is not for you. But if you love mysteries, even those with the scariest plots, you'll find this story compelling.
