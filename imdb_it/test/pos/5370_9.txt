One of the best less known horror occult films of the seventies. It's gritty, exciting, scary, surreal here and there and at times even very clever, which can't be said of many of these films. I can't help but see some pungent symbolic and metaphorical points in the society of the seventies and stuff of generation of the time in which this film was made. The screenwriter obviously cooked while also providing some good old "crypt" scenes. With a job well done by a creative director the result is fun and stimulating. The simple but effective ending shows especially how these things are treated well by those who can. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast was mostly unknown to me, except LQ Jones as the moody but amusing sheriff and Strother Martin as the city doctor. Martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the film. With that voice and skill he is one of the greatest madmen of cinema, at least for me. What an actor! <br /> <br /> So for me it is a bit of a mystery why this film has not received much more recognition. I think it deserves an almost equal place in the occult canon alongside Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. A helluva movie!
