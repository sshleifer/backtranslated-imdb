I come from Texas and my family was on vacation a couple of years ago in Sante Fe with my brother. He suggested going to see the church with the stairs. I was absolutely shocked by the miracles that occurred there. The film is fantastic - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the parts they played. It's incredible, absolutely incredible. If you haven't seen the scale in person, it's worth a visit. The wood is beautiful and the architecture is stunning. Being alone in the chapel gives me goose bumps! Reading the history of the chapel and then seeing its beauty is breathtaking. Watch the movie - it's FANTASTIC! Then see the stairs in person!
