This is a very moving film that takes a new turn somewhere we've all been: a relationship as it's about to end. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa, desperately trying to keep her connection with Bobby for another day, is extremely convincing and moving and takes you straight into history. Who did not have to face the end of a relationship and at least wanted to scream in tears, "Just another night!" When he gives her another night, the journey that these two people share makes you stop and think about how precious every truly close relationship is, and how everyone - permanent or otherwise - should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away.
