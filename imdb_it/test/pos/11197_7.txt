A study of one of those universally familiar, physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the film also makes comments on cultural displacement. <br /> <br /> The film presents the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). One has the money (and the comforts that come from having "made-it" with a constant income); the other has none and goes in search of work. They are not even happy. Don't expect any celebration of life here - this is loneliness, warts and everything else. <br /> <br /> The film manages to offer a powerfully dreary crossing through the "low lands" of the human condition. Brave movie. Well acted and well shot in my opinion (the outdoor shots of the port are my favorites). A film that should inspire gratitude to anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfillment in life (not to mention employment); everyone else will find a companion in this film. A film with all the warmth and rhythm of an ice floe. Expect a bitter pill, not a "happy pill".
