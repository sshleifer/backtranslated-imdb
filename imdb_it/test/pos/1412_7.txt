Johnny Crawford is very good in this film of a teenager in old age in a generation that was in the midst of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, at times sweet, but sincere film. It gives us a look not only on the social scene, but gives good, solid advice that is valid today on morals, decisions, the generation gap, children's appointments (some of the statistics provided in this film are stunning: today's statistics). It's nice to see Billy in his younger days. It's a fantastic film. It made me realize that human nature does not change, even though hair, fashion and language can change, humans are still struggling with the same problems they have been struggling with for thousands of years.
