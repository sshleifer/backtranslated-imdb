I absolutely love this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it in the video store. I saw that Kathy Bates was there, so I thought it was worth something, you know? I saw it the first time shaking my head. . . eh? Then it was the last scene and I felt sore from smiling so much. I clicked "Play Movie" and looked at the whole thing again. It is without doubt the strangest film I've ever seen. But the more I look at it, the more I love it. It is absurd, crazy, sweet and expensive. Kathy Bates is impeccable, but the rest of the cast is also fabulous. What strange characters are all! The dwarf is too much fun for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a fun and fabulous movie. I want to see it again. Whoever looks at it for the first time, please let it out until the end. It's worth it!
