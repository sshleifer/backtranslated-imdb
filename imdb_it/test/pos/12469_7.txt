I really liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour, until the cruelty to animals by civilized humans in Scotland struck me in the second half and made me so sad that I couldn't see them a bit '. However, this was done by the director to point out that the first natural scientists ruined everything they had not understood "studying" it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied, which we now know should not be studied anywhere, but in the natural world in which they live, and as discreetly as possible. I recommend this film because it was a mostly serious and honest story about Tarzan and he made a point of showing the cruel animal cruelty that was rampant in the scientific world of the 19th century as well as the pure and simple, wonderfully primitive life that Tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a child and raised as a chimpanzee after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle. Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very profound in his life as Tarzan, as was Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzan's rich and ennobled grandfather in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was cute and pretty like Tarzan, the "Jane" from his first film role. From his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes, I can't understand why Lambert didn't become a big star later, but his really bad choices later might have done it. The terrifying Ian Holm, a French wounded in Africa aided by Tarzan and who escorted Tarzan to his previous, unknown ancestral home in Scotland, was as great as ever. <br /> <br /> I am so happy that Tarzan fell ill and did not remain in the cruel civilized animal world at that time and went home to Africa in the end to live his life with his "relatives" kind and loving, who raised him instead of being in Scotland and living like kings, which would have ruined him if he hadn't killed him first.
