Almost no information is available on this film, or on its air dates. After a continuous and exhaustive search I found the DVD available for 3.99! - for the date of February 28, 2006. Try yahoo / DVD and video. To obtain this information, I will continue to say that this is a well-made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. It is a possibility to see William L. Peterson before C.S.I. turned it into a star. Likewise in the story is the venerable Barbara Hershey - does anyone remember when she was Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to keep writing to get this post. Thanks to previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure TV movie which obviously leaves a lasting impression on many.
