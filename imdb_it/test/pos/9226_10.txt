Here's what you need to remember about this movie .... IT'S A VIDEO FOR CHILDREN !!!!! I don't know about you, but I'm a kid from the 80s. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So, of course, I love this movie. But if you look at the other Rainbow Brite movies this is by far the best. But, as I said, it's a film for children. You must judge it as a children's movie. It doesn't matter to children if acting, animation or script are fantastic or even good. All they care about is what happens to the characters. If the good guy (or the girl) wins, then it's a great movie. If not, then it's bad. You all know what I mean. You were all children once.
