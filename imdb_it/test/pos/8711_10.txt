I miss the words whenever I want to describe my feelings about this movie (and the sequels) ... Do you have any flaws? Of course he does ... From the "Subspecies" themselves, which have not been performed well enough for a special effect. So why do I glorify these films ??? For the herd of films, mass consumers out there, who care more about quantity than quality, economic fun rather than depth, shit like "blade" (it doesn't even deserve a capital letter), "underworld", "Dracula "2000", "dracula 3000" and so on are good movies to munch on popcorn and drink a couple of coca-cola ... What makes Subspecies a superior effort for anyone who claims to be a Vampire fanatic, on the other hand, it is obvious: The Vampire Himself is Romanian, the plot is set in Transylvania (the scenes shot on the spot are more than convincing) and the atmosphere is not based on "full action" chases or on expensive orchestral music. it is the source of the atmosphere ... This is how a Vampire should be and this is how it should behave! Add an incredibly dark castle with dark passages located in Romania, include some typical Vampiric elements (like the movement of shadows on the you when the Vampires take flight) and you have a work of art! In short, if, like me, you are fascinated by vampires and feel that their appearance and setting should be sinister and dark, there is no better place to look inside than in a movie Subspecies ... Or in Vampire Magazines , the brilliant spin-off of the first ...
