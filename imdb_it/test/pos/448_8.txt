Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film, "The Journey", with Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and concerns a group of travelers who have problems leaving Budapest due to political problems in that part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner), seize their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), who presents himself as an American but actually a Hungarian freedom fighter, who the major believes was smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding it. It becomes the focus of the major's romantic attentions. <br /> <br /> Great film that conveys the tension and hassle of the Cold War, and all the performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly good as the passionate Major who is not entirely bad, and Anne Jackson offers a realistic and powerful performance like a pregnant woman who doesn't want her baby born in a communist country. <br /> <br /> Good script, good director, good cast - there should be more movies like this. Highly recommended.
