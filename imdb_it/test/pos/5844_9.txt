Oz is a great series, one of the undervalued television programs. He has a certain relationship with the soap opera, in the sense that something evil is always happening, and it is the unfolding of every instance of evil that fascinates. From my discussions with people who are actually in prison, it sounds real. Every interaction has a machining in the background. Behind every action, there is a pattern, a plot to make someone else. I like this series so much that it's one of the few TV programs I bought completely, on DVD. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it. The character in the wheelchair who offers his jaundiced vision of life does so with a bit of ironic humor.
