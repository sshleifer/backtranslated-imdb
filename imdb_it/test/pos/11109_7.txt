I always wanted to see this movie and the first three quarters showed that I hadn't waited in vain. But what the hell happened in the end? I mean, don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It certainly made me nostalgic for the realistic, unique NYC of the 80s that we lost thanks to Giuliani. But another half hour is missing!
