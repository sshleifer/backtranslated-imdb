Well, someone who likes to travel on the highway at 120 km / h, eat McDonalds and run the twenty-seven air conditioner and watch Fox News non-stop, I found this documentary interesting. One thing I learned when talking about North America, I assume this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For the Canadian attack I'll leave it to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The consequences of oil depletion will affect everyone, especially those living in large countries in Australia, Canada and the United States. I am sure that Green Peace will not applaud more gas, it no longer means any SUV, without realizing that people living in sub-zero temperatures could die of hunger. <br /> <br /> As someone who has studied economics, I know for sure that we live in a world of limited resources. I will give documentary material to try to present a balanced view of oil depletion. However I am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of posts loaded - republicans like warmongers. What did the Democrats send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you intend to present a documentary on economics and resources, it is better to leave the political side to one side, because it could completely shut down a potential member of the public. Focus on the issue of limited resources. At the end of the day, it's better to open the minds of the mainstream, since it's not a good preaching to the tiny choir. <br /> <br /> I really like watching documentaries like Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia not because of their political bias, because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Of course, I like shopping and the consumer's junk food as if there were no tomorrow, but if the world ends tomorrow I'd rather die and consume the living beep out of it. <br /> <br /> For potential documentaries out there, just give people the facts and let the spectators decide for themselves. If you are trying to package your political opinions as a balanced documentary, people will smell a rat a mile away.
