Quite decent for his early work and without Kokaku Kidotai without, and gets an extra 2 points for Easter eggs. For Shirow definitely a step in the ladder. I'm biased as a Shirow fan, but this was a big step from Dirty Pair which was what I knew about him. Violent fun with a porn soundtrack! You can't help but notice it. I know people appreciate it for Ghost in the Shell ... but all the deep spiritual tones have been treated in Appleseed. ESWAT kills the terrorists, the struggle for humans to remain viable while the bioroids eliminate them, and Deunan remains thin despite taking junk food. Surely, like the characters, the traitor too ... and I don't know why.
