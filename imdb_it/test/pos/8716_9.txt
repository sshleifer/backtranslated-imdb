I have to agree with all the previous commentators - this is simply the best of all the sparkling comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe has always been, and certainly with a nicer face (maybe there is less mystery, but look how he paid Marilyn for that.) I don't think I've ever seen such a luscious female on the screen, so perfect that even a gay like me is enthusiastic about it - and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if evangelical idiots really want to do the their "convert-a-queer" number, they really need to improve their standards, since no church mice has to apply here ...) Her breasts, the rest of her figure, her adorable voice, the hilarious way she shakes as she crosses a room ... just to get in front of a man, her breasts literally pointed like in an exquisite comparison ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the greatest men in the whole story of the cinema. No one acted alongside his greatest female stars: Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert, and here Bardot, among many others. And he was also in "Fanny" with Leslie Caron, and had small parts in "How to Steal a Million" with A. Hepburn, as well as being in Deneuve's "The April Fools" (though not in front of her). the only thing I might disagree is that even loud and unpleasant music on the credits is appropriate - I mean, Bardot doesn't want to be thin above all else, and his essential volume (I don't mean his voice ) is part of its irresistible charm and, one might even say, exemplary. <br /> <br /> Vidal is really nice, even if the pout Brigitte says at the beginning "I don't know why I'm in love with you, you're not even handsome. <br /> <br /> Dear, dear Bardot! Really one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy she is still with us, when so many truly authentic characters are disappearing so quickly, in all its eccentric glory.
