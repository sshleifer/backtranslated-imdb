I had to call my mother (a WASP) to ask her about this. Was it really that bad in the 40s in New York? Surprise, he could not remember. So I told her to watch the movie. Arthur Miller, not in a script but as OUR for a change, was 30 years old when he wrote this in 1945. It is a painful representation of anti-Semitism. And yet, strangely, there is a tender history of human relations (Finkelstein, the Jew, with Newman, the non-Jew, mainly) who is the basis of the cruel story. The acting is competent and the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think of this is not of great importance in the theater is that it is >> aaagh << controversial. <Br /> <br /> I actually give it ten out of ten. Maybe a little high, but it's worth seeing.
