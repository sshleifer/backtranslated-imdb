For Finnish Estonians it sometimes seems like a land of dreams. A land where many of us want to go to work there or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies has made this brilliant piece that shows that not everything is so beautiful even in Finland. That Finland can be just like Paha maa (the bad land) of any other country. It shows that people there can be just as miserable in their lives as we are in any other place. That sometimes there is nothing good. This film clearly shows why Finland is one of the best suicide countries. It is not easy to live in the North. The cold climate changes us. I have become increasingly attracted to Finnish films and this is very good. Even acting is great. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the best Finnish stars. Pay attention to the sex scene (if you have small children) and a small depression that could come after the movie! 8/10
