I saw this performance on TV and recorded it. My daughter played us again and again. I lent myself to work and everyone loved it. It's just a brilliant physical comedy. Bill made his appearance here in California, (he was working and living in New York) and performed the Regard of Flight on stage. I was able to bring my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Bill was awarded a federal endowment, and my daughter wrote him a congratulatory letter, and Bill was kind enough to write her note back and enclose a photograph. <br /> <br /> People ask me and I can't decide if he's a comedian, an actor or a clown. In reality he is all three. I really wish it was on DVD, my tape is lost.
