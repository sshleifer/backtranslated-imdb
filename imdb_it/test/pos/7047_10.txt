I first saw this film in the mid-80s and thought it was a funny movie. As I got older, I watch this movie for several reasons. I like to see him when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14 years) at the time of the release of this film, so I can identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas that campers / CIT of this film have. I like to see the clothes that have been worn right now and listen to the usual urban legends as told during the night canoe trip. The film is also full of funny jokes. I highly recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager between the 70s and the early 80s.
