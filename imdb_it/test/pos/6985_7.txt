* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought Pitch Black was pretty funny, with some nice effects - I liked the bigger beasts, even if they aren't a Alien series patch. It had a nice atmosphere, and I felt that Vin Diesel contributed to its contribution. One thing that left me puzzled was the rain. If the planet has three suns and is almost in daylight, where does the humidity come from to form clouds and then rain? <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that Fry died at the end - he reminded me of the 70's New Hollywood movies, with the main heroine who didn't make it to the end.
