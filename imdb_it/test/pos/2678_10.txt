Wow, this is in my opinion the best sitcom from friends. If you've had a shitty day, sit down with a beer (if you're old enough. If it's not a root beer you should do it.) And look at a couple of episodes, it's the perfect recipe for happiness. /> <br /> The thing I like best is that everyone in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comic timing. After a while you will become attached to the characters and you will really care about them. I think the secret to the success of the shows is that they have an enviable life. Doug is fat but happy, he loves his wife, his job and his friends. The father-in-law is the only flaw but hey nothing perfect.
