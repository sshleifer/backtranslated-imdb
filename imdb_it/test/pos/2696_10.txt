In an age of bad, if not horrible, comedies, King of Queens is more than a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! In my opinion it is one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time. Nothing has been so beautiful since being married to children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as a comic genius. These guys really understand what's fun. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and I wouldn't have had half the laughs seeing KOQ only once. Other funny people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (the leader of Carrie). I'm so happy that they managed to get so many seasons out of this gem. The show was a hilarious winner in an era of mostly comic losers. Take a look if you haven't!
