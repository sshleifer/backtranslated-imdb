First of all the story is not so simple as many previous reviewers tend to point out, it's actually a very complex story, unlike the other Bergman films that are more prone to character study. In Skammen we have two main characters, but since we are cast from the beginning in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open to any resolution. This creates great tension and makes any event significant. As the plot develops, we are introduced to numerous characters, who have become symbols of humanity, both its dark and luminous sides. We have the example of the innocent spectators who try to get by during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole film, the perverse opportunists who try to make the best of a atrocious event (the character of Bjornstrand), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost turned into animals by boat etc. All of them are somehow seen through the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters are more sober in other Begrman films (En Passion) and this is exactly why what is important here is the story , the way in which external events have the capacity to radically change human nature. <br /> <br /> Bergman made this film two years later Persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word pronounced by Liv Ulmann's character is INGENTING, nothing. Here: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter is nothing more than a game that includes all theatrical works. But what about the war? And above all those annihilating the twentieth century. In Persona, the only real emotion suffered by Ulmann's character is when he sees a victim of the Vietnam war turned into a human torch. In Skammen this idea extends to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In a region with no name for a country without a name (let us suppose only that it is Sweeden) two factions that speak the same language fight an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers caught in the middle, but their dreams are woven into a sort of counterpoint. Jan is initially an idealist, unable to react properly to the world and subject to the will of his wife. Towards the end it turns into a radically different personality, capable of unmotivated, willful, ruthless murder (look carefully at the suicide on the boat ... the simplicity of the act is heartbreaking). On the other hand, Eva progressively loses contact with reality and in the end is completely suffused in her unfulfilled dream. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view the whole film transmits its message very effectively. Bergman positions the viewer next to the character, putting the camera in the car with the actors, or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist manages an extraordinary camera control, there are some masterful "freehand" effects, very good in making everything look "real". The shots when the characters are captured by the army seem very similar to documentaries. The script is minimalist but the story is quite complex for that subject. In reality the whole film is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in stark contrast to the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. Nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent redemption. But, as in Liv Ulmann's dream, in the end it's all so beautiful that you can't help but be amazed ... It wasn't so terrible since it was so beautiful!
