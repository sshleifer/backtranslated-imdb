See No Evil With Kane. The film has a fantastic plot But it was not just a hidden eye, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it would be from watching WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw when the movie came to theaters. I enjoyed the movie even though I liked the story. <br /> <br /> GREAT EXCELLENT FILM I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter if Kane is killed The end <br /> <br /> Or they didn't kill other horror stars in every movie <br /> <br /> I'm out and coming back for more So part 2 would be <br /> <br /> Be very interesting.
