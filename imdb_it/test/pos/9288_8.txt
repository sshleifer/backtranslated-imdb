A very funny look at some of Australia's current business and political affairs. The Chaser guys really seem to have fun with this show and what I like is that they all have their strengths; some are brilliant (Chas) in making themselves completely idiotic, while Julian manages to bring out everything "I'm interviewing a famous politician and I'm about to suggest that he was disguising himself as a kid" br /> <br /> They have big segments on the show, taking the piss out of all kinds of aspects of Australian culture like our current affairs programs, announcements and Early Morning television programs. Some material is a little tired and predictable, but overall it's very fun to watch and will leave you with a smile on your face.
