Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took at the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) that Coen is doing "their thing" to one of the great works of literary history. Who would have thought Homer had it in mind? I don't know where this film will fit into Hollywood history books, but it will be in my and many other DVDs or VHS. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and fun, with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a short but hilarious Holly Hunter. Having been born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I would like more people to have some fun with us in this way. They even invoke a soundtrack suitable for the rural south. You're NOT doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie! <br /> <br />
