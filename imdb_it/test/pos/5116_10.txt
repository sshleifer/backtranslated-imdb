I Love Ernest goes to prison. It's one of my 3 favorite movies from Ernest. The others are Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes to Camp. In this film Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor for a bank but wants to be a bank employee. He will soon be assigned the task of juror, but he will soon get into trouble when the evil assassin Felix Nash (Varney also) knocks him out and changes places with him! Soon Ernest is in prison and is forced to behave like Nash, otherwise Nash will kill the love interest of Charlotte Ernest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair thinking he is Nash, he is so electrically charged that he ends up bursting and leaves and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Full of hilarious scenes and comics Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that will make you laugh so much! It still does it for me! Jim Varney was a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both the good guy and the bad guy! Varney was like his Toy Story Co star, Tom Hanks. No matter what role their roles were in memorabilia, this is one of the things Varney will always remember! REST IN PEACE. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other great characters to life! 10 out of 10!
