I really enjoyed this movie. He was angular without being a sociopath. Vin Diesel gave birth to the character of Riddick and made you feel good and bad about him at different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The snowmobile film - oh yes, it's called "Triple-X" or "xXx" - it was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black he plays an anti-hero at most. I don't think you can be wrong when Vin plays in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood could cast him as a star of the adventurous action movie - wrong! I think the script for "XXX" was weak for which Vin could not act completely. <br /> <br /> However, Pitch Black is a great scifi - watch it! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
