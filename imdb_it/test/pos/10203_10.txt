Here is another 1940s western that I watch whenever it comes to TCM or FMC, because although it may be historically flawed, it is extremely fun and well acted, in addition to Randolph Scott, my favorite actor second only to Gary Cooper-Well OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. But the film itself, for me anyway, is reasonably accurate historically and as I said before, well acted and "flows" very well - I bet I saw it 50 or 60 times, and I enjoy every vision more than the previous one. I recorded it on tape from TCM but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on DVD. Watch it if you don't have it - I guarantee you will like it!
