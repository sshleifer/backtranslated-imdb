Some people may call the same type of "American Graffiti" as "Cooley High", but I would not. For beginners, in "AG", all were white, while in "CH" they were all black. Also, this has a Motown soundtrack. In particular, the film focuses on several African-American working-class students in 1964 in Chicago and their antics. The film deals mainly with domestic life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there is never any dad around. But these young people always know how to live life to the fullest. <br /> <br /> One thing that really sets this film apart from most other portraits of people of color is that teenagers in this film are interpreted as very responsible, worrying about the missing school. Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and that of the white boy in the film. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack. It really is one of the best soundtracks in the history of cinema (we also have it on vinyl here at home). A classic in the true sense of the word.
