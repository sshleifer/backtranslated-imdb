I recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film from director Mani Ratnam at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. I gave my highest award at the Film Festival for this feature. Make sure you don't miss the opportunity to experience this cinematic gem ... but to be biased: this film will make you shed a tear if you are part of the species known as homo sapien! A 10 !!
