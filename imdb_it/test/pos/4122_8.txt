Even after about 20 years, the original Black Sabbath members have lost nothing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their golden age (1970-1978), including "NIB", "War Pigs" and "Paranoid". <br /> <br /> Also included is a priceless backstage video with interviews and retrospectives in their days as the best hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are equally interesting and intriguing to look like the fabulous performances on stage. <br /> <br /> A must for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans.
