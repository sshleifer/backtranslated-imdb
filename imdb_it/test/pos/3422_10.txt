I haven't seen a movie that touched me and grabbed me that way for a long time; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was taking a bath; and I didn't even want to pause him because I was directly involved. Emotional; powerful; very moving; horrible and heartbreaking. It gives you an incredible insight into South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The lead acting was amazing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events taking place in this film and how horrible the story is; I was fascinated. I don't even want to try to explain the story; it's too complex and I wouldn't do it justice. Please see this; you'll understand why when you do it. Greetings, Hol
