This is a great concert with the best songs from the band's thirty-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were animated and entertaining on stage and performed a great show. That said, I think the audio recording was messed up at the mixing console and / or through the miking process. However, it's not the boys' fault. They also mentioned that the show was set up at the last minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They simply should not have put the show out for public consumption. Neil's snare drum seems distant and Geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but bottomless !! They should have held this concert and waited for a better opportunity. Buy this DVD only if you are a hardcore Rushian. The quality is lacking in the audio department.
