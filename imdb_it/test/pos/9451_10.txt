This was a fantastically written script when it comes to perceiving things from another perspective. The comedy was timely and not excessive, the acting was generally exceptional, and the plot had a greater purpose of generating misunderstandings when we think of people based solely on their outward appearance. The plot unfolds as Amanda Bynes 'brother / sister character tries to play soccer on the boys' team, discovering instead a new love interest along the way. Tatum Channing is the place where the real wrong perception is found and at the beginning it does a great job of acting, then it realizes that the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.
