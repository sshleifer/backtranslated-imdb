I think this is one of the best Tamil movies I've seen in a while. I love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a boy and a girl who fall in love and made the film brilliantly. The cast did a great job and I particularly congratulate Litte's girlfriend. It was brilliant and really sparked the feeling of a foster child in search of his real mother. The best thing is the songs, the beautiful music and the moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this move! in particular "Kannathil Mutthamittal" and "Velai Pookal". Great songs, both. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to enjoy good tears and fantastic acting (and superb songs!). Greetings Simran.
