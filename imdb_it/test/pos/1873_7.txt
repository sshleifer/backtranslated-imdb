It took years for the cult icon Bruce Campbell to get this project off the ground - but in the end it does, it's here - and what a beautiful piece of schlock entertainment it is! Looking at the plot; sounds like two things. An excellent base for a very silly B-movie, and a shameless excuse for Bruce Campbell for what he does best - the slapstick humor in Evil Dead II style, and this film gives both sides. The Man With the Screaming Brain is a comic book absurdity - but there are some really great scenes, and it's almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote, directs, produces and acts in this film - and even if it's not really Citizen Kane, it must be said that this is a result for the most famous man who fought alone in a cabin in the woods. The plot follows the American entrepreneur William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. The journey ends badly, however, when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead; thanks to the same woman Mad scientist Stacy Keach is available to join Cole and the taxi driver's brain in one; and we have a cult movie in our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is fun and has some laughs; but once the main plot point was executed; the film really resumes. Bruce makes the most of the scenery in all kinds of silly situations, from changing clothes into a trash can, to deciding (with the taxi driver in the brain) what to eat in a restaurant. Humor is mostly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who has enjoyed Evil Dead II (which should be anyone who has seen it) will surely appreciate that too. It seems that Campbell is playing a little too much with his strengths with this whole project, but if you have tuned in and NOT seen Bruce do what he does best, disappointment would ensue. In addition, do not disrespect man; but he was never the actor with the widest range. Despite being very funny; the film is not exceptional, sometimes it becomes a bit too silly; and there's a whole sub-plot with a robot that I didn't like; but overall, The Man With the Screaming Brain is a film that unfortunately we don't see too much today. The film is a wide-ranging film, with no holds barred, B; and deserves respect for this if nothing else.
