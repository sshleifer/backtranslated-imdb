This is a good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern California, directed by James Bridges and starring Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda plays a television reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but he can only be a television reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a nuclear power plant supervisor. Fonda and Douglas are sent on a routine assignment to a nuclear power plant and almost an accident happens and they understand everything on film. Everyone tries to cover it except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon begins to investigate and discovers that the company is more concerned with profits and safety at the plant. It's a good movie with a pretty good ending.
