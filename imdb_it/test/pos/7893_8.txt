If Archie Bunker were armed, it could have been "Joe". However, "All in the Family" would have had a rather short run because the censorship would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this film. Joe is a working class boy who is a racist and a bigot and has a big mouth, especially when he is drunk. One evening he meets a man in a bar, Bill, who is drinking a drink to calm his exhausted nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's drug addict and slips him on Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter lived with the drug addict, and that she was transported to the hospital after an overdose, and goes near the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect her to come across the boy, who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. In the ensuing struggle, the boy is accidentally killed and Bill doesn't want anyone to know about it, of course. But let Joe slip in, and then when the newspapers and TV news come out, Joe sees them, puts together 2 and 2, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. He connects with him later and Bill is obviously worried that Joe would blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to go out with him. Which is, in a sense, almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she is in, and slips home, and by chance she listens to what happened and then is on the run, and most of the rest of the film is composed of Joe and Bill who infiltrate the "subway" to try to find her. This ends with a rather shocking ending, which for me was completely unexpected and ends with the right note, or with the wrong note, depending on your point of view. A sort of decent but obscure vision of life in the early 1970s, mostly from the point of view of a working class bigot, which doesn't make it suitable for everyone, but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.
