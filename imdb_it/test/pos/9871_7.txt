I bought it in the budget department last week. I already had Halloween and II, and since I aim to collect all the horror films of all time, I chose this one. after all, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> this movie is smart enough to tell the truth. seems to create the right atmosphere and has a beautiful "Michael myers story". uses the old positions from the original, and the main character is the boy that Laurie babysat to that fateful halloween of 1978 ... <br /> <br /> even the climax is quite satisfying. however, it is MUCH better than H20, which frankly, is absolute crap.
