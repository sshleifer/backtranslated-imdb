An incredibly heartbreaking story about two soldiers in distress in World War II. Set in a frigid scenario, not only the struggle against the Nazis and the traitors in Belarus, but the harsh natural elements, this film tells a story of two soldiers of polarized morality, one who survives but finds something impossible to manage with his his own circumstances, and he who dies, having done all that can be done in the face of intimidation and all that is possible to break the spirit, in fact, "the ascendant" of the title. A film that should be seen by everyone, especially for the phenomenal performances of the main characters and the trembling set designers (in particular the incarceration and suspension scenes).
