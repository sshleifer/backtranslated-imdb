Despite the apparent structural similarity with The Simpsons - fat dad, housewife mother, 3 children, a pet, typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposed to The Simpsons. His greedy (and sometimes too much) use of cutaway was his main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail in the head (The Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bite in the fifth season is ruthlessly hilarious), others are less successful, and seem invented. And they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the plot. (The pieces of Jesus are totally unpleasant and offensive.) <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to pure golden comedy, so much so that Chris and Meg can only fulfill the role of the adolescents obliged in your typical dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, is MINDLY GREAT. Thank goodness he went directly to the DVD. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the strenuous comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach with Family Guy is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and incredibly, much more brazen. <br /> <br /> The creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, criticized the famous Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from the point of view of a cartoonist. I don't think it's that bad, the detail and accuracy of some of the parodies are quite successful. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great series with a large large amount of choked ranch sauce and jokes.
