I was born in Beijing, China, and moved to the United States at the age of nine. I have been home to Beijing several times since then and I loved it every time. One of the many things I love about Beijing is the people and atmosphere they bring to the city. "You hao hao shuo" (which translates more accurately into "if you have something to say, say it well") captures that feeling of Beijing in a delightful and sincere way. I suppose you should have lived and understood Beijing and its people to get the most out of this film, even if you could enjoy it at will. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, deliberately a bit bizarre and captivating. I will let it develop on its own and don't tell you too much, except for some comments. Every detail, from the images on the wall, to the decorations, to the streets and to the restaurants seems to be at home. (Zhang Yimou probably shot everything "in place") But most importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the good heart but unlucky "portable man" and the nightclub owner are Beijing natives and lovable in their distinct ways. Their conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, mostly driven by situations and conversations (save the bright bafio near the end) is intriguing and always interesting. <br /> <br />> I'm 21 now. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so amazed by Zhang Yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into credible characters, and everyday life into extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "keep cool" - different. funny. significant.
