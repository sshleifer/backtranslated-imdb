By far one of the best science fiction films out there. However, it takes a multiple vision to understand the concept of the film and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect, but the main plot of the film itself. It is my opinion that this film had such negative reviews because no one had the time to watch the movie the way it was to be seen. There are some moments you want to hurry up and pass, but they are few and far between. Hooper, who directed TCM 1 and 2 along with a remake of INVADERS FROM MARS, and THE FUNHOUSE does his best work here. Great score, good acting and great effects make this movie to add to your collection if you have the chance to see the widescreen version on DVD, highly recommended to anyone who is a science fiction fan.
