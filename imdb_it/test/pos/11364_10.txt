In 1961, this series was shown on local TV here in southern California. Since then, I and many others have always been looking for BBC for tape or DVD. Now all of a sudden, here it is on Amazon. I pre-ordered in January and now here March 30 has arrived. It was a long wait (48 years). It was worth it? So far I've just seen Richard II (I only had the DVD from 2 o'clock) and I can really say YEA !!! it's absolutely worth waiting for Acting, directing and producing are superb and even better than I remember. Production is in B&W but somehow fits. The video is clear and very good, the sound is impeccable. Further proof of how timeless Shakespeare is. <br /> <br /> I gave this 10 stars even though I only saw 1 of the 8 plays. I'm sure that when I've seen them all I'll change my rating to at least 12. <br /> <br /> It's currently available on Amazon (US region 1) at a reasonable price. <br /> <br /> I'd better stop now so I can watch again. Next is Henry IV, whose part 1 is my favorite work by Shakespeare.
