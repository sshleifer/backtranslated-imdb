What film! I've always liked the Asian shooting style, and this movie doesn't disappoint at all! Photography is breathtaking, ranging from incredible landscapes to swirls of colors. The main actor is really realistic in representing the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The finish is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only observation is that perhaps they should have shown a little more deeply the link between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women. But all this is an excellent film!
