K-Pax is a very intriguing film. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally unbalanced man who thinks he's an alien? This is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self-proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film is revealed and further evidence is discovered, both theories grow credibility. Its ability to map the area of ​​the galaxy in which its home planet is located from memory indicates a knowledge that no human being could possess. Yet hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, full of devastating events that could have caused such an aberration of personality. The ending seems to give the answer, but it's ambiguous enough to make you ask if you really know. Normally, I don't like lady or tiger terminations, but this is tempting. I have a theory of mine that fits all clues, but I don't know that my theory is more correct than anyone else's. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley ("Wings of the Dove") runs the story gently, with great skill. This is a rare example of the director remaining in the shadows and inducing exceptional acting actors to talented actors to let history dominate. This does not mean that the direction is technically inferior, because it is excellent. However, Softley remains discreet, offering great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from today's avant-garde directors who visually grasp and shake the viewer as if they were shouting: "Look how brilliant I am!" <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey once again offers a marvelous performance as Prot. This is a piece that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring Spacey to make the Prot cold and logical a minute, and then to shift gear to summon his alter ego tormented under hypnosis the next. Spacey is as credible as it is alien and human, making the task of the viewer much more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also formidable as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. <br /> <br /> This is an inspired narrative for the reflective viewer. I rated it 9/10. If you have to have a closing at the end of a movie, this movie will be very frustrating. However, if you like a fascinating mystery that makes you think long after the end credits, you won't be disappointed.
