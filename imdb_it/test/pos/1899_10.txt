Anyone interested in what it was like to make a film in the 70s watch this movie. Some dialogue in this film is so funny, I summarized my submission. Pay attention to the boom microphone that appears in some scenes and some of the best karate actions ever. Do not take this film seriously or you will be disappointed, enter it with an open mind and immerse yourself in the world of one of the most wicked mutha of the world Dolemite !!! Editing was put together as if it had been cut with a razor, but again this film is much more than what you see in the movie that influenced the black community in ways you can't understand !!!
