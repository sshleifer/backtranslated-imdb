I only saw this movie once when it was shown on TV, but I can still remember it 15 years later, so I have to say something about it. I thought it was a clever look at school, friendship, bullying and the influence it can have on adult life. <br /> <br /> The title really refers to how being good or bad at sport can make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within the school and even later in adulthood if you are good at it - this is set in a private school in England but it could be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The main character is bad at games, looking for revenge in old age, all culminating in a firefight on a cricket pitch. I must admit that I was gutted by the ending - it was powerful and saddening.
