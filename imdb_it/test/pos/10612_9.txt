Marigold is by far the best Bollywood outsider I've ever seen. (I didn't grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred of them now.) I'd say he leaves Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair and even Merchant and Ivory (of Bombay Talkie) almost in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood, and has the confidence to let us know - there is humor, but no arc, ironic distancing, no "of course I don't really mean this" stuff. As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, he "understands" it, and so can we, too - the joy of a Bollywood cinematic experience, along with touches provided by a Westerner who enters the role of narrator. /> <br /> It is the story of a caustic American actress, bitch, bitch, beautiful (she was only in films with numbers in their titles, like Fatal Attraction 3) that is found in another Bollywood movie by the one where she went to India to be in (Kama Sutra 3 folded the curtains while she was traveling, apparently because her producers are now in prison). Salman Khan, in real life a mega-mega Bollywood star, is the dance master of the delightful film written about the moment she was dragged ("is this before or after I go blind?"), And through the sweetness of her slightly psychologically gifted character, he learns much more than how to find his inner ability to dance ecstatic. <br /> <br /> The strong start gives you both Bollywood - a super energetic troupe of dancers facing the Taj Mahal (both entertaining and familiar to the western viewer, as well as providing the high-speed musical thrill we love in a Hindi movies), and Salman on the screen from the start - no Bollywood is waiting 20 minutes for the hero. He has an Indian costume embellished with a Kit Carson-style western movie fringe (all in white). <br /> <br /> The character of Ali Larter is pleasing to the western viewer - she is blonde, who is "traditional" for a "white" person in a Bollywood film and visually understandable casting - but she is a robust girl, not the ethereal type of blonde with whom one usually presents oneself, and is a more or less three-dimensional total bitch, who practices profane and violent conversations of cell phones with a boyfriend and an agent in the United States. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes of women having problems with one another going to a bar to take care of them - the ability for people who don't get along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in movies hindi, but we rarely see much of everything that happens among women (apart from the discussion between mother and daughter about the choice of the daughter's groom), not to mention the "strangers" - unrelated people - not to mention the bar-going . So the spirit is the same, the details are new, and I was delighted. <br /> <br /> I saw him only once, in a preview that showed, with the participation of the director, a great speaker and a question-answer - he and Salman must be friends "brothers" for having made it , he loves India, plans to make a Wizard of Oz movie in India. I can't be too detailed about the songs when I saw them only once, except to say that I liked them all. They range from a happy parody of the Bollywood number in the film within the film - the female costumes, with the Livorno hats and the bodice with the shell (it's a beach scene) on fluid clothes - they are worth the cost of a ticket from only - to a reflective and scenographic romantic song in a sadder and more serious part of the film. <br /> <br /> Mix of Hindi and English in music, and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan gets a lot of credit from me for opening up unusual projects - this and Jaan-e-Mann - and a good judgment of what they are. Carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all along the way, and totally satisfying (ie not narcissistic at all) if Carroll accepted or rejected - clearly only a professional who likes to be involved and collaborate.
