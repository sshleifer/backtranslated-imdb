I saw this film for the first time on an Alaskan Airlines flight, and since then I've seen it twice more. It is simply - and simply is - one of the best films of recent years. I found myself enjoying it after my first viewing, but a little cloudy on what had happened. After seeing him again a few weeks later, things started to take their place. He was not confused, only profound. In fact, the depth of the film may not be appreciated for a long time. For example, it occurred to me only after my third observation that Sammy Davis Jr Jr. (grandfather's dog) is more than just a pet - perhaps he is the replacement for his dead wife. Witness how fiercely he protects her. There is symbolism galore, and none of this is harmful or indulgent, only real. The adventure of their journey keeps the plot in constant motion and, even when they arrive, you're not sure if it was really the destination. While the film continues, so does the adventure and I realized that the destination was simply a point of passage. The soundtrack is fun, the scenery exciting - and both decidedly oriental. I could go on and on about the deeper meanings of the film, but I'm not entirely sure I have yet discovered all the nuances. Plus, it's more fun to tease them yourself. As much as any film can be, "Everything Is Illuminated" has proven to be like a good wine that sweetens with time. I highly recommend seeing it - twice.
