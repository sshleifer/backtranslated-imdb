The film had no help in terms of promotion: if there had been an advertising promo on TV or radio, I have not seen / heard it. The only commercial I saw was his first opening weekend: a dingy and bizarre B & W photo of Andy as Val-Com, behind prison bars, with the title: "WANTED! Runaway Robot!" (which was also the poster in front of the 3 cinemas where I saw it at --NOT the nice little color poster on this site, with the head shots of the whole cast, and the Crimebuster cartoon - which really it wasn't so good - they should have used an action scene from the movie itself - didn't they have a debut photographer? A poster should help a future audience decide if they want to SEE the movie - there were so many people who couldn't get in in their choice sold out, and I wanted to know what it was Heartbeeps - and that poster didn't help! That dirty photo and the only photos provided to the newspapers were so indistinguishable in B & W that they were No trailer for the film: just a slide in a theater, composed of the word "Heartbeeps" inside a heart, with an arrow of Cupid crossing it, and one that was a totally black image: only Andy and Bernadette's voices that say "Val-Com! My entertainment center does not work well! "" So it is mine, do you think we should tell our owners? "This does not help people who were not aware of the film. <br /> <br /> During filming, Andy told reporters that he could not eat, once he applied his plastic lips, so he would "load up for breakfast, and fast" during the day's shooting. what did Bernadette do: but at the time I wondered why they didn't simply drink protein drinks with long straws or ate astronaut-style puree food through pipes? <br /> <br /> Phil-Co, the baby robot, seemed to have been the precursor of the Johnny-Five of the Short Circuit, with the same eyes, a similar face.I tried to find out if they had the same designer, but no help.I have articles from vintage magazines about the film, and the design team was immensely proud of their work, and they were going for a special prize for their innovative device to create "smoke" without stopping for Catskill's cigars. Soon after, LucasFilm NOT used that device, even if they had to, for the scenes Return of the Jedi with Jabba the H ut: a man created "steam" around Jabba, blowing cigar smoke in a tube, joking that all he needed was a glass of brandy, and he would be a happy man. I thought that the use of real tobacco products by LucasFilm was insensitive to those who were upset by the smoke. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who had recently been the successor, the great Arthur Fielder in the role of the Boston Pops master (which however was a success in the standings), but he never recovered from the death of Fielder, and is now a shadow of the ancient splendor), used the show to promote the films with which it provided the music. He played "The Empire Strikes Back" there; And would you think it would help Heartbeeps play some numbers there? The only thing critics liked about this film was Williams' score - but it was NOT available for purchase! I saw a vinyl album, in 1982, with Heartbeep, another half film, but it disappeared. Only tonight I saw the CD listed on THIS site and ordered it. If I can get a scanner and time to write articles, I'd like to create a Heartbeeps tribute site. I liked the movie and I don't care what the dissenters say! <br /> <br /> The only problem with the film was that, towards the end, it was messed up, in a logical sense: the robots escaped from the factory to have the freedom to decide their own destiny, to do the their own choices; yet, when the landfill owners tell them that Phil needs to go to the factory, to have a "purpose" programmed into him, they don't even question it; they look at each other significantly, and leave. Along the way, each of the adults loses battery power and "dies". They are not REALLY dead, because they are robots, and they just need new batteries, yet they are treated as "death", with little Phil crying over them and rolling away. So what was the POINT of this? Phil never returns to the factory and gets "a purpose!" And, of course, landfill owners could have pushed them, or given them all the rechargeable batteries, with spare batteries; but the real point was to have this touching scene, where all the robots were consumed, and Phil is left to cry. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com is a golf instructor, and Aqua-Com is - I'm not sure what. Catskill is an ENTERTAINER - which OTHER should it be? I'm not sure they clarified it. Landfill owners seem to take it easy, lying on deck chairs, drinking lemonade from Phil, their "bartender". The new "daughter" of Val's and Aqua, Philsia - I think the name is - perhaps it is Sylvania - does not seem to be much more than a table lamp. <br /> <br /> The movie is missing, which is sad - from the photos I suppose the missing stuff includes a sweet scene, where Phil is having a Christmas, with Val giving him the wheel of a car; Aqua is supplying a horn; Catskill took the fireman's helmet to give Phil, as we have seen; and they have Christmas trees. I don't know if a missing movie provides a better logic, or if writers can't think of a better crisis / resolution. The film was cut to 72-75 minutes to match it with other failing films. No other reason besides that. For a DVD, I'd really like to be in the making, as I want to see interviews with the cast / crew and John Williams, and the interview with Merv Griffin. The production video; and re-edit and restore the missing movie to make it better.
