This film was very good, not great but very good. It is based on a drama by a man by Ruben Santiago Hudson ... it is he who played most of the parts. On paper it looks like an acrobatic casting. Yes, we gather all the blacks in Hollywood and put them in a movie. Halle Berry also produced it. The only name I didn't see was Oprah, thank God because it would probably end up as a guarantee film. Instead this film was not a sentimental mess. It was moving but not fake, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer in question. The film revolved around the universe of Tata, Mrs. Bill Crosby and how she bred the writer and took people. Now, being a worn-out New Yorker when he said he took sick and old people and then we see them go to a mental institution to get a man, I'm thinking that his sister has a medical scam. Getting jobs for the people and taking the state healthcare / caid allowances But no she explains to Lou Gosset that she only wants $ 25 a week and didn't want the money ahead of time. I think that part was included in the film only for us tired New Yorkers, so we know it's not cheating the poor. (G) It was written by a New Yorker, so he knows the agreement (g). It looks almost angelic and looking through the eyes of a little boy I understand why. She is married to a not better 17 year old who makes fun of her. Terrence Howard was born to interpret this kind of parts. He was good, but I'd like to see him play something different. Markerson, who plays Nanny, is also very good. But for some reason the person who struck me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this Oscar? He has already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and stole the movie. I didn't even know who he was in this movie. He is a chameleon never the same. I've never seen him act badly. This was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me laugh and cry. I repeated the scene a few times ... once because I didn't know who it was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I saw her in roles before mostly mousy stuff. But she's so good here. I know people who behave just like her. So it was very real for me, Macy Gray, who had one of the biggest parts and was also very good. I was very happy not to have killed Nanny. I thought it was dead at the beginning of the film. MA was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People with whom we could know or with whom we lived. Thank God for them, I don't know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who has lost 2 children and has gone through a lot of things but every time I feel selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. This film is a tribute to all those people. I just hope they told us what happened to some characters like the gunman, boyfriend Paulines played by one of my favorite actors on HBO The Wire, Omar, Rosie Perez and Richard lesbian and Delroy Lindo. arm man, he was enchanting in another small role.
