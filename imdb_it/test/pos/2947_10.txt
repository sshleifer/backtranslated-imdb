Fantastic documentary A film within a film. I am so happy that Block was forged after his mother died. Marvels at the time and money spent on therapy. What could have happened if he hadn't had that hold? Did the therapist help her or did she simply fuel an addiction that kept her bank account at bay? The public must understand that divorce was less an option in those days. She was a housewife: she went to therapy instead of going to college or training at work. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist ever tried to convince her to think about what she could do to change her situation and break free? Meanwhile, his wife n. 2 was exactly the opposite. He was out there, working with his father; she ended her bad marriage, supported herself and seems to be a very trusting person. Regardless of the state of the marriage, the Blocks did something right in raising 3 children who could watch their parents' history, get along well and share them with us and maybe take us to start conversations with our parents and spouses.
