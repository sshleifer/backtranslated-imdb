In World War II, America developed a brand new HUGE bomber plane. Lois Lane and Clark Kent go to tell the story when the plane is on its first mission. Lois leaves the plane before taking off. There are also some Japanese saboteurs on board who have every intention of flying the bomber to Tokyo. Will Lois be able to warn Superman? What do you think about it? <br /> <br /> Lively and colorful cartoon. The animation is a little jerky, but much better than any we see today. The color and sound have been beautifully restored. Only two problems: poor music and racism (especially in the title). Apart from that, it's pretty good. An 8.
