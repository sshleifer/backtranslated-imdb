I finally received my DVD today, I saw it and I am pleased to announce that this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of "Rich and Famous" that the modified TV version of the film that somehow entered VHS sometime in the late 90s but, now WB has corrected the error and has it released on DVD complete with a bath scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare ass, and the scene in the hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) in C ** t! It's all there and it looks better than ever! Clear crisp digital transfer, widescreen and special features that include original theater trailers and a vintage 1981 featurette entitled "On Location with Rich and Famous" with cast and director interviews. If you love this movie like me, you will not be disappointed with the purchase of this DVD. Happy to finally have this on DVD ?? It's worth the wait! Thanks Warner Bros!
