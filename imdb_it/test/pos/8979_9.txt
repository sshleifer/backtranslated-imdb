I like Tom Hanks, and he is one of the few actors who will drag me into the theater regardless of any doubts about the film. I worried that Mr. Hanks would return to the "light comedy" as this is the arena where he made the transition from TV to the film - does he remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not a light comedy. Political satire and political satire are extremely well written. The script is the protagonist of this film, and Aaron Sorkin's word processing is among the best on offer this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicols holds the whole escapade together, offering a film that continues to play 90 minutes very fast (timing is everything in comedy, and nothing is ever fun if you drag). The choice of Nicols in the sets and in the lighting is very reminiscent of the 70s and 80s, a move deliberately used to root the piece in the period. <br /> <br /> The return to the use of the working model and digital photography special effects also improves the retro aspect and credibility. Note to the scenographers in the choice of the repertoire material: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG and a Bell and a Hind. But it could also have been part of the joke. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the public NOT to get historical references to their own history. History tends to repeat itself because repeat offenders have forgotten what happened the first time. Congratulations to Mr. Hanks and the chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's script is animated by these actors and the entire production team is at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
