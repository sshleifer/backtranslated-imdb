> This show is the biggest thing that comes out of America since The Simpsons. Not only does he have thousands of new ideas, but he is actually> controversial (see the Hebrew line, Season 1, Episode 1) and is not afraid to "tick" people. However, the great minds of Fox have erased him, along with Greg the Bunny and Futurama, so make sure you buy the Season 1 casket as long as you can. They will be the best money you've ever spent. It is certainly a show that improves the more you look at it, since at first the constant flashbacks can become a bit annoying and do not always seem to fit the story well. However after a couple of episodes you realize how brilliant it is, and how comparable it is to any other show currently on the air right now.
