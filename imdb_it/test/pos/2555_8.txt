Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in studies inspired by characters in naturalistic-style films about the type of small people who pass by every day, without anyone really realizing that they are there, in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have been pushed to the margins of society. They exist in a sort of gray world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America appears rather doubtful. Where they come from ? How did they get there? How do they make it? Where will they end up? These are not beautiful stories as such, but survival stories at the most basic, everyday level. <br /> <br /> Ale is one of these street kids. He has no education and both, however, he can save money, he is not even beyond simple theft. He is mostly anxious to be reunited with his older sister. We see him in the first scenes playing a safe house in search of her, but without having any success. A young friend, Carlos, does a job in a chop shop in the shadow of Shea baseball stadium. Eventually his older sister comes to live on the spot with him, but he is jealous of his friends' reasons and suspicious of how he makes extra money. He dreams of buying a food van and starting a business with his older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani shoots all his films on the spot. There is nothing lucid or hidden about them. This is life as these people must live it, in the raw. It is not cute, even though it is never disturbing, and the somewhat desperate air that hangs over much of the film, is the same that looms over the daily life of these people. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of space and space to work. Polanco is exceptional in the title role, and Gonzalez gives solid support as an older sister.
