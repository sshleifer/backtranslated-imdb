I gave it a 10 because it's the best movie of its kind ... a good old T & A movie in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw this with a similar movie called "Swap Meet" and both were good of their kind ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more tits in this movie than you could imagine for a movie with R-rated. From beginning to end, they seem to continue to appear on the screen (sunbathing scenes, bedroom scenes and, of course, the budding soccer game). In addition, a memorable kissing booth (kiss me, Clutz!) Everyone seems to have fun in their roles (different Playboy playmates, Danny Bonaduce, different television and film family actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to record is that Lisa London's character is called by her surname "O'Hara" and not a good name from the 70s like "Olivia" (or even Ora or Ona or O ...? ? !!. I saw him again in the late 80s with my ex-wife (quite well endowed) and couldn't believe that I was enjoying the movie !! She was probably jealous !! Once again, this film is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... don't think about it too much!
