If you love the tradition of vampires and you're a fan of gothic horror, then you might want to take a look at Soul's Midnight. I didn't know much about this movie before watching it, and I didn't expect much, but I found the movie fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Interpreted by Armand Assante as the vampire leader Simon, Soul's separates from other low-budget vampire films by intertwining the mythology of Saint George and the Dragon in a new fun way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the budget was for this film, but I feel that if it was a little more than they could have been able to hit the gore and the effects at home. <br /> <br /> If you're up late one night and in the mood for fun Soul's Midnight is a good choice for the low budget vampire.
