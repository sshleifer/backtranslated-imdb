I loved this movie! It was admirably moving and fun. Finally, here is a story about a group of people who face some challenges, struggle a little and then decide to be themselves and end up being happy; when was the last time you saw him in a movie? Facing the fluidity of life, love and sexuality, the characters are faced with real problems (even if in situations that are often ridiculous like the male group camping and the explicit relationships of collaboration) and are able to learn and grow without the film becomes a preacher, darkly desperate or too unrealistic. You will love and worry about characters who, far from being empty stereotypes, portray real people with a simple touch of truth behind their potential labels. <br /> <br /> A good romcom for a Saturday afternoon, and the only film I've ever seen where sexual fluency ends happily and no one is forced to be something they don't want to be. Much better than Jessica Stein's Kissing, a good choice if you're tired of watching gay movies that have a painful lesson and a bitter lesson. Or maybe you like a nice English romp? James Purefoy always seems to be on the move, and Tom Hollander is delightfully funny. So go ahead, look, have fun; you will not regret!
