If you watch this movie because there are Michael Caine or Michael Gambon, don't worry, it's not their typical role, although I found Gambon fantastic. Watch it instead for Dylan Moran. I am a fan of everything in which I saw it and it is no exception, I had not even noticed that it could have acted, but also the characters that must pass for itself, as I found completely credible, which is impressive considering that the public knows that it is false. <br /> <br /> The plot is brilliant and although it is not a constant laugh, it has many other spells. A great movie for people with a sense of humor.
