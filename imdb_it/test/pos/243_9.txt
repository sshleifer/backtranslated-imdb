A fantastic musical with Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where he dances. He is not yet a star, but gets a great chance when he is chosen as a cover girl for Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with his grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he immediately takes it for a competition in which his maganzina is running. Hayworth's new-found fame at first makes wonders for Kelly's club, but his star rises so fast and so high that his grip on her begins to falter. This is not the most original of the plots, but the two leads actually make it work. It also helps that the script is fantastic. Kelly is not yet at its peak, especially his peak as an actor. His dance, however, wow. Hayworth is the star, but Kelly supports the most memorable moment in the film as she passionately dances with her own reflection. Obviously it's a take-off of Fred Astaire's shadow dancing in Swing Time, but I think Kelly mounts it, which is hardly believable. In fact, this was the most surprising dance sequence in the history of cinema, except perhaps the An American finale in Paris several years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better. Too bad that Rita didn't sing her songs (well, she could have a couple, since sometimes her singing voice was different). His dance is wonderful, as is the rest of his acting. It's hard not to love her in anything. She is indeed one of the few truly beautiful women of the classical era. Not plastic like many of them; no, you can really see the heat in that woman. His smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers is Kelly's best friend, and he's also very funny. The Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers trio is obviously the kernel that became Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor's trio in Singin 'in the Rain eight years later. One of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely stolen with the number "Good Morning" in Singin '. I think Singin 'in the Rain is the best movie, since Cover Girl is a bit rough. This roughness, however, only adds charm. There are aspects of this film that beat Singin 'in the Rain, and even An American in Paris. For example, the central relationship is more emotionally engaging. Instead of the dominant older man who chases the baby (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers, after all), we have a very nice relationship with two people who look more like each other. There is no run-up, an aspect that unfortunately transforms a lot of the best musicals a bit harsh, it must be admitted. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the beginning, and when it starts to fray, I really felt it. 9/10.
