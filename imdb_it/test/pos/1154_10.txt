Ok, I'm a history buff, and okay, I'm an action movie junkie, so of course this movie is in my top ten all-time. I love the action scenes and unique weapons of the period. I have some doubts about two handed sword fighting, and the Raisuli sword looks more like a katana than a scimitar, ... oh, well, I've never fought like a horse, either. <Br /> <br /> I also love attempts at philosophical proverbs. The typical desert tribe probably could not read the Koran, so they would have believed it on the word. Several writers have criticized the Connery brogue, well, on vacation as a youth, I met a family of South Africans in our West, Dinosaur National Monument, and although Africans spoke to each other (yes, second generation Germans can feel the difference ), they spoke English with a Scottish brogue. It seems that whoever teaches you your pronunciation. Scottish Missionary?
