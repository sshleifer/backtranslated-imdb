To suppose, this film involves two actors (Caine and Moran) trying to defraud a gangster. The plot is rather scarce, as there are several holes in the plot. However this normally should not matter as the comedy should bring a film like this. There are some really fun parts (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). However, at other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the film. The character of Caine seemed excessive to me. Especially in the beginning, he continually quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. You could say he was playing the part correctly, but the character seemed flat and not funny. Overall I would say that I only see if a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise, wait for video or TV.
