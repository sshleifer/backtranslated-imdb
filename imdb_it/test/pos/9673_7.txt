I have all the family seasons so far and I have to say Vol. 6 was the biggest disappointment of all of them. There are still many laughs to be found here, but I think that Vol. 6 like the last volumes is slowly providing less and less laughter. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest annoyance I had with Vol. 6 seems to be VERY heavy in left-wing politics. I am a big supporter if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this Volume really seems to push their political views down my throat and I think it keeps us very far from the show. Insinuated that all conservative states are horrible places, insinuating we need more arms control, insinuated school is under funded, insinuated religious people are crazy, Bush is friend of the devil .. I could go on and this is only from the first three episodes. <br /> <br /> Of course some were fun but it becomes a point where you're not making a comedy and you're just pushing your political opinions on other people.
