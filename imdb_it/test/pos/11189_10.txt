This film stands for entertanment. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen. The lines, the acting. And the clothes, wow, talk about 70: s. If you ever see this little gem, buy it. Worth every penny. By the way, the opening song is wonderful. If anyone knows where I can find it. Plese, send me an e-mail.
