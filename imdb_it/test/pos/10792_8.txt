I've never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I found his films forced, preachers and generally imperfect. The two Stone films I really like are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio takes the cake to be Stone's best result. Stone is a director you're a fan of or you're not, it's safe to say that before watching Talk Radio I wasn't fond of the boy and considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry, although after watching Talk Radio some of the my perceptions have changed. Talk Radio is a disturbing and funny attack on what is now known as "reality TV". <br /> <br /> Talk Radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous and perplexed radio host named Barry Champlain who hosts a controversial late-night radio show in Dallas. Become quickly known for its bold and bizarre aerial presence, it becomes a feeling late at night, in which depraved drug addicts, criminals, racists, sociopaths, bewitches, perverts and idiots call for ridicule in the air . The film shows the rise and fall of a man's career, accurately portraying freedom of speech. Originally adapted from a theatrical performance, the film sticks to the theme of the theater that was originally built around it, wonderfully conveying the fierce nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With fierce energy and non-stereotyped air, Talk Radio brings all the hilarity behind "crass media". Today it is even more touching than it was in the late 1980s. The film explores the study of arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled way how good it is to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, however it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully frank. Stone tries to show how freedom of speech is a crucial aspect in life, but it is something we should be cautious and cautious about. The film raises the question "is our main protagonist the same as the sad people who call the show?" <br /> <br /> Stone fabulously creates the key set-piece of the film (the radio station) with an ambition and a cold atmosphere. Then he manages to capture the isolation, the fear, the ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that accumulate at the radio station. Eric Bogosian is interpreted perfectly as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius, Barry Champlain. It perfectly fits the role letting its jokes escape with such enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, brusqueness and, in the end, the bold hilarity of its offensive nature. The performance is full of spark, which was evidently robbed of an Oscar nomination. His voice fits the character, being a primary element of a radio host and his power to act brilliantly together with tragedy and comedy. <br /> <br /> There is a strong use of editing in the films of Stone and Talk Radio boasts some of its cleanest and most rhythmic works. He uses beautifully controlled photographic techniques, which differ from being calm to suddenly become turbulent. There is a vibrant energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderfully delightful script that works as a central piece to the film's grandeur. Astonishing and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio, capturing the city at night in an impressive way. Not forgetting the incredibly excruciating and yet obscurely funny "spiral to decline", it is ultimately an extraordinary cinema. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is an essential modern masterpiece, I am sure you will be surprised that it is really fantastic. I highly recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in media or movies. Talk Radio is a fine example of high-level, intellectual and insightful entertainment, which still retains a well-deserved wake-up call. Finally, if it were not for Eric Bogosian, the film would not be the fun, delightful and lasting masterpiece that it is today.
