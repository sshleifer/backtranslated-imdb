For a long time residing in Western Pa I have a deep knowledge of this subject and found that REGFRESHING was so authentically captured in a movie! Congratulations to the producers of this epic !!! And what a great legacy for schoolchildren in the years to come. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail and the realistic representation of this complicated network of events make it a unique production of its kind. <br /> <br /> Viewers will find themselves mesmerized by the plot and fascinated by the narrative. <br /> <br /> Grahame Greene is magnificent as the presenter. <br /> <br /> BRAVO !!!
