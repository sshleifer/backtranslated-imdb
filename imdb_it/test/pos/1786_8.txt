A year after his triumphant first special, "My Name Is Barbra", Barbra Streisand met with his production team to produce this special special CBS-TV in a color then revolutionary. First broadcast in March 1966, "Color Me Barbra" follows a format similar to its predecessor: three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the after-hours rooms of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she is dressed as a vintage maid, wanders through the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through the song. In various forms, Streisand expresses a variety of moods from the "Minute Waltz" comedy to the melodrama of "Non C'est Rien" in a painting by Modigliani to the beatnik-style frenzy of "Gotta Move" set in abstract art. My favorite moment in the special is when she turns into a dead Queen Nefertiti player while singing a disturbing rendition of "Where or When" by Rogers and Hart. <br /> <br /> At the opening with another comic monologue full of silly non-sequiturs, this time in French, the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly colored circus medley in which it interacts with animals, including his beloved poodle Sadie. Find an appropriate context for "Sam, you made the pants too long" with a bevy of penguins and compare his profile comically with that of an anteater with "We have so much in common". As for the first special, the program ends with a compelling solo concert in which he sings chestnuts, "Every place I hang my hat is home", "Where am I going?" and "Starting Here, Starting Now" between them. Also included is the brief introduction that was filmed in 1986, dressed in an ironic way in absolute white, when the special was first published on VHS. The juxtaposition of setting and song is even more effective than in his first special, and a 23-year-old Streisand is in excellent shape.
