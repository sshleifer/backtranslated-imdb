I came across this film in the mid-eighties as a teenager and this immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday movies. As can be seen from the other reviews, this film has a very good storyline and the famous actors have signed up for it. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is as big as the bride of being having second thoughts. Even the acting of Dennis Morgan is strong. It goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor who makes Stanwyck away from her husband. <br /> <br /> This is a Christmas classic. The settings and the story create a fantastic Christmas story
