In a small and picturesque Sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young sexually curious boys. The local police continue to try to track down the killer and make the list disappear with five or more suspects, including the voyeuristic village retard Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and a fleeting, grungy, voodoo witch who plays with wooden dolls called Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). There is also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), a handsome young priest who runs the boy's local school, Andrea (Tomas Milian), a journalist who helps rescue the police, and the beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a beautiful, but seriously fucking-up addict who seems to have a thing for a long (I mean, VERY) young guys. As is typical of the yellow subgenre, the plot will not be fully revealed until the last few frames, but if you can stay there long enough, this movie pays. The script (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) reduces herring to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by an excellent geographical position, the cinematography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and the soundtrack (by Riz Ortolani). Even acting, particularly Bolkan, is very good. Fulci fans who were weaned in the grotesques of the 80s like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find here more artistic talent and less gore than they could anticipate, but they will still enjoy a particularly dangerous whip scene in a cemetery (bizarre, but effectively , sings the ballad of Ornella Vanoni "Those days with you" and a long fall along a rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much to reuse it in his film THE PSYCHIC (1977). The scenes of the children killed are mainly off screen (except for a brief strangulation), but the camera does not hesitate to dwell on their corpses. The film was not theatrically distributed in America and, presumably due to some anti-Catholic elements in the plot, received only a limited release in Europe.
