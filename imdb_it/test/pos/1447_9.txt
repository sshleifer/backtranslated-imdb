If you like your movies to tear your emotions away, if you like your movies with a guy you can cheer for, and relate to, if you like your movies in black and white, you have to watch this movie! Look at it from beginning to end, because you don't want to miss a beat. Sometimes it's slow, and I ask you when something will happen, then when the plot starts to unfold, you'll be on the edge of your seat! I know I was! My mother told me about this film because our family had some of the same things contained in it in the film. We loved Frankie, who plays the role convincingly. What do you think of Frank Sinatra, put it aside, in the film, is thin and does not sing, so keep an open mind. For the time it was created, it tells a story that is still told today in homes across the nation, and probably in the world. Please look, if you like older movies, try it.
