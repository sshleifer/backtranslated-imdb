He made one at Christmas to try to bring back a number one song, and now the formidable Justin Lee Collins wanted to bring together the cast members and maybe some member of one of his favorite child TV shows, The A-Team. The only member that he could not get was the late great George Peppard who played the main character Col. John "Hannibal" Smith, but he got a kind of psychic to try to help. He managed to bring together all the members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Captain HM "Howling Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea (Amy Amanda Allen), William Lucking (Col. Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Col. Roderick Decker, the only member of the team to die). He spoke with Mr. T (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus) in an early interview, but was not available to present himself at the meeting. It was really fun to watch him try to find them and talk to them, even though they probably didn't want to, and the meeting, of course, is the big highlight. Very good!
