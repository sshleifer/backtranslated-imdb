This film is one to spend the short time, entertainment, but that could then be done in no country has nothing identifies "the Colombian". Those looking for the arguments of the alleged Colombian cinema or socially and politically correct and what is called "endangers", it is better not to see this film. Some to drug trafficking, or the struggle does not refer either to the farmer and the worker, nor to the wing guerrilla warfare and political abduction. <br /> <br /> The corrupt police is a character who could be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and even the main character, an Argentine photographer, could be Venezuelan, Peruvian or Filipino and the frequent "boludo" in his Parliaments could be replaced by another slang word from any other country without character or story changes. The important thing is that this is a very decent story with correct images and performances. Its quality is almost a TV movie, but a good one. That if a film like this if it deserves or does not deserve support with public funds a bit is a classic "mamerta" discussion.
