You must have lived in Japan for a while to enjoy the beauty of this movie! I lived in Okinawa for over 2 years, and in northern Honshu for 4. Believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of the contrasting east / west mentalities, both from a sporting point of view and from relationships personal. A funny, funny and moving film that deserves better than Americans can judge. 8+ out of 10!
