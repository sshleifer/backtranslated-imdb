Now here is a film that does something that hasn't been done for a long time. It takes about ten different elements with which we are already familiar (Vampires, martial arts, techno beat, top-or-line special effects, etc.), and turn it into something that looks brand new. In what could easily have been simply a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer", Wesley Snipes (none of my favorites since and above all because of "Passenger 57") gives a really good breakthrough like half human / half bloodsucking. It recognizes the internal conflict, but does not dwell on it more than necessary. Makes Blade the deepest character of Michael Keaton made Batman. <br /> <br /> I will say that the only part of the movie that made me a little annoyed was the clich√© of the ever-present horror film of that person that the hero happens to know who understands exactly how to stop the wicked. On the other hand, in a film like this, you have to have it, so it's easily excusable. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, unveiled in the previews, makes a bad villain more than bad for the Snipes hero. He has class, presence and enough control in his little pinkie to teach Al Pacino how to downsize a little. Who would ever think that a comic book would be a springboard for an actor? I sincerely hope this is it. And whoa! where the hell did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? Don't get me wrong, but the prolific actor didn't do anything memorable from "Millennium", and how many of us saw this just for the nice video box? Well, here it is, folks, in a turn of Obi-wanish, as the mentor and father of Blade. And also a good job. <br /> <br /> The quality of the acting is accompanied by the quality of the choreography and the special effects. Accompanied by a throbbing techno beat, the fighting scenes bring back and quickly remove the memories of Mortal Kombat. Hey! He also had a script! I was wondering what happened to all the good writers out there. <br /> <br /> The two main indications for me that I saw a quality film were these; I felt no remorse for paying the full price to enter, any Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon". (wow, how many of those came out this year? Ugh) Also, I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequel, like for the film's ending. We just hope they do just as well as with the first. <br /> <br />
