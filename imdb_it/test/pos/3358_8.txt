I'm a tough fan of Dads Army and nothing will ever change this. I've taken all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I watch them I listen to them it's brand new. <br /> <br /> The movie. The film is a remake of some episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy inside the doors, Battle School and many others with a different edge. The introduction of a new general instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move, especially when he would not have cashed the check (something that is rarely done now). <br /> <br /> It follows in the first years of equipment and uniforms, start-up and training. All in all, it's a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two pitches. One is the fake German accent of the Germans (come one, the Germans cannot pronounce the letter "W" like us) and two the casting of Liz Frazer instead of the familiar Janet Davis. I like Liz in other films like filming but she doesn't take it right in this and Janet Davis would have been the best choice.
