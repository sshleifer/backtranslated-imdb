This film is hilarious. Laughter never stops. Each scene is packed to the limit with a hilarious comedy. Chris Farley is a comic genius and Spade plays his character in a t-shirt. Farley was one of the best slap comics of all time, and in this film (as in all his films) we see how much time and energy he has dedicated to portraying his character in the way he thought fit. "Tommy Boy" is an excellent example of comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
