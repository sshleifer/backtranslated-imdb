The best Batman movie of the 90s without a doubt. This film takes place in a city full of insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Even if the villains are a bit rough, they fit perfectly into the film's colorful but nightmare cinematic tone. <br /> <br /> The performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really offers expectations. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by cheap clothes, this is a Burton-style movie. This cannot be described; Burton is a sui generis director who brought the Batman franchise to another dark level but without forgetting his comic style past. <br /> <br /> Recommended for action film enthusiasts and, above all, for superheroes.
