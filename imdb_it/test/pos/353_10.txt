the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is still the most creative Mario; even more than the super mario 64. the controls are excellent; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphic design as well. the levels are very large, and the good old leaders are back. there are tons to explore in this game; certainly a high level of replay value. I have only 2 complaints: 1: the story is a bit similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty is not very high; even if it requires a little patience. Mario fan: the game you've been waiting for. Casual players: this game is worth more than the buy. 9.8 out of 10.
