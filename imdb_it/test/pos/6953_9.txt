Where Rivers River North is a story well told about the struggle of two peoples to live their lives in the face of "progress" and development. In addition to enjoying the film as entertainment, I also learned some life in rural New England in the late 1920s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has captured the raw beauty of northern Vermont and set the stage, while music has brought the film to life. Very well done for a low budget and locally produced film. I found the character of Michael J. Fox the weakest in the film, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal achieved two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. It saddened me that he did not mention a best actress that year (I assume the film was too "small" to be considered a film).
