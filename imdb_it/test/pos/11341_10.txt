Handsome, emotional and subtle. I watch this film in an art center with a smaller screen in a movie theater with 95% of seniors. I would like a bigger cinema like Lowes to show here. Great cinematography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, it is much easier for me to understand the film. However simple the plot may be, many English-speaking viewers did not have the whole story. Three old ladies next to me continue to peek and have no clue about the movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprised when I said that Mr. Chow slept with Ms. Chen and have a child. He went to Singapore trying to tell him but he didn't. <br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> The Mandarin translation of the film's title actually means a moment or a flowery memory. The phrase was usually used to describe the beautiful and wonderful memory that was impassable and brief. The whole film is practically suited to the title. Not to mention the flowery "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, really a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy in their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talking quietly. I felt a terrible anguish when Mr. Chow was feeling his moment of departure, and Ms. Chen was crying on her shoulder ... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> As much as I like this, Chungking Express still tops my favorite. Anyway, I'll also give this to 10. As a point of reference, CTHD only got 7. <br /> <br /> If you love art, you'll love this movie. Not to be missed.
