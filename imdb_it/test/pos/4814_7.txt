The late director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after he began directing television dramas live in New York City. This film came after the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his film debut as a troublesome teenager with a film-making father, played by James Daly, who does not establish enough of a relationship with his son . Kim Hunter plays the mother, who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The film uses the famous juvenile delinquent corner of the time to tell its story. MacArthur gets into trouble in a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, has to do with a police sergeant, James Gregory, determined to teach him a lesson. The material could easily have turned into exploitative, laughable and sensational, like any other number of the period. However, under the secure direction of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrait of the dynamics of parents and parents. The dialogue is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well. Some scenes with Bissell, like the theater director, and Gregory, like the police sergeant, are a little heavy and dated. However, the performances are uniformly good, which is necessary for a film of this nature and on this topic to be successful. This is an impressive film debut for both MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
