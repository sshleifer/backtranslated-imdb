I have seen the whole season one and I can say that I have never enjoyed a show of this level for a long time it is nice to see a show like this in the yard and hope that there are many coming final season. the best bar can't wait for the second season, as far as I'm concerned, things can only improve as the mills continue to change and rick to turn back his family and how they will come out of the church roof with the acting of this level is easy to see why the show is a big hit with people as long as people like making shows like this I will keep looking at I think it's hard to find an original idea now as so many shows have covered a wide range of subjects to see an original like this it's refreshing
