I don't like Jackass Number Two. Nobody should There is and has never been something particularly saving on Jackass. And yet ... it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I simply can't explain why. <br /> <br /> This new film leaves the first in the dust. It's so funny, so horrible and so wrong. The whole team gives their best - with Jackss in chief Knoxville leading the charge. He is crazy. I love it, but it's crazy. And more power for him. With his flourishing film career he could have sat down and let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he almost literally threw himself into the world of the "Ass" with all his heart, strangely respects me. More compliments must go to Bam Margera, who previously seemed happy to sit down and make sure that everyone around him did more or less what he wanted. Here Bam is not the tormentor but the tormented and it is so much better for this. <br /> <br /> I simply can't say which is my favorite part because I laughed all the way. I have to admit that I've seen a lot of the film in my fingers, but there hasn't been a "real" movie I've seen in a long time and that made me feel invigorated like this. I love them or I probably hate them, the Jackass team delivered above and beyond my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a Jackass number three because someone will die and I want these kids to hang around.
