Yes, this film is another remake. Yes, this film can be considered a chick. And yes, this film is not perfect. However, The Women is a clever modern update on the social behavior of all women, with an impressive cast of A-listers including Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor in chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the female creature out of the world who is responsible for most of the dramatic film, called Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary is trying to deal with her traitorous husband (who is never seen in the film), following the advice of both her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen). <br /> <br /> Besides Mary, there is Sylvie who is divided between her social life and her professional life. You have made the decisions to test your moral and ethical values. Then there is the writer Alex who is a lesbian, with a lot of sperm, but knows her way with words. And finally Edie with four girls and another baby on the way, who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end. <br /> <br /> Together the women live for revenge, rely on each other, and give yourself life lessons. But it is the cameos of Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar, which show the cruel and habitual behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she is tough, silvery, expert, and yet she feels she can become what her daughter will do later. There is Fisher showing how to blackmail and test the boundaries of selfishness, morality and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl, who shows no pity for what she says and who says it. Leachman who plays Ryan's cheeky housekeeper, knows his place, when and where it's needed, and how to deliver a good one-liner. Finally there is MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. He is the only character who gives Ryan's Mary an epiphany about who he really is by discovering "what I want". Despite the scene of Midler stealing performances and memorable quotes, it was underutilized. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie, together the women show the public what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until the time comes when you answer that same question. Face feminism, what it means to be a woman (ferocious, ruthless, bad, aseptic, intelligent, clever, intelligent, shy, proud, ashame, self-conscious, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what women want, because women are as they are. It's fun, modern and not a masterpiece at all. But the bottom line is, it's worth the money and time to see veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women.
