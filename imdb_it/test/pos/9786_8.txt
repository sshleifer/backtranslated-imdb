Milo is a neglected and underrated horror film of the late 90s, but the feeling and atmosphere is more like that of a horror movie from the 1980s. It seems that a group of girls is led to "see things" in the office of Milo's father, a gynecologist, and as a reward for seeing what's in jars (yes, a gynecologist plus something else ...) a girl plays "doctor" with Milo. Hmm, his first patient and he lost her. Now Milo is a creepy kid who always wears a yellow raincoat, rain or shine, and speaks in a fun way ... but it's not all that weird about him. Fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and there is a marriage planned for one of them but tragedy and leaves a girl who comes from out of town with the possibility of replacing her friend as a school teacher, which she does. And then strange things start to happen again. Which of course involve this kid in a rain coat. This is not overly violent or graphic, but it has a distinctive bravado that is not found in many modern horror films, and it is worth seeing. One wonders why it is so difficult to find a good horror movie in this day and age, but here is one that is criminally neglected and certainly worth your time if you check it out. 8 out of 10.
