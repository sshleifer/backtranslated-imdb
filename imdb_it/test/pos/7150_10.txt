I was surprised that "Forgiving the Franklins" did not generate more enthusiasm at this year's Sundance Film Festival. There were times when the projection laughs I saw were so strong that the movie could barely be heard. The film has excellent acting and a story that really does examine wider issues. Know small problems like religion, sex and truth. Many of the comedies seem to rely on the same old and artificial invented situations, many leave thinking "I know they ripped it off a sitcom". This film starts with its unique direction. I really think Jay Floyd did a fantastic job on a tight budget for this movie.
