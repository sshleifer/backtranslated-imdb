I saw it last week during the tour of Bruce Campbell's book. I thought it was great. Almost everything I would expect from a science fiction movie Bruce Campbell. He is camped and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely stupid. The plot is extravagant, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves / brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-KGB turned into a taxi driver. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between him and the KGB agent. The film has all the fantastic slap and humor of Bruce Campbell. The film is quite predictable, I knew that once he killed his wife he would share a brain with his murderer. However I did not go to see this film because I thought he would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a science fiction film Bruce Campbell and I wasn't disappointed. I highly recommend going to see him on his book tour or waiting and watching him on the science fiction channel next month. Although before the film he said the Sci-Fi channel cut a movie to make it TV friendly. If you're a Bruce fan, I highly recommend it.
