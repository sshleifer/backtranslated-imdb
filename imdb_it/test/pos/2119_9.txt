Not all films are worthy of an Oscar, but let's face it, sometimes these types of films are more fun to watch and leave a longer and longer lasting impression. This left me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait to hug my son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what kind) knows how it feels to lose one. I think most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who has grown up since birth. Bruce Willis was great when the tycoon became a good boy and Joey Lauren Adams was as convincing as a good mother. The boy who played Buddy had a cherubic face and his sister and friend Edgar played extraordinary supporting roles. I really enjoyed the movie and it was something the whole family could appreciate. Thank you!
