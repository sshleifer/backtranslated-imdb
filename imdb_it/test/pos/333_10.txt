When I entered the theater, I thought it would be a great movie. And I wasn't a little disappointed. WOW! This film is brilliant! The emotions felt throughout the film are extraordinary! Great acting of Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. Probably this could be the best Tamil film I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has once again shown himself to be the best at making meaningful films. <br /> <br /> This film is basically about a young girl (PS Keerthana) who is looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who left her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (JD Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) discovers the story of this young girl and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this child, but one day he discovers that they are not his real parents and decides to look for his biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way in which Mani Ratnam presented the film is magnificent. <br /> <br /> My vote - 10/10
