*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There must have been something in the air in the years immediately following the post-war period that made night cities interesting environments for films. A group of night and urban films were made at that time, and not only in America. One of the most notable was Odd Man Out by Carol Reed, an English portrait of a wounded man who staggered through the streets of Belfast. In America it was noon, or more properly, midnight high, of film noir. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really film noir, but it has noir traps, even if it uses them for its purposes, which have to do with bigotry. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, it was adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks. The book was about the murder of a homosexual; in the film the victim is transformed into a Jew. Although filmed as a mystery, there is little suspense in the film, since it is quite obvious who the murderer was at the beginning. What makes the film so watchable and wonderful is its evocation of a city, Washington, D.C., immediately after the Second World War, by some of the most gifted artisans working in the movies at the time. Unlike many night movies, Crossfire is set mainly indoors: in police stations, clubs and night cinemas. Soldiers are everywhere in the film, and most want to return to their civilian lives. However, from most of the men we meet, it is perceived that their personalities have been so influenced by their military experience that it will be difficult for them to return to their old quarters; for some perhaps even impossible. They seem more related to each other than to anything else. <br /> <br /> However, some men have never really been joined by anyone in the army. The killer, Monty, is one of these individuals. He feels he has never been connected in his civilized life, either. He is a lone wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he has a mile-wide sadistic stripe, and he always needs someone nearby to be the target of his lines. The man who kills has done him no harm, and was indeed alien to him. But once Monty had discovered the religion of man, it was enough. He didn't really mean to kill him, since it was his intention "to simply" humiliate him and beat him. But since he was quite drunk, Monty's fists got the better of him. It is this act that defines history as history in motion. <br /> <br /> Once the film is built head-on, the other characters are quickly brought into focus. The opposite number of Monty is Keely, another soldier, who, though introspective as Monty, and somehow aloof, has no resentment towards anyone and seems a reasonable, even lovable boy. Finley, the pipe smoker homicide detective, is a bit dandy and a little less showy than men in uniform, but he shows more than one game for the various and mostly recalcitrant soldiers he deals with. The actors playing these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, offer excellent performances, each in a different key. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking for someone to choose; and one can feel his anxiety to become a victim himself. Like Keely, Mitchum is low-key, almost casual; he never raises his voice; and seems to have more things to say, more to offer, than is allowed by the script. Young's performance has often been criticized for being too soft, but I find it deceptively strong and pleasantly unusual. Cut against the stereotype of the hardboiled cop, and make Finley's character a bit of a crime detection prince. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, although sometimes the script is surprisingly well written, even brilliant. Lead actor Paul Kelly offers one of the best short performances in movies like "the boyfriend" of a woman a soldier picks up in a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he may or may not live with her, even though he seems quite relaxed in his apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing is clarified, and this man himself seems more than a little confused about his role, being or should be. In a sense these few scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anomie. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the film are adrift, aimless and practically lost, some more seriously than others. In this regard Crossfire is, for the whole sermon towards the end, a film on the vagueness of identity and the ease with which it can be lost or deformed. Men move from bar to bar in this film, while they engage in a kind of unbridled camaraderie, their personalities blend into a sort of general American male model. Then something happens, something is nailed. A word is mentioned, whether "Jewish" or "hillbilly", and things suddenly become tense, and the very notion of individuality, of identity outside the group, of someone who does not love them, becomes profoundly offensive, even repulsive . Then, after the spirits have rekindled and whatever has put them back together has been resolved or forgotten, men return to their normality as a free and non-personal group, and order is restored.
