William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel prize in literature. Faulkner wrote above all about life in the South, particularly during the years of depression. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers are a captivating tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, travels to Memphis, Tennessee, to enlist as hundreds of thousands of young people, some who would never return home. His younger brother does not take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis with no money to find his brother. Surprisingly he becomes a soldier of another type since he wants to enlist even at 10 years. Ron Perlman makes a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy. This short film won an Oscar for best live short film, well deserved. If it were longer, it could compete with longer movies. Everything else, like the costumes, the art direction and recreating the American era in 1941 is perfect. The film also shows the heart-rending home war as most Americans survive the great depression. Actors and actresses are not known but perform top quality performances. If Hollywood made quality films, I would probably go to the movies more. If Broadway had more quality shows, I would go more to the theater.
