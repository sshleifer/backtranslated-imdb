"Batman Returns" from 1992 was the second round of Tim Burton as a director and once again he achieved success by making this film as dark and gloomy as in 1989. Gotham City is again a dark and dark place with crime and corruption that explode from every street corner.

Kyle has a dark, sexy secret of hers and she's just a real vampire like the sexy and mysterious, but dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan is formed between both villains to destroy Gotham and above all they both want to get rid of the bat. In reality this film, although violent and somewhat vulgar with many penguin scenes, is clearly a thrilling thrilling ride from start to finish, since you can never find a boring moment and your thumb up to Tim for the his exploration of dark and conflicting characters. movie even more interesting. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance was the best ever since no one could have interpreted "The Catwoman" in a better way and Devito was perfect as the "Penguin": her build suited her character perfectly, even if the macabre ones were funny to watch. "Batman Returns" is an exciting thrilling ride that you cannot take away from the spectator's gaze that you will like many times is electrifying and explosive.
