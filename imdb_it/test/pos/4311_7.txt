Well shot, a little uneven, "Nobody" is good evening entertainment. The plot is simple enough: three yuppies get into a wreck with a bunch of strangers in a bar, and it turns out to be a lot more than they expected. The acting is decent and there are some unexpected twists. Watch for the completely incredible (like the 10-shot revolver and the 25-shot semi-automatic pistol).
