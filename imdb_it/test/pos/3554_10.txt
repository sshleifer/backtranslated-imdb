An irritable police detective suspects a French duke of being the infamous thief ARSÃˆNE LUPIN. <br /> <br /> John & Lionel Barrymore participated together for the first time in a film in this intriguing dramatic crime. Similar and at the same time so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. John plays his role with gentle subtlety (when not in disguise) and Lionel is earthy and common in his performance, each obviously with a wonderful time trying to recite the other. Aided by a generous script, the result is practically a draw, with the viewer the clear winner. <br /> <br /> Although overshadowed by the two male stars, Karen Morley is as intriguing as the mysterious woman John finds naked in his bed. Tully Marshall gives a colorful performance as a stupid nobleman with a lot to lose for the crime leader. Henry Armetta and George Davis are very funny as two security guards seriously inept. John Miljan offers a solid presence in his small role as police prefect. <br /> <br /> The film stars will recognize an untrusted mischacer as a guide to the Louvre during the climatic scene that deals with an attempted robbery of the Mona Lisa.
