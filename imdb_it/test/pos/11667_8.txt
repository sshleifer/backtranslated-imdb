"It's easy to kill a monster, but it's difficult to kill a human being." <br /> <br /> Set in the St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana nun who made friends with Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist headed to a lethal injection machine for killing a couple of teenagers ?? Does Sister Helen agree to help the inmate and stay with him until the end ?? an act never tried before by a woman ?? <br /> <br /> In their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both children and asked for his help in a new trial to convince the audience of the grace council to save his life ?? <br /> <br /> The film challenges the public to reflect on the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry grieving parents whose children have been killed, stabbed, raped and left in the woods to die alone ?? <br /> <br /> As the execution of Poncelet gets closer and closer, his character is apparently deceptively complex, having doubts about the correctness of what they were doing to him ?? In a moment, we feel sensitive to ask for a test of the truth machine to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious interpreting the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, children for being there ?? Did Poncelet never understand that he had stolen so much the Percys and the Delacroix, giving them only the pain ?? Will they never see their children again, never keep them, love them, laugh with them? <br /> <br /> In the scenes that precede its execution, the condemned man abandons his terrible fa√ßade and reveals his identity ?? Fortunately both Sarandon and Penn are exceptional here, completing an exquisite and tangible harmony of souls ?? When Sarandon was looking at Penn, was he projecting compassionate eyes full of tears? Do you ask him to visualize it while he dies? '' I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love '' at that moment, did we really believe that she would be the face of love for him?
