Mikhail Kalatozov's The Cranes is a superb film. Winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival, he has excellent photography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova, the only Russian actor to win a prize at Cannes for a performance. She plays Veronika, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and without worries, with plans to get married. His life will turn upside down when the Second World War hits and his boyfriend volunteers for the army. The film describes the effect of the war on a teenage love and on the people who remained and saw their loved ones go to fight, waiting for a letter or other information. It is a portrait of lost innocence. Samojlova does a magnificent job and his character transformation will break your heart. Camera movement is fast with many close-ups, it's a dance machine. The first scene in the stairs is fantastic, but it is not the only one, then there is a scene in which Veronika attempts to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in the history of cinema, the bombing of the house of Veronika when she runs the stairs in the middle of the fire, to find her apartment completely destroyed. Simply fantastic! 10 out of 10.
