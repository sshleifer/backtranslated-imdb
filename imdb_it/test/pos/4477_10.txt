This film is beautiful in every way. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue requires only a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is thin, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning into an animal and mixing that wild nature with the passion and honor of an overbearing man. There is not a single flaw, not a mistake or a wrong time to find anywhere. It's completely perfect, but only if you understand what you are about to experience. It is not a film for those who want normality.
