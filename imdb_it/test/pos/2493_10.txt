You can't watch a movie like "Privilege" by Peter Watkins, a story of exploitation of a pop music artist by big business, the state and even organized religion, without thinking about creatively degenerated products like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears , who sell corporate giants like Pepsi or other poisons for money. Or any number of entertainers, in music or movies, who become instruments of political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. A film like Privilege must have seemed almost science fiction when it was published in 1967, its premise was so fantastic. Today we tend to take approval for celebrities for granted, without reflecting on its more alarming implications. Watkins' vision has not only become reality, but we tacitly accept this reality as "normal". <br /> <br /> Now consider Punishment Park. How Privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is sold to us, and why, Punishment Park requires that we deal with what is taken from us, and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps America, and the rest of the world, if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film. He is already so close to reality, that in seeing him recently, I felt a sensation of genuine and nauseating anxiety. <br /> <br /> Watkins still skillfully uses a documentary-style narrative. While in Privilege some edges of this technique were evident, in Punishment Park it was refined with perfect perfection and without interruption. The sense of realism is exalted by disarming, unpretentious, economic and credible representations by the entire cast. This is the kind of acting that Hollywood has completely turned its back on, to its detriment, in favor of projections of aesthetically perfect images. The cast has first-rate material to work with in the Watkins script. <br /> <br /> Many film visionaries have tried to shake the viewer from their sense of complacent and false security. No one has ever achieved this result with such raw and chilling precision as Peter Watkins does. <br /> <br /> "What seems clear enough now, is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and excluded Americans, like these people, back into the national community, the Administration has chosen to accept and exploit the current division within the country, and to take sides with the one that considers the majority: instead of the policy of reconciliation, it has chosen the policy of polarization ". <br /> <br /> To paraphrase one of the characters, we don't have to call them but because they know what they are. Better than us.
