Meryl Streep in the role of Kate, a woman who dies of cancer, plays her role admirably. No wonder he had an Oscar. In the part shows that occupying and cultivating housewives is as important as their sisters in the business world. And the lesson he teaches about life expectancy and their lack of accomplishment as the relationship grows, this is the most important thing he teaches his daughter. We can expect too much from our comrades. Realize that there are many mistakes and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. This is a gloomy film and the ending, though sad, shows the reconciliation between father and daughter. I give this to ten.
