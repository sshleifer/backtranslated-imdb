I remember seeing this movie when I was 13 and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the movie and the characters I loved. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker), because it made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) she really liked and I hoped they would eventually reunite with her boring boyfriend, Ralphie (Christopher Murray) he ignored and made friends with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love the part when Fred tries to be with Stacey, and I always remember when he chased her through the car. But it was so beautiful. I will always remember this tenderly in my teenage years. I am now 33 and have taken my copy on DVD and can't wait to see it.
