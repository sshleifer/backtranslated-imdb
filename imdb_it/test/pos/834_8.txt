Well, it's a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's films haven't been so great lately. On the other hand, if you are a passionate Van Dame fan you should watch it because there is a huge improvement in the fighting scenes. Also what I really liked is the beautiful music music. I'm sure this will kill time if you're an action fan. As for Isaac Florentine, the director of Undisputed 2, I don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed. I can't wait when one day Van Dame's films reach cinemas before the DVD. Maybe someday :). <br /> <br /> In the end it's worth looking at if you don't have other action movies to watch, this could make your hour and a half fun.
