I remember seeing this 1978 comedy in one of the bargain deals I took when I was looking for a study break from my university courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson do a bit of tracy-hepburn in a thrust-and-parrying style in this featherweight wave directed by the reliable Howard Zieff (who did "Private Benjamin") on the aggressive return of a widow's doctor in game of dating. All quickly thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after his wife died. Upon his return, he realizes he is instantly catnip for all single women in Los Angeles. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief of staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley has to pacify to maintain his residence. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted English woman who cooks cheesecakes for a living and has some concrete opinions about the medical profession, which she freely expresses on a talk show on PBS. Obviously, Charley is in the show's discussion panel, and the sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to standard complications about how serious Charley is willing to become on Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potential cause of illicit death from the widow of a wealthy baseball team owner who died at the hospital under Willoughby's careless supervision. <br /> <br /> It is only refreshing to see such a mature but lively love story between two characters inhabited by actors who provide the lines with the scalpel handling skill of surgeons. Matthau is the usual swinger soloist of the '70s and a beautiful sight that waves with his arms like akimbo in his powerful walk. Far from his heavy award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is as sardonic and charming as vulnerable as the flamboyant Ann, who thinks all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable bravado, while Richard Benjamin provides friendly support like Charley's colleague Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with some nice strokes of the medical profession greed. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
