Denis Leary can really be fun and smart sometimes and he's always nice, but this takes the cake! This show showed the genius of Leary. <br /> <br /> The Job is set in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a hard-nosed detective who is married, occasionally has a drug problem and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. So much that it drips into it. The district is full of funny, interesting and funny characters besides McNeil. An excellent cast too. All the episodes of this show are really fun and addictive. The one liners on this show are everywhere. You'll be upset after listening to them and you'll laugh at them a few minutes later and then some. The cases in which the district deals are something else for the stripper nuns, a hostage situation in the bathroom, and others are exaggerated. This show was too good. The legs could have grown to last many more seasons. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: a fantastic and fantastic show. I miss this dear show. All the episodes of this show are fantastic. Also take belly laughs ... a lot. The ABC made a huge mistake by giving it the ax. Too bad Leary didn't revive the cable TV show. However, I give this show one of my highest recommendations. Truly a unique show of its kind.
