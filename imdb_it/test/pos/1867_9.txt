In short, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The film is less about the pure science of Darwin's beliefs, and focuses a lot on his relationship with his family, mainly his wife, Emma and daughter, Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones gives a wonderful twist as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is able to share the time on screen with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But it's those two who bring the movie. Their true chemistry is evident from beginning to end, but develops transcendence while Darwin is grappling with his demons. The scene where Darwin tells the end of Jenny's story, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, Annie, is absolutely compelling. The world premiere audience at TIFF was enchanted. Bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the best of the year in short order. Equally magnificent is the work of Connelly who plays the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, "killed God". <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly across the entire spectrum of Darwin's pain, savoring every detail of Bettany and Connelly acting. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
