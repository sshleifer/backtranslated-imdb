Utopia, made in 1950 in France, was the last film produced by Laurel and Hardy. With the bad reputation the two have for their post-1930 productions, I expected this film to be terrible. Although, let's face it, it's not up to their "vintage" comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It's watchable and partly really funny! And certainly the plot is of the same standard as you'd expect. Some gags come from their previous work, but considering that this film was their first for five years after their last Hollywood-produced film, "The Bullfighters", the routines are performed with confidence as you'd expect from these professionals . Some scenes are not very much, but the value of this film is that some scenes are fun and, as such, absolutely priceless. I particularly enjoyed the goodnight scene. <br /> <br /> I felt sad at the end of the film. Our heroes are left on their desert island. It is such a metaphor for the truth of real life. Hollywood and the public of the time had given the stars to a deserted island of memories, and that was to become the last image portrayed in the film. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan refused the offer to appear in "It's a Mad Mad Mad World" in 1963. What a shame it was - a color film, only two years before it passed. However, his health was probably not much. <br /> <br /> These guys are probably the greatest performers of the comedy of all time, and although the film is far from their true potential, it is still an honor to watch them appear in the film for the last time and touch the echoes of their dominant talent.
