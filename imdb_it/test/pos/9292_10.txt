This is exactly what Australian television and Australian politics need, people with a sense of humor !!! Well on ABC to support these guys. The show is based on a couple of Australian guys who know how to take the mickey out of politicians or other people in the spotlight. The boys use Sydney as their main base to take a dip in the audience. Keep an eye on the Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr. Ten Questions. The guys who do these acts are the same guys who presented CNNN. If you enjoyed CNNNN and Glasshouse then you will love this show. I'm still interested to know which stunts are real and which ones are simply acting because there are some questionable actions made by the guys ...
