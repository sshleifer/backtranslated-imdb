Nazarin is a kind of saint, he wants to live in life exactly as Christ taught man. But it is too late: now the Catholic Church is in the hands of a rich bourgeoisie, the bishops live in luxury and do not give a Damnation to the poor and the sick. This is why our hero cannot follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow them. So he strips off everything, and on the way to purity, he is joined by a kind of Mary Magdelene and a woman who is attracted to him sexually (the scene between this girl and her boyfriend is telling). In Spain (it was the end of the fifties), they thought that Nazarin was a Christian film! Knowing Luis Bunuel, it was decidedly incongruous: all his work is anticlerical. The lack of Nazarin and his "holy women" towards Jesus is an absurdity. About Nazarin, only brambles and weeds grow. His attempt to help workers on the road is a failure, he is hunted like a strike. All his words amount to nothing. At the end of the journey, he is arrested and offered more neapple than a woman (Bunuelian sexual symbol). Thanks to "Nazarin", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censorship had not had the slightest idea) and to direct "Viridiana".
