I agree that this film was spectacular. The way Jamie Foxx captured, not just the impression of Ray Charles, but the essence of Ray Charles really made the film. His life has made a great story and it's nice to finally be told. I also found a fantastic interview with Jamie Foxx about this role of InnerVIEWS Ernie Manouse on KUHT, Houston Channel 8. Is the link http: //video.google.com/ videoplay? Docid = -3001837218936089620 & q = innerviews + jamie + foxx & hl = it. I invite everyone to take a look, as it gives an in-depth look at what went into his role and his personal feelings about Ray Charles. The only problem I could mention with the film is that sometimes the style of shotting was rather bland, but in the end I think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person, Ray Charles, rather than the film Ray.
