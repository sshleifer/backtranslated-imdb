This film exemplifies a certain brand of horror comedy of a strictly adult type but quite different from the Troma films (with which it shares certain qualities). Humor is raw and ready but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​horrible dolls with evil powers and twisted minds doesn't make you shed your boredom, take the six pack and enjoy the best "Chucky" movie.
