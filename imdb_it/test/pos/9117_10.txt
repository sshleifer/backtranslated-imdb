I was able to see a preview of this film through the UCLA pre-screening program, and let me tell you: THIS FILM IS INCREDIBLY GOOD !!!! I have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the film as much as this. I had a fair amount of respect for Tenacious D before seeing the movie, and now I'm MAD on them. I will definitely buy their album when the 14 comes out and I'll see this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the fence to watch this movie, CLICK AND GO !! It is worth the extremely expensive price of cinema tickets these days, as you will surely be able to burst out laughing throughout the whole thing. <br /> <br /> In addition to comedy, the glorious and divine music flowing from KG's guitar and JB's Voice is awe inspiring. The public is amazed that such beautiful harmonies and incredible riffs can be created together with such ridiculous (and hilarious) texts. If for nothing other than the music itself, this film is worth the admission price. <br /> <br /> With a wonderfully coherent plot that links almost all aspects of the traditional story and the hallmarks of "D", great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some rather fantastic cameos, this film sits there with the best! Go see it !!
