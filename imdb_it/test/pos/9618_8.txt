Five fingers of death: Although the epic Shaw Martial Arts precedents had shown the influence of the American cowboy genre, no one had ever paid such an open tribute as this, especially in the saloon fighting scene. And although Shaw Bros.'s films had borrowed from the Japanese genre chambara (swordfight) before, nobody had done it with such success. I suppose this has to do with the fact that the director is originally from Korea, and therefore brought a non-Chinese perspective to such loans, which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture; but in any case, this film presented real technological and technical innovations in Hong Kong action films. for the first time in Hong Kong, the camera had access to the entire set, which meant shots from different angles, such as the low-angle internal shot that showed the ceiling of a room (the original American innovation of which is usually credited) to John Ford), or the long shot at high angle that allowed the visualization of a large area of ​​land, or the frontal pursuit shot. <br /> <br /> It is true that this was not the first melee combat film of true cinematic substance - which remains Wang Yu's "Chinese Boxer"; but commercially, Shaw Bros. was right to choose "Five Fingers" as the first major release in the West because, one could say, it was the "Chinese minimum" of their action films, that is, the least dependent on purely Chinese theatrical traditions . Although this did not make any impression on the American critics of the time (who destroyed the picture universally), it was not lost in the American public, especially among African Americans, whose culture had always been, by necessity, an eclectic mosaic of elements borrowed and innovation. In "Five Fingers" they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story, in the serious young man forced to make the extra effort to overcome social barriers and betrayal in order to recognize his merits. This seems to be a universal problem for Modernity, but every culture has its own way of expressing and solving it; 'Five Fingers' presented it in a way that many Americans could be related to both Chinese. <br /> <br /> So the film has only a historical value? Certainly not. First, this problem did not go away. Secondly, some of the innovations leave most of the film as fresh as it does at its first release. Also the action is well organized and the performances, even if a little too serious, are clear. The film is a bit too long, but the story covers a lot of ground. And there are wonderful set-pieces, like the comparison of the saloon, the fight on the way to the contest, the strange double final. <br /> <br /> looks definitely better on a theater screen, but still impressive for viewing at home: recommended.
