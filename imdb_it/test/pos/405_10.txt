Note: after writing this review, I see that this list is about TV series and not the original film. My mistake. I thought IMDb was a movie database, not a TV show. But since most people will look for this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not outside ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name with which this film is listed on IMDb, I will leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series, which must have been freely inspired by this movie. I didn't see the TV series and I would have liked it or not, but one thing I'm sure is very different from this movie. This film is NOT like a TV show and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it nor in other famous Hollywood stars (besides Jack Palance, who was very fascinating in his role). <br /> <br /> This is terribly a sweet film that thinks totally "outside the box". It is not at all like a Hollywood-style film, which is probably why (what is a nice word for idiots?) Who decides to market films or has not decided not to market them. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film has captured my heart and my imagination from the beginning. From music (which is only part of the time, so you can't really call it a musical) to cinematography, to really beautiful history. <br /> <br /> A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and quite plump) argues with the other German or Bavarian man she travels through the California desert with and somehow goes with him - she's getting into the car and leaving to look after herself on a deserted and deserted highway in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Find the small and crumbling but charming Bagdad Cafe in Baghdad, California and check in. The rest of the story is magical. I don't want to try to describe this film because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Attention: if you are a racist or you have something against great women you will not like this film, as the main romantic protagonist is a great woman and the brown and red skin characters have important roles and are included as "part of the mix" without any racism. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 10 for originality, entertainment and pure delight.
