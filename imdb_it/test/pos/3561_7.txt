A train holding unionist soldiers carries $ 300,000 of gold, along with a Clayton banker, who is there to see him reach his destination, but is suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda kicks with gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to pull it out of him, he is killed by the soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and will soon be executed. A foreigner dressed as a priest arrives (after the generosity of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold. In return Monetero gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton notices and discovers that something has happened. Soon all three are breeding for gold, but the bank's insurance company and Monetero's band are also looking ahead, waiting for their chance to jump. <br /> <br /> It is enough to look at the opening sequence that you will know about yourself. It is part of a spaghetti western with an ironic style and a sprinkling dependency of many references (some well done) from other films (mostly the trilogy of the dollar) of its subgenus. The lively direction of the director Enzo Castellari is wide and mostly light, but there is potential in many of his grandiose, spectacular set pieces and regular rhythm. For the most part, there are a lot of fights, fist fighting (and lots of acrobatic stunts) compared to vicious shootings. However most of these stunts are very well done and very funny and when the guns are glowing there is energy to burn. The traditional storyline comes close to conventional details, but since there's a lot of connivance and outfoxing going on, the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite sure how it will end up playing between the three. This leads to many moments of effective suspense, smart twists, and a lot of wink, wink. The humor in the starch script is rather cunning. He worked favorably between the light and spicy style, the dynamic frame by Giovanni Bergamini and the soundtrack by Francesco De Masi. The performances are extremely well done and form a surprising relationship. The ironic and trailing turn of George Hilton is as solid as the ambiguous stranger. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a balanced performance like Clayton, which holds up well. Kareen O'Hara does not have much to do, but he is a worthy observer. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide valuable support. <br /> <br /> A funny and spaghetti-worthy parody / tribute that throws a curved ball after another and many "dirty" frivolities.
