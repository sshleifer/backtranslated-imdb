After "Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman" with Alison Hayes opened the doors to women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other films to collect and carry the torch and what else a lovely actress from Dorothy Provine from "It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" to play the role. The downsizing is that the pretty and blonde Provine could be too sweet and innocent to get into Allison Hayes size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with a lot of steaming sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door. She could have taken and done this role to prove that she could be sexy, but the material betrays her. Lou Costello, however, proves he can make a film without Bud Abbott giving him jokes and, in some of his scenes, he even challenges a dramatic role when he doesn't address Gale Gordon as his front man for the gags. Gordon, however, says that all that can be is bold, perturbed and intrusive, very much the same character that he later creates in "The Lucy Show". Charles Lane also has the same role in everything he does: a straight man, and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing at the time, but I would have liked Dorothy to be a little more cheesecake and get dressed and at least allowed to become dangerous. As the main character of the film, he takes the second billing for Costello, who is in the whole film with Dorothy several times disappearing as a secondary plot. The entire film put together cannot decide whether it is supposed to be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There are many good scenes, a very funny humor and a very ridiculous field concerning the rest of the film. However, I like this film because of its empowerment of women; there aren't enough movies out there like this. If this movie had a chance to be redone today, I highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original script. Courtney is at the top of my lists of actresses who I believe can and should adequately interpret giantesses; although, I must admit that if one of the beautiful titanic of Allison or Dorothy came after me, I would go quietly !!
