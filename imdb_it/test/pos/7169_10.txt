A fun and biting critique of Russian society and culture during the transition from communism, OKNO V PARIZH also shows the West in an unfavorable light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (the "window on the West" by Pietro il Grande) finds a magical portal that instantly transports them to Paris. Mamin's film is really hilarious, and just "strange" enough to keep the viewer of the faded films constantly in view. The songs, the dreamlike sequences and the delicious disgusting fringes of the society of both cultures mix to create a memorable and meaningful film. Anyone trying to understand the change in Russian cultural feelings since the fall of the Soviet Union should start here.
