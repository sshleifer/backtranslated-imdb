Glenn Close is back as Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who keeps a family together through good times and bad times. The acting is superb - Christopher Walken (unusually not ghostly) while her husband still offers a high level performance. It's nice to see young Christopher Bell growing up; pity we don't see much of Anna (Lexi Randall, also from a few years older), but the new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was very welcome. And finally, Jack Palance, like the long lost Patriarch Witting, is more than ever handsome.
