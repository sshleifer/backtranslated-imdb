I liked this movie. More than I expected. He has enough action, intrigue and places to make it worthwhile. While I still can't see Mark Wahlberg as a leader, he has become pretty good at being a credible manager and that's fine. <br /> <br /> The superhero of the film is the Mini Cooper. He has proven to have the speed, dexterity and muscle to do any job. And to manage a maniac like Charlize Theron's character.
