I thought that Anywhere But Here was a good movie. The protagonists are two wonderful actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, who when I heard they were in a film together, I resist watching him. Overall, it was a very pleasant film. He had his moments where I felt like they tried to do something hard, and there was also really exaggerated and worn-out material, but there was nothing in the film that I absolutely hated. I also liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited Thora Birch, and all the little happy / sad moments are touching and effective. If you want to watch this movie, go ahead, because even if you don't recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a rating of 5.9 seems unfair in my opinion.
