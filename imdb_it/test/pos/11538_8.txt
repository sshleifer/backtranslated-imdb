I was never really sure if I liked this documentary or not. It was shown on Channel 4 before a shortened version of Revelations and is on the Revelations videotape before the uncut show. The documentary is basically a friend of Bill who says how good it was for an hour with the video clips of the show mixed, a bit like a trailer for the movie you're about to see. Is David Letterman also crawling like a worm for downloading Bill from his show before he died, the reason? Bill made a joke about how the characters of Pro-Life had to picket funerals, and Letterman had Pro-life advertising. However look for the video as Revelations is Bill at his best ranting :)
