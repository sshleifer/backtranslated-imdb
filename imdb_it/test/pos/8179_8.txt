This film is not for those who expect a martial arts show. As far as historical accuracy is concerned, I will leave this question to those who are better informed on this subject. I thought the performances were wonderful. Gong Li never disappoints as the resourceful and (initially) loyal consort of the King of Qin. Fengyi Zhang showed a lot of flexibility in portraying a ruler who goes mad. He chose the "Hannibal Lector" route rather than resorting to annoyance. For me, the best performance was from Zhiwen Wang as the marquis supersmooth. The character appeared very fat, but in a thin "Sir Humphrey Appleby" - Yes, the kind of minister. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the main feature of this film. The scene in which the Marquis and his men stormed the palace was breathtaking. There are also a series of beautiful battle scenes. Therefore, this film is highly recommended on the big screen.
