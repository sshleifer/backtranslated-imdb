[Minor spoilers follow] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen said that topical humor about serious events could be considered acceptable by many on the basis of the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. 1939 before the German assault on Poland was certainly not a fun time and subsequent events, including the Blitzkrieg (following the Sitzkrieg) which brought Germany to the English Channel, caused the heroic evacuation to Dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine France who preached his honor before the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> The stuff of romance, comedy and a great deal of serious drama? Yes. The director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with a well-matched and exceptional cast, creates in Bon voyage a mess of events and scenes of history and imagination that is extremely fun. <br /> <br /> Viviane Denvers (the bow -eyed and beautiful Isabelle Adjani) is the best French actress while the war clouds gather in Europe (which cliché abused, sorry). A venerable veteran with many interests to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be "Whatever is good for Viviane is good for ... Viviane." Following a premiere of his latest film after which a minister in Reynaud's incompetent administration, Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him), signals his interest in her, returns home only to meet wearily an ex-lover who does not understand the word "no". He resolutely decides that problem but then frantically and histrionically enlists another ex-boyfriend, the hungry Frederic (Gregory Derangere), to help manage the chaos in his apartment. Frederic is a waiting novelist. <br /> <br /> A comic incident that once again underscores, almost like a public service message, the importance of working wipers puts Frederic in jail for the most serious charges. Fortunately, the Germans have broken from the their static positions require a wholesale transfer of prisoners in the south of France but our boy runs away, making his way privately rather than as a state ward. <br /> <br /> Panic and fear in France when the Germans won the victory are well represented and a new twist enters history. Who should meet Frederic if not the beautiful young researcher, Camille (Virginie Ledoyen) who accompanies the Jewish refugee scientist, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has some "heavy water" bottles he needs to get to England. Of course, the Germans cannot stick to this vital ingredient to know what (this part is pure fiction - there has never been heavy water in France in 1940 - only Perrier). And Camille is so endearing and devoted. <br /> <br /> And then? Peter Coyote as an alleged French journalist, Alex Winckler. Be informed about his name. He is indeed an officer of the Abwehr (German military intelligence: a spy). And he also read Viviane (and he wants a resumption of their relationship). Apparently the Kopolski type is the only great male character who doesn't want to do it with the actress. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of adventures and misadventures that are perfectly integrated to produce a very fast-paced and enjoyable movie. Partly a tribute and a little parody of "Casablanca", this is an extraordinarily funny film (except for the heavy Nazi pieces). Isabelle Adjani deserves the compliments for the best portrait I have seen in years of an adorable, all-adorable narcissist with little or no salvific characteristics. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to jump the ship and join the traitor, Pétain, is as convincing as a man whose ardor for Viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the Republic. Being a human being in power at a critical time in French history, Beaufort is terribly vile. <br /> <br /> Not shown in too many theaters, "Bon voyage" should be available for purchase or short-term rental. Watch it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
