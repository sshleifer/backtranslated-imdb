Although this film is 11 years old, I just rented it yesterday, and I found it to be a really touching film. The story of true friendship in front of a very real monster is an inspiration and very touching. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't care much about the amount of language used by some of the young actors - especially Renfro - I understand that art is imitating life. Renfro once again does a magnificent job of rough and rough (and I mean MUCH) disturbing bully (his role in The customer comes to mind), and Mazzello does a great job with the witty, slightly eccentric, Dexter - a child who realizes that his life must end too soon. <br /> <br /> While there are so many moving and fun moments in the film, I must say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by Pony in the abandoned church, and Dexter (Mazzello) cut himself , saying that his blood was poison. While it is very enterprising and a bit fun to see an adult man running away from two small children, it is one of the most difficult scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely check this, but prepare with your Kleenex - I'll need it!
