a great film, with a rather unclear political message. is shot in a theatrical style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. emotions run high from western tourists and businessmen who seem reluctant and unable to yield to the mayor's oriental-Russian charm, although he makes every effort to understand their point of view. the two opposing views of the world are clearly made clear, but the film also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. he acted strongly and had a strong emotional impact for a 1950s movie.
