From the first hit of "We're Gonna Groove" to the last guitarist of "Whole Lotta Love", this set of two DVDs could be one of the best music DVDs ever released from the shelves since Beatology Anthology was finally released all beginning of this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is that of disc 1, a whole concert and many TV appearances. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is on the DVD, as well as some of the best performances of the band's last concert at Knebworth. <br /> <br /> In the Royal Albert Hall concert, for example, the band had plenty of room to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed And Confused" a huge rock power ballad in contrast to the relaxed blues song of Led Zeppelin I. <br /> <br /> Next, on DVD 2, is a promotional video for the hit song by Led Zeppelin III "Immigrant Song". One of Zeppelin's most difficult rock songs, the video is as rough as a Pre-MTV video, but it shows a lot of guitar power from Jimmy Page, as it was based on a live performance. At the end of the video, we are treated, in transition, with a short photo of fans filling places at Madison Square Garden. The following are representations that should have been part of "The Song Remains The Same", but they did not make the cut. Both were excellent riffs like those of the songs "Black Dog" and "The Ocean". <br /> <br /> After the Madison Performances, we are treated with Earl's Court. Most of the Led Zeppelin IV material was played here, like the most popular song Zeppelin ever recorded, "Stairway to Heaven". It is brilliant as always, even more than the IV version. <br /> <br /> Finally, to finish the 5+ hours of live material, is the last Led Zeppelin concert in Knebworth in August 1979. As a viewer, watch this, they must admit that the voice of Robert Plant it is always more acute and profound from all the screams it has made in the past, and it is evident here. On songs like "Kashmir" and "In The Evening", Plant does not have his vocal drive of old, yet, in "Whole Lotta Love", he returns for another song. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best music DVDs ever published, only next to the big "Beatles Anthology" box released in 2003. The sound, both in 5.1 DTS and in 5.1 Dolby Digital, just like the DVD of Beatles, gives you the feeling of being on stage with the artists, standing right next to them, as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when you are doing jam in the studio. Although The Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different groups, each of them has received several DVDs. Although this set comes only on two discs compared to the five Beatles Set of the disc, it still seems to fill the viewer after examining all these contents. It is also a pleasure to watch it again and again, not only for the sound quality, but for the pure energy on the stage when Robert Plant starts singing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant effort from the Atlantic.
