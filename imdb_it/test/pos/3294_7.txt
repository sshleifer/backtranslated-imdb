Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. This seems to me rather ironic because in reality it is one of the first films I remember. My mom took me and my little brother to watch this movie at The Garland theater in Spokane when it came out in the mid-70s and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I am going to memory here, but I believe this move involves a hunter accused of a crime he did not commit and the law pursues him. I think it's set in Alaska in the 1800s. A narrator tells the story of the hunter played by Mike Mazurki. Really, this is a great movie with a fantastic setting. It could be compared to the 1981 Death Hunt movie with Charles Bronson. The two films have a very similar plot. The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult-oriented film while Challenge is a family movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both quite old when this film was made, which I find quite impressive considering that this film was shot in wild places in Alaska. This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died, a few years later. Both had been around since the silent era.
