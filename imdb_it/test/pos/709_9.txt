A film that deserved distribution in theaters. This film created for television is a cinematic jewel that exemplifies the technique of Michael Mann with the mixture of contemporary music closely integrated with visual images. Always with Mr. Mann, the amplification of the impact of music is almost as if there was an invisible actor awarded as an academy added to the cast, screenwriter, director and director of photography. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely one of my all-time favorites. Although nothing is perfect, this film comes very, very close. <br /> <br /> In addition to an excellent script, a great direction and a masterful acting by Richard Strauss, there is an ensemble of actors of an all-star character at their best: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face. <br /> <br /> If this comes on TV, sit down with popcorn, turn on the sound for a surprising soundtrack and score and get ready to be riveted on the 97-minute movie. I highly recommend recording it, as it is only available on VHS and DVD from the Netherlands and the DVD is coded by region 2.
