Most of the other reactions from subscribers to this service were very apt, although some found it slow or ambiguous perplexed. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multilayered in its meanings. It can be seen as anti-war, due to the opening and closing scenes, and the folly of fake grandeur, as the cavalry men looked wonderful as they prepared for Eylau's great office, in contrast to his horrible conclusion and disturbing, when we see bloody uniforms, male deaths, etc. - but above all, I see the film as a moral man in an immoral society. Eventually Chabert chooses retreat from the corrupt French post-Napoleonic world and opts for the simple pleasures provided by Derville (who is saved by himself recognizing Chabert's basic decency and the morality of his renounced choice) - white bread, cheese , a little wine and tobacco - on the riches he left to his wife, and the dishonor of her and society. In his case, we can see the film also as a feminist, in the position of women at that time, in which the only weapons that Madame Chabert has are her charm, beauty, cunning and, ultimately, money.
