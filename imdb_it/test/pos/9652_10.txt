This is the best French movie of the year! I saw him twice and found him great both times. It didn't seem boring to me, even though it's very long (3 hours). I am seventeen years old, so obviously I was not able to experience the events of May 1968 that marked an extremely important turning point in French history, but it doesn't really matter since I loved the film. It is actually quite universal: people of my parent age can identify with the characters and so do people of my age. Garrel seems to understand young people perfectly, their way of thinking and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Perhaps because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son) is actually intended to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Well, anyway, great movie, no action (I have to be honest on this point) but feelings so strong that you can't possibly remain indifferent. If you're looking for a relaxing Sunday night movie, don't waste your time with this, you'll be disappointed. But if you like cinema, you will love Les Amants RÃ©guliers which is a bewitching film close to those made in the 50s and 60s by Nouvelle Vague artists.
