Most Hollywood movies seem to follow one of the few pre-formulated and very predictable plots. This film is not and is a perfect example of what I look for IFC. <br /> <br /> There is a boy, Michael, and his girlfriend left him without a word. He wants to know what happened. She's fine ? Can you say goodbye? Maybe get some closure. He was unable to contact Grace and in an attempt to find her he made a movie asking for your help. <br /> <br /> Michael thinks we might need a reason to help him, so he tells us that story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (the girlfriend who she's gone) <br /> <br /> it's 20/20 and it's no different for Michael. By telling his story and getting feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and how much he appreciates what he has lost. This is unfortunately a lesson that we all had to learn (or learn) and it is easy to identify ourselves. This is what makes you want to hear more about Michael's story and want to know if he finds Grace.
