HELP LESSONS is a little movie that creeps up on you. What at first sight seems to be a light and senseless comedy, British style is the basis of a very beautiful story about growth and the need for a meaningful friendship of both young and old. The writer Jeremy Brock ("Mrs. Brown", "Charlotte Gray", "The Last King of Scotland") directs his own script and the result is a cohesive, progressively engaging story, full of fascinating and diverse characters, each played by exceptional actors. <br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, standing alone as a developing actor in the "Harry Potter" series) is a quiet and simple seventeen year old poetic who lives with his bird watching his father Vicar ( Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive, compulsive, rigid, evangelical mother of doing good (Laura Linney) in a house where "needy people", like the deadly transvestite of Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), take precedence over family issues: the mother, by the way, has a relationship with the priest Peter (Oliver Milburn), using Ben as a cover! Sad Ben is, among other things, the attempt to learn to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides that he needs professional lessons. And he needs to find a job to help pay for poor Mr. Fincham's needs. Ben follows an advertisement and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly actress who is as crazy as any other character has ever created. She hires Ben and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip that Evie demands, the two learn the lessons of life that are missing from each other: Ben learns self-respect and self-confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow you to leave its weathered facade and to be the dear human being who has hidden. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, always offering the best acting skills in every character she creates, finds a role here like no other: she is strangely wild and lovable. Rupert Grint is the right choice for the debut of the Ben maturity. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that of the classic film "Harold and Maude". Laura Linney is as always a superb actress who plays a very different role from her usual repertoire. And the supporting cast is a panorama of refined characterizations. This film is a pleasant surprise and is sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love good writing, directing and acting - and the message! Grady Harp
