Chan-wook Park, you have to give it to the boy. In my eyes, he is not only a brilliant director, but a brilliant director who can transform his hand into any genre and often offers something refreshing and at the same time satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thirst is, in essence, a tale of vampires but one that plays fast and free with some of the "rules" of the subgenus. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who selflessly sets up a research program and then selflessly grabs the disease he is trying to cure, dies and comes back. All thanks to the blood with which he was transfused. Being the only one in five hundred to survive, it becomes rather the celebrity for those who know him and all he wants is to return to normal. Normal, however, now involves the possibility of jumping large distances without injury, of wanting to drink blood and getting very hot under the collar when the sun's rays settle on his skin. It is not long before living with a rather dysfunctional family unit that has known him in his childhood and while hiding his strange new lifestyle he finds himself caught up in a complex love triangle, becoming more acceptable to the darker thoughts and slipping on a slippery slope that could take him from man to beast to monster. <br /> <br /> Skilfully mixing a number of genres, Park's film seemed much fresher and more original than Let the Right One In (to use a recent example) and honestly impressed me with his approach to the material that could have easily looked so worn and reworked like any other vampire movie we've seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy, while meditating on ideas such as the strength of faith, power over life and death, the negative side of immortality, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> Some people have complained that this genre The approach to blending weakens the film, but personally I discovered that it was a lively, fun and always pleasant film, helped by a great central performance of Song as a tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast without weak connections. Many characters move through a series of emotions and do it with skill and credibility, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of the priest's love, lust and affection. <br /> <br /> Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and fans of "The Tell-tale Heart" by Poe (look and learn) should come to terms with this, it's another class from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to come up with nothing less than solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.
