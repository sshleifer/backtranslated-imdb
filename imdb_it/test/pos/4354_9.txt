Although perhaps not as fun as some of Herzog's works, Little Dieter is another good film by one of the greatest film artists in the world. Starting from the usual themes of Herzog, Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting study of a brave man and his efforts to continue living after a traumatic life experience. Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Vietnam War gave him this opportunity, but instead of spending the war flying in a cockpit, he spent most of his time on the ground as a prisoner of war . Dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with the occasional help of Herzog. Herzog has a very small voice at this time, but it helps create visually and subtly powerful landscapes, which shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with him. <br /> <br /> Dengler is a charming and extremely nice person. As human and alive as they are, I found the story of his life and his unbearably optimistic personality to inspire. Thanks to Herzog for (re) presenting it to us. <br /> <br /> The film's scale is not so wide, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the first films that made Herzog a force to be respected Nevertheless, I highly recommend it to its fans and those who love documentaries. It is a very interesting and well made film.
