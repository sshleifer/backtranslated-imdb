I am an Australian who currently lives in Japan. I saw this film on TV here and I was very impressed by the precision and honesty in the representation of colliding Western and Japanese ideologies. Anyone who has written the script and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it means to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood was when Tom Selleck's character kissed the woman in the middle of his office and she leaves him. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a film that highlights the true experience of 'gaijin'! 9/10
