Since 'Midnight Cowboy' I have been looking for films with Dustin Hoffman and for the most part I have not been disappointed. Since then 'Kramer vs Kramer' I have been searching for movies with Meryl Streep and for the most part I have not been disappointed. He gave a superb performance, really one of his best, in "Sophie's decision" and I licked it in "Out of Africa". That these two actors came together over 20 years ago for "Kramer vs Kramer" was certainly a good idea: the result is an excellent drama of characters with a theme that is still very relevant in today's society. <br /> <br /> To divorce everyone has a bad time, even if the children seem to suffer more ?????? .. Beautifully managed by Robert Benton in some original direction that presents some memorable scenes: even the passage takes on character and should be included in the time zone! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), simply simply magnificent. How do you get an eight-year-old child? Benton succeeded, and of course there seemed to be good electricity with Hoffman: the result is certainly captivating, engaging and convincing. The performance of Justin Henry must be among the top 5 or 6 performances for children of all time. The best thing, once again, was naturalness, there was no way to exaggerate, so frequent these days. <br /> <br /> This film appeared again on the small screen the other night, although I have had it in my video collection for years: it is still worth looking at and paying attention to everything. About 7Â½ out of 10.
