These days, you rarely come from a children's show that doesn't involve 1) a preteen pop star that's as fun as watching dry paint 2) engage a storyline to find the perfect date with a different boy / girl each time 3) wheel around irregular screams and incomprehensible humor. About 95% of the shows on Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network meet the criteria listed. To put it in simpler terms, everyone lacks good acting, originality and good storytelling. It is as if producers and writers thought that children were not smart enough to understand character development and plot details. They could not be more unaware. Of course, children have fun with laughter and unpredictable behavior (if done at a conservative level and done well), but also because they want to enjoy a story, see the drama and see the people being challenged. They don't want to see people living in an impeccable world where they get everything they want. They know this world is not all fun and games, they know it's not perfect. Everyone has problems and we all have to learn to solve them. This show revolves around that kind of thing. Alex Mack is an average girl who seems to have everything for her brilliant sister, Annie. His mom works in some office but sometimes she is at her parents' house. His father, George, is a prominent scientist at Plant, a chemical company that employs most of the city they live in, Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and teased by most of his peers. His only friend is Ray (but he gets more friends as the series goes). On his first day at Jr. High, Alex returns home not too happy for school, but a truck carrying chemicals from the plant crashes into a hydrant trying to avoid investing it, discharging a strange chemical known as GC-161 , where the chemical mixes with water, covering Alex in it. Shortly thereafter, he begins to develop strange powers like turning into a puddle, pulling lasers out of his hand and moving things with his mind. She also lights up constantly when she is nervous (although we will never see her again later). Apart from her sister Annie and her friend Ray, Alex decides to keep these secret powers to everyone, even her parents for fear of being kidnapped by the Plant, whose corrupt owner, Danielle Atron, has the head of security, Vince, at search for the mysterious GC161 kid. Each episode then deals with Alex who tries to live a normal life as a child and at the same time learns to live with his strange powers. The series might seem like a show for girls, but it's not. As a boy, I enjoyed watching this show because of its fantastic effects and dramas. The producers successfully add some elements of science fiction to the elements of adolescent drama. In fact, some episodes were silent and a little disturbing. The groundless factory manager Atron and Vince are good antagonists for the series, because writers really set them up as a threat and give you that terrible feeling every time they appear on the screen. In addition, the smart move adds David, the truck driver who toppled the GC-161, Vince's bizarre assistant in the hunt for the comic effect, but you also love him to the end. It was interesting to see little Alex trying to live as a normal child, but struggling to perfect his powers. Sometimes you forget that these are children who are fighting against a gigantic institution for adults, because you are drawn to history. The show does a good job of relating to the children by showing Alex that he could have superpowers, but he is still a child and must be careful. Even in some episodes you will find yourself destroyed by Alex's calamities. My favorite episode in which Alex wishes he was never born really shows most of these elements. As I said, the producers have never hesitated to add a few laughs, whether they come from Ray's jacket or from George's strange habits or from David trying to be a good boy. Of course, you happen to come across trivial moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the plot of the series, but what good series isn't it? All in all a great show. 9/10
