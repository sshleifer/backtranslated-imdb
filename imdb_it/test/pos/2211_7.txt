We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. His idiot-savant sister recited original poems, which are making the community passionate about writing about her sister. Unfortunately, it's the poetry of Evie. While the mother returns to be happy and the boy next door shows her interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is. For a person so brutally honest who doesn't mind telling the Ivy-league guys that he doesn't respect them, it would seem strange that she would be able to come up with a lie. For someone so happy and cheerful, it is quite emotionless when it comes to certain problems. These are not character flaws, they are a development of the plot, and they mean much more than they initially seem. <br /> <br /> Mostly this is a bit of a melodrama: a mind character, the personalities of the other characters push them through the drama while the relationships are at risk. But in terms of writing it is very fresh and bold. Acting helps writing very well (perhaps the idiot-savant sister could have been interpreted better), and it is a real joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Direction and cinematography are not so good. They are acceptable and the world of Evie is wrapped in colors and light, which makes some images very beautiful, but it is not very consistent. It is not so much a defect as a result of a low production value, but within that same value there is a true storytelling and a real care for the characters. So, even if it's not a perfect movie, it's certainly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
