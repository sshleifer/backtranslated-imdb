CONTAINS "SPOILER" INFORMATION. See the other film by this director, "Earth", at some point. It's a better film, but this isn't just different. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist view from an Indian director. Tradition, rituals, duties, secrets and the representation of strict sexual roles make this experience of cinematic vision engaging and culturally dynamic. All married characters lack the "fire" of the double bed with their spouses. A husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual "adultery" giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife is alone and wants the intimacy and tenderness she finds at the end with her closed lesbian sister-in-law who comes to live in their home with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese mistress, but was forced to marry a lesbian (without his knowledge). They just had sex once the closet lesbian wife loses her virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives at home and eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers. Another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or take care of herself due to a stroke. However, he uses a bell to communicate his needs and his displeasure with family members. He lets them know through his bell or beating his fist that he knows exactly what is happening at home and how much he disapproves. <br /> <br /> In the end, the truth about all comes out and the two women lovers end up running away together. But not before there is an emotional scene between the drug addict husband and his heterosexual ex-wife. His sari catches fire and at first we think he will die. However, we see the two women united in the last scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The writer / director of this film challenges the traditions of his culture, but shows us individual human beings trapped by their culture and genre. We really come to worry about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes. Everyone surprises us with their humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
