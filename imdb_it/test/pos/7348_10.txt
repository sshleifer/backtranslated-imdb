OMG, it's seriously the best show in the world. Harder rock than Jackass and CKY and it's so fun and fun. I love the show. All 5 seasons are fantastic but for a brief summary: Season 1: - Great if you want to plan a treasure hunt, watch the house be destroyed and have fun seeing Phil bing hungry. <br /> <br /> Season 2: - Great if you want to see them buy Castle Bam, watch a slayer concert, discover the wonder that is Mardi Gras and the fun of coming to this, seeing a demo derby and actually seeing the creation and opening of a Tree Top Casino. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Great if you probably want to see the first Driveway Skatepark, a civil war, Johnny Knoxville, a pirate ship and Don Vito actually winning one of Bam's reindeer games. <br /> Season 4: - Fantastic if you want to see them in Europe, get them Jobs, build a state and a bayou and The Dudesons Season 5: - Fantastic if you want to see them in Brazil, Ape's birthday, Mike Vallely, The Metal Mulisha, Bams Lambo disappears, Bams Hummer is destroyed, a playboy party in the bams pool and the last ever Viva La Bam :(
