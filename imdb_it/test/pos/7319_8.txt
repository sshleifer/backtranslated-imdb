Although I'm not a big fan, I'm a Three Stooges purist. I think their best work, by far, was with Curly as the third Stooge and their first films are generally the best. This is because after a while they started redoing their films and the gags started to become stale. Here, in 1934, they were still pretty cool (more than one way) and fun. <br /> <br /> Here the boys play very unlikely roles: respected doctors in a hospital! The three behave in a silly way, they hit each other and scare the pants to anyone who expects to improve. Endless energy and freshness make this a must-see for fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, although I liked this movie, I STRONGLY suggest you to try to find a much less well-known short film from tiny Educational Images. NIFTY NURSES is very similar to MEN IN BLACK, but it can be more fun and it is the best hospital comedy of the time - better than that of Laurel & Hardy's COUNTY HOSPITAL.
