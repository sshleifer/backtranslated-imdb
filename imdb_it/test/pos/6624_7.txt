After seeing Ingmar Bergman's Skammen, I had many feelings, but above all, I felt dissatisfied. I've heard so much about this movie, but I've come to find it lacking. Don't get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of a film like that, but as far as depth and emotion go, I wasn't so impressed. I found the characters unpleasant and unrealistic, which penalized the dramatic effect. Furthermore, the fact that the war was fake led me to think that the emotion was not real. The dramatic war films, in my opinion, are much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. I find that of all the films that try to show the brutality that this falls in the middle with regards to effectiveness.
