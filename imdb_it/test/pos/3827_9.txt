To start, this is my favorite operating system. <br /> <br /> In addition to StuOz's critical comments, I will add others: Obtaining technical information, when the Enterprise fires its photons to a blind target, should be mighty close to direct hits (I think) in order to cause to any disturbance much less damage to the Romulan ship with the emptiness of the space with which to struggle. <br /> <br /> of a problem with the Romulan commander who questions his belief in the Romulan "protocol" or his leadership, unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone ) that I am not at war. Also, I don't think the Commander falls in love with the basic or simple tactics that Kirk played, like "playing to death", or falling in love with the trick that the subordinate inflicts or not on to attack the Enterprise when it's on the Enterprise: I'm surprised that after seeing the Romulan ship's method of attack earlier, that Sulu would have said, "Are they giving up?" when it attacks the Enterprise for the first time. <br /> <br /> Funny how Spock can only perform repair on weapon control just when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Even in the final attack, I thought the Romulan ship was afloat too long (so much that Spock could run down a couple of corridors and return to the weapons room and activate and fire the torpedoes photonics. At this point I would have used phasers, but I'm sure it has to do with technicians and the budget). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: it's a good drama played on the Romulan ship, in which we introduce ourselves to the Romulans. Great scenes with Stiles that tells a good part of the human knowledge of the Romulans. Even his conflict with Spock is right there. I wanted the character of Stiles to stay on the show for a while, if only for the energy he added. <br /> <br /> It's just for fun that I point out the negatives and jokes, (I'm sure there are others). But for me this is as good as it gets !! "Balance of Terror" is always what I put at the top of my ST rankings.
