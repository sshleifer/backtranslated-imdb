I think Josh Duhamel is great !! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but I think the beautiful and sexy Josh Duhamel makes the show "Las Vegas" really fun to watch !! In the days of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth !! A piece on a TV show is a must because women enjoy watching something, especially just for harmless entertainment purposes !! I would have done everything to "Win a date with Tad Hamilton" !! Josh Duhamel is amazing and I will always have a crush on him !! Josh is definitely a HUNK !! and I'll watch "Las Vegas" all the time, Josh Duhamel is a big reason why too !!
