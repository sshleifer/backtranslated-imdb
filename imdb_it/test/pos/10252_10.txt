Cooley High was actually a drama with comedy moments. It was a reflection of high school life during the day. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, DC from 1976 to 1979, and much of what was in Cooley High was a daily thing at Coolidge. In fact, after the movie was released, everyone started calling Coolidge "Cooley High". Becoming tall, shooting dice, chasing girls, basements and battles, this sums up high school life for many in D.C. during the day. I can't forget Motown because Motown's music started and ended many days ago in the 70s. Successes kept coming. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humanity above the madness because when all was said and done just like in Cooley High my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and living every day at most from the homeroom to the seventh period. Thirty years later we are preparing to celebrate those good times. Cooley High is certainly a vintage piece that improves with time because it likes it or not the only thing left over from those days are the memories, some good and some bad.
