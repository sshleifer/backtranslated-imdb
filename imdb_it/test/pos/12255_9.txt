If you haven't seen this movie from the late 1980s in the Washington Bureau of a Network News station, I highly recommend it. It is a sad comment on the direction of the news that they bring back to this country, but tells the story with wit. The characters are well developed and the performance of Albert Brooks is fabulous. It offers all its jokes with fun minimized comedies. I'm not a fan of Albert Brooks at all so this was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and advised me that this is close to reality, so I congratulate the writer and director for doing their research. <br /> <br /> Funny movie with lots of insights on the World of Network News. It's not nearly as dark as another film that I also recommend in the same "Network" genre.
