It is rare for a film to drag you away into its world and leave you wanting more once the credits come out. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a film. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wants to become human. She swims ashore and is found by a boy named Sasuke who promises to take care of her. Course Ponyo's father, an ecologically obsessed sorcerer named Fujimoto, tries to prevent Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature, which eventually turns when Ponyo turns into a child, causing a huge typhoon. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is a very rich film. It is full of wonderful imagination, adorable characters and a genuine heart. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here is to tell a simple little story, and while doing so he creates an authentic cinematic magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is an enchanting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. Even the environmentalist of Miyazaki is still so evident in this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows the dirt and grime falling into the ocean in an almost surprising light, not to mention the fact that Ponyo's father is engaged in an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. While the plot is simple, Miyazaki manages to add this further level to provoke thought with expert competence. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful work of art, each hand-drawn cell looks like a wonderful pastel painting. The film has a very different appearance compared to many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the art is still spectacular like never before. The underwater scenes are simply beautiful to look at, the Fujimoto fortress under the sea is very creative and the sequence in which Ponyo crosses the fish that jumps into the typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic. <br /> <br /> Corso is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that make this film a memorable experience. Sosuke is a guy who acts older than he actually is, and the energetic Ponyo is a laugh at the minute. Each character is so pleasant and memorable. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is a wonderful experience, enchanting in every single way. While the film can be sold as a children's fairy tale, I believe that many adults will be wiped out in its fantastic world with their children. While the film may lack the density of some of Miyazaki's previous work, he keeps it pure and simple, true to himself, offering a fun, moving and fun movie all in one. This is a magnificent film. <br /> <br /> Give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!
