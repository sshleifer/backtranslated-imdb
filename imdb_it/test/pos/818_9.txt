This film essentially contains all the elements of a great exploitative movie of the 70s, except that it was made in the late 80s for the direct video market. <br /> <br /> You have a young couple in love, but the whole world is involved in crack or group violence. When the boyfriend goes to prison, the girl ends up being vulnerable to all the criminals, who are all in this movie except for the policemen. First it is hooked by a croupier and then because it owes money to Jim, Jim Brown, it becomes Brown's property. So it's basically reduced to military-style slavery to which the film takes its name. <br /> <br /> As if this were not enough reason to watch this movie, you also have Anthony Geary who plays a seemingly conservative school guidance consultant. , but it's really a big crack dealer. In a squalid but exhilarating scene, he demands sexual favors from the heroine because he has no money for a correction. In an earlier scene it was established that he is his advisor. That scene is another in which Jim Brown forces her to take a hot hot shower because it smells of hysteria. Lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good in this movie. Tarantino, bring it back. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino is a big fan of this. It has the right mix of comedy, action, sex, romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's evil turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great villain of the 1980s, Wings Hauser in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be an Oscar movie where you can recognize performances like this. Meanwhile, we hope that modern DVD movie directors will learn to use the same type of language in an ironic tone.
