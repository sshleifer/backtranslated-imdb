The saving grace of this film is its humor. Playing to the strengths of their star, Warner Brothers launched their version of General Custer as an arrogant, aggressive, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected tension of idealism; it was Robin Hood again and Flynn had blossomed into the role. All his best action photos took advantage of his talent for mischievous and comic timing, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite a previous agreement to break the partnership; the part of the strong Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet types of love interest that she had grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later films, and after seeing the script she specifically asked de Havilland to be chosen to do justice to the part. In this final collaboration, she accumulates all her considerable acting skills in what is basically, a wild adventure movie, and the chemistry of the screen comes back on - for once, she and Flynn have the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romanticism in an old married couple, with the same winning effect. <br /> <br /> The Flynn / de Havilland pairing and the comedy streak are what provided the durability of this film, when most of Flynn's other Westerners - held in such affection by the contemporary American public, although presumably not from their star, they have long been forgotten. The action scenes are fairly superficial (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed positions) and the villains of the piece are revealed, like a schoolboy, like the same people who were horrible to our hero on his first day at West Point, and therefore continues to frustrate him during his career. It reduces the cast list, but it's a bit too morally convenient. <br /> <br /> However, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that has never turned out to be more than an exciting piece of entertainment. Skilfully helped and supported by a group of supporters (including, memorably, Anthony Quinn in a wordless role as Sioux leader), Errol Flynn makes his way galloping through the plot for his usual arsenal: deliciously embarrassed looks, unexpected sweetness , mischievous sparkle, flash point indignation, cheerful communion and pure high-octane charisma. He's a reckless braggart, but you can't help but like him. And it's hard to get away without the "Garryowen" melody intruding between your ears for many days thereafter. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's lasting successes; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amusement, and is a film worth remembering.
