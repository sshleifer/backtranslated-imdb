I've been away from Istanbul for the past 10 years. During that time I lived constantly in London. When I saw the film, I realized how Istanbuler I am. I'm not just from Turkey, but I'm part of Turkey. One of my parts is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. Probably Faith Akin thought he had made a great musical documentary, but I have to say that it is more than that. It's about putting a nice mix of music, cultures, approaches, politics, very different ethnicities in a delicious dish ... <br /> <br /> As we all know Turkey to be precise Istanbul is always comes and goes between be eastern or western city. As one of the band members said, Istanbul is a bi-cultural city. But much more an eastern city because we have always tried to be a western city. Show that we've never had one. <br /> <br /> This film will capture from the first second. The music is excellent, the people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, band members! It's nice to see you all in a small movie theater at Wood Green.
