I remember watching this series eagerly every Saturday night. It was the highlight of the week. I liked everything, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have their album Legend). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed by leaving the creation of another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of different robins in the Middle Ages. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was full of young actors, I'm sure Robin and his men would have young people, after all those people didn't live so long in those days. The other Robins always seem too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent seemed Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the end, it is a pity that they could not at least make a special to bind all things and give a happier ending.
