I knew the premise of this film, and of course I can't miss a good live movie, especially from the "Master of Suspense" director Sir Alfred Hitchcock. In practice, tennis champion Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets the eccentric stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train traveling from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "suggests" to exchange murders. Obviously Guy didn't take it seriously, until, of course, Guy's wife, Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott), was found killed in an amusement park. The boy is the main suspect and Bruno continues to "slam him against" reminding them of their "plan" and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead This investigation into the murder and stalking of Bruno is threatening his tennis career and his relationship with the senator's daughter Morton (North by Northwest's Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Ruth Roman) Bruno realizes that Guy will not do his murder, so he decides to place evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty, Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter in the amusement park After his tennis match, Guy and Anne (who obviously discovered the "murder" plan) run towards the amusement park to stop Bruno, and argue over the out-of-control carousel, with Patrici also starring to Hitchcock (the director's daughter) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John as police captain Turley and John Brown as prof. Collins and Hitchcock's cameo. boarding train carrying a double bass. Some interesting dialogues and interactions between characters, some good moments of suspense and, of course, the unforgettable carousel finale, a good classic movie. The Oscar for the best photograph has been nominated. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was the number 75 in The 100 greatest pop culture icons, the film was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!
