I'm amazed that of all the reviews I've looked at no one seems to have noticed one of the main points of this film, or at least as I've seen it. It looks like a great homosexual fantasy, dressed in the field, a glorious naked Ferdinand, a defined sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero, and as a final climax, a group of men in a tight sailor suit dancing the hornpipe. The whole approach, once you are used to it, offers you all sorts of fantastic scenes and images. The sight of an innocent Ariel brought to a disgusting naked Sycorax to perform "his terrestrial and abhorred commands" is one of the most obscure I have ever seen in a Shakespeare film. However at the end of the film I was tired of the style and the last hornpipe dance was too much to take. Still overall it is an interesting interpretation of the game.
