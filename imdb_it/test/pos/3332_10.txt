These comic writers are relentless with their trivial (and amusing) word games. The first shot we see here is an island prison with the following inscription above its large gates: "Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose". Inside the prison, the first sign we see is "Welcome: sit down". They then show an electric chair. <br /> <br /> Corny gives way to a clever one, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With the pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then flees through it! In no time, he crossed the United States, shuttled through Canada and is in the northern part of that country. That's where we see the Canadian Royal Mounted Police and, of course, our hero Droopy, known here as "Sgt. McPoodle". He is in charge of capturing Alka-Fizz's at-large criminal. So, with his trusty little blue horse, he goes out into the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf. <br /> <br /> From that point, we get the normal story: Droopy is always one step ahead of the wolf, no matter what the latter do .... and both characters are involved in some wild and very gag fun. Droopy even comes out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. There is nowhere the wolf can go - or do (plastic surgery!) To escape the intrepid "Sgt. McPoodle". No one in the history of cartoons has perhaps even more exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his nemesis! His screams, his face and body lying horrified each time are a big part of the gags of sight. <br /> <br /> You would think that this one-line comic would become monotonous but it is not. These are more beautiful things than Tex Avery and the gang, just one of the 24 cartoons on the "Complete Theatrical Collection" DVD with beautifully restored images.
