A gem of a British comedy. The poor American schlub Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, who plays another villain but this time adorable) comes out of an English jail and tries to go straight, but his job as a maintainer in a bank is too attractive for his ever reformed criminal , directed by a very bad Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the recall of all that money is simply too much for him. Things unravel and reravel and it's all joyous to watch. Jordan must have played 20 villains in his career, but never played the same twice - this is simply too lovable to hate. Niven has never played a bad boy, oil everywhere. Two good actors we lost and I wish we had back.
