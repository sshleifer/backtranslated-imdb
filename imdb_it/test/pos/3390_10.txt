Shelley. <br /> <br /> Based on the successful novels of John Jake, "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell", this was a mini television series from 1985 to 1987. Its success is more due to the success of "Roots" than similar soap operas of the era of civil war / slavery television about a decade earlier in the 70s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time was making many films like Dirty Dancing that would make him famous, interpreters of Orry Main, a young man born in South Carolina plantation who leaves for West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read) who should be the hated enemy, Yankee North, but with which he is closely connected. Soon, the Mains from the South and the Hazards from the North will become friends despite the turbulent era that leads to the civil war. The theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing even when the nation was falling apart is the heart of this soap opera, otherwise full of action and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell, the grumpy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil of Ashton Garber is fun to watch on the screen. All that It's about Jakes novels, what we see is a condensed version of this and they changed a few things to make it a sort of love story with attached history lessons. The characters meet up in all the Civil War scenes: Harper's Ferry where the abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, the former slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are aware of the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) to fight the war in his conscience, we meet all the leading players including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis Several veteran Hollywood actors of the Golden Era - Robert Mitchum, E lizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha the villand have cameo and it's interesting to see them. This is not historical fact, it is historical FICTION and purely dramatized entertainment. But it has cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, customs and places. It's like watching an epic movie that lasts longer than Gone With The Wind with war scenes! The script can be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. Swayze talks about it like Terri Garber does but some performances, like that of Kirstie Alley, James Read (like George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes while the beautiful and strong Madeline are really good performances. They have filmed in sets and in places in the South. The music is enchanting and this is a quality film in which we are rooted for the good guys and we look at the scheme of the bad guys and in the end we get their comeuppance. All fans of the Civil War movies and Jakes novels should watch it. It is available on DVD and VHS.
