I don't have a really solid thesis here, so I'm going to throw in some comments. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is absolutely beautiful. It is shot in high contrast black and white, and some scenes are so well composed that they are almost distracted. <br /> <br /> There is a sequence at the beginning of some intense protests, and some of the shots were surprising - three boys firing tear gas at demonstrators, etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think one of the biggest signs that this is a recent film that looks back to the 1960s is that it really is about how the idealism of the revolution has changed and has turned into something different. The interpretation of this change is really interesting - I think that both the political and the artistic and more self-indulgent phase of things have strengths and weaknesses. The film does not necessarily take the position in which things are ruined. <br /> <br /> Third, I think the romance works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, really, really, I really hated the ending. He was too melodramatic. It could also be said that the ending is unworthy of the film that preceded it.
