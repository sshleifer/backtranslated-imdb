I'm considering this rather high just because of Sam Elliott. I could have done without female nudity, but I'd like to make any nonsense to see Sam fit his stuff. He must unleash wonderfully cynical cynicism, many of which I agree with, and it is a joy to see him in a role where he actually emulates instead of just frowning and looking as manly as he can be. My boyfriend said that this film is in a couple of ways similar to a movie in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the strict sense of the police of the term!) Who was a bit too demanding to test himself. You can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like Sam, you will like it. You could say I'm biased, but who isn't? I would buy it on DVD in the blink of an eye!
