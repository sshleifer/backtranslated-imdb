You can't help but admire Hitchcock's early work. "Saboteur", for example, is so bright and fast that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. There are some elements of propaganda but they are intertwined in the mystery so well that it sounds wonderful years later. You also have some previews of things that Hitchcock would do later - how to use a national landmark as a background. This time it's the Statue of Liberty. In "North by Northwest", of course, is the mountain. Rushmore. You will also recognize the things that appear later in "Rear Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but we will not give away the show. Robert Cummings is excellent as well as the oh-so charming Otto Kruger. Look for the Hitchcock mini-western in this. It happens quickly so don't blink.
