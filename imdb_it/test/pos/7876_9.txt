My second favorite movie of 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was completely rejected by a lot of idiots, calling in a piece of garbage. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is incredible as the hard worker who has some problems with the new generations. He's a scary guy, but he has a great imagination and is very funny. I was a young liberal when he was released, but as terrifying as Joe was, he also broke me! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a fox full of mixed stone. The Queens dinner scene is exhilarating and insightful for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This was NOT an exploitative film and the script (which was nominated for an Oscar) should have won that year. The director never has enough money to make it quite credible in Hollywood. No matter your political persuasion, then and now, you will like someone in this film. A clear 9 out of 10. It's on DVD and video. Check it out!
