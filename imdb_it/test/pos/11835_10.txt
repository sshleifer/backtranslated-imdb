This delightful film, well written, is based on a New York theatrical work bearing the same title in which Sir Aubrey (named knight Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) gave rise to the role he plays in the film. Here, in 1931, we see him in the first part of his acting renaissance in the very first "talkie" era and in the role of the character that he would have made his own until his death in 1948, after finishing his last performance in Little Women that published in 1949. <br /> <br /> This engaging game is about an elderly British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them, after bringing them to his manor in England. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies plays her daughter by mistake and is a tour de force for her. She is at the same time captivating, impatient, superficial, charming, wise and compassionate as she creates an indelible and seductive character that remains well hidden in memory. <br /> <br /> The 26-year-old Ray Milland appears here in a small but the leading role has already appeared in seven other films, only for a little over two years. <br /> <br /> The film should be appreciated as a representative of the production of a 1931 Hollywood factory and as such is not impeccable. However, it is a fascinating pleasure from the first to the last scene.
