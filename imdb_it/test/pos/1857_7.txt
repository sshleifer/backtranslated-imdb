Last year was the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species", so it is right that Jon Amiel's "Creation" has been published. The film focuses on the period of Darwin's life (Paul Bettany) as he wrote his famous work, and the mild tension he put on his family life. <br /> <br /> I think the film exaggerated with Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt for his late daughter Annie, but I still like the thought of Darwin's theory that works like a karate hit on religious dogma. As it was, the United States was one of the last countries in which "Creation" found a distributor, due to the debate on the evolution of creationism (yes, it is still ongoing). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it in the same way that I recommend "Inherit the wind". I hope that one day the debate on the evolution of creationism will not be a problem. If this film helps put the debate to rest, then more power to everyone in the film! Also played by Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
