The first part of the film takes less than 90 minutes, so the film really doesn't have time to get bogged down in the plot. It turns everything around and that's it. Subsequently the film has some great action sequences so that we move towards the edge of a place. Finally the film has a stellar cast that includes Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne. He is a first-rate cast who sells and covers the stories. <br /> <br /> This is not brain surgery, it is a popcorn movie and at that level it has a very high score. It's worth a look.
