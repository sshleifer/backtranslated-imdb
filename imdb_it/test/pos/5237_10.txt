If you ignore the technical problems of this first film (1930) such as the sound quality and the occasional rigidity of John Wayne, you will find this film a more realistic epic than almost all the films made since then. Starting in Missouri, a large caravan of Conestoga wagons, people and animals head west. The floats are cut down by huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risks for the riders in the carts. Indians meet with Wayne and allow the train to pass through their land. Later, Indians gather west of the train to fight them. The wagons form an enormous circle with horses and cattle in the circle, and they shoot with their rifles, creating with the Indians who are circling a veil of smoke. <br /> <br /> When the battle ends, the dead are buried on the spot and the people and carts depart. This scene is remarkable, since the camera stays with the dead while the living move away. It is unique in the way it connects the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer live. The wagons encounter a large thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere. Finally they arrive at their destination near a redwood or redwood forest in Oregon. The film is in 70 mm widescreen with a 2.0: 1 ratio (in 1930!). <br /> <br /> I did not mention the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and enormous amount of work involved in making this film. Video game producers will never work so hard to make a movie or a movie like that. Given the technical limits of sound, music sometimes moves, for example when Wayne leaves his girlfriend to hunt down his friend's killers and eventually. <br /> <br /> While all the critics talk about The Searchers and Wayne's psychology, racism, irascible temperament and complex characters, The Big Trail gives us a story of simple people who encounter extraordinary difficulties. One of the best westerns I've seen.
