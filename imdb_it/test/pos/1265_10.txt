I'm amazed that Memento (which is an excellent film) is so well regarded in the Top 250 and this doesn't even seem like it !! What the hell is that ?? To be honest, when the movie ended my instinctive reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous finale ended, I concluded that they are equal in their excellence. I'm just confused as to why it's not in the Top 50 along with Memento. I intend to venture a hypothesis that (unfortunately) is because it is in black and white or because (still sadly) that the characters all have British accents ... unfortunately because it is not a reason not to appreciate a great film like this. <br /> <br /> I'm telling you that if you love Memento, you will also love following. Brilliant!
