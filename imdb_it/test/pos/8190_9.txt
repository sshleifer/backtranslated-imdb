Based on the current event, this epic film is set in the year 221 BC and tells the true story of the unification of China. Full of action, full of intrigues, passions, betrayals and unforgettable battle sequences, it caught my attention despite its 160 minutes in length. <br /> <br /> The king, Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of China and becoming his first emperor. Her lover, Lady Zhao, played by the beautiful actress Gong Li, devises a plot in which she will travel to the nearby kingdom of Yan to set up a fake assassination in motion that will give the king an excuse to invade Yan. However, he falls in love with the killer while the king becomes increasingly ruthless. <br /> <br /> There are subplots, tragedy and constant high drama. There are scenes of great beauty and abject cruelty. There is a great cinematography and a brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The profound characterization made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events that bring to mind the Greek drama. Yet it is totally Chinese in that it addresses the age-old questions if the ends justify the means. And it raises the questions concerning life and death and good and evil and all the blurred contours in the middle. <br /> <br /> It is the story of individuals against the background of history, a story that has shaped China for the past two thousand years. I have been overwhelmed in history as well as the moral questions raised. There are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and blood. <br /> <br />
