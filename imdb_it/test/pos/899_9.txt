I think this film has it all. It has really fantastic music that I can never get out of my head. It has captivating-looking characters. It's REALLY fun (you know, the type you will create on the ground and you will continue to say the fun parts every day for three weeks). Despite the bad acting, the bad cgi and the bad story (about the cops going after a robot), it's really cool. It is one of those films that you and your whole family can watch, reunite, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and watch it twice more. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun parts, like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and gave him the finger, and then threw him a ball of paint at him so he could play paint ball. On that side, I kept saying "Remember, remember?" To my cousins ​​who saw it and showed them what happened. There was also a very funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there (just before he fought) and Kurt was talking about his "Strange dream" and how he was "Superman". I loved that part, even though it's been a while since I saw it, so I don't remember that part. All the actors said were fun, as Kurt says, "I love you, like a God!" to the robot. <br /> <br /> Even if there were some bad things, in all it was a BIG movie. Friend, I can't stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );
