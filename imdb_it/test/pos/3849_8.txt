"The Aristocats" is the classic Disney at its best. It is not considered the latest Disney classic alongside Disney's best-known films, but it is a well-made and fun movie that definitely deserves to be a Disney classic. "Aristogatti" is certainly a sure pleasure for children, because it has all the components for a fun film for children. I will like it very much as a child. I'm not sure that this film is a real pleasure for adults, who could watch the Disney classics for nostalgia, but I still like this film as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" may not be as complex or innovative, but it doesn't matter. This film was made at that time when the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and the essay verse, which certainly "Aristogatti" shows. The characters make the film; they are all nice, funny, have big lines and have a great interaction with each other. The voice actors are also a part of making the characters so compelling (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and so on). A misunderstanding may have been the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette, since they are obstetricians and do not have much to do with the true story, but fortunately they are fun and funny characters and the scenes with them are pure gold. > <br /> "Aristocats" is both fun and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. The style and look of the animation fit perfectly into the French environment of the film (in particular, the city of Paris looks great). The animation and character design are fantastic. And the songs are really catchy. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title song is a nice song, along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and the memorable show-stopper "Everyone wants to be a cat". And the soundtrack of George Burns is perfect for the film funny and emotional situations. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Aristogatti" is in my opinion the best Disney cartoon of the 70s and is a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. So what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this Disney classic with your children. It deserves to be in their memories.
