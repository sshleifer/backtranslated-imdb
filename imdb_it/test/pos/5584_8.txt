I saw this film as a child and I want to see it again. has he survived? They discount the 1980 version of everything like fluff. I am sure there are many who do not consider it necessary to preserve these films. It is so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it is gone. Today's young people do not realize the hallucinatory quality and impact on their lives that a film seen in early youth can have in old age. This film, "the blue lagoon" had that effect on me. How many of us wanted to find ourselves in a place far from the fears and chaos of the modern world. This was an idyllic story of a boy and a girl shipwrecked on a tropical island. there are problems to be sure, but in the end they fall in love and have a child. Life should be so simple and beautiful.
