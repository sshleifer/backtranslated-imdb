<br /> <br /> Watch out for philistines, especially American ones! This has all the elements you will hate: a bold approach to film language, a pictorial sense of composition, an intense homoerotic concentration to its elegant narration, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, worse still, is based on a story that you I probably hate it as well ... If, however, you think the films don't have derivative plots, be full of action and disgusting dialogues, you don't need the visual grammar of MTV / TV commercials, so watch this. It is one of my favorite films, and is perhaps Visconti's most perfect work. It's sublime, like Mahler's movement that he uses persistently throughout the film.
