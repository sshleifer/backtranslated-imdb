Undoubtedly one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has pushed the boundaries of cinema perhaps more than any other commercial director. I've known Herzog for several decades and have never been impressed by the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was a little surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, but I couldn't help but imagine that Herzog brought his actors and team into the real jungle not just to make the film, but to live it. No other director is so crazy about the purity of the film production process and the later tradition of productions like Fitzcarraldo was forged into the movie legend. <br /> <br /> Today I sat at Fata Morgana, a 1969 Herzog film that could be described as a filmic allegorical postcard. Without looking for real locations, I assume it was filmed somewhere in Africa, both coastal and desert, a region that may once have been the cradle of a child, a child civilization, a childhood life on earth. It is these origins, the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse of which Herzog deals, as expressed by the distributed narration during the 79 minutes of execution. <br /> <br /> Looking at FM I couldn't help but I feel I was a passenger on a deep journey. In the opening sequence, the title is translated as "Mirage" and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on a landing strip. These images are perverted, their three-dimensionality is flattened flat by a long lens, accumulating layers of exhaust gases, heat waves and light aberrations on each other. The effect let me conclude: things are not what they seem. <br /> <br /> FM is divided into 3 very distinct chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) The golden age. The first chapter opens with innumerable and languid images, where they fart desolate and dry landscapes, rotting dead animals, broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars that slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. The people who populate this inhospitable landscape are prisoners, showy and showy of the desert. The narrative speaks of a time before life, a time when the canvas of the earth was empty and all that existed were the heavens. While the narration speaks of a simpler and purer era, a portrait of a young boy holding a fox-like animal by the throat evokes a cold depiction of man's cruel and ruthless attempt to impose a dominion on nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter we will present ourselves in much the same way, however the images and people are more animated and seem to be infused with a minimum of life and vitality. We listen to a biologist with dazed eyes who talks about the fact that hardly a monitor lizard has hunted prey in such a lifeless environment. While holding the monitor that wiggles, with the tongue touching the flies, he also describes how difficult it is to capture these creatures in the burning heat of 140 degrees. The parallel is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated and straightforward portraits of individuals struck by the sun, the desert and the laborious efforts needed to exist in this harsh realm. He also pushes forward the theme that, if he is not in control, man affirms his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant way. <br /> <br /> The last chapter takes us out of the blast furnace of the desert and into the more familiar territory of Herzog populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior. No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs in Herzog's world - maybe that's where he feels most comfortable. Just like Errol Morris, Herzog chooses to place his camera in an apparently objective position before he lets the film roll. The subsequent flirtation that Herzog has with his subject is the result of his ability to continue shooting well beyond the point where most directors would have screamed. As Morris does, this extended roll goes beyond the "on" moment that subjects feel obligated to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime, their fa√ßade gives way to something real. The most entertaining portrait of this chapter is that of the 2-person band playing a strange polka-like song that Herzog recycles in this chapter. The band's drummer wears the same glasses as the biologist, as well as another guy who does a magic trick, begging for the question: what is with glasses? Surely they add a little lightness to the film, but one has to wonder if they have a deeper meaning or meaning, or this is just another example of Herzog's playfulness. <br /> <br /> The narrative aside, Herzog uses folk and blues music as the soundtrack to the experimental documentary. Leonard Cohen grabs most of the time on the screen, two of his wonderfully melancholy songs "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne". they perfectly accompany the flowing landscapes, adding the convincing impression that we really agree. At the end of the journey, Herzog returns to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film: the distant shot of a solitary vehicle that crosses the infinite desert swallowed by a mirage of water that fills the horizon. Despite the general squalor of FM, the crescendo of the film and the reason for the mirage leave you with a spirit of hope, convinced that against all odds, life will persevere and perhaps even flourish. <br /> <br /> When I finished writing this post, I referred to FM to find out that Herzog shot him in Cameroon Sahara only a few weeks after a bloody coup. True to his legend, Herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. While in prison, Herzog became ill with schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. It's really hard not to love a film as hypnotic and austere as Fata Morgana; knowing that the director was willing to die for doing it just makes you respect even more. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
