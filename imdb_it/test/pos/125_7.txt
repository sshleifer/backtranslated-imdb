This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its character "Sita" presented as Nita. I also note that it was Radha who underwent the allegorical process of fire in the film and not Nita / Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was Ms Mehta's script, not her direction. The characters, large and small, were well developed and seemed quixotic towards the end - rather like the end of Mazursky's "Unmarried Woman". They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And a cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see on him, bringing his disabled mother Biji. It seems that finally we assume a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherence to religion. <br /> <br /> Ms Mehta seems to be tinkering as a director (however, compared to most mainstream Indian cinema, it would seem to be brilliant) because she can't use her script to go beyond the microscopic common family she presents except that to present a taste of the Chinese micro-minority in the social environment of India. He even dedicates the film to his mother and daughter (not his father!), But his Radha recalls the brisk days with both his parents in a mustard field. Compare it with Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants - thanks to her competent Canadian production team and her financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual women in a middle-class Indian family can be a sacrilege for some, but simply capture the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire to anything better than its immediate survival in a limited social space . The films of Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali touched on parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore were not seen by a large segment of experienced filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Ms Das, Ms Azmi, Jafri and Kharbanda are credible but not exceptional. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave extraordinary performances under the good directors ("Khandar" by Mrinal Sen, "Paar" by Gautam Ghose, "Ankur" from Benegal), a particularly absent brilliance in this film. Ms Das shone for her presence on the screen rather than her ability to act. All in all, the strength of the film remains in the structure of the script which is above average in terms of international cinema. I am sure that Ms Mehta can sharpen her writing talents in her future screenplays.
