This is certainly a quality film with a classy cast. As for the films on Carlos the Jackal, this beats the weak efforts of Bruce Willis in "The Jackal" in a bloody mess, then spits on them. I am a little surprised that this film has not attracted more votes, obviously a "sleeper". A pity because this film definitely deserves a watch. It is intelligent and never banal. Look at it, 7/10
