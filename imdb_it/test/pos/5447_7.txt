Leno speaks through his lines. This ruins the joke, for those of you who haven't understood it. His show is held in a micro-sized studio for a reason, or for two reasons: the small amount of laughter will be amplified, and few want to see it. Letterman's set is the exact opposite: Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full. <br /> <br /> NBC, bad taste NBC, will never understand it. Founder David Sarnoff's megalomaniac company continues to be all about money. At least CBS has a bit of a family atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Leno collects cars, or they are stamps, while Letterman runs cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I chatted I used to ask other chatters to send me an email if Leno was saying something funny. I have never received a single email. Letterman has magnificent times. He also manages to re-use the less funny joke so that it becomes one of the funniest things on that night's show. <br /> <br /> Letterman has built other careers. Paul is now well known and respected in his musical right. The other members of Paul's band also gain recognition and career advancement. Biff Henderson has become a name that America knows. Companies on the same block of the Ed Sullivan theater also get a boost. What has Leno ever done for someone else? Personally, I'm glad that Dave moved in and Leno got the Carson concert. I've never seen NBC shows before and I had no reason to do so. <br /> <br /> The Top Ten is an American icon. So it's Letterman. Leno is the dream of a caricaturist, nothing more.
