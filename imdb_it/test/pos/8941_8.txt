This film had a distinct Woody Allen atmosphere, so if you're not a fan of humor, dark humor or shoulder humor, you could probably find something else to do. If you are, however, this is bizarre, with some twists and a natural and fluent dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite compelling, not quite like a shipwreck from which you can't clear your eyes, but close. I mean that in the best possible way. Intrigues are plentiful, twists are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters are definitely adorable. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
