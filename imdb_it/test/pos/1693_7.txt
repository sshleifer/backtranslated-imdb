Apart from the fact that the women in the film are incredibly beautiful and all the prisoners in the camp are too fat, this film sounds true in the post-war chaos. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photographs and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character. <br /> <br /> It is very slow in points, but its rhythm is so different from American and Western European films that it is quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Both main actors do a great job In the DVD version, you can see interviews with the main actors and crew members, and lead actress Stanislawa Celinska gained about 50 pounds and lost all its beauty. But in 1970, she was a stunner.
