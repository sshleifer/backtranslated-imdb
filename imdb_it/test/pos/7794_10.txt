AAA is my favorite movie ... I've seen it a number of times (I don't remember the count now) and every time I love it .... This is Raj Kumar Santoshi's best film ... Comedy, dialogues and performances are amazing ... All the actors and actresses did a great job ... You can't stop laughing while you watch this movie ... it's simply hilarious ... Amir khan and Salman Khan did a great job .. and the acting of Paresh Rawal was excellent as always ..... The music is inspired by old Hindi movies (60s music) and it's good ... the whole cast of the film did a great job. .. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a great Indian comedy movie to watch ...
