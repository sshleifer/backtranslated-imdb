"Hail The Woman" is one of the most moving films I've ever seen in my life. I looked at him twice in succession and sobbed my eyes. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of silent film deserves a much wider audience; unfortunately, the only surviving press is so scratched that most people will not look at it all the way, and will lose the gem that shines beneath the surface. This film could use a digital restoration to help bring out its beauty, but I doubt it will get it from anyone, since its main theme is the spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit, and this is not politically correct in these days. However it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurt by the pain of broken family relationships. <br /> <br /> The cast is magnificent, in particular Florence Vidor, which literally lights up like Judith, the daughter; ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and is put aside; Theodore Roberts is the old and unhappy overbearing father who destroys all those around him out of pride; and the handsome Lloyd Hughes, like his son David, is afraid of his father, but in reality of life itself. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch at Christmas, above all. You will not regret being patient and seeing it in its entirety despite its deterioration.
