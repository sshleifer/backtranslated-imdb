I really like this movie. The first time was on Turner Classic Movies. All the actors did very well, but Brynner steals the show again as usual (it's so sexy!). This is one of the films where Brynner's emotions are seen. In reality this film is the first I've ever seen laughing because it plays very strong, important and important roles in other films. In this film you see both a masculine, hard and sensitive side of Brynner. In this film, Berryner appears to be a "gentleman". It's amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian language that drives me crazy love. I do not understand when both Brynner and Kerr (both have very good chemistry) star in a film together and then Brynner always dies at the end and in a sense remembers "The king and me".
