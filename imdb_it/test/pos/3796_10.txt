I rarely write reviews, but this film simply requires more attention than it can, since it contains the most hysterical seizure that has ever been shot in a comically wrong sequence. I only saw this one time and discovered it was the funniest movie I had ever had the privilege of watching. I laughed from beginning to end. It is a real pity that it is not published on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can only compare his film to that of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or Promise her Anything. Only this plot is not as complex as Mad World. <br /> <br /> I hope that in the near future this film will be released because it would be a shame to lose such a comic gem among the scum we have today.
