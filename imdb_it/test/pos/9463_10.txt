OK, at first I thought this would be another romantic comedy, which held back the comedy, but it wasn't. I mean how could it have been with the fabulous Amanda Bynes who was staring at us! She was fantastic, really funny and it's still sensational! Even the boys were extremely fit, one of the main reasons for going girls! The plot is strongly based on Shakespeare's play "Twelfth Night", since it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to the character of Malvolio. The script was really well written and combined and was very funny. Even the football skills were incredible, it also made me think about playing football! In any case, to summarize this is a light film of love story, which becomes very confusing! Go see it!
