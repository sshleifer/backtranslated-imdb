Although I was hoping that I would have liked a little more, this was definitely an awesome movie. There were great interpretations by all the protagonists, and the story, although not what I would call chilling, was still effective and kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the photo, because it always seemed cold and wet and really seemed to fit the film well. I also thought that the low budget was suitable for this film, because I don't think that a clear image and a clear sound would work well in a film so dark. All in all, he fell a little short of my expectations, but I'm still very happy that I finally sat down to watch this movie.
