Meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count. <br /> <br /> In what was simply a forerunner of what would happen, Murray rules the screen in what can only be described as comic mastery. Tripper Harrison is one of the greatest characters in comedy of the last 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, clever when he needs to be, severe when he needs to be, and thoughtful when it suits him, Murray infuses Tripper with that SNL spark in his eyes. <br /> <br /> CITs are only for awe as they crouch under the comic genius that is Mr. Murray. <br /> <br /> Summer is not summer without a view of meatballs. One of the best comedies ever the screen.
