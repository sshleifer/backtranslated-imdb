I've never seen a movie like this; I wasn't going to see it, but it was worth the TV channel shift. I'm mostly a scifi movie watcher, but I'd be more than happy to add this to my collection. It starts as a one-sided movie with a simple love triangle, then it becomes something a little different (you can't say anything else, but it involves two guys and a girl, but that's not the way you'd expect). Also, this film was played by Hugo Weaving from "MATRIX" and "THE LORD OF THE RINGS" in a role I never expected ... a very funny guy. This movie is playing on HERE TV, but if you don't have a satellite, it's worth paying a rent. So try it; you will not be disappointed.
