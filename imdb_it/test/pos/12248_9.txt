I didn't really like "As Good as Gets", but I'm a big fan of the work of William Hurt and Holly Hunter, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of Albert Brooks. Here in Spain, it is little known and only as a 2nd division version of Woody Allen on the West Coast. He played an important role, but Hunter and Hurt were good too, especially Hurt, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the role that reminds me a little of his part in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the cast is also fantastic. Robert Prosky, one of these familiar faces of American cinema, the ex-bond girl Lois Chiles, placed well in that role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and especially the brief appearance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe it has no good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson, anyway ... The best film by James L.Brooks, great story (well solved) and superb cast for one of the films, certainly the best of the 80
