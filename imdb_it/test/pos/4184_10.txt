I just can't understand why people are surprised that this movie doesn't make sense. It should never have made sense. (Duh! At that time the writers were completely destroyed by Frodis.) He just had to entertain and tease, and he does it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The Monkees are good actors. They would not have been hired if they had not been good actors. Mike has something impassive and dark, Micky is the best in pure psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually believed he was so stupid in real life. Don't tell me they can't act, because they can definitely do it. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Sure, Jack and Bob have the only credits, but they actually had a big hand in that script of the Monkees, who were also in that smoke-filled room. <br /> <br /> (it is absolutely impossible to ruin this film) The head is very highly symbolic. Among the most memorable elements is the black box, which in reality was based on 2 things: the image of Monkee to which the boys were tied, and the real black box on the Screen Gems lot where the band was held the takes. There is so much more symbolism in the film that I just let you see and understand. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic. "Circle Sky" is one of the best songs by Papa Nez ever, and "Porpoise Song" and "As We Go Along" will leave you spellbound. If you prefer to be strange, then "Ditty Diego", "Can You Dig It?" And "Long Title" should be satisfying, great songs that are. And then there's "Daddy's Song", no doubt a tribute to the days of Davy on Broadway, and intriguing editing / color for that sequence is superb. (At least for '68.) <br /> <br /> Oh, for those of you who won't watch a 'PG' movie, you're missing out. Especially since Head was originally rated R in 1968. The rating was lowered about twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Now where was I? Ah yes: "We were talking about beliefs, beliefs and conditionings ..."
