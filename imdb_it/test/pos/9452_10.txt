I just rented this movie from the video store last night. Being new and not released a long time ago here, the rent was only overnight. Me, my little sister and my older brother who usually hates watching this type of film sitting and watching. Once we started the movie and sat down to watch it for a while we were all laughing historically. My brother too. This film is hilarious, I actually laughed. No matter how fun some movies are ... even though I think it's funny, sometimes I can't laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother ended up thinking it was the best "kind of movie" he had seen. I ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later.
