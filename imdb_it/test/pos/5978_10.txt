Having just seen this, I find it hard to believe that it is no longer known. This is the little known but almost shamefully neglected, COME AND SEE (Klimov, 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. They are significant, powerful, incisive. The ASCENT is also equipped with a score used sparingly but brilliantly by Schnittke.
