Can it really be a Troma movie? Some scenes almost look like an "A" movie. The acting is generally competent (the two protagonists and the nurse's replacement were particularly good, and I liked some of the clashes between the young Capulets and Ques); the scenes have been modified without problems; the plot is consistent. It is funny. It has an original and original sound track. <br /> <br /> He has the usual exaggerated Troma and low humor, but I don't think Shakespeare would have worried so much. In fact, I think he might have gotten some good laughs from this. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack with a very informative commentary by the director, several deleted scenes and the usual collection of Troma's self-deprecating stupidity. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to tell you that this was Citizen Kane, but it's a rather inspired low-budget filmmaker.
