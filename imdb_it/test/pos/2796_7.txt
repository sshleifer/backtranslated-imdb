Cedric Klapisch's film L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is an easy and airy charm wrapped in nostalgia for our young and attractive young people. At the center, is the full-length presentation of the long MTV reality soap opera known as "The Real World" in which, as its motto says: "This is the 'true story' of seven strangers chosen to live in a house and they have their lives recorded ... so watch what happens when people stop being kind and start to become real. "That's exactly what happens - minus the cameras planted in every tiny corner of the house in Barcelona, ​​Spain , where Xavier (Romain Duris) comes to stay, having to learn Spanish to meet his business needs. A stranger in many ways slowly forms a camaraderie with his housemates coming from every corner of Europe except America ... this is a film in which the only American shown is an unlikely character with whom Wendy ( the lovely Kelly Reilly) has a relationship with ("Only for sex", he confesses, since he has his boyfriend making a late but confused appearance.). During his stay there, he tries to maintain a distance relationship with his girlfriend played by Audrey Tautou as he begins an attempt to flirt with the wife of the Spanish homeowner where she is and receives some advice from a lesbian home companion (Cecile de France) on how to seduce a woman. A sweet feature that presents a moment in time that the twenty-year-olds will never see again, L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is forgettable fun that embodies the threshold of the "real world" experienced through the eyes of Xavier.
