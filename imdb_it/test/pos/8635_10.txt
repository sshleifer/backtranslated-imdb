I've loved this movie since I was a child. I remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me. I loved it and I still do it. I think it's very funny and original. There are also some very catchy songs in this film. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors portraying Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are fine, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavy boxing sensation Buddy Baer, ​​also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer is as good at this as the cop and the giant. He is a better actor than the boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this film is hilarious as Lou Costello continues to ruin the car and gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. Even the slapstick in the house is good. I especially like the comedy in the giant's castle. My favorite parts are; the part where Lou is climbing the magic bean and everyone is singing goodbye. Jack is singing to them that he will come back. Lou Costello is very good at singing. My other favorite part is the part where Jack is fighting with the giant. I like it when Jack makes the eggs explode and when he tries to make the Giant an omelet they keep exploding. Abbott and Costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time. This is just one of their great movies that I will love and love. The reviews for this film are not very good and I can't understand why. This is a great film by Abbott and Costello. I also like how Lou Costello returns to reality at the end and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud hits him. He begins to sing his song and leaves with an attitude as if no one was pushing me around. Great movie.
