Don't hate Heather Graham because she's beautiful, you hate her because it's fun to watch in this movie. Like the fashionable clothes and the funky environment, the actors in this film work well together. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally illuminates the screen. The minor characters - Goran Visnjic {sigh} and Patricia Velazquez are TALENTED as they are beautiful. Congratulations Miramax and director Lisa Krueger!
