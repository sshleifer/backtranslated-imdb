This must be the best film of all time (in my opinion). He really taught me when I saw when I was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom of being a child slips away sooner than we expect. Even Giuseppe Mazzello must be my favorite actor of all time, and I think he and elijah wood did a great job in the roles of the brothers. This film is pretty sad and some people don't understand the ending. But the story itself is pretty incredible, the thought of a 7-year-old (bobby) abused by a drunk foster father is horrible, and what the two guys do about it is sad and important. My favorite part of the film is when Tom Hanks (old Mike) lists the 7 things about being a child that gets lost in the adult world. However there are some parts that could have been done better in this film, like the casting of the mother (lorraine braco), which I think is a horrible actor. "the king" has interpreted his role well, since it is a difficult role to interpret. Joseph and Elia were definitely the stars of the film. I could not believe how well the victims of an abusive stepfather played, being the age they were (7 and 9). But overall, I recommend this movie to anyone, who loves great child actors and a great movie. :)
