Yes, I watch this show. Because my girlfriend looks at it, of course. Well, at least, that's what I tell my friends. But as no one here has ever known me, I can tell; I love it! This is the excellent trash TV. <br /> <br /> First, there is the panel; The same Tyra, who does not miss a unique opportunity to talk about herself, but must be taken seriously, since she is a businesswoman. Then there is Jay Manuel, a sober, very serious and incredibly professional gay guy, and Miss Jay, an extrovert, "catwalk" queen and a damn funny guy, and Nigel, self-styled as the only man on the panel. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the show is an in-depth look into a shallow area, and we have to give it to the producers to show us the internal view, which can be informative as well as entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, the edition is exceptional; there's just the right mix of everything; The girls who live together in the house of ego, their impressions of the sets, the competitions themselves and the judgment. All this flows perfectly with the right rhythm. There are no lengths. <br /> <br /> Of course, there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we don't see in the shows; The panel is made up of capricious divas, extrovert and quick; woe to those who offend them! But having said that, as long as a competitor does not step on his toes, their judgment is usually fair - I think. <br /> <br /> So, give your brain a break; If you can't beat them, join them and have fun watching this piece of reality TV with your loved ones. It will make you want more, somehow.
