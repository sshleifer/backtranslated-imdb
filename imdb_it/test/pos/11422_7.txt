This short by Stan Laurel is a small parody of the movie Valentino BLOOD AND SAND. If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, you'll probably enjoy this movie and you'll laugh at some scenes that make fun of Valentino's movie. However, if you haven't seen that movie and you watch this movie, you probably won't be very impressed - even though I really liked the titles, the word "bull" has been used repeatedly in very funny ways. > <br /> Stanly plays "Vaselino" a bullfighter who seems rather dull and wins only because the bulls seem lazy and not aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the film, which allegedly killed ten men, is obviously just a domesticated bull. <br /> <br /> It's not a great film anywhere in the imagination, but it's still a nice and harmless film.
