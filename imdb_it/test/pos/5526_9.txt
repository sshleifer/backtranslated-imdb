The trick, so to speak, of this 1934 Paramount comedy is the six interpreters of the comedy, paired in three man-woman teams, which all appear together. W. C. Fields and his frequent screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as sheriff and innkeeper of a small town. Fields seems to have been given to the latitude to inject a lot of his unique brand of misanthropic and surreal comedy in his part, and it works wonderfully, especially where he is allowed to do his famous billiard routine, a digression that is totally welcome since it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> At first glance it might seem a mismatch to think that a film is carried by the subtle domestic comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland alongside Vaudeville's ample, joking cry of the great comedy of husband and wife of George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here it works perfectly thanks to the parts that George and Gracie gave in the script. There are some freeloaders who tour California for the Ruggles and Boland honeymoon trip and constantly find ways to annoy them at every step, including, brilliantly, while they are all clinging to a cliff for dear life. /> <br /> Making Burns and Allen's comic book woes to two nice characters turns out to be a perfect way to adapt their far and biggest comedy characters in life to a real world - the comedy of people reacting to in a credible way it turns out to be a gold mine like the famous and naive delivery of Gracie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Ruggles deserves a special mention for his portrayal of the finicky banker "Pinky" Whinney. He is wonderfully thin and undervalued, and he draws laughter from the jokes that in the hands of another actor might not even have been heard. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully witty all the time, and mostly it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor Whinney who can't get a moment on their own, and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just a first-rate comedy from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For the pre-code viewers out there, there is some pretty impressive material in some of the funniest scenes, as Whinney tries to convey to George just because he and his wife want to be alone for Un some time. <br /> <br /> There are some signs of precipitous production here - the occasional occasional jump, one of the most obvious drop sets you'll ever see in a movie (right there with WC Field's short "The Golf Specialist"), and the knot in Field's tie constantly changes shape. These don't bother me, though, and they shouldn't bother anyone enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> "Six of a Kind" is a little-known gem and one of the funniest movies I've seen for a while. If you are thinking about looking at it, the answer should be yes.
