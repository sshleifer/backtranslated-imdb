I used to watch this when I was very small, so I used to watch my videos. Now I watch DVDs, I love it. Ray Winston is "The Dude", the rest of the cast is all good and even with the change of Robin Hood everything works. Great stories, twists and the way it was shot - to the untrained eye (not mine is trained) can be interpreted as a lack, but it adds the absorption of the audience to the film. With the green hills and the contrast between the luxuriant sunlit forest, the dark corridors and the castle dungeons - It's fantastic. Personally the definitive interpretation of the legend of Robin Hood. I can't stress how much I think you should look at this, if you get the chance, YOU MUST WATCH IT.
