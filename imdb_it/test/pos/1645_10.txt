A diverse team between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot, and the guy who plays Bana at Seinfeld, go up to an Arctic research post where all members died killing each other or killing each other. They find out that there is a worm - a virus - which is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is that, after a dog lashes out, anyone could have been infected, but who? This is not only my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorites on the show. The arctic environment contains the characters and, of course, like Carpenter's the Thing, it is very funny to see these serene-looking characters who suddenly start shooting in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are poor, I didn't care about them at all. The drama between the characters ends up working more than it normally would because of the tension and because all the actors (including the boy Bana) understand what is happening in the story. And, as usual, I loved the ambiguity of the ending. Highly recommended.
