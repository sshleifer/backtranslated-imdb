Keys to the VIP, an original series of the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca) has achieved great success with this fun, yet inspirational source. This show is hosted by four funny and good-looking guys who judge others about their "game" (ability to pick up women). Each episode features two guys who challenge each other in various pick-up games. There are three different sections and the winner gets a VIP night at an exclusive Toronto night club. <br /> <br /> Being a boy, I find this show exhilarating. We all know that it is difficult to confront women and to see these guys naturally trigger the curiosity of men. The guys who compete in this show might even give you some indication if you pay attention.
