Luis Bunuel's "Nazarin" will always be remembered as a great film because he is absolutely honest in his presentation of the comic assault on religion. It is one of those exceptional films that must be shown to all people, especially small children, in order to familiarize them with the notions of good and bad, sacred and evil. The most difficult question posed by "Nazarin" concerns the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. It has been addressed by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above the small things in their worldly lives, especially sins. Bunuel marks tremendously by showing us that various questions relating to class differences deserve sincere, honest and reliable answers. Nazarin seems credible as it was done in a light and comic vein. This is the only reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely faithful to life to all audiences. It is surprising how Bunuel approaches the search for the true question of love in his film. This black and white gem was shot beautifully by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favorite cameramen. Film critic Lalit Rao saw "Nazarin" in Trivandrum, India, during the 13th International Festival of Kerala 2009. "Nazarin" was introduced by the eminent Indian cinema personality Mr.PKNair as part of a special package called " 50 years ago ". This is a movie that should be with any demanding DVD collector.
