This is the first Three Stooges abbreviated with Shemp that I've seen, and it's one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> This is what I liked most about Shemp when he came back after Curly's stroke, he didn't try to be like Curly, he was his character, and that's what I admire! Shemp is my third favorite maniac, I like it better than Curly, but I like Curly as much as I do Shemp. Shemp is awesome, it's funny, it's stupid, it's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really liked the scene in which he dropped the nickel and Moe entered the cabin with him to find it and ended up being tangled in the wires and really hurt! <br /> <br /> But what I thought was scary was when Shemp had her face pressed against the glass of the telephone booth, she looked like a deformed Snape professor! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp, he had a lot of bad things happening to him in this short, but that's just typical of the Stooges, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! <br /> <br /> This short is another must for Three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
