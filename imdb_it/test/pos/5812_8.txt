This was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror series, but I had seen a couple of Hammer horror movies (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and I thought enough about giving a look. <br /> <br /> This first episode was a shock - not for the horror but for all the nudity. Was this "normal" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed a lot more skin than we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, a scene in which a boy put his hand on one, and another scene with the man a woman pretending to have sex. Hey, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a witch who died in the 17th century returns to her old home and makes life hard for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch in the role of "David Winter", was not very actor, but his wife was not bad and was really a beauty. It was Prunella Gee as "Mary". Her husband rightly suspected her of having an affair and this has a role in this story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was funny as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup", who returns with a bad mood in her and enjoys tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man, I'd say it was particularly fun to see the two women who went there! This starts off slowly, but once "Lucinda" starts to awaken things, it becomes a lot of fun.
