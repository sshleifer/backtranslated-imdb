A good documentary that analyzes the background behind the oil dependence of our societies, the problem related to our current energy consumption and finally discusses the effects of the energy deficit coming from the peak of the oil production problem. <br /> <br /> This film should be educated to all students as part of their education. Show it to your children, parents, relatives and friends. They will thank you in the end. <br /> <br /> After reviewing the contents of this documentary and comparing its quoted sources, I would say that the facts in this film are scientifically well supported.
