Despite all the hustle and bustle of the episode THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES, THE BALANCE OF TERROR could be the best episode in the series. And, even though I've always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it's so funny, I really have to cast my vote because this Romulan episode is the best. <br /> <br /> The film, quite interesting, is really like an underwater movie of World War II as it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it tries to destroy the Romulans before they sneak up through the Neutral Zone after a raid on the outposts of the Federation. In many ways, the show is very similar to the film THE ENEMY BELOW - where the American Captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German Captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown in counterpoint while both try to overcome the other - and in the process we develop a respect reluctant for their enemy. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that only a small piece of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet - and this is surprising because an episode on board could easily have been static and boring. But because the writing was fantastic and the main characters were so well written and interpreted (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Strangely, for the die-hard Trekkers out there, they will recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is simply a fantastic and extremely addictive episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
