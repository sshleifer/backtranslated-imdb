Faith Akin once again made me understand the depth of my passion for this city called Istanbul. Being addressed as a city of cultural mosaics, Faith Akin contributed to that by tackling through the mosaics the music performed in the film. Furthermore, the film's climax, in my opinion, is the scene in which Muzeyyen Senar (a diva of Turkish music) sings at the age of 86 as he did in his younger years and throws the glass of raki in the air without spilling a drop, which is a traditional act in raki culture. It is simply wonderful. Sezen Aksu (a Turkish pop singer) with his mystical and significant looks at the end of his song that gives the film its Turkish title, makes the scene no less than a climax. Last but not least, the wonderful scenery of Istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you're away. Warning!
