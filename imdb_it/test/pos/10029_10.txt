I saw for the first time "They died in boots", around 1970 and although many years have passed since then, this film and its impression remain. The cast was good to excellent and the protagonist was really heroic. When I saw this movie for the first time I knew it was the wisest and the only real position to have was to enjoy this movie as an exciting piece of entertainment and then a little. I felt then how I feel even now that Silver Screen does not provide a true representation of much of everything not to mention the life of George Armstrong Custer, however director Raoul Walsh had to contribute to the real value represented in this film when I watched a semi-documentary with other great directors like Vincent Mennelli in which these central figures spoke of successes with precious comments that provide a glimpse of the Hollywood mentality. This is what I considered interesting and where all this has become terribly interesting and very enjoyable. However, so many oblems have been made with the silver screen and its ability to tell stories that some of the pleasures have been lost and perhaps you would have found it to be true here too.Custer ranked 34 in a specialization class of ... 34. Much has been made of Custer final class rankings, but of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy with him in 1857, half of them had already been fired or abandoned for graduation on June 24, 1861. It is suggested in the film as the several instructors are determining if a soldier is ready for the command and then comes across the name of George Armstrong Custer and there will certainly be an exchange between the two parties and here is where the Sargeant on Duty says in an almost subdued tone also to suggest that it is come out by accident "His squadron will follow him to hell," Your attention Sargeant, scold the tape. If I'm not mistaken as soon as Flynn shows up in an initial battlefield, he acknowledged that Custer didn't see the action right away and in fact he was doing his job a reliable clerk to not only Sheridan, but Hancock also forces the forces to finish for a while with the Army of the Potomac under General George McClellan. There is some truth in the boldness attributed to the hero of the battlefield of Custer as was shown in a counterattack, "young Custer spurred the horse into command and bravely threw himself among the confused confederates. Like a lonely soldier surrounded by rebels, the audacity of the Custer shone, he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers, including a rebel captain who personally captured the first Confederate battle flag taken by the Army of the Potomac. as a promising officer on the battlefield. "Robert L.Bateman - General armchair. There is a problem here and that is the story of the story and the truth about George Armstrong Custer, the story is good Hollywood entertainment, maybe even great entertainment, but for whatever reason all that can be said was the change to entertainment purpose. Although perhaps skipping the gun it would have been better to know that Tom Custer would have lost his life at the "Little Big Horn" a few meters from where George Custer should have died as well. They were brothers and Tom Custer so far holds an honorable distinction of being in the midst of a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have received the Medal of Honor twice in his military career. The list of commitments that the film shows indicates that the Custers were indeed an active young officer. He was not with the Union forces either in Chancellorsville or in Fredericksburg, but he was with them in the battle of Antietam and at that time he was promoted captain by General McClellan, but he would not last McClellan was soon replaced due to the historical fact that The Army of The Potomac had the means, and the information (discovered around some cigars were General Lee's plans to split his forces) yet he did. succeeded in acting, President Lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost accordingly. Custers' biggest victory could actually come to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. His forces occupying an area called the Gettysburg cemetery field camp in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a Jeb Stuart Led Cavalry of about 6,000 rebels with a force of 2,300. I think Custer's heroism is worth worth discussing it. In the film, the speculation had a mistake, well, you better guess again because Custer had not only men in his corner, but he created a petition to present to the Governor of the state of Michigan who was relatively new to the cause of the Union and where it was preparing to form cavalry regiments. Despite Custer he was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he appeared in all that Golden Braid that was not by mistake, as if I were led to believe. The truth is that Custers' defense in Gettysburg forbade Jeb Stuart from having lunch in the shops behind the Unions and to vitally protect that side. This action has taken place and has been timed to coincide with Picketts Charge, in order to obtain the greatest probability of success. It was a critical victory and Custer was the bravest and the best. His men followed him to hell and lived to tell about it.
