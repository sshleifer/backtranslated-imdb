I just saw it in a preliminary projection. I haven't read the book, but I've heard many positive things. <br /> <br /> The film was absolutely fantastic, very moving. With the roller coaster of emotions you connect totally with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who include Persian / Dari was incredible. <br /> <br /> It is one thing to note that Khaled Hosseini really loved the film which is unusual for the adaptation films in the book. Even after seeing the movie several times he was "sobbing". <br /> <br /> Even the animation from the introduction was exquisite, with names shown as if it were a Persian calligraphy, truly unique! Sometimes the translation did not clearly convey the message efficiently, but all in all it was a great film.
