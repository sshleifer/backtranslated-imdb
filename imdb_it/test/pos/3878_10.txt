Because of this show that stops early, I never understood why until I recently read the story behind the series. I have heard that this show has never had its effects as one of the greatest shows, this show is iconic in nature and deserves the film that has always been destined to have if not cast by an original team, at least with the cast incorporated in the plot or a long cameo, perhaps at the end, to commemorate it to the late Col. Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This cast has given us so much to bring happiness to us growing up that they deserve a last effort I have the fact that the series ended openly because they cut the series is a sufficient reason. This crew and the cast have made us understand as children the essence of being one of the good guys, seeing how upset the world is today, I think a more delicate version like the original should be set in motion I have already read the previews and I know these are not the plans but, if nothing else, a DVD movie, I would definitely buy it. I really don't understand how the shit shows have the finals of the series but this great show that continues to work regularly today and probably is looked at more than some of the current junk games today will not always remember the incredible Hulk series, Knight Knight Airwolf, and team A because these types of shows last over time, I'm almost certain that they knew the ones you see on the detectives won't even be remembered in 10 years, so why not report something and show people what it means to stand still? how these old shows really are.
