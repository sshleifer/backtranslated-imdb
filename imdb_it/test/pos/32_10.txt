LACKAWANNA BLUES is a beautiful theatrical performance by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even more beautiful film as the author has adapted his life story to the screen. This brilliant film turns on the screen with intense colors, refined music, brilliant editing, superb direction by George C. Wolfe and a cast so extraordinary that it becomes mandatory to watch an encore! Yes, it's just so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the life of the author of the "Junior" child (Marcus Carl Franklin) who grew up in the inimitable house of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S), deeply empathetic. Epatha Merkerson), a lady who has dedicated her life to helping the dispossessed by transferring them from the South, from psychiatric hospitals and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy remembers all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - strange characters with a painful past - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family saved by the Tata. The myriad of characters in the house are too numerous to delineate, but they are interpreted by some of the best actors in the industry: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward , Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film we present ourselves to the cruelty of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the contagious joy of Afro-American musical contributions to our musical culture and the courage of a beautiful woman who fought all the adversities that the world can reserve to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is completely immersed in this role, a role that makes her shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. She offers one of the most incredible performances of the past years, and this film was released in theaters instead of as an HBO film, she would no doubt have added the Oscar to put together her Golden Globe award. <br /> <br /> The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe manages acting and history as a master: as a riff in a jazz piece, he glues small moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from history with the array of dance parties in local clubs overflowing with summits with incredible blues, jazz, dancing and joy. The production crew has assembled this small miracle of a photo with extreme care and never for a moment the attention slows down from the moment of history. Highly recommended vision, almost mandatory! Grady Harp
