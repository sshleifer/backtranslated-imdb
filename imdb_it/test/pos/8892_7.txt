College teacher Larry Donner (Billy Cristal) is a stuck writer since his ex-wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) ruined him, stealing his novel that became a best-seller. He does not hide his hatred of Margareth, upsetting his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), who is an anthropological teacher in the same college. While giving creative writing lessons, he is shadowed by the student Owen (Danny DeVito) who wants to know his opinion on his crime. Larry says he didn't like it, and explains that in every mysterious story, the killer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he would be caught. In addition, Larry suggests that Owen watch Hitchcock's films to understand the structure of a suspense story. Owen, who wants to kill his detestable mother (Anne Ramsey), observes "Strangers on a Train" and misunderstands Larry's advice, believing that his teacher wants to exchange murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and while on a ship, Margareth falls into the sea vanishing into the sea and is considered dead. However, Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the main suspect, while the deranged Owen presses him to kill his mother as part of their alleged agreement. <br /> <br /> "Throwing the mother from the train" is one of the funniest comedies of the 80s and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "Strangers on a Train", but there are lines with "Vertigo" (with the camera), "Family Plot" (with the machine without interruptions) and other films. The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when Larry says that every great love story or mystery has a train. Anne Ramsey is incredible in the role of an evil and violent dominating mother and the viewer will surely feel pain and understand Owen's madness. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Cristal plays a character obsessed with many stupid and unreasonable attitudes but necessary to the plot. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mam√£e do Trem" ("Throw the mother from the train")
