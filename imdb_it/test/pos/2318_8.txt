I really enjoyed this movie. I've probably seen it 2 or dozens of times and I'm still enjoying it. Being an old Navy boy, I am still attracted by the extraordinary interpretation of Anchors Away! I also love the "McHales Navy" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the dive officer, but I'm just old-fashioned, I think. He was still good at watching, lol, especially after the crew had finished with the laundry. The cook, the sonaran and the electrician made the film. I also loved the old salty engineer and his first class PO. And Grammer actually did a truly commendable job of being a misfit officer. I liked the "driving scene" as they passed the golf course towards the harbor, lol. Pure Navy! And I swear I had an XO that was just like that little weasel ... I'm so glad this came out on DVD, for the damn time. : 0)
