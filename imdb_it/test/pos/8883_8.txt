stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. <br /> <br /> After the university lecture, teacher Larry (Crystal) wants his dead ex-wife and Owen (Devito) wants his mother (Ramsey) dead. When Larry remembers that he wants his dead wife, Owen knows what he has to do for him, in exchange for a favor in return, because Larry kills his mother. Devito is absolutely exhilarating in this as the aspiring writer who has daydreams of poisoning his mother and shearing scissors in his head. He has a child's role that makes him look more like a confused man than a murderer. Ramesy was actually nominated for an Academy Award for this, thanks to his wonderful interpretation of the old lady. Along with the comedy, the film also has a heart. A scene between Devito and Crystal apparently starts as a joke, but it goes deeper, actually makes me a little sad. Danny Devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in his direction. I recommend this for every comedy fan. <br /> <br /> My assessment: B plus. 84 minutes PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
