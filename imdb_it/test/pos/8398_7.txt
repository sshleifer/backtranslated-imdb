I look at this film without great expectations, I think everyone should do it. It's a great television series and obviously we couldn't compare it to Gone With the Wind, but it's still nice to see. It is also strange to see a different Scarlett. Joanne Whalley doesn't play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I think Scarlett changed when she got older. Don't expect that much of this is just looking but not looking: I think it would be horrible.
