I loved this movie, it was cute and fun! Lauren Holly was wonderful, funny and very credible in her role. Even Costas Mandylan was very good, nice to see too !! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual, was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character. It was a pleasure to watch a movie that is fun, interesting and can be seen by the whole family. It is difficult to find good health films. Thankfully for Hallmark movies, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, please let me know !! I have purchased several Hallmark films and am very happy with them. I hope I can buy this !!
