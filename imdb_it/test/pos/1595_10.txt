If all the films were to be destroyed and only one could be saved, death in Venice should be. It is a monument in the history of cinema. Very criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating his point (an old man discovers beauty in a boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this film for what it is. 'Death in Venice' was shot more than 30 years ago, and portrays an even earlier period, at the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Life has been slow compared to now. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. The director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the main actor, succeed admirably in showing how the old composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest for a boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his day, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. We see his inner struggle, mostly on Bogarde's face, against the marvelous background of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music, composed by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, there's no denying it. No special effects, car chases or fights to keep the public locked in their seats. Not even pervert sex scenes; the interaction between man and boy is limited to looks stolen from afar and to the occasional smile. <br /> <br /> So basically nothing happens in this movie? Not if you want your senses hit like a basic drum. If you want them to be played like a violin string in a romantic concert, this is the movie to do it.
