'O Brother, Where Art You' is a cheerful tale of "Odyssey" by Homer, set in 1930 in Mississippi and rampant with a bizarre peculiarity that is the trademark of the Coen brothers. Three unfortunate prisoners make their escape to find the treasure - and more than their share of adventure - in this delightful movie. George Clooney is as fine and naive as the talkative, lovable leader of the trio; but the real compliments play out to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his funny but adorable cohorts, nicknamed 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by Clooney's character after they received baptism by total immersion in a river. The three have cut a record under that nomadic home plume for money, and unwittingly turn into nocturnal sensations with a true "rock star" status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to qualify it almost as a musical. And there are some incredible film production feats here: the scene at the KKK rally is a real doozy, and it's so similar to the scene where Dorothy's friends save her from the witches' castle in "The Wizard of Oz" which is almost equivalent to film plagiarism. And what an amazing plagiarism it is! Without giving up at the end, I must say that the climax of the film is one of the most breathtaking sequences filmed in recent memories (on a par with the spectacular finale of "Magnolia", another of my favorites). 'O Brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!
