He kept me on the edge of my seat. Of course, the plot has some holes in the plot, but the sheer tension of it, the way the director continues to challenge the premise is simply fascinating. José Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of the best Spanish actors (see La vida mancha and Héctor) and here they appear as a happy couple from the upper middle class. Below all, the truth is that all of Coronado's life is a lie. He is not an economist, he never went to university or does not work in the Central Bank Reserve in Spain, as everyone else thinks. We have some information on how he kept up appearances or managed to do so, and while it is not very plausible he is still somehow credible. <br /> <br /> The internal mechanisms of the scam are shown intermittently, but it is credible because Coronado is a source of security and assertiveness. He doesn't believe only in the scam, he also believes in the premise of the film, and therefore the door. <br /> <br /> Of course, he tests the belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of marriage finances for almost 10 years, but again, since she is presumably a brilliant economist. <br /> <br /> It has been said, in a nationalist tone, that the film is not "distinctly Spanish", as if it were a litmus test for the good film. True, no castanets or strange cabbies in this, just a tense thriller. You would like to know how this story ends once you start looking.
