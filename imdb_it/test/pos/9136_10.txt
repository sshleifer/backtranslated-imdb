I decided to write a comment on this fantastic film because here on IMDb we quote that John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films in his pre-American years, but he completely ruined his reputation with his latest film made in USA, plans to do it again. Here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the most stupid ideas for an absolute remake: the film's plot is simple and even stereotyped by today's standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is the recitation of the four protagonists, unique in its genre directed by Mellville, cinematography, music and its style. Today no director is able to make such a film, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a film in today's box office-based film industry. John Woo has made a more or less decent film borrowed from Le Samourai - Melville's The Killer, but remember, it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but economic actors (in merit of acting). So what I'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made, along with another Melville film - Le Samourai. Watch it. And even if the remake is done, try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.
