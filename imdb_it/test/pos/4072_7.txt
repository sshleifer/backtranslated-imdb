This is a funny movie. The feeling of Bob & Eddie Show could lead to a following, but I doubt he will make enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves he can once again be a great straight man with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun watching work with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo, well, it's still fun to watch and he did his excellent part. <br /> <br /> Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and we got a lot of it from the movie and the big releases at the end. DO NOT LEAVE AT THE BEGINNING OF Credits! <br /> <br /> At least a 7.
