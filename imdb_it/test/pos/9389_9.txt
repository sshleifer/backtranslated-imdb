I love B-horror movies. However, generally I'm not a big fan of "so stupid is funny" movies. I had to evaluate this so simply because Death Bed: the bed I eat is so unique and so original. there are a lot of question marks, lots of plot holes, and the WTF factor has increased to 11, but I wasn't really bored for a second. Actually I couldn't call it disturbing, every minute I was saying "what the hell this bed / movie is going to do!" I saw it with a friend who is in no way a fan of horror or B-movies, and she was pretty too. the effects were actually very imaginative and the colors and atmosphere were quite good. it maintains a very consistent and uniform tone during most of the film, (although an incredibly ridiculous consistency) and the acting was not TERRIBLE. I can see from the point where there are some inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of faith almost impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept, that this fact didn't bother me. seriously, for me, this film has hit the realm of one that I will never only forget, but I guarantee that I will find myself thinking about certain scenes in the future. Does anyone else know of other films in inanimate objects that eat the genre of people? absolutely amazing.
