I liked the story of a boy who tries to get his girlfriend back ... he was there, done that way, so I can tell myself ... anyway, I love the camera work, like the camera sometimes comes " left ", and are just sitting there talking about the scene, or other things ... or how the camera follows him to find the cast and what not ... I watched it on IFC last year and I have it adored, so I told some of my friends about it, and some of them looked at it, and they loved it too ... take a look if you can, a little girly, but it's still a good film ... I gave a 10/10 because of two reasons ... one: I can relate ... but anyone who has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can relate to ... two: it's a really creative way to make a movie, it's like you're constantly there, right in the middle of shooting ... like I said, great movie
