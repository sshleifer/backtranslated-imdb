I heard a lot about "The English Patient" and finally decided to take the CD and find out what ballyhoo was about. What I discovered was a cinematic pleasure and, I should repeat, "I should" always be observed with an open mind. If you are religious, zealously moral, I fear that this is not a movie for you as you will not be able to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you continue to insist on the moral dilemmas that this film creates. As I remember well, before watching this film, I read the review on this site and I was completely disgusted by the opinions of that person I quote stated "that the protagonists fully deserved what they got". When it comes to morality, I agree with him, but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have rarely seen such a beautifully made film. I keep hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First of all this is a love story and it is an extramarital affair (moralists look at each other well) but we don't focus on that. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. It is a mixture of flashbacks and the present. It is set in the Second World War and tells the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy wonderfully played by Ralph Fiennes) who is treated by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in a war-torn Italy just before of the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burned scar victim suffered greatly in pain remembering the torrid story he had had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are so cleverly intertwined in the story that you are transported into history and you have the feeling of being a first-hand spectator. The places in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and I am not ashamed to say that I had tears after the end. Watch it with someone you really love. The film begins and ends with the same shot of the desert, where the sand dunes twist and sag like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and pain was transmitted so overwhelmingly by the actors that I wonder why God! Because we have wars that destroy the beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of innocence. <br /> <br /> Anyway he deservedly won a lot of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works by director Anthony Minghella. This type of film brings back the romance in the David Lean film genre. It almost reminds me of Lawrence of Arabia who was also based in the desert.
