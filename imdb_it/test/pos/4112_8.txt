I was 19 or 20 years old, at the time I lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I still remember the new domed theater, called the 21st century. Oscillating back chairs and a new sound system, a big screen and a huge open space between the screen and the theater full of people. We have experienced all the excitement of a new preview of a movie. Da da da ta dadadada ... I can still hear the opening music playing the trumpet and the cymbals crash. I loved the interaction between characters and filmed panoramas. I know that Peter Finch and Luv and Sally have had some problems with the lip sink but hey, it was good to feel good, make movies for things! What I regret is the way they cut out the significant heart, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I saw the cut version and I can see that he lost his vision of the vision he had in the preview edition. Yes, I am a little surprised in Peter's effort to make love through music but, you know, I didn't see him that way when I left the theater. when they questioned us while we left, I regret any comments I made that may have altered the original. I liked it and then I still see it while listening to the music on my LP. Most of my family listened to me singing most of the soundtrack and I can use film monologues in our "what movie is this" games. I would like a DVD version of the director to be available. It's available on VHS but it's not exactly the same. I would particularly like a serious style commentary on the Lord of the Rings on his origins, struggles and triumphs. Demanding people should leave things pretty well alone. Bring it back!!!!
