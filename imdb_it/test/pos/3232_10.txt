A film is beyond all expectations, a great vision of the human condition. What drives Mila to get her ass painted. What could push a human being so far away that there is only way to escape is to have the back passage painted repeatedly by strangers. <br /> <br /> This film is not afraid to paw the stairs in front of the problem of painting the ass. Simply breathtaking. Get on the sequel or what comes next from the genes that did it.
