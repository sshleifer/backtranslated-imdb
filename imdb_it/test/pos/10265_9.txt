It could not have come from a different country or from another time. This film simply exudes psychedelia influenced the Italian cinema of the 60s. So, pseudo serious and sexually free. Sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this visual and sound pleasure. We also get the adorable Dagmar Lassander, certainly at his best. Extravagant activities make a wild ride and if the fun in the midst of the Mimosa towards the end seems too long, it's just another fascinating trait of the time. You probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and, of course, announce a breakthrough in the process. It would have been better if Philippe Leroy was not so strange with his frayed red hair and distorted facial expression. Ben does well and has many silent moments in which Dagmar is riding and must show a mixture of love and hate. It is not a normal narrative film, but for those who like something different, this is certainly it.
