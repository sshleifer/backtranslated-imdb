I don't understand where these bad comments come from. The film put you on the edge of your seat and made you a little afraid of going to your car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The part that makes you is that all this could happen. Not to the extent perceived in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This film took that reality and turned it into a nightmare of Dee Snider. <br /> <br /> Three inches up (the third is of the corpse in my freezer).
