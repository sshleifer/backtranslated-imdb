At first sight a film like Northfork, a city destined to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters sent to evacuate the remaining citizens, could only be an ordinary film. While we soon meet a remaining priest who cares for a sick child, an avid owner of the land, we could be put on a simple story that we could easily digest. However, when one is introduced to this film for the first time, one notices the extraordinary open cinematography and a scene that involves a church hall missing a wall that opens to the pastures and to the panoramic view of the mountains with the grazing of cattle. It soon becomes clear that after this scene and some of the people introduced by the people, that this is not an ordinary film and no ordinary story, it is something very special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance things are not clear, but the cinematography and the landscape that the viewer witnesses are amazing, and the characters that populate this small area soon extinct are simply amazing. It's what can bring you closer to this qwerky movie, or you got bored sitting there waiting for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Deep, spiritual and dreamlike quality films, give a slow and methodical approach, I'm sure it will bore some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture, the movie is fantastic from witness. <br /> <br /> Rated 8 out of 10
