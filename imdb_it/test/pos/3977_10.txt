Contrary to what many might believe that this film is a type of film and "anti-system" attitude. It is an excellent portrait of the "system" in question and how ridiculous it is. The fun parts of the movie are actually fun because they talk about the truth about the world around us. Anyone who thinks this film is unrealistic is simply denying the self-evident truths about life. And this is to learn what you like. This is what college should be .. <br /> <br /> I learn that a comment must have at least 10 lines. I think I gave my opinion on this. So now I write a couple more lines as a filler. I hope you enjoyed yourself during this time. I encourage you to go see the movie. It is really worth it until you follow it and immerse yourself in the film.
