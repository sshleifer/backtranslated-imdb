you know I've seen a lot of hong kong movies crap in terms of production and they were good. But Running Out of TIme was great. <br /> <br /> I think what made the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such great chemical skills is so beautiful. The film is really fast in the beginning, but not slow down enough to notice what is also good, we don't want to have a heart attack, lol. In terms of plot, other things that interest you are sufficient. Lau has some good times while using makeup to impersonate people from the underworld. The film also has the best oriental support cast from "house of flying daggers". <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic because it is so unpredictable and leaves you speechless in every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comic, action and emotional pacts in one, 8 out of 10
