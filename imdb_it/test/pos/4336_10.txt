While I agree that this film lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, it is aimed primarily at fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey) returns to the street again (given a license to kill the police chief no less) and moves into the friends' apartment (who guessed it) was killed by a street gang that took control of the neighborhood (which resembles Beruit). It is strange that people who frequent Bronson are in the habit of being killed. Bronson systematically kills them one at a time while people in the neighborhood are used against him. There are some dynamics between Bronson and Fraker who lead the street gang, you can say that both appreciate their work. At one point in the film, after they made their way into the city jail, Fraker said: "I'm going to kill an old lady just for you, take it on the 6:00 news bulletin." The "Giggler", a handbag thief who laughs while committing his crimes is also nice to watch. The film was made in 1985 and most people could probably identify with the stereotypical urban bands that are projected in the film. It's fun to watch Bronson (Paul Kersey) get rid of the streets of these thugs. Look at the appearance of the Wildey Magnum, a serious hardware that Bronson brandishes. I also really liked the soundtrack of this movie.
