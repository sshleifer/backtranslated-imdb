Felix is ​​watching an actor test his jokes: "A ham, a ham, my kingdom for a ham sandwich !!!" The dramatic boy who tells Felix "will have to sacrifice my art and go to the cinema". It is in tears. Felix looks at him like he's crazy and shrugs his shoulders. The old man tells Felix to "go ahead" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, "How do you expect me to get the money?" <br /> <br /> In a few minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he sees a shoe entrepreneur making a "bankrupt" sale on his store. Felix has a plan to save him and the man promises the cat $ 500 if it works. <br /> <br /> Well, but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In an outrageous scene, Felix turns into a briefcase and that's how he comes to Hollywood, turning again into a cat when he gets there. <br /> <br /> We then witness Felix's attempts to enter the entertainment world. His audition scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. Also there are caricatures of some famous actors and silent movie stars. In all, a lot of material is in this 9.5-minute comic book. It's amazing how much more you can get in 2.5 more minutes, assuming that most animated short films last seven minutes. <br /> <br /> However, there were a lot of laughs here and other strange things that you could only see in a cartoon, like Felix you have a sword fight with giant mosquitoes! Crazy stuff.
