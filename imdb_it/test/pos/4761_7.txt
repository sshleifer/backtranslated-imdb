**** SPOILERS **** Buried by a mountain of medical expenses and his funeral failing to pull him out from under the gravedigger Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, he devised a plan to make a lot of money with the help of his two crooked friends, Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch and Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito is approaching his childhood friend Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a mass informer to win Buddy's trust and let Vito tell Vito what happens in the streets of New York regarding the mass activity. Buddy is a policeman who works in a sub pink NYPD sub, Seven Ups, who does things "their way" to clean up the streets of New York from criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito receives the information from Buddy and makes Buddy understand that he is indeed giving him advice on the mob and what is happening and using this information to tip his hooligan partners, Moon & Bo, to snatch criminals out of their weekly take and kidnap mob loan sharks and keep them for ransom. <br /> <br /> Everything is going well for Vito & Co. until the crowd decides to take revenge and wrongly seizes rhythms and kidnappings a member of the Seven Ups Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who worked undercover thinking he was one of the hoods that kidnapped them and tore them away. Later, Ansel was accidentally killed by Moon when he blew up the trunk of the car that Ansel blocked, thinking there was a full suitcase or cash, ransom. <br /> <br /> Fast-paced and exciting film with that gritty and dirty New York City photograph that was so effective in the movie "The French Connection" that features both Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco. Incredible car chase started in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of New Jersey about 15 or 20 miles away with Buddy almost ending to behead for his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a great man, is as tough and effective as any other action actor who can think of how Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, he also looks a bit like him, former middleweight and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer who beat the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight championship in 1957 and behaves like him in the film : durable and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is as good as Vito the undertaker, the lowlife heel that plays Buddy and the crowd to the point that leads to kill Ansel, Buddy's partner. Even if it's rubbish, you can't help feeling sorry for Vito because he only wants the money he gets from the robbed mobsters to pay for the Rose hospital and his wife's medical bills. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to get hurt, but as they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned. In the end Vito has a lot of explanations to do to the not so affectionate and caring mobsters. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Seven Ups" sees the late Bill Hickman do the dangerous stunts with car chases and act in the film. Hickman was also the stuntman of both great films that saw him ride on the streets and highways of New York and San Francisco "The French Connection" and "Bullitt".
