So the Koreans are now eliminating American horror films. But they are doing it in style. DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even has a small BILD'S PLAY that does it. Several young adults are invited to attend a special event in a gallery full of dolls, only to discover that they are targets of a vengeful spirit. Dolls come to life and do pretty nasty things to children. The level of gore is reasonably high, photography and set design and production values ​​are top quality, acting is not so bad and fears are certainly there. DOLL MASTER may not be in the same league with A TALE OF TWIS SISTERS or even DEAD FRIEND, but it is close. Give him a watch. You will not be disappointed.
