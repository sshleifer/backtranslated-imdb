Every American who thinks he understands World War II should see this movie. Few Hollywood films about war have challenged the stereotype of Japanese soldiers as brutes without emotions who obey orders without thinking. We like to think that every Japanese was ready and able to fight to the death, until the day we bombed Nagasaki. "Fires on the Plain" shows a different reality: pathetically underdeveloped, demoralized and hungry to the point of cannibalism. They speak euphemistically of human flesh as "monkey meat". The film and the novel it was based on also put to death the myth that Japanese soldiers preferred death to surrender: they had good reason to believe that their enemies weren't in the mood to take prisoners. For me it raises a question that most Americans would prefer to avoid: if the Japanese army was so downed at this point in the war, why was it necessary to bomb Hiroshima?
