I just saw "The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse" in a special screening in Manchester, with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith of the League in attendance. <br /> <br /> On the back was Peter Kay (who has a short cameo in the film) affectionately in a low voice during the question and answer session after the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was complicated (in a good way) and very very funny. It follows Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try to save the fictional Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of their creators. <br /> <br /> The League plays a wide range of characters and themselves (or characters based on themselves) and they are ably supported by the cream of British characters and comedians like Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner. <br /> <br /> Warner is a particular one that reminds me of his smooth and sharp turn over time Bandits'. <br /> <br /> The film swims in and out of various realities and allows some inhabitants of Rosyton Vasey to gain some space beyond their usual limits of their comedy film. <br /> <br /> Steve Pemberton's Herr Lipp has a great Bretchian moment towards the end of the film and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life that brings a lump in his throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with his tender affection for the characters. <br /> <br /> This echoes something that Mark and Reece said in the Q&A later, that the plot of the league is tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole movie is really a letter of love for them. <br /> <br /> For a format that started as a radio character - these sketches sketched the idea to support a film that takes you on a journey through fiction, "reality", comedy, tragedy and a pleasant journey for two of the less obvious characters who bring a long history form from their 70 strange existing creations. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show will love it. Pay the dedication and attention to detail in spades, the uninitiated can be a little lost, but the joy of the GG was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and make the stylistic leap in homage to the farce and the expressionist film. <br /> <br /> There are many tributes in this, including "The Shining" and "La Belle et la Bete", to name but two I have noticed and skillfully demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in England of 1690 that makes perfect sense when you're busy with the film. <br /> <br /> What can I say, I was amazed, amazed, emulated and giggled in everything and they surely brought out what many have failed. A successful British television comedy for film translation. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed "The League of Gentlemen" in the past, go see it; you will like it. <br /> <br /> If you don't have it, rent / buy a DVD and then go see it. <br /> <br /> Well done guys and thanks for the fascinating and fun Q&A.
