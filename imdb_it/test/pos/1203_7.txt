(May contain spoilers) I find myself disappointed by the criticism this film receives. Although it is certainly not perfect, it is much better than what has been given credit. Acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are fantastic; including the title number, "Where Do I Go?", "Easy to be Hard" and "Black Boys / White Boys". While I haven't seen the stage musical, I think it blurs the judgment of many. This is not the musical you see in theaters. Do not try to compare them. The theatrical musical could have been sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on the film, so it was necessary to add a plot. And the ending that was added is simply fantastic. The film made me feel like I had actually seen something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy on one level.
