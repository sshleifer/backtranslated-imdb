An exquisite film Simply don't make them any more! We have eavesdropped on a middle-high class family in Dublin in the early part of the 20th century. They are organizing a dinner after Christmas for their friends and relatives. Their speech at the table is just useless chatter, but it's so well written that one is absorbed. Away from the dining table, some piano sounds help create an intimate atmosphere as if you were there as one of the guests. Perhaps a little too perfect for an amateur player, the strange mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this movie. No real story but real entertainment and a lesson in objects for emerging filmmakers.
