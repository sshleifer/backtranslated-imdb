I watched this film as a child and continue to watch it every now and then for the nostalgia factor. When I was younger I loved the movie because of the funny storyline and interesting characters. Today I still love the characters. Furthermore, I think of the plot with more consideration because I now see morality and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is far from the worst movie ever, and even if it's old-fashioned, I'm sure I'll show it to my kids in the future when I have children.
