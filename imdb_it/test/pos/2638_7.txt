_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ is missing. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> Some others stan wrote the comment above. Obviously The Wild Life is not Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quintessence of the 80s. However, wild life is fun if you are not worried that mindless movies are mindless movies (especially when you know it should be a mindless movie in the first place). The small Latin of Scarface is in this film and is absolutely disrespectful ("I saw Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!") Also the colonel makes an appearance ("cause ..."). RIP The Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This film is not worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres, btw. It's not worse than a 7 in terms of other teenage comedies from the 1980s. He has a lot of the impression of a Cameron Crowe film. Only the staniels gave a 5.
