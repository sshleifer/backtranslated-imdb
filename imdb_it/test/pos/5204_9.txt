I recently saw this film in the hope of seeing an accurate portrait of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I got what I expected and more. Just to think that I ran into this movie fortunately, before I had never even heard of it. It's a German film made in 1993, so I guess it can't be surprising that it's almost completely unknown to the modern American public. It is a pity because this is really an extraordinary film, I would dare to say that it is good if not better than Platoon, Full metal jacket, Apocalypse now and All quiet on the western front; which are all iconic war films. <br /> <br /> 1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany dominated continental Europe and parts of North Africa, so Adolf Hitler ordered the large-scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fatal move that eventually defeats Nazi Germany. In the early stages the invasion is fine and the German armies conquer large areas of the Soviet territory, but in Stalingrad a critical battle is unleashed, a city that holds a great symbolic and strategic value. The battle soon turns into a bloodbath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both German and Russian soldiers fighting. On the verge of taking the city the Germans are suddenly counterattacked by the Russians who end up cutting the entire 6th German army at Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. The whole battle is seen through the eyes of some young German soldiers who fight for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions, but also against their own sadistic officers who only care about medals and glory and the generals who they have little regard for the average foot soldier. <br /> <br /> This movie will haunt me for a while. The German soldiers on which the film is concentrated are so young and naive, then their humanity and sanity are torn from them and you really feel sorry for them, because it is not the demoniac Nazis often portrayed in the film. Everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed was shattered, and having fought a gruesome battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad, we see them further deteriorate with the onset of winter, causing the death of many. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but also so real. It is amazing, at first we see the young boys who impose themselves in the midst of their lives, and in the end a shell of their past strips off everything. After witnessing so much carnage these men lost their will to survive, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler who eventually abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another of Hitler's crimes that leave the men who fought to be slaughtered by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war movie describes the horrors of war and this is what this film does. The battle for the tractor factory sequence It is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that is precisely what the Battle of Stalingrad was. German and Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only bad apples (particularly on the German side) that condemned men. The conclusion is that this film is surprising because we see how men break physically and emotionally during the war. We all have our limits and these men have been pushed far beyond their limits into the deadliest battle of our time. What the average soldier endured in Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they survived everything they had seen and done, they would be scarred for life. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why War is Hell, and exactly what hell looks like.
