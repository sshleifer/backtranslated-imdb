Fast Times is not. But watch this movie, it has a heart. Have a drink and have fun. It is loaded with a large number of newly started stars. Sherilyn Fenn has her first cameo credited on screen. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis, etc. - they all look so young. Oh, and if you look closely at the cop's wife, it's Nancy Wilson from rock band Heart.
