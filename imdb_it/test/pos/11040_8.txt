I loved great lighting and was warmed by this history of American working class society and life in seaports in the first half of the 20th century. I was attracted by the timeless intractability of this realistic performance. see and feel the power of the star. "Greek" melancholic comedy. Someone in the mood for a shot with a beer back? ... or a little ginger? Hey, water boy !!
