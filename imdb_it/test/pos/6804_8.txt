During the 13 years of school I attended from kindergarten through high school, there was only one day when my class took a trip. When I went to school, you went to school, from 8:30 am to 3:30 am and didn't take travel documents. But for some reason, I couldn't remember in this advanced age, we went to see a movie - National Velvet. I don't remember the film, so, on the eve of my 57th year, I decided to revisit it. <br /> <br /> It is a film about a time that no longer exists. A time when people trusted others and did not lock their homes. A time when people were given the benefit of the doubt. It was a time when the family was the most important thing. This film shows all this and more. Show love, trust and attention and the goodness of the people. <br /> <br /> It would not be a bad thing for every family to see this movie once in a while and discuss its message. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to see the young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at her best, the performance of Anne Revere, awarded with the Academy Award, Angela Lansbury before Murder, She Wrote and Donald Crisp, who played for almost sixty years. /> <br /> What a movie!
