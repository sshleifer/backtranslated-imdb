The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classical writers like Charles Dickens and contemporary writers such as Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both face the gloomy effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he had his successes and failures, but one of his shows that you can always count on: they will be something unique. Who would have thought that someone would write a musical about a barber who cut people's throats and turned them into meat pies? Sondheim did, and did it wonderfully. The entire show is set in a factory, to suggest the inevitable catastrophic effects of the misery of those who are at the base of society, and this perfectly meets the needs of the show. The walkways and railings are moved to suggest roads, walkways and bridges. The techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with visual skills and set changes. So to top it all, he casts the great Angela Lansbury in the role of the hideously practical and funny Mrs. Lovett, and George Hearn, with her baritone operatic voice, like the deadly Todd, and you got yourself a stellar musical vehicle. The rest of the cast moves perfectly through the clich√©s of the love story, with the exception of Johanna and Pirelli, who sound a little too forced. If Johanna and Pirelli of the Broadway show could be here, it would be perfect. Hearn recites while singing more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents don't seem forced here. Through all this, Sondheim's soundtrack never fails to emphasize the dark seriousness of the plot. As I said, it can adapt to any style. In Follies he imitates the 1930s style of the 1930s shows, in Pacific Overtures he captures the subtle art of Asian music, Into the Woods knocks at Disney-style 32-bar songs, and Assassins tells a story of American music. Here, however, he does wonders in making his music distinctly English, from spoken songs to duets and operatic soliloquies, to society waltzes, to the Gilbert / Sullivan style staking. Still, the show remains deadly serious, even if it causes more laughter than any musical comedy. In it still, it is a sad warning about the evils of revenge. This is where this film makes a mistake, in cutting the solo of the judge in which he scourges himself for the guilt for his crimes. Without it, the Judge is just a bad conventional, and the point of this film is that there are no upright villains. Both Todd and the judge learn, too late, the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything in his obsession. This is well evidenced by the icy revival of the tormented Ballad by Sweeney Todd, which ends the show with Todd and Lovett emerging from the tomb to tell us that the end is the same: in a world full of Sweeneys, revenge only generates revenge. "Participate in the tale of Sweeney Todd. He served a dark and vengeful God. Looking for revenge can lead to Hell, but everyone does it, and rarely like Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
