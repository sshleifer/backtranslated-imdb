After another raid on an empty village, the head of the Vikings Timandahaf misunderstands his councilor Cryptograf's explanation that "fear gives wings to the inhabitants" and believes that fear actually makes villagers fly. They decide to pursue the champion of fear in Gaul to learn to fly and make them invincible warriors. Meanwhile, Vitalstatistix's nephew, Justforkix, is sent by the Parisium to the Gallic village to become a man and Asterix and Obelix are assigned to train the young man. The stupid son of Cryptograf, Olaf, listens to a conversation of the coward Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. While returning to the Viking village, Justforkix meets Abba, Timandahaf's daughter, and they fall in love with each other. But the Machiavellian and ambitious Cryptograf plans to marry his son Olaf with Abba and become powerful. In the end, Asterix realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love. <br /> <br /> When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic book and I read all the stories of Goscinny and Uderzo. This film shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. The love story of Justforkix and the beautiful Abba is delicious and the situations in which Asterix and Obelix are involved are hilarious. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Astérix and os Vikings" ("Astérix and the Vikings")
