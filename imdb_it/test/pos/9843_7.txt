James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) has just started his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a school of youth reform run by corrupt politicians. Reform school inmates are minors disadvantaged on the streets of New York, such as the "East Side Kids" who were poor and indifferent during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, there is a process held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn that is set on fire and a big jump by the corrupt guardian. I noticed that they first got the horses out of the barn. This film is not shown very often and I can really understand why!
