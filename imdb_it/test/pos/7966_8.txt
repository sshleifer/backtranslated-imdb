Towards the end of his career Jack Arnold, a very efficient director who gave us the characteristics of classic creatures from the 50s like "He came from Outer Space", "The creature from the black lagoon" and "Tarantula", joined the 'former soccer star has become the main headliner of the blaxploitation movie of the 70s Fred "the Hammer" Williamson for a couple of films, producing the lovable, if not trivial western "The Black Bounty Hunter" and this variant of black action pleasantly lively, intelligent and very fun of the 70s over your 40 years standard noir spun by private detective. <br /> <br /> Williamson shows a fascinating combination of dry, self-deprecating humor and relaxed and casual ease like Shep Stone, a cheap, affable and forever Los Angeles ex-cop who has become a private investigator. Stone is so hard for the money that he uses a bar as a commercial office and can barely make ends meet with small cases of low salary that the police don't want to disturb. While striking the sidewalk of one of these deceptive concerts (Stone is trying to find the teenage daughter of someone hiding somewhere in Hollywood), Stone finds himself elbow in a complex, dangerous, seemingly bottomless crime plot that includes a Jesus out of mind. a fanatical religious cult; fresh. > <br /> While lacking in the mischievously playful and mischievous ingenuity of Robert Altman's masterful "The Long Goodbye" or the incessant and incessant pessimism of Arthur Penn's marvelous dark "Night Moves", "Black Eye" remains a welcome success hip'n'flip 70s run on thriller mysterious suspense of the 40s. Arnold's capable leadership maintains the rhythm in motion with a beautiful constant sequence, punctuated by sporadic and exciting hand-to-hand fight scenes and the excellent use of various weakly colored LA environments (the crumbling amusement park abandoned at the end of film is particularly effective). The script by Mark Haggard and Jim Martin provides a good amount of fairly complicated and often genuinely surprising twists. And the array of bizarre, crude and approximate secondary characters is a strange and extravagant group, with particularly remarkable turns by Rosemary Forsyth as a tempting and powerful owner of a lesbian agency (Forsyth has the best image line, boasting with Stone when the first time he meets him, "I am a lot of women"), Teresa Graves of the television series "Get Christie Love" as Stone's faithful, outlandish girl (the casual and non-judgmental description of the film is of the unconventional femme fatale of Foryth that of Graves in equal measure the atypical Friday is one of his strengths), and Bret Morrison, that has made the voice of the radio "The Shadow" in the years' 40, like a pleased porn director. All in all, he is a modest but confident winner.
