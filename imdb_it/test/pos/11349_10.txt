The most attractive factor found in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful main actors. Nor is it their exceptional acting and their sparkling chemistry. <br /> <br /> For me, it's the mis-en-scene of the whole movie. Settings, lighting, props ... everything adds to the mood for love between the main characters. A puff of smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind, Lizhen's changing cheongsam reflects the constraints of the decision-making process, the ruins of the Angkor Wat bonds with the deterioration of the relationship between the two protagonists. /> <br /> The excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film the right amount of feeling needed to enrich the complicated nature of the characters' relationship. The film unnecessarily leaves the public to want more.
