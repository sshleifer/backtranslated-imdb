'Traffik', despite the title, is not about drugs. In the best tradition of the crusade of the British television drama, "Traffik" analyzes and moralizes its apparent argument, which is not a mythical scourge, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and effects. There is something almost scientific in the way the film takes four sets of characters from world-class and dramatically separate world backgrounds - a poppy farmer forced into the Pakistani underworld by poverty and a cynical government; the Englishman, a former Olympic swimmer of a drug baron on trial for trafficking in human beings; two grumpy German policemen whose determination to condemn the second derives as much from class rage as from any belief in the law; and a Tory pastor, whose Cambridge student daughter has become an addict. <br /> <br /> Traffik is an educational game without remorse, from the first scenes of Jack Lithgow in Pakistan, which investigated the government's success in eliminating drugs before sanctioning more British help, we are bombarded with facts about the problem . But these "facts" come from a variety of sources - disguising government representatives; left-wing lawyers with interests (ideological and domestic) acquired in corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. <br /> <br /> The facts, normally the reassuring markers on a map, are clearly not enough: the more facts we get, the less the situation seems to be controllable. It is not until Jack, the moral center of the film, the man who connects all the narrative threads, actually travels to the heart of drug darkness, learns to shed his hypocrisy tory (deploring the use of drugs, but refusing to put any serious money into tackling the problem and creating conditions, through various free market initiatives, in which drug trafficking flourishes, just as the antiheroes of Warner's old gangster films were actually American capitalist models, so the traffikers are the ideal Thatcher and Reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be recognized. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Traffik" is not about drugs. As Jack finally recognizes, after being fired as Minister Tory, the drug is not really the problem. It is a society dismantled by a woman who said that there is nothing like it (as demonstrated by the non-existent family life of Jack), systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness, increasing the number of those who turn to drugs . <br /> <br /> The most terrifying thing about "Traffik" is not the graphic and numbing images of drug addiction (whose technical detail ironically reflects the presentation of more "legitimate" verbal information), but the dystopian views a Britain stripped of all joy, beauty or community, a desolate wasteland of abandoned houses and soulless modernity, a society of defeatists ready for smugglers and barons thatcherite to do their job. <br /> <br /> This is not just a contemporary British story: it records the decline of an empire built on trade reduced to lawless drug trafficking. It is certainly significant that the other sites in the program are Germany and Pakistan, crucial agents in the decline of the Empire. Here the old imperial amorality returns home, the previously enslaved victims, their bodies abused by the power of their masters, returning to the imperial center, London, the seeds of its decline literally transported into their bodies, embodying the fears of all those late 19th century Gothic novels. <br /> <br /> Traffik is one of the great achievements of British TV and is in many ways superior to the recent Hollywood remake. Political attention is obviously more acute - Jack's decline is much more effective than Wakefield's because he, as an agent of government policy, as well as a bad father, is part of the problem, while the only real political mistake of the America is complacency. In almost all cases, the characterization is narrower and much more plausible (compare Lindsay Duncan's timid Helen, already bitten by experience and failure, and her resonantly superficial counterpart). <br /> <br /> Unlike the dubious underground current of "Traffic" (making Mexico obscure and Other, the last horror of WASP being sex with a black man), the portrait of Pakistan is rich, tragically designed, with disconcerting arguments about drug protection punctuated by scenes of gruesome violence. In all, the inextricable link between public and private is expert. Visually, the film is extraordinarily creative, without ever being flashy or "cinematic", especially in the last episode, in which the buildings and the furnishings seem to move while the system closes. If "Traffik", like its remake, feels the need for earth fragments, then the prevailing sense of waste and loss is far more overwhelming, Jack's speech desperately desperate.
