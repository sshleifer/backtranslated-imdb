I saw this movie when I was a kid and I've been looking for it ever since. It's worth staying with Cabin in The Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as you can see in the movies that show the fantastic talent of African Americans. In the 1960s local Los Angeles television stations would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same film for 5 days. Orgy and Bess were one of them and my whole family would be there every 5 nights in front of the TV and only moved into advertisements. South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all musical classics that you can find in any video store. It would be a shame to let this collection of some of the best talents that America had to offer was forgotten or locked in a vault. Please make the film available to the public.
