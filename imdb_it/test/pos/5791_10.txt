First of all this film is a piece of reality very well done artistically. A sort of combination of "American Beauty" and "As Good as get". And of course something specific for all Russian films (obviously the precious one, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of man's loneliness ... Particularly recommended for people who really want to see beyond any vomit propaganda about communism (whether positive or negative propaganda!). A film about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially for young people, fear when touching the real and too dirty face of society ... and false "solutions": alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution: true love ... Obviously it is very "localized" in the space and time of the "Russian perestroika" but it is valid for the whole society (except a perfect one, but don't worry - it is not possible to find this on our Earth!). For the last time - definitely recommended ...
