My son Adam (5 years) is a big Scooby Doo fan. He really likes this movie. He particularly liked when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The score is his choice and reflects his love for the characters. <br /> <br /> After first seeing the movie "Vampire Rock", this, not surprisingly, was very similar in that they repeated a well-worn basic plot in a different setting. <br /> <br /> Few adults will encounter this without having their memories of the TV cartoon series and even less will watch it without children. You like it or like it. I loved Scooby Doo for half an hour as a child, I'm glad my son loves it, now I can stand it.
