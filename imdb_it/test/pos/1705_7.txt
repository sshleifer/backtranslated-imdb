I have mixed emotions about this film, especially when compared to its precursor, <br /> <br /> "An American Werewolf in London". That movie had funny moments, it was even more a tale of horror than anything else. This updated version, now set in Paris, doesn't have that "edge" and it's simply not in the same class ... but it has some positive things that the first film didn't have and overall it's still fun to watch. <br /> <br /> So, aside from the "werewolves purists", most of whom think this film is pure junk compared to the London version, I will still give them decent grades because I don't care what others think. I liked it though I agree that "London" is better and I prefer that version too. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this film are rigorously reproduced for laughter, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. It also introduces the female protagonist, played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. It doesn't look like you make a lot of movies, or at least the ones I've heard here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film has points to have it inside, and it looks beautiful. <br /> <br /> When the horror begins, it can be scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of vulgarity in this film, unlike the first: without words and without the name of the Lord in vain - incredible! <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of sexual comments and there is a scene with a guy running out of a bar tied to a cross that was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal which is not attractive to a middle-aged boy like me. This film is much more oriented towards 20-somethings, if that helps someone. <br /> <br /> It's fun ... just don't expect me to live until the first movie.
