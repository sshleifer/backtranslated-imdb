This long-awaited memory of Rush's DVD visit to South America in 2002 is probably the best rock video ever recorded on the record. The values ​​of image and sound production are surprising, especially as they have constantly fought the elements to bring this production. All the songs you would expect from the RUSH catalog are here, from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, gloriously reproduced for the frankly and orgiastic Brazilian crowd. They actually refer to YYZ, which is a tool and gives you an indication of their fervor! disco is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi-angle sets - the Villa Strangiato, YYZ and the fantastic drum solo, plus a 30-minute documentary on the band's visit to Brazil. All in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.
