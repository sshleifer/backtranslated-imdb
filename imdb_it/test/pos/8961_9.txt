I'm not exactly sure how accurate this movie is, but I can tell you that I was completely entertained by this movie. the burst character, played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique, but entertaining characters in recent memory. this film was informed, but managed to avoid preaching to the public. made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive and happy to spend time watching the movie. it does not take time to understand what is happening and takes you on a roller coaster of genuine and human emotions. I thought I knew my story, apparently I didn't know at all! I give this move 9 out of 10, and I recommend it to all adults, and young adults, and to young at heart, not just to young people. but as soon as they are allowed to see films with "r" classification, make it a priority.
