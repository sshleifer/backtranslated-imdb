It is a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as the dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German romantics such as E. T. Hoffman and others. In "Der Mude Tod" by Fritz Lang (also from 1921) Death personified drives a young man away from his love, but in Lang's film the fate of the characters cannot be mitigated by the behavior. None of the young lovers deserve to die, but it is destined for circumstances to meet only in death. <br /> <br /> In Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlen", however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and delayed death - through the choices of the characters. Although the scenes of the Ghost Carriage that collect souls are truly disturbing, these horrible images of Death as the great leveler are compromised by the Redemption offer of Death to the true monster of this story, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to all those with whom it comes into contact. <br /> <br /> A New Year's Holm is defeated in a fight with a drinking buddy. As the first person to die at the stroke of midnight, Holm must become the Ghost Transport driver and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, led by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on his way to ruin, comes to his soul and takes him on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who have tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerl√∂f novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape his fate and see his repentance arrive too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by gathering their souls . It would have been an appropriate punishment and more immense horror than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny is not the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to his body and save his family at the right time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge repentance in "A Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> If the banal and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the images of the film. The special effects are amazing when measured by the standards of the day, and continue to hold up, which is more miraculous considering that these double exposures were created inside a crank camera. Furthermore, the restored film on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.
