I like the phrase "post-war British suburban paranoia" used by one of the reviewers. He describes so well the kind of films that John Mills has excelled in ("The October Man" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952)) between "grande" ("Scott of the Antartic" (1948) and "War" and Peace "(1956). <br /> <br /> This distinctly" Eric Ambler "style plot saw John Mills play Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises his friend, Charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport, a gruesome "reporter" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is in his consulting classrooms at that time and offers to give him a ride but while he is monitoring the actress, Windsor informs him that he is already in the car waiting !!! (something strange is happening !!!). Howard is left for his appointment and he doesn't think about it anymore. <br /> <br /> The night after he finds his body when he gets home from work, he also discovers that his friend Charles could not have called him as he is still in New York and Windsor does not seem to exist stere. Earlier on a patient, Ms. Ambler (Rene Ray) to whom was reported by dr. George Kimber (Mervyn Johns) tells of his recurring dream of finding a corpse and a brass candlestick with a square base. It's a nightmare that is becoming reality for Howard, but obviously when the Detective Inspector Dane (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies any knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is then found in Howard's Daimler trunk. <br /> <br /> When Howard is lying, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself a "friend" - he has a picture of Windsor that he wants to mistake for a box of matches that Frieda gave Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles plays and while Howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the games !!! Who can trust - who doesn't have something to hide !!! <br /> <br /> This is a top thriller - not really in the same class as "The October Man", but with John Mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men trapped in impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
