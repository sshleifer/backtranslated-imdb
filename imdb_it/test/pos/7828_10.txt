Without doubt a great all-round show that if shown today would attract a huge following. The guardians of the body were only 6 episodes and a trailer, but they still deserved some series to really bring it to speed. With outstanding performances of great talent and versatility Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard, he really did it with the likes of Proffesionals, The Sweeney and Thief Takers. The narrative lines are based on diplomatic protection services and with large scenes of films and scenes and stage locations, outside a part of the garbage that is shaken by other television production houses. I don't think it was even shown on terrestrial TV, like Sky or Freeview, the witch is a shame as if it were to be shown today, I am sure she would get a large viewing audience. I hope one day the Carlton TV guys decide to release it on DVD, cheers, Nick.
