The Assignment is an exceptional thriller with several character-driven twists rather than star turns, the need to stage special effects, mandatory romance and endless pursuits. However, there is a car chase here, and a dandy is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful both as the terrorist and the naval officer "recruited" to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third level actor, like Quinn, has an important leading role like this one that brings a movie. Usually, such a role is assigned to an A-list actor with the box office draw, which is probably why I never heard of this movie before seeing it. Donald Sutherland is as big as the morally ambiguous, sometimes gruesome agent who recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is also fine as an Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are more plots, which gradually converge towards the end, and not all at once, as we are used to seeing. The paranoia and claustrophobia of this type of thriller are captured and portrayed with moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The positions are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but we rarely get all the qualities mentioned above in these days, without stupid and / or meaningless plot developments; the unconvincing star turns; noisy, annoying, music video soundtracks; a villain who held him; and many times a cast, the costumes and the plot that are aimed primarily at an audience under 25. It is an exceptional thriller, which surely did not get its debut at its release. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
