On its surface, this is one of the most classic and amusing action / comedy / novel I have seen in a long time, remembering the pleasant old "Saturday afternoon" films that had the right balance of unexpected twists, well- timed humor and integrated action. Beyond this, however, is our knowledge of the context of this film. It has the same elements as "Casablanca", but it is set just before many of the characters would really understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their behavior. This adds a strong note of humor to humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future). This is a movie you won't regret watching.
