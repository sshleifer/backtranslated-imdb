Focus is another great film starring William H. Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo and saw some of his films and he still hasn't deceived me. Macy is the archetype "good guy with something to hide". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a faithful and hardworking faithful, who hosts his handicapped mother at home. The scene is set after the Second World War, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of human resources for a company that is fundamentally anti-Semitic. After accidentally hiring a woman of Jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve his failed sight. <br /> <br /> Incredibly, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unfolds, Newman will begin to see a completely different world, where being a Jew is like being an animal. <br /> <br /> The film is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something quite normal. The chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is.
