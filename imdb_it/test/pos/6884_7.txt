The "Puppet Master by Yong-ki Jeong only with scary parts" was the most recent Korean horror film I had the pleasure of watching. With the title of "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, this film struck me immediately when I saw it reviewed online, with images that made me think of Puppet Master, Childs Play and other horror movies based on toys / dolls in the past. But for some reason I didn't think .. "Boy, this will be bad taste", I imagined it would be creepy and funny. The Toysome horror went very well. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, but I like it, so it was fine. The soundtrack, almost as I found it with Acacia, was beautiful and reminded me a lot of the classic horror scores of the past. I won't give much, but the story has been strong in this, and I highly recommend it to all fans of Asian HORROR. It is not extreme, it must not be taken with the utmost seriousness, but it is really good.
