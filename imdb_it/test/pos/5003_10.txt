This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. That usual chair (sofa for a woman) guest, that obligatory band that plays monotonous melodies, the same old beats, the same pattern copied from the times of Nebuchadnezzer .... probably the scheme of Johnny Carson, copied by one and all, Latterman , Leno, Conan ... Daly, this show doesn't seem to have any of this. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I'm going to follow it. Although it is too early to say, this show seems to have no intellectual pretensions that most talk shows try so hard to project, and I hope this is what will make this show different from everything else. I hope this show lasts a long time! <br /> <br /> Going back after months, I still love this show, and I love his self-deprecating humor (For example, his claim that only the solitary potheads would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and therefore, the jokes are fun only for the stoned types) which, however, does not involve the usual monkeking of Conan O'Brien, for example (I know it is a capital sin to be rejected by O 'Le antics di Brien, but I don't like very his style and repetitiveness). <br /> <br /> I looked at him again the other night with Tom Arnold. The parody of the Trading spouses (and Ferensen's Nanny 911 in a previous episode) is hilarious. The idiot paparazzi are funny, especially when a security guard warns them against taking photos of people, and (if I'm not mistaken) they start taking pictures of him shouting "Gary Coleman". <br /> <br /> Added April 16, 2007: Returning once again, I was confused by the neighbor and his dog. I can't decide if it's a joke or a real thing. However, it was fun to die for. <br /> <br /> I don't expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe it does. He's crazier than a bunch of monkeys, so I'd like to write my suggestion here for him: I'd like him to do a 30-minute show with Crazy Gideon, the late-night TV advertising star. I wish Crazy Gideon would interview Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play the guitar), make a skit in the SNL line, and even answer the audience's questions about his potential Los Angeles paternity (I know, Crazy Gideon you may not be aware of this, but there are websites that explain why you would be the perfect candidate for the office of mayor of LA). <br /> <br /> God willing! <br /> <br /> Going back on July 14th 2007: someone has written here that the people who praised Spike's talkshow must be corrupted by Spike. I confess Spike really corrupted me, but I also have to confess that Rockefeller mentioned me in his will and I had sex with Cindy Crowford last night.
