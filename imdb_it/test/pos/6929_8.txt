I like Dylan Moran from his work in Black Books, although I found some of his stand-up to be really forgiving in terms of long and confusing gaps ... however, I was intrigued to see this film with him and Michael Caine and curiosity got the best of me. <br /> <br /> I was amazed. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal range and the characterization of the different people he played in the film were absolutely perfect, something beyond the capabilities of a simple comedian and really equal with Alec Guinness, John John and the other greats - was really skilled in his portrait. Michael Caine was a very convincing first woman and the standard British movie the fact of having a precocious child on hand to be too wise and withered worked - the only aspect that I didn't really like was the incredible chemistry plot between Dolores and the tough man of the cockney gangsta played by Dylan. <br /> In addition to this, it was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I also like the end without ends, it's always happy and happy, but with MC who beat. OK, it's not exactly being stuck by your gooli and gutted beijng (which is what a real criminal boss would do to you if you took 50k from them) but showed at least a small measure of reality in history. /> <br /> I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone - but I would also like to warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a little slow. If you protect it, everything will come back. <br /> <br /> And as for the oath, I'm in Ireland. It would not be true otherwise.
