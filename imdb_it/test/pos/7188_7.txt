The line above sums up very well. The best comic book resources are visual gags and word jokes (the latter are almost impossible to translate, which is why comics are at their best in their original language). <br /> <br /> Both are quite difficult to capture in the film, and that's why those will never be as good as comics. Films are simply a different medium from comics. With this in mind, this film does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of comics. <br /> <br /> The word gag is bearable, and sometimes even funny (Debouze refers to Amelie!). I must say that I looked at the French version. If you don't look at the French version or your lack of understanding of the French language, it limits you to subtitles, the word jokes will probably suck. <br /> <br /> Even the slapstick is fine; it's a very simple form of humor, and not very funny when you're over twelve, but it captures the spirit of comics. The other visual jokes are the saving grace of the film for the older audience, as they are often quite funny. <br /> <br /> Acting is totally exaggerated, but again, it is not at all annoying because it captures the spirit of comics. Only Depardieu and Clavier are not totally guilty, which may be why some people think they don't appreciate their roles (I didn't notice anything). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich turn into an art form. It's actually fun to watch. Once again, I'm afraid it wouldn't be as much fun when the rumors are nicknamed. <br /> <br /> Overall it is not a bad film at all, much better than the previous one. It's not a classic and it doesn't dethrone The Twelve Tasks of Asterix like my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. The French version, that is. 7/10
