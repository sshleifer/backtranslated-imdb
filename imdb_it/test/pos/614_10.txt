I expected it to be good, after seeing some good moments at Ozon and reading a lot about this ... but this film is brilliant, intelligent, very bright (emotionally and far-sighted), perfect at all times. every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so tightly and primordially true and honest. this is the film about beauty and innocence; it's simplicity
