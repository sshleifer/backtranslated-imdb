10 respected directors made a short film with opera arias as inspiration (and music). I will do it separately: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about a 1931 assassination attempt in Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs' wife) plays a man! Not bad, very beautiful and exotic Russell is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Verdi. No story, but there are some disturbing black and white images that fit the music perfectly. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Useless, boring, no plot, nothing at all. Full of free female nudity. The worst! <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris play in this amusing, albeit obvious, story of a couple who cheats. Quite good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, lush and romantic. Very good. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Boring. A yawn. <br /> <br /> Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. This has Bridget Fonda in her debut film. Love story beautifully made with a fairly explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really weird but OK. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical look at youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /> <br /> The last one is by Bill Bryden doing "I Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!) Dressed as a clown who synchronizes his lip with Caruso (!!!). <br /> <br /> When he came out he almost got an X score (for the abundant nudity and sex scene). An R was given with a strict warning stating that the R rating would be heavily applied. After the movie bombed that warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 out of 10 segments were worth it. It's worth seeing even if you don't like the work. Avoid the Godard segment. I am giving an 8.
