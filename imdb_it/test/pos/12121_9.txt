Great movie about an American G.I. Who leaves the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. Do you accept, but do it because you really like it, or because you can support it with easier access to food and so on? Meanwhile, his brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called the werewolves, their purpose of driving out the occupants (one might recall that the same group played an important role in Lars von Trier's Europe film (Zentropa) ). James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the 1980s television program The Dukes of Hazzard, is surprisingly excellent as the American. Should he become a big movie star ?? at this age it reminds me a lot of Warren Beatty. The other main actors are also good. Fuller's direction is quite good, still using many long scenes (although they are not as complex as they were in Park Row, long pauses most often consist of long scenes with many dialogues). The only problems are in the script, as seems to be the case with all the Fuller films I have seen. It's not too bad, but it should have been expanded, enriching the main characters and parts of the script. Helga, his wife, undergoes a major change, but completely off the screen. Therefore, the emotional center rests directly on Best's shoulders. Even Fuller was supposed to kill the sick mother at the beginning of the film. I hope you don't look too hard! It simply does nothing for the whole movie except in bed. It has so few lines. But Fuller continues to pull it up while the movie goes on. I would have had his death to consolidate myself the relationship between David and Helga. And the film ends too abruptly, and no compensation. These aren't really the biggest flaws in the world (the way I described them makes them look bigger than them). 9/10.
