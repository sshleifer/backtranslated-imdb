This is a film that should be seen and treated as a work of art. This is an unclean work of love of the Schrader brothers on the life of Yukio Mishima who is full of truly artistic elements. The film moves from color to black and white, from the past to the present, works of fantasy by Mishima to him. All without getting confused at all. The only thing I can do is that the whole movie, except for the spoken parts of the narrator, is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but has not found won. Criterion, if you are reading this, this is a movie that should be published under your footprint with all the possible extras. This film deserves more. 10/10
