This show was so grueling to watch and there are only two issues Drowned World (Substitute For Love) and Paradise (Not For Me) where you can sit and contemplate everything. The opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually exciting, while Madonna will go up on stage through a giant Swarovski crystal ball that descends from the ceiling and the huge screens behind her show images of galloping horses. Horses have a role in this show due to the fall of one of Madonna. Madonna's infamous scene on the crucifix is ​​in this show as a huge screen counts up to 12 million, the number of how many African children have been orphaned because of AIDS. Eventually a web address arrives for anyone interested in donating. We then enter the theme of the environment and are shown again images of politics and religion. There is an intermezzo and then the show starts again from the music of I Love New York and Ray of Light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers who make funny movements with the hand. Towards the end there is the number of music with the song Disco Inferno mixed with the song and the dancers make known more than there presence. The finale is full of energy again when the show closes with the Lucky Star and Hung Up melodies and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Did you confess?" It comes out. The DVD is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack of the show was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did a great job with the movie for this show, keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.
