There are a limited number of fans for films in the world that would love a particular genre to go in depth that this group has done to give life to something that the author of the original film had, up to this point, never reached. This is a wonderful exploration of the true dedication and love it takes to reach a potentially successful cult film. <br /> <br /> Originally, with the blessings of Alex Cox, this troupe began producing the sequel to one of his absolute punk style films. Their goal is simply to fully capture the atmosphere as it should be for a complete tribute to the original film "Repo Man". <br /> <br /> This is a great story of dedication and betrayal that can occur along the way to the wonderful film production. A really funny story and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.
