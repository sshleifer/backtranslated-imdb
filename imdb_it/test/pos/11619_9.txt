First of all - this film will not be for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images which, by their very nature, will extinguish many potential potential spectators. Obviously from the reviews on this forum - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY has divided those who have seen it. They are among those who really enjoyed it for several reasons. I think this was a very ambitious (and quite competitive) undertaking for a group of 18/19 years with no budget and little experience. I think that every aspect of the film - the direction, the acting (even if the character's performances are more comparable to the stage or to the free form due to the nature of the film ...) the production, the FX, the score / design sound : all are far superior to many films I have seen that exceed the budget of these children and have tenfold tenfold. Honestly, I haven't been very impressed with a horror-style "art house" movie since Nacho Cerda's GENESIS ... <br /> <br /> First of all - I'm not going to pretend to understand and / or to understand all of the graphic content of this film - but knowing that it was not a direct narrative film when I went there, I was not disappointed by how it went. SUBCONSCIOUS CHRONOLOGY is 4 relatively short vignettes that revolve around the theory of the right brain / left brain / anger / psychosis vs. desire theory. moderation / compassion / "normality". To briefly summarize a synopsis of each "chapter": <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL basically has only one naked girl who has an eyeball cut off from her abdomen. I'm sure it's symbolic of something - I don't think I paid so much attention to that point and it struck me quite quickly. <br /> <br /> The next "episode" - HARAN LARVAE - is a nihilistic, horrible, genuinely creepy story about a boy who is in love and rejected by his pregnant sister, who yields in his growing psychosis that leads to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter. HARAN LARVAE is the best of the group in my book and will probably fit into your skin. The dead-pan narrative dialogue accentuates the growing tension when you know that something horrible is about to happen, but you're not quite sure what it is. Do yourself a favor and if you're interested in seeing this movie, don't do too much research on it. Come with an open mind and an iron stomach and I think you will be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode. <br /> <br /> REBIRTH has a group of people in a field that breaks up the ground and blows trees and things. Apparently an "artistic" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something like that. Not bad, but this is also quite short and I lost the point on this ... <br /> <br /> And RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to talk about religion and religious hypocrisy and also with HARAN LARVAE, has some of the images / "more difficult" messages of the entire function ... <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL is not something to write about at home, mainly because of the very short execution time, but the madness follows quite a come ... and REBIRTH is also a bit short and not entirely challenging, but HARAN LARVAE (in particular) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so off-the-wall and well made that more than compensating for the other parts. I think the main reason I liked it so much is that "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive" as it is, it's also done very well and you can say that it was a real job of love on the part of those involved Nothing in the film seems cheap or rushed, and even if the content is not completely decipherable, it is undeniably original - and this alone are the points of my book. Not that every "bizarre" movie that has an unintelligible plot has to be praised for its "originality", but SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is the kind of film that I think I'll look at some other time in the near future to see what other performances I could get from it. Once again, this film is ABSOLUTELY not for everyone - with VERY extreme scenes of blood, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious imagination, etc ... which is certainly there to shock the viewer to take a more difficult look at this film. I must say that it worked for me, and I look forward to the Hussain / Cerda collaboration that is said to come later. Check this out if you have the stomach for this - 9.5 / 10
