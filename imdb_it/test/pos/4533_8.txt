I think every critic who killed off "Tommy Boy" when he was released in 1995 should go back to watching him and learn that it's not a bad movie at all. Each critic filmed the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes, "Coneheads" was fun, but a bit had a premise about a joke and "Black Sheep" I agree with is one of the worst films ever made. But "Tommy Boy" does not fall into the category of "Coneheads" which could have been a little more fun and "Black Sheep", which is a piece of tripe. It's very funny and fun. I agree with the criticism that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy as he claimed to have idolized those boys and those kids had a genius for comedy but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he was around longer to show to the critics that yes, it was not John Belushi, or John Candy, but it was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are hilarious and the premise is also a hilarious laugh. It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh, but we have films like "Tommy Boy" to remember how funny he really was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of the 90s.
