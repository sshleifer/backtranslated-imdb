Reality before TV reality? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A forerunner of "Say Anything" which is gray? I can't decide, but the soundtrack is * from the 80s - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie and U2 - I can't believe it, they would never have thrown all those genres together in a teenage movie today. <br /> <br /> I remembered him as a teenager, especially the sexual parts and not a hint of altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 1980s. Looking at him again, I can't describe how much I like that Rose, played by Kimberly Richardson, turns out to be the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 1990s, and she was almost 30 when she was in Last American Virgin, playing alongside the sixteen year olds - fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a sincere cherry on top.
