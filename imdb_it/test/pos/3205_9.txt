I really like this show. It has drama, romance and comedy all in one. I am 28 years old and a married mother, so I can identify both Lorelei and Rory's experiences in the show. I've been watching reps on the Family Channel lately, so I'm not up to date on what's happening now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there will have fun! I really like it to be an hour and not a half hour, while the hour seems to fly when I'm looking at it! Give it a chance if you've never seen the show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters on the show, especially because of the way they are with one another. How could you not see that there was something (or take so long to see it, I guess I should say)? <br /> <br /> Enjoy it!
