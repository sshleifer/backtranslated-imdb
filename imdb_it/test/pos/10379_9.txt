I don't know why some people complain about this film as it is not a comedy and at the same time too unrealistic. If it had been realistic, there certainly wouldn't have been much comedy. Also, I don't think a comedy needs to make you laugh out loud twenty times. There was a lot of subtle humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank just played a dream character. In real life, there are many people whose facial expression doesn't change much, so Kim Frank kept his state perfectly in place. The ending was quite unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It is a carefree film with a pleasant ending. I liked it. I really liked it. A serious part was that Krueger went to Schwedt and I'm glad they didn't show what happened there. Showing how it was when he came back, he made it very clear.
