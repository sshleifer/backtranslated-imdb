A ghost story about a typical Turkish high school with a beautiful sound and visual effects. Taylan Biraderler (brothers taylan) had made their first shots on a TV show a couple of years ago, as far as I know. It was a kind of Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories but lacked visual effects. This time they seem to have what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh for sure, and may even be afraid. It has a pleasant plot and some young and brilliant actors. If you are a high school student in Turkey, here you will find so many things about you. In the film there are many clues about its history and its ending, some you understand at the moment, some will make sense later, the dialogues have been written very cleverly. So these make the film one of the best Turkish films made in recent years. Don't forget, this film is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
