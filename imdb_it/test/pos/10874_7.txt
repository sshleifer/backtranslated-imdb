I don't know if I would go so far as to say that this film belongs to the 'Aussie trash' bunch, but it is fair to say that there are no Oscar candidates here. What needs to be considered is that most of the actors in this film were not actually actors as such, just boys with nothing better to do at the time. There were many others who offered roles in the film, but refused to go surfing on the coast; all the things taken into consideration, it wasn't really a bad movie for his time. In some ways it is not very different from today's times, where peer pressure is still alive and well, apart from cell phones, computers and other similar gadgets that children lived without, unlike this generation. Anyway, I have to evaluate this movie like an old favorite that I look at once in a blue moon and never take it too seriously ...
