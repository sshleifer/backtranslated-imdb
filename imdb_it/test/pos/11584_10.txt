As I expected it would happen, too many reviews of this film (from professionals and amateurs) have focused so much if not more on the ideology of the film. This is because The Sea Inside (aka Mar adentro) is a film about euthanasia. In particular, it is a true story of an infamous Galician named Ramón Sampedro, who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide, who was denied this right by the Spanish constitutional court, and who - well, I don't want to ruin the movie ending for you. <br /> <br /> The real life Sampedro has catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with the producer / director / screenwriter / composer / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997, and The Others, 2001) "biopic", The Sea Inside, another rhetorical help was provided in the international debate on this topic. <br /> <br /> But as I keep saying (to deaf ears), your opinion, for or against, about the film's ideology should not influence your assessment of the film. You should not evaluate the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make. You should rate the film as a movie. Maybe it's a bit too idealistic, since none of us can probably completely separate our assessments from our ideological prejudices, but idealistic or not, that's the goal. <br /> <br /> So forget the philosophical and political issues for a moment. As a film, Amenábar has transformed one of his most elegant and mature works to this day. It does not focus on the debates of society. It does not focus on Sampedro's legal / political struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man, living his days confined to a bed in his brother's house. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, played here in an extraordinary performance by Javier Bardem, was a quadriplegic. At the beginning of the film, he was a quadriplegic for 26 years. This condition was determined, as Amenábar shows us through wonderfully shot flashbacks, from a diving accident - Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, miscalculated water, dived, broke the neck and almost drowned. As a quadriplegic, he eventually started writing poems, some of which were published in a book called Cartas Desde El Infierno ("Letters from Hell"); in real life the book by Sampedro has become a best seller in Spain. Perhaps inspired by the artistic work of Sampedro, Amenábar has created an elegantly poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of The Sea Inside is set in Sampedro's bedroom. The attention in these scenes is the complex and sublime performance of Bardem. As a quadriplegic, Bardem merely moves his head and speaks. He mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a profound character with a multifaceted intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenábar have Sampedro often philosophize in a discreet manner, but there is always a combination of an evil sense of humor, a passion for aesthetics - including music and women, and a sadness and even occasionally not much bitterness to below the surface. Different underlying emotions occasionally spread like waves on the ocean's skin. <br /> <br /> The people that Sampedro interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways. These others include his sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who was his chief guardian after the Sampedro incident; his brother José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the vocal objectors of Sampedro's desire to die, and with whom there is an underlying unresolved problem (it seems that perhaps José was the only one to save Sampedro from drowning ?); his nephew, Javier (Tamar Novas), who is perhaps the most understanding of him; a defender of the right to death, Gené (Clara Segura); a pro bono lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), who wanted because he had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), and would therefore be more empathetic, and of who falls in love; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman who works as a conservative and moonlight as a DJ, who has heard about him from the media, who wants to convince him to want to live and who falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> Most of the film consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his room. There are also some other ancillary characters, including Sampedro's father, who remains strangely distant, and a priest known and attentive to the media, Father Francisco (José María Pou), who does his best to change Sampedro's mind through philosophy / theology (in a scene often erroneously characterized as "comic" - has a comic element, but the scene is mainly very serious. <br /> <br /> The fact that most of the film takes place in Sampedro's room gives ingeniously to the couple significant changes in setting a greater impact. Sampedro's room has a beautiful, large window, which claims to be satisfied as a vantage point on the world.Maybe even more important, regularly imagine the window as a springboard through the which flies through the hills to the ocean, which he has always loved, and which was the most influential force of his life - he provided his life when he was younger and took away the its mobility. Amenábar gives us a fantastic sequence of Sampedro that imagines one of his flights to the sea. It is magnificently filmed, with low angles (presumably from a helicopter) of the rolling hills, until we follow a stream to the open ocean, which in this film represents freedom, infinity and natural forces. <br /> <br /> The other significant change of setting comes with Sampedro who finally goes in a wheelchair (otherwise he refused them, saying that they "laughed at his immobility") to make an appearance in court to help plead his case. Amenábar gives us a moving, melancholic travel diary, subjectively shot, by Sampedro that observes life and the world in action from the car window. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not, it's hard to deny that this is a well-acted, well-scripted and well-constructed film. You might not believe it's a ten (and this is even more unlikely if you don't agree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's still worth looking at as a fine example of artistic and sophisticated film production.
