I really enjoyed this movie and usually don't like animated images. But I thought cats were attractive and the plot was fascinating. There is a beautiful song called "Everyone wants to be a cat", it's very funny. It has some comic moments and it's an interesting adventure. I think it could be a passionate cat lover to enjoy this movie.
