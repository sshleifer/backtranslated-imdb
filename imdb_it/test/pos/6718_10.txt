Danny Boyle was not the first to understand that zombies can run like hitters. That honor belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the largest vampire zombie in the bare space of Halley's Comet that is unleashed in the never-ending film of the end of London. Tobe Hooper may have done a lot of crap, but for this science fiction and deliriously insane horror deserves a place among the immortals. It also offers the space vampire Mathilda May, the best thing that comes out of France from Simone Simon, passing the entire naked film. Which she does very, very well. Remember that while she is the most overwhelming female presence anyone on Earth has ever encountered, she is also "totally alien to this planet and to our life form and totally dangerous". It was a launch meeting I wanted to sit on: The astronauts from the British space program found three alien humanoid life forms in a giant 150-mile artichoke / umbrella-shaped umbrella ship hidden in the comet's tail of Halley full of giant dried bats and bring them back to Earth with almost apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the London population of their life force amid much nudity, thunder-eddies and spit coffee through the room's direlogo ("I was in the space for six months and seems perfect to me. "" Suppose you don't know anything, which is downplaying the matter. "" Don't worry, a naked woman won't get out of this complex. ") Oh, and we will receive the authors of Alien and Blue Thunder to write it with rewritings not accredited by Mark of the Devil writer, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. Looks like a winner, that's $ 22 million ?? have a good time. And they do it, they do it. <br /> <br /> True, there is enough promise in the raw material to have produced something truly gruesome and stimulating (in an age when AIDS hysteria was approaching its height, sexually transmitted) the plague 'offers ample opportunities for allegory), but in the hands of Cannon's Go-Go guys, what could have been another Quatermass and the Pit quickly turns into a 10 floor from Outer Space. It is full of delirious inanities, both the exhilarating scene of the death of Frank Finlay ("Here I go!"), Peter Firth's Grand Entrance ("I'm Colonel Caine." "From the SAS?" Michael Gothard shouts quietly through a room full of journalists: "Gentlemen, that last remark was not for publication. This is a D-Notice situation" responds to surprisingly complacent pressors, security guards offer the vampire in Mathilda May's naked space a nice cookie to prevent her from escaping, reanimated bodies that explode all over the people, the South American prime minister sucks the life from his secretary and London fills up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and jogging as the city becomes the most complete on the screen since Mrs Gorgo lost the junior to Battersea Funfair and was furious. And this is not saying "This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist!" scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the line of the male vampire "It will be much less terrifying if you come to me" while a lead fist wielding Peter Firth adopts his best Action Man voice to answer "I'll do just that!" In one scene you have a possessed Patrick Stewart who embodies the female in the mind of our deeply confused astronaut hero, Steve "I-never-over-playing-Charlie-Manson" Railsback and his incredible bobbing eyebrows in full "Helta- Skelta! " modality trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones seem braked) interpreting the house secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a sort of demented Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors who it always seems as though he must have been a Doctor Who in all the time that no one was looking at him anymore) tearing apart the public school macho in the hope that nobody would ever see him and John Hallam's unparalleled reaction shots as a nurse who continues to open takes her to the middle of a psychic tornado to introduce more drugs. As if they needed more in this movie. It's just a pity that Frank Finlay's mad scientist who is not qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski) lost action in that other. <br /> <br /> it matters how much you think the movie is crazy, but it still manages to get even more crazy, whether it's a zombie pathologist ("He also needs to feed himself") that explodes throughout the the home secretary's suit, Patrick Stewart's blood and offal forming a naked Mathilda May or space vampires transform St. Paul's Cathedral into the world's largest laser show to transport human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mothership . I loved every gloriously crazy moment. In its truly unique way, this could be the greatest film ever made. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers the original 116-minute version that was opened in the UK rather than the heavily modified 101-minute US version, which not only offers much more laughter for your dollar, but fully restores also the soundtrack by Henry Mancini to his original glory (the American version covered many gaps with further insights from Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although at first sight a rather surprising choice, Mancini has cut his teeth in many of the universal sci-fi horrors of the 1950s and his soundtrack is superb, with an exceptional driving title that offers a rare reminder of how interesting it could be being away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately there is nothing but an extra trailer, although it would be nice to hope for a day of a special edition with some of the scenes erased by the 128-minute cut originally planned by Hooper: from what is shown here, these could only offer even more comedy gold!
