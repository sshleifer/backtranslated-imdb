Very pleased to see that this excellent film gets such a high score from IMDB users. The best years of their lives remains the best cinematic statement about veterans returning from the war I met. Easily the best performance of the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact the whole cast shines, including the music legend Hoagy Carmichael who treats us all with a thin version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this excellent movie to anyone who loves movies.
