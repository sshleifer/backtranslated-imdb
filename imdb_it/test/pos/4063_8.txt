"Showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics have said, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard of Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! Since the crime or the police of "real life" go, and plot, moreover, it is rather illogical, but DUH --- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, the chases, the aerial shots and the exploding skyscrapers were present but less important than a Schwartzenegger film, I found it a bit boring and exaggerated. Apart from the sensitivity of 9/11, to myself, all that hyper-pyrotechnic material was becoming very old in recent years. It seemed a lame substitute for characterization, history and engaging emotions. I hope the lesser amount of it in "Showtime" is an indicator of a tendency in Hollywood. A downward trend, less use of the stupid, less use of the exploding building. Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their presence on the screen and the charisma - and even the depth of their character - have been "a joy to see" for many years. This can't be dismissed here --- they are engaging, fun and endearing actors in this movie. I can't point a finger at it, but maybe the explosions, the excessive FX and all this have reduced the final product ??? Perhaps, or maybe it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives the impression that the film has not reached its maximum potential. Whatever it was, "Showtime" was fun - I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out - but I got the impression that it wasn't all it could have been. At least not everything I was hoping for. <br /> <br /> Great film, but not a great film. I gave an 8 out of 10.
