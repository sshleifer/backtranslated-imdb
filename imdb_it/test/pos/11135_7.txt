In 2023, in a world governed by the economic interests of large corporations (and not by the popular will or politicians), Kam (Bobbie Phillips) is a human hybrid and an IBI (International Bureau of Investigation) agent. It is called "sub" (from subhuman) and its genetic composition is composed of 80% of human beings and 20% of animals. It has a combination of puma genes, which gives it strength and flexibility; hawk, which gives it a greater ability to see and hear; and chameleon, which gives it the power to disguise itself. In the first film, she was a very seductive and amoral woman, using sex to get information. I have not yet looked at the second, but in this third the story is full of action. A group of scientists has developed a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years. The search has not yet been concluded, when one of them betrays the other and steals the search. The problem is that, due to its molecular instability, a black hole will be created that will suck up the entire planet. Kam saves Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), the survival of the team of scientists, and tries to recover the dangerous inventing from the hands of the "bad guys". There is a very strong submarine in this band that causes many difficulties for Kam. This action and science fiction movie is better than the first, recalling "The Terminator" in some parts of the plot. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress and her clothing is very beautiful. I'm becoming a fan of this good entertainment. Fans of science fiction films will not be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy "Chameleon 2". My vote is seven.
