I haven't seen this movie in 30 years, so I don't know if I'd like it like when I was 12. At the time, though, I loved this movie. This is a great "appetizer" for young pre-teen girls. Be careful of the ending, though. There are tears and hard emotions. <br /> <br /> Looking back from a 2008 perspective (with so much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to watch it again. Patty's indifferent and violent father, indifferent mother and favorite sister helped make her vulnerable and hungry for company. Patty was sad when Anton left. His heart was broken when he was killed. The anger that was addressed to her later was shocking. After all, he was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> The thing that I have most strongly preserved is how this film has taught me that even "enemy" soldiers are also people. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I saw television programs like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol that also pointed out that the "normal" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> The "regular" soldiers were drafted. The Gestapo was selected by hand among the volunteers for their special hate attitudes. I think one of the privileges of being a Nazi was that they had special assignments and, therefore, did not go into battle. Their specialties were interrogation and torture. <br /> <br /> Later, during the Cold War, I thought of Russian soldiers and I remember SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "bad". But the reality was that the Russian soldiers weren't ready to destroy America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government was ready to destroy their lifestyle. Which, in a sense, was true, since the United States fought to end communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson is still applicable today. The German soldiers were not the same as the Nazis, just as the Muslims are not the same as those of Al Qaeda.
