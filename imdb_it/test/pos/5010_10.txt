After seeing the premiere of the Talk Show series with Spike Feresten, I took a moment to really think that there are indeed good concerts after 12 over SNL and I was disappointed to see they were only 30 minutes long. His great writing skills have helped this show overcome a series of lack of money and hands. The Electronic Lincoln was hilarious and I really think this will be a good Dark Horse Talk Show. <br /> <br /> I was very happy with the way he handled it and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. As you would have suspected, it was a bit wobbly, but for that kind of time interval it was very good. <br /> <br /> Overall if you are not someone on the weed or even if you are and you have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have fun doing it.
