The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that really left an impression on me. Partly for the characters, many of whom fall into stereotypes of fantasy / science fiction anime, but placing these stereotypes in the rather banal high school environment is a turning point that I enjoyed. Then there is the somewhat crazy character who is something else: a stubborn, almost amoral girl, with a ridiculous amount of talent and a secret she is not aware of. <br /> <br /> The set-up of the series is a bit of a mental journey. Essentially Suzumiya, unbeknownst to herself, is a sort of super-powerful being, capable of divine feats of creation and destruction, since she can destroy and rebuild reality according to her whim. Our narrator and main character is Kyon, a high school student whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruhi seems to lead her to drag him, against her will, into a club that is starting to revive her life, because she is bored with normal life. Looking for adventures, she claims three other unusual members, each with secrets and they all end up being dragged into her crazy schemes. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of crazy, but fun, philosophical look from the beginning Discuss whether the world is simply Haruhi's creation while getting bored of the old one and whether our characters exist to serve it or to serve her to continue to exist or if they could exist without her. It's a bit of an enigma, but still pleasant. While sci-fi / fantasy scenarios occasionally occur in the series, I think the joy of the series lies in the way things are normal, while this tension remains in knowing that if things are too boring, Haruhi could destroy the world in the hope of making it more interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is clean and in line with what I expected from the souls that are typically imported into the United States; I like character drawings and while there's not a lot of action in the series, I think it's better this way. The series is narrated from the mind of Kyon and does not recite an omniscient narrator, but only comments on what he knows and what he feels. He has a lot of things in mind, but he doesn't really talk much, so it's nice to hear that. <br /> <br /> Dubbing in English is quite acceptable, but I prefer the Japanese to act on it. There are some aspects unrelated to the series, some of which are parodies and traffics in fanboys, which I found funny. For the first season, I have to admit that there is a lack of closure, as the series does not have a bigger narrative arc, but it seems to take things one at a time, so it is an easy series to collect and put down, even if I think that due to its rather amusing qualities, it is still quite difficult to repress. It is also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in the drafting of the series. <br /> <br /> Even if it is based on novels, I still want the extra series to have stronger narrative arcs, but I like how naturally we observe these characters develop and how well the series can interpret moments of calm as well as the craziest ones. Seeing Haruhi growing up on her own was a real pleasure and watching the development of the relationship between the SOS Brigade (Haruhi's club). <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone, due to its thoughtful premise and "extraordinary beings" in a worldly world "setting. It probably won't satisfy the fans who are in action / science fiction / fantasy and could be a bit 'too offensive to the more relationship-oriented drama lovers, but for those willing to try something a little different, or like oddly bizarre series like this, I think The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a rather pleasant and unique series. Still please 9/10.
