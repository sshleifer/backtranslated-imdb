The genius of Stephen Sondheim was never shown again as in his "Musical Thriller" of 1979, SWEENEY TODD, a mixture of gothic, bloody, macabre but delicious music on a demented barber who returns to London to take revenge on the evil Judge who not only he has permanently exiled him from London, but he is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to "protect her from all the ills of the world". The barber finds the love, the sympathy and the assistance of a owner of a solitary pastry chef who has his own agenda in which Todd is interested. This musical has shaken Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury). The production was entirely filmed in 1982 with Angela Lansbury who recreated the role of Broadway as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of the daffy cake shop who finds practical use for the heads that Todd produces with meatballs. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway, is thrilling in the title role, so you have to ask him why he wasn't originally chosen for the role. Lansbury and Hearn are compelling from beginning to end and are 100% committed to their grisly characters helped, by a first-rate Sondaheim score, probably the closest thing Sondheim has written to an opera. Lansbury shines on "The Worst Pies in London" and "By the Sea". George Hearn interrupts the show with "Epiphany" and is also compelling during "Pretty Women", a duet singing with Judge Turpin, the man on whom he has sworn revenge. Cris Groendahl is vocally impressive as Antony, the young sailor who saves Todd and falls in love with his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a bit exaggerated like Johanna and really pushes her to the point that during "Green Funch and Linnet Bird", in reality, she pushes her voice off for a couple of moments. The rest of the cast is top notch, most notably Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin who plays "Johanna" in this production, which was cut from the original production and Ken Jennings in the role of Toby, whose beautiful tenor fills the auditorium of "Not While I Am Around." But it is the breathtaking soundtrack of Stephen Sondheim and the hypnotic performance of Lansbury and in particular of George Hearn that makes this night of gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you for a long time time after the curtain. Not to everyone's taste, but if you are a game and have a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all lovers of musical theater and a must for Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury fans.
