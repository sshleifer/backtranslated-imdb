"Murder by Numbers" sees Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as two rebel high school students who are satisfied with the perfect murder in order to overcome their blatant self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way their plans are Det. Cassie Mayweather. This is by no means close to the traditional mystery of a finger-pointing murder while the movie kindly shows us the killers (Gosling and Pitt). What the film does instead focus on the purpose of their murders and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself is rightly chosen for various reasons, mainly because the "Numbers" in the title are the most vocal. The angle focused on the reasons behind the heinous murders, although it will haunt you with its chilling dialogue (especially by the insensitive kids), does not live fully exploring the origins of what led them to their murderous frenzy. The characters are compelling and you have the good looking rich Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the intelligent but socially embarrassing Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they pretend to despise one another, and even share a sympathy for the name of a classmate Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but outside the school they are allies and collaborate in a ritual in which murder is an escape to free the mind. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story that involves kids seems exciting, but it is pushed into the background of a more banal subplot that involves Det. Mayweather (Bullock) who assumes that their murder is due to discrimination (hence the arrogant aspect of Gosling) and the inexplicable characteristics, but manages to do it well. In the beginning, the public could despise the character of Cassie due to the fact that she is very stubborn and not very favorable. He shows dominance and control over his lesser partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even if he tries to reason with her, he knows that it is a battle that will probably not win. <br /> <br /> The reason behind his behavior as a tyrant goes back to the fact that Cassie was the sad victim of a crime that left a permanent mental scar on her. This side story doesn't have a lot of space in this film, partly because it doesn't offer anything compelling with the main plot (the murderous madness of boys). It also offers some development to the character of Bullock in the film, but it is only half work and not very satisfying. I would have liked if the diabolical students had a secondary history. The resources were right there in front of them for the perfect crime effect, the creative schemes for the kids to manipulate the cops with their false evidence and the lies just to get out of a potential life sentence in prison. <br /> <br /> Despite the lopsided sub-plots and the useless "real killer" ending, "Murder By Numbers" sports a strong performance by an exceptional cast. Sandra Bullock was as convincing as the ruthless tough cop who tries to shift her inner pain into a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries in every way to understand his partner and is able to repel his occasional tyrannical tyrants. But the stage thieves are the diabolical duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling as they keep you glued to their place waiting for what they'll do next. The boys' chemistry recalls Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley".
