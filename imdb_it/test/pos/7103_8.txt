House of Dracula was made towards the end of the Universal horror cycle of the 1940s and I saw it a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Mad Doctor, Edelman is raising plants for a serum that heals people. Count Dracula arrives for a cure for his vampirism and Lawrence Talbot then comes to see if he can cure him by turning into a werewolf at the full moon. The Frankenstein monster is then discovered and Edelman brings it back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire. Talbot, now healed and one of Edelman's assistants is safe. <br /> <br /> Like many films of its kind, we have a hunchback assistant and a thunderstorm to keep it moving. <br /> <br /> The cast includes the usual Universal Lon Chaney Jr horror (The Wolf Man), John Carradine (House of Frankenstein) and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster. Also with Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. <br /> <br /> House of Dracula is a must see for all old horror fans. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
