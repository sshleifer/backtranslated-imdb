First of all - What are you thinking? This is the best movie I've seen in ages! <br /> <br /> Secondly - I don't think of a British film as it is set in Dublin and has mainly Irish actors - Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane, etc. <br /> <br /> Third: I thought Moran was excellent. It was hilarious and fun. Michael Caine seemed to be there just to get the context of Moran. Every character he hired has perfected. <br /> <br /> I thought Abigail Iversen was better than any other child actor I saw. She was credible as the intelligent girl and also as a child and as an adult (yes, I know it sounds strange but hey ...). She even managed to get past Caine. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.
