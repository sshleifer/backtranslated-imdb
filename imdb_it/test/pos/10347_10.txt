Recovery is an incredibly moving work, managing the devastating effects of brain injuries not only on the individual, but on the whole family. Without resorting to preaching or Hollywood endings, Tony Marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The greatest appreciations go to David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances. I had assumed before seeing the drama that I would see some of their previous screen reports in Blackpool, but it never is. Neither of the two actors is recognizable from any previous work, and I did not see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes. Furthermore, Harry Treadaway's performance as the son who had just started his life at the university was fantastic - throughout the piece, showing the torn nature of an adolescent boy thrown into the involuntary role of the man of the house, <br /> <br /> Sometimes, almost all the characters in the drama are not nice. As a spectator, I wanted to give everyone of them a good dose to wake up to reality, stop taking the moping and start adapting to the rotten but very present change in their lives. But in the same circumstances, I see myself behaving like any one of them - going from trying to show the upper lip stiff to despair to escape anything, including completely different behavior from myself. It's the biggest strength of the show - the truth, without sugar coating, to force us to think about what we could do in the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult show, but a must see. I hope he somehow manages to be shown in the United States
