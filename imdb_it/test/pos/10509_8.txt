I don't see why everyone is bombing so much. I thought it was a fun time that unfortunately wasn't popular enough to be so famous. Believe me, I've seen a lot much worse than this. If you want to see a bad movie, see the blood shack or the dead alien or something. So this is the normal but better slasher rate than most. And it's watchable. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Part of the music is very full of suspense. And even the scenes of death are beautiful. We see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words SOLD written in blood on the mirror, and we also get a double beat from a plunger! with razors attached to it! This was a fun 80s slasher that is definitely worth your time, despite what others are saying about it.
