I think this is a fabulous movie ... I've watched it constantly since I was 4 years old when I was 8 ... However, watching it has caused many nightmares. I particularly appreciated them because of the boy who has always been like "the other world" and his friends. I am 12 years old and I still have nightmares to this day. I can't fall asleep right now because I'm thinking about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I certainly love this movie, I have great memories of it. Kate is very good at acting in this film. Surprisingly, I never realized it was her! I also think that the graphics were of the highest quality, contrary to what other people think
