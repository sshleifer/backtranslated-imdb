Many of us find art pleasant only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep within us. That is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally connect to it. It was winter here in Australia in 1992, when I saw Batman Returns in theaters and shocked me. Both "me". I had to belong to an ideal, to a standard, but at the same time I was living another life. Tim Burton was the first film producer to say that it is OK for a comic film to be obscure and confess that darkness can happen to all of us. After Tim Burton's interpretations of Batman, many other dark and anti-hero heroes invaded the cinemas. Comic folklore for decades had told of friendly and nice heroes with incredibly beautiful smiles and magical superpowers flying in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten and you see your parents coldly killed before your eyes? You shoot. Somewhere in your psyche, your young and tender psychological makeup breaks down. The only way pain and pain can be managed is to create an alternative person. Make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, will use all the rage of anger to use any available means to avenge the innocence of your parents on that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. This is life seen through the eyes of Bruce Wayne. Both couples. The world you see is dark, gloomy and cold. Although they patrol the streets and listen to people, they don't rush to get his autograph. He is their Savior, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns talks about losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains "the only solitary man beast in the city". Bruce Wayne never legally stops the vile Max Shreck. The Penguin never fails to release his penalty of being discarded by his parents over the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is lost forever to be mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero does not take the girl or the cat. This film deepens the desire in each of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot. The film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle, Oswald and, of course, Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave according to a certain standard. This until we break out. Only hope remains at the end of the film when we see Catwoman climb to the night sky. But come what we can all wish for goodwill towards all men and women. As for me, I cannot say that I will reach a point where I will believe that my problem with duality will be reconciled. But it's fine. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of Batman movies, it is truly an exceptional narrative masterpiece.
