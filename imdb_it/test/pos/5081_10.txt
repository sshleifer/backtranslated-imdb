I think this was the most outstanding field thriller I've seen in a long time. The search for the film has been deepened, the writer Kelly Sane has not left sad ends. The cast was seasoned (fantastic all-round shows). Omar Metwally was exceptional. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poetic, the music enchanting and the overall effect highly satisfying. <br /> <br /> The yield goes into the territory that even the media are afraid of trampling. It really is a wake-up call for those involved in espionage and in the legal web that is the "war on terror". <br /> <br /> A woman came out of the theater and asked me "does this really happen?" This in itself speaks of the masterly conquest of Gavin Hood.
