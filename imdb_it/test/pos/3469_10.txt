Until I saw this movie, "life is beautiful" was my favorite movie of all time. This film is all that should be a great movie. Great unsurpassed script, acting and direction that neither approaches sentimentality, the subject tries or leaves without the emotional impact it requires. This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood and lacks the claim that it would come from France. A wonderful film even above the level that I expect when I see the logo of the films made by hand. I don't need to go into details as the previous posts include all the reason why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet.
