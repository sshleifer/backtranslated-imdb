This film was fantastic. Never before have I seen such a film that led me to the harsh reality of drug use like this. There is no glamor, sugar coating or glorifying heroin. This film shows the real struggles, pains and losses suffered by the people facing this drug. A good movie, a decent emotional acting and a fantastic plot. A great watch! <br /> <br />
