Eccentric, vulnerable, raw, honest and a pleasure to watch. I'm not here to provide a summary or synopsis of the film. I simply wish to congratulate this little film with the GREAT GREAT HEART. I tip the director and he is an excellent cast. If you want to know what's going on in the movie ... then go see it. Michael Parness, writer / director, has managed a very sensitive and emotional topic, Suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career in front of Mr. Parness. This movie works. From the extravagant opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. Like any movie, we have to suspend disbelief, but I found with MAX AND GRACE that I was easily transported and completely convinced with his "surreal moments". I just hope they still pushed some of those moments. Mr. Parness has "pulled" some wonderful interpretations from this already talented cast. For example, Guillermo DÃ­az's performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. The giant Ralf Moeller, former Mr Olympiad, as a terrified patient ... perfect. I can go on and on ... This independent film has the power of a big-budget Hollywood movie star, however, you forget about the STARS on the screen as you follow this wonderfully written story. The real star here is the brilliant script. I look forward to seeing more from writer / director Michael Parness.
