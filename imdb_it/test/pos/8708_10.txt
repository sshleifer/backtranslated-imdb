This is a perfect example of a Classic Full Moon Pictures movie. Any fan of Horror / Vampire Flicks should definitely check this. Original and good plot, easy to follow. Furthermore, this film has some heart-pounding scenes that combine horror with action. As of now, the only sequel I saw in this film is Part IV, which I have to say is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give him 10/10 <br /> <br /> Horror film fans like this should check out Puppet Master, Slumber Party Massacre, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures movies .
