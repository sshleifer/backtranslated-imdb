This film is so 80s and that's what I like so much. It does a great job in conveying the feeling of that strange decade. The reality that Russian nuclear weapons could cancel you at any time. Reagan in the White House told everyone that things were great, while more and more social programs were being cut. The young men withdrew, but not as far as their parents in the 1960s had done. The young people still went to school, they just smoked so much that their feelings were almost dead. Nothing made them, not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends. How strange to understand that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. Watching the characters face crime is fascinating and tells of a very sick society. Glover is fantastic, Keanu is fantastic, Hopper is incredible. One of the most memorable films I've ever seen.
