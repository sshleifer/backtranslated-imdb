Radical drama with great sets, costumes and shows ?? although some people are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite family and position bonds. Beautiful villains ?? you want everyone to go wrong. A lot of strong female characters in this ?? both good and bad. Even the secondary plots are well developed. Several cameos of the main stars of past ages. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Curl up on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and drink the choice with this one. A mat and a cat would be optional.
