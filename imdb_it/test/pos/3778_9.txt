This film is one of three that Chapin later combined into a compilation that was released in theaters in the late 1950s under the title "The Chaplin Review". <br /> <br /> This was a strange film somehow because later in life, Chaplin was against the war and his films emphasized peace and brotherhood. This film, on the other hand, is a propaganda comedy intended to support US efforts in the First World War. It is really strange to see Charlie as the "super soldier" who captures 13 Germans, casually and coldly, shoots several Germans in a few seconds as a shooter and then goes behind enemy lines to try to catch Kaiser himself! In truth, this was a great start for the Little Tramp, even though it was at the same time very, very fun and entertaining. The film is exceptionally well structured, well made and I am sure that it has done a lot to strengthen the support at home for our troops (too bad it was such a useless and expensive war).
