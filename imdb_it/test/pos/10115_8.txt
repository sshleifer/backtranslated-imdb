The radio will make you laugh, cry, hear. This story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to see. There's enough for both of us. cuba Gooding Jr.portrays the title character to perfection. His performance is worthy of a nomination for the academic award. The film's compassion is obvious. The film evokes many emotions. I really liked this movie.
