I saw this movie on a night when I couldn't sleep, I liked it and tried to find out when it would come back, probably the best film I've ever seen at the time, and even now the cast is full of people I didn't never seen before, but it seems like a real life story in New York, this is the kind of film that elevates the pleasure of viewing because you see it, feel it and feel it, from the moment I saw that Wirey drank a beer and looking at the game I imagined how it must be to grow up without a father, there are so many lines from this film that I use daily as "personal time alone" in the bathroom drinking a 7-11 drink, GREAT FILM
