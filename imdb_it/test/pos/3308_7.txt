An extremely entertaining version of the best-selling pot by Rona Jaffe on the trials and tribulations (and of course the loves) of a group of women involved in one way or another in editorial publishing in New York. Directed by Jean Negulesco, fresh enough from the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain", and the "Sex and the City" prototype, except that sex takes place off the screen here. <br /> <br /> The brilliant female talents of the day, (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer), are all well launched as Joan Crawford appears as a Queen Bitch of a publisher who could probably eat Miranda Priestly by Meryl Streep and spit it out; with absolutely no effort it steals the movie. The men include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan, (if he weren't Rossano Brazzi he had to be Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans, (before he wisely decided to go behind the camera) and Brian Aherne. There are more suds on display than the ones you'll find in your laundromat, but if, like me, you like "Desperate Housewives", not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and her company, you'll probably love this. A very guilty pleasure.
