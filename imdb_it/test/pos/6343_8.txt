I had my reservations about watching The Return to Lonesome Where after seeing and enjoying the original so much. Without Tommy Lee Jones resuming the role of Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I thought it would not seem authentic enough. After seeing "return" I can honestly say that he is a worthy successor. Actors really do the show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed performing at their best. I admit that the story may not be as compelling as the first, but the "return" certainly has its share of excitement and captures the romance of the old West in a way that few other films have. Anyone who still has reservations can be sure that The Return to Lonesome Dove manages to capture the "feeling" of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and take a look, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
