The efforts of a new group of young talents supported by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, 2 extremely gifted actors, make the evening of entertainment exciting and exciting. And I might add that Hal Holbrook shines like a senator. This film deserves five stars. I give him a ten on your ladder. And the ending is PERFECT. I am constantly amazed by the ability of British actors to master our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what better setting for a New Orleans mystery! The Big Easy, also known as Crescent City, permeates every scene. As a writer and director, Sebastian Gutierrez deserves praise.
