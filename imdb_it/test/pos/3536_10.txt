The Messiah was a compulsive vision from the beginning to the end. The story centered on murders of seemingly random men in London in various gruesome ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) must find the truth that, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he thinks. <br /> <br /> The compelling drama and Ken Stott was brilliant. We hope we haven't seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.
