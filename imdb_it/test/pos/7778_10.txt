This film features some of the best ensemble works I've seen in the cinema or on stage. The actors play each other with skill and vivacity that in no way can be achieved through editing. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" is a good story, period. But it is also an excellent portrait of the urban, middle-income, twenty-three African-American set that is not often seen.
