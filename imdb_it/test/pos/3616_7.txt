After a rather slow start, I thought that this film about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during the Second World War has become a rather pleasant watch for a couple of hours, mainly from two points of view. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is interesting and it seems credible to me, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz plays Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the beginning, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went to fight. After the German intervention, Greece was conquered and the Pelagia island survived under the Italian occupation, during which Pelagia met and began to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage). This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in the occupied territories. When they met their occupants, they began to see them not as enemies but as real people, and sometimes they fell in love - often because of the disapproval of their neighbors. I have just finished reading an interesting book on the German occupation of the Channel Islands of Great Britain where this was a major problem. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> The second fundamental question is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was portrayed quite realistically. The first was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupants. Greece defeated Italy (very true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The city's refusal to surrender to the Italians and instead of insisting on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could have happened (and it was rather funny, in fact, I loved the phrase "we would prefer to surrender to this German dog than to you Italians "). Even the portrait of Italian troops seemed credible to me. The Italian army never fell in love with their German ally and was never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply cannot understand) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this could make them prisoners of the Germans . It was all pretty well done, I thought. <br /> <br /> It does a bit of wavering at the end with an overly predictable ending, but still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
