"Best In Show" tracks the stories of a handful of human competitors as they prepare for one of the biggest canine shows on the calendar. Any amateur psychologist would say that unconditional love and an obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing in someone's life, and each of the characters somehow fills this clich√©. There is the former High School Hottie who is now married to a geek man, the yuppie childless couple, obsessed with the label, the lonely man in the open, the young wife of a rich coder (along with his shorthaired dog trainer) and the gay couple. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so funny is how they portray these stereotypes in a completely believable way - almost affectionate, in many cases. Every ludicrous thing that one of the characters does or says - with their dog as an innocent spectator - seems the kind of behavior you would expect to see in a dog show. <br /> <br /> The biggest laughs come from the commentary team of an all-American style sports announcer, comparing the moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game, and his English, canine academician, foil. <br /> <br /> Evidence of the brilliant husband as his blonde wife meets a surprising number of men from his past is always good even for a laugh, as is the demented behavior of the yuppie couple as the pressure increases , while their hound remains completely without frills. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at - even if cats are more your bag.
