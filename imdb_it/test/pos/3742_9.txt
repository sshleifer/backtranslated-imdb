Since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the film (I lived here all my life), I waited for this film to come out. And I mean, I waited and waited and waited for a year and a half for this film and for me, it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book but in my eyes it is still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that took me away. I laughed and smiled the same. It's a fantastic film with a fabulous storyline. <br /> <br /> It's about never giving up to find the one, the one that will change you forever. What will shape your soul and awaken you to a completely new vision of life. <br /> <br /> I must say that you can meet someone and make them change your life forever, which is Gere's character he did at Lane's. I met the love of my life and immediately I was completely fascinated by the fact that I never forgot it or how much I was impressed by him until I met him again a year later. As for me, I could relate to this film with all my heart. I think if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, great job Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere!
