This British documentary was recently shown on Comedy Central during their "Best of ??" week and can also be seen on the DVD of the second season of South Park. I remember seeing many commercials for the DVD showing clips of this documentary, most of which occurred with Matt Stone, Trey Parker and some other guys in a hot tub. It was fun when I saw it in commercials, but I used to see it when I saw the documentary. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Goin 'Down to South Park" is quite fun and an interesting look at how the South Park episodes are made and the story of the series dating back to when Matt and Trey got the idea in college. However, there was something in the tone of this documentary that actually seemed a bit depressing. It's not as fast-paced, fast-paced, and as lively as the South Park episodes. Rather, it has a slow, dry style, which can sometimes be fun, but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen. If you have the chance to see it, by all means to do it, but I don't think you miss much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 7/10
