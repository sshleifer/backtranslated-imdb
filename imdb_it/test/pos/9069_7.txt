Peter Lorre gives one of his most evil shows as owner of the titled place. The plot has a new government agent put on the track of the character of Peter Lorre. When G-man's contact is killed by one of Lorre's agents, the G-man is sent to prison for the murder, even though everyone knows there's more to the story. Lorre has the man entrusted to his care and is taken to his island where he is digging diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he is not speaking and a battle of wills is set in motion. <br /> <br /> This is a good little solid thriller that doesn't make much sense in the essay, but even so the film holds your interest. I had put the film last night to use it as something to drift on, instead I found the story compelling enough to make me spend 70 more minutes. Lorre is the reason why one falls into this. Its quite unnerving behavior. He does very little but it is clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (looks at how they light his cigarettes) that he is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look if you cross it.
