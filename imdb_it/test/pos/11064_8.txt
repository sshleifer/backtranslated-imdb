I have to admit to being biased for my vote on this film, but I have strong motivations as I know part of the real story that has been given the Hollywood treatment here. The novel by Edna Ferber on which it is based is from an age when real names cannot be used. In a sense, this film is all smoke and mirrors. Although it was published in 1946, it was shot shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is at her peak in this brunette movie. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade her beauty to get a rich husband. Today she is a gold seeker, but in this social age she is desirable and the kind of woman who makes all men want her, and all the old haughty types of society talk about her and avoid her, as they wish for are she. Ingrid is at her best and plays this role well. <br /> <br /> A little sympathy for the character of Ingrids grew up in the New Orleans section of this film as he manages to get a decent grave late for his mother scandalized as part of the settlement by the his relatives to convince her to leave New Orleans. The contemptuous family of relatives are so scandalized that they do almost everything they ask for leaving the city. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good at this film, although he seems to be getting a little older already to play a Texan triumph / gambler. He pulls well, considering the handicap that appeared to him to be older than it was due to the smoke of his life chain. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid was nominated for an Oscar as a supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin in the role of Cupidor has been overwhelmed in many ways by his role, but it is the only comic relief in the film and he does it well. <br /> <br /> When the film moves to Saratoga, it accurately depicts the importance of Saratoga in that era. I like the sequence in which Bergman reaches the Saratoge spring to get some of the "sulphurous" water that everyone considered so healthy. When he drinks a little he tries not to make a face and comments on how beautiful he is and what he should have more. <br /> <br /> The real story is the battle of the railway that actually took place on the Tunnel, New York railway line, which is the current Saratoga Trunk from which the title of the film derives. This battle actually took place in 1869 between agents for Andrew Carnagie and J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869 which connected the country of coal and the east coast. The references to it are throughout the film are very real. There are also some dialogs describing Carnagie as a "Scottish" even though the reference is vague and unknown to anyone who does not know the history of the battle. <br /> <br /> The railway line and the Tunnel railway tunnel, New York (post code 13848) still exist although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. Today it is still part of a key freight transport line, years after it occurred. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the film while he is driving the train in the tunnel is right, it is still "a beautiful mighty country".
