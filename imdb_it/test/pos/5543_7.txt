First of all, don't be fooled by the name of my family. My mother was Italian full of blood, so I really know Italian families and I love mafia films, even fun ones like this. <br /> <br /> For those people who have badly beaten this movie (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what's good. This is a damn funny and well done movie. The fact that almost no one is Italian is part of the joke, as far as I can see. And what straight male red blood could complain about spending an hour and something with characters like Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this film he won me over with the opening song by Rosemary Clooney who was as Irish as you can get, but his pronunciation of the Italian words in "Mambo Italiano" is impeccable and sets the tone of what must follow perfectly. (Hell, I even bought the record the following day for this.) Only the appearance of everything flashy in the apartment that I saw personally in the homes of my relatives, although not in the same place (which I found hysterical) I sold for me. <br /> <br /> This movie is like the good guys on the gas that laughs. I just wonder why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food these guys should have taken? My hypothesis is that the crew ate it. "The fries are crunchy, the smoothies are creamy." My mouth is almost as watery as he thinks of the beautiful Mrs. Pfieffer. (And I never trusted clowns anyway.) And the three best things about this movie are the wife of Mercedes Ruehl, the messily funny, scorned wife, Dean Stockwell as the unfaithful husband Tony "The Tiger" and, lastly, but not least, the great aggression of Oliver Platt who should get more comic roles. And note to myself: find out where that black girl ended up. Ouch! Why do you work so rarely? This image is right next to the great mob movies as it should be.
