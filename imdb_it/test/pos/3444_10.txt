Seeing this film, or rather a series of films, in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of ​​the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experiences. This monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical context, reveals how full and intense every human existence is. People are portrayed as they are for themselves: their experiences from the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomenon are detailed with the utmost in artistic skill and perception. Edgar Reitz shows a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and desires. <br /> <br /> When these phenomena are opposed to the immense time allowed by the duration of work, one cannot help but understand the strength and liveliness of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that every person tries. When I saw these films I perceived my future experiences, as my life would inevitably be distorted and oscillated due to intentional and accidental events. I gained the feeling of being longevity and what it meant to reflect on past lives, memories and contexts. A masterpiece and a revelation. I just wish the BBC would project it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where I can get a copy, they can contact me
