I've seen a lot of Shahrukh movies and that's a great role for him. It has such versatility, but remains mainly in positive roles. Like Rahul, he is very dark and unsettling, yet I found myself sympathetic to him for much of the film. If nothing else, watch this movie for Shahrukh. He plays a very complex and real character in a very convincing way. The story is very typical and has already been done in the past, but the character development is very strong and fun. The opening is a bit confusing, but in the end, it doesn't matter. The songs that I found very nice and give an idea of ​​what the characters are thinking. Very clever. I think this film was very good and I recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. It's a must see!
