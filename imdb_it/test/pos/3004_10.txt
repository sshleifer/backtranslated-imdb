I would give this TV series an advantage of 10, if I could. The writers were "sketched" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus for the show. These characters were so real. It could be said that from the two main actresses, Mrs. Toussaint and Mrs. Potts, that their relationship with the camera was genuine, it did not end when you heard those familiar "Cut" words at the end of a "Take". The show has thought a lot about life for example. Historical battles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, every family have the same situations, no matter who the members are, in reality it was simply a wonderful family show that at the end of each episode, you can just sit down and sit sofa to yourself "now what I learned from this particular episode". <br /> <br /> I must say that I recorded most of the episodes and I find myself looking at them over and over again. /> <br /> Now you know why I gave a 10+ !!
