You can have fun with this movie and at the same time regret all that is not. In the 1980s, a very refined member of the United States Congress (Tom Hanks) supports the Afghan partisans who resist the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Hanks is in a hurried, benevolent-well-encountered form as clever, politically incorrect, Charlie Wilson, first glimpsed in a hot tub with three deep-looking women. If only the film had the same air of carelessness; but apart from the turn of Philip Seymour Hoffman as a cynical CIA agent, he tries to be perceived as patriotic. Aaron Sorkin's detached dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of Wilson's stories. And there is an oddly unspoken subtext: Wilson's friends later turned into Taliban and other anti-Western groups, leaving the world worse than it was when these events occurred.
