"First Ninja 3: The Domination" by Sam Firstenberg mixes martial arts with "The Exorcist" as a horror. The horror elements projected on the screen are simply ridiculous, but the film works as a nonsensical action / martial arts film. The fighting scenes are well choreographed and exciting, and the film is never boring. Forget stupid dialogues, limping acting and annoying soundtrack: grab some beer and take a look at it! Highly recommended!
