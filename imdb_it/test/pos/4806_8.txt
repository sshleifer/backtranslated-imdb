Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both proud in the crime thriller directed by Johnny To, which tests most Western efforts. Think of Hong Kong's "Heat", only better! Everything about the film screams class; from the performances to the soundtrack, from the cinematography to the script. The tone remains serious everywhere, but the film has a beautiful line of black humor, friendship and romance in his heart. Of course, it becomes a bit absurd later, but he would be a heartless spectator who didn't find something to love about this movie. Thank God, Hollywood has not (yet) taken over and ruined a classic. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
