The Cell is weak on the plot, full of holes and even has a pretty crappy acting. but none of this matters, because the tarsem singh director gave us one of the most visually beautiful films ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to make the tarsem tolerate and take you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing shocking, pleasant, breathtaking and amazing images to the public. <br /> <br /> the images of this beautiful film will stay with you for a long time to come. this film is a perfect case for the theory of "suspension of disbelief". forget the silly plot, let your senses be overwhelmed by the images. and J. Lo seems sensational enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. cinematography is heartbreaking, haunting music and simply stunning costumes. <br /> <br /> the film is less of a film and more of a work of art. it's just that the medium is no longer a canvas, it's the big screen and the celluloid. one of the most refreshing films of this decade. The Cell is a watch not to be missed. A new bold step in creating a film. <br /> <br /> a compelling 8 !!
