The Commentator before me stated that this film is the worst that has ever been forced upon him as a child. I have to say though that I loved this film when I was little and I still love it today. The film has the best running theme for family get-together. Considering the time period in which the film was released, I thought the film was well played. I just wish you could still find a copy somewhere !! Of all the 1980s movies I saw as a child this was one of my favorites. I know I probably saw him at least once a week with my brother and my mother. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who knows it or I don't know. So if you find a copy I suggest you watch it! It is wonderful and moving.
