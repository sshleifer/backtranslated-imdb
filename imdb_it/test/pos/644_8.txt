I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!". Jennifer Beals is ok as a girlfriend, but Yancy Butler as a female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! After seeing her in WITCHBLADE, I was not prepared for the pure uncontaminated sensuality and pure sexual excitement that she casts on the screen. <br /> <br /> I have to see THIS film again .... even if only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne!
