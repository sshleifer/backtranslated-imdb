From the golden age of British films, this is my vote for one of the most entertaining of all time. After being shown yesterday to my film company in an ecstatic audience, I was amazed by the goodness of the play (made in 1950!). It really belongs to the expert times and the inimitable games of two of the best actors that Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a play by John Dighton, this farce is briskly managed by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: a ministry error softens a girls' school in a school for boys. I will always laugh when I think of this movie.
