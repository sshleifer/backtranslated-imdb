Never have the words "hidden gem" been so accurate. Bad movie lovers could search everywhere for the next hidden darkness, sometimes coming out with things like Weasel tear my flesh, but other times, luck will prevail and you could end up with something like Death Bed, then hoping not to be a bad guy the film has only a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that could throw you out, but somehow Death Bed still fits in the "bad" category. With a dark and empty atmosphere, Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low budget horror, reserved only for those lucky enough to appreciate a shadow so dark of a vision. <br /> <br /> Death Bed involves an inconsistent, yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the cute ghost trapped in the portrait, who only wants to spare someone from the terrible fate of being devoured by yellow foam. Even if it's not so scary, considering that it's a killer bed, Death Bed has the qualities of successful horror. A dark, desolate, confused atmosphere, a disturbing music, a subtle score and that dreamlike quality that this masterpiece almost touches. Such a quality or atmosphere usually seems unintended. Not only is it intentional, but from what I've read, Death Bed is based on a real dream, George Barry, the director, has successfully transferred the dream to the cinema, only a genius could accomplish such a task. <br /> <br /> Old mansions make good quality horror, as well as portraits, I don't know what to do with the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid, a rather bizarre dream indeed. Also, this is not exactly the B-horror brand I expected, considering the title and all the rest. Before seeing this Gothic jewel I was expecting something more like the Class Reunion Massacre, now it's a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what I'm saying. Having considered all of the above, I feel like Death Bed deserves only eight stars, but since it has remained so dark for so long, we will say that the bed that eats deserves nine.
