Did I swear that I would never allow myself to devote myself to the false figures of authority of the sixties who told me that things were better in the "good old days"? the current Australian Prime Minister is a sordid example of such a mental set. <br /> <br /> But I switched to "A Decade Under the Influence" because I found the documentary "Sneakers" another channel a daunting experience. I found the values ​​expressed by the respondents "Sneakers" too ugly to accept as reasonable. So materialistic! So devoid of any sense of indignation in a society that can bear to kill someone to steal its very ugly shoes! Thus, lacking a useful purpose that they could report without aversion, the exploitation of an audience that harangued them to keep those shoes over their heads to block a sponsorship deal for themselves with a cobbler was simply too much to continue to watch. > <br /> "A Decade Under the Influence" represented a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I noticed the change in the film - this accompanied the display of disastrous disastrous misadventures in America's foreign policy in Vietnam and of so many less reported places on my site www.peterhenderson.com.au . "A Decade Under the Influence" documents the precise moment when this change took place. <br /> <br /> Before the 1970s, the armed forces were represented in American films as an invincible fighting force composed of decent human beings who turned into conquering heroes on the battlefield. After the seventies they are generally portrayed as a displeased anger by a group of bureaucratic clowns in the Pentagon. Before the 1970s, the FBI agent and honest cop tended to be portrayed as friends and protectors. After the seventies, FBI agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their folly and his superior's corruption and defend justice in his idiosyncratic way. <br /> <br /> Before the 1970s, the archetype The American "little boy", the "average Joe", the Jimmy Stewart type would face the problems he encountered and thereby get a deep insight into the underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and the justice of the "American Way". After the seventies, Kevin Costner usurped that role, but now he is the voice of one crying in the desert for evil to be exposed, or accepting his destiny and bringing out the best he can. <br /> <br /> And now those "old-time religion" mentalities have been stripped of all honesty and rectitude and portrayed (with a certain amount of justification) as bigoted bigotry and selfish hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> "A decade under the influence" says how it was. "A Decade Under the Influence" says how it is now. It describes the redemption of the American film industry from the hands of the studio magnates artistically, morally and intellectually bankrupt. It shows the assault on the Hollywood Bastille by independent filmmakers who have promised to bring a disillusioned and tired audience back into theaters. The fact that their failures were numerous, and sometimes disastrous, simply underlines the magnitude of their success. A result that is reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars like Clooney, Daman, Affleck, etc. And the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.
