For a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this film, even though it's a very important aspect, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very beautiful love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. They must live their sad days without any ray of hope. If each of these two women were left alone, imagine what kind of life they would have to accept. They found each other and fell in love. That this love is against all the social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, found relief in each other, it was enough. The reaction of individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept, suffer too, and then they can go on with their lives, their lives. Very beautiful.
