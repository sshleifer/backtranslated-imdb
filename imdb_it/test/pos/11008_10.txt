Yup!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! This is the same topic, but I think it's a much better film than THE MATRIX (1999), at least 200 times cheaper! Very nice work with Michael Ballhaus's camera and Fleetwood Mac's wonderful "Albatross" at the end. Fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the entire film. It is a pity that this film was never released on DVD. But now after 37 years I have finally come to the conclusion that this TV movie is not just one of Fassbinder's best films (although there are silent films by Fassbinder), it is a brilliant example for a science fiction film, made without much money Buy !! Watch it!!
