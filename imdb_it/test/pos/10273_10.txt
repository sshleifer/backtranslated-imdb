This is easily my favorite movie. A tragic novel intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are almost invisible until everyone finally unravels in a fantastic race. Pure brilliance. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a little more of Gilles Mimouni's work, but at least according to imdb, he didn't do other features. Has the high quality of this work made another task too daunting? Has he moved (again) to some other sphere of creative effort? I hope for sure that this won't be his final feature, but I can't really blame him if he decides to stop with this jewel as his only contribution to the world of feature films.
