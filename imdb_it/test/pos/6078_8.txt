In World War II, a badly burned amnesia known only as "The English Patient" is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where it joins a convoy of medical troops and others in an abandoned monastery. Among them is Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally encounter unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts looking for bombs in the monastery; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier-of-fortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to pay. <br /> <br /> Through flashbacks we learn the patient's story: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late 1930s, finds himself with a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), as they map the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton left them in government affairs, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, creating a relationship that, of course, has a far from happy ending. <br /> <br /> If one is able to neglect the illogical parts of the plot (how, why would a patient find an African in Africa?), then one can appreciate "The English Patient" as a return to the past l David Lean's intelligent, layered and overwhelming epic in the 1960s. Much more than "Titanic" or other epic novels recently, this film brings to mind "Doctor Zhivago" and "Gone With the Wind" - an epic love story set in an immense historical context. You should not expect a war movie, even if there are some scenes of violence (albeit too short) that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow ) in particular). <br /> <br /> The film is very ambiguous, as far as practically everything is concerned. The central question of the film is: how much are you willing to go for love? As critics of the film rush to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, a character who is anything but sympathetic: he has a relationship with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and information to the Germans, causing the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and Caravaggio's torture, and actually kills a British soldier who arrested him at some point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is a bit the point - he is in love with Katharine, and sees the world strictly in terms of love that loyalty to the country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates "Property. Ownership". The two engage in a rather daring love affair (fucking hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it is clear that Katharine is more attracted to the mysterious and exciting Almasy than the relatively boring Geoffrey. <br /> <br /> The 1944 subplot is quite shaky and seems superfluous; the love story between Kip and Hannah is never entirely credible, and I think the film could have done without it. But those sequences add an interesting plot of mystery and complexity to the film, so I won't complain too much. <br /> <br /> Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to transmit time and place through simple devices such as crowd scenes, strategically positioned posters and military presence. We need not dwell on the fact that it is 1938 in Cairo, but it is useful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the cinematography of the desert of John Seale are absolutely beautiful; the sand dunes, the sand storms and the captivating desert caves are captured in beautiful details. Gabriel Yared's soundtrack is disturbing and suggestive. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally solid. Fiennes offers highly layered performance as a mysterious, complex and bewitched character. The difference between Almasys of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; an exciting and a bit carefree, the other obsessed and thoughtful. Kirsten Scott Thomas is as effective as Katharine, the explorer who seeks adventure, and Colin Firth offers one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who soon realizes that he is not competing for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does a good job as Caravaggio, the shifty, the wanted brigade, spied on by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a show that recalls Jose Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and also a similar character): very short, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the actors of 1944 are insignificant: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but insignificant. Kevin Whately, as Kip's unlucky partner, does what he can with a rather small role. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is not a perfect film in any way, but the insulting attacks on it by much of the public going to the cinema is not at all deserved. Maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of Lean and Kubrick, or perhaps people expected something simple to understand. Complex to criticize, brilliantly directed and filmed, "The English Patient" is a fantastic modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
