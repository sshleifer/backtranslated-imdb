This film was certainly not very sophisticated. No, the humor was actually rather stupid now that I think about it. But, even if I think about it, I laughed, proving that a decent comedy doesn't need to be very deep. <br /> <br /> Fatty Arbuckle is the definitive star of this short, despite Buster Keaton appearing in the film as well. He is the butcher of an old grocery store. A lot of silly things have happened in the store and I think I laughed more during the coffee grinder sequence - you just have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> However, later, Fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because she can't stand being separated, she dresses up as a drag and infiltrates school. Arbuckle is an ugly woman! So, for silly and unsophisticated fun, watch this movie. It won't change your life and it's a very light photo, but it's also fun.
