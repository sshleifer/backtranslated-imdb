My cousins ​​and I have seen this movie since we were little. I don't know exactly what this movie is, but we clung to this catchy movie and it became a special part of our family's memories. <br /> <br /> I absolutely and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good healthy family movies because that's exactly what it is. The things the four children dive into are absolutely fun to watch. It's an old movie but don't let it fool you. This is one of the best movies out there that shows a strong bond between siblings.
