OK. Finally a horror film that went well. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that an effort had been made to create what I consider almost a masterpiece of horror. Zombies, whores, alcohol, tombs and much more. An excellent cast, well acted, well directed, well written --- there was almost no flaw. Even the American actors with Irish / English accents really pulled it off. I thought the actor Larry Fessenden was familiar to me. It was that missing tooth. In the end I realized that this guy was the protagonist of "Habit", a vampire movie in New York. I thought she was excellent in that role. Now I wonder if he is American or not. His accent was so convincing in "I Sell" that I thought he grew up on the emerald island, not in the United States. Well, apparently he's a born and raised New Yorker. A great actor - he really made his role in this film. Nothing beats a horror film set in early 19th century Europe (like Hammer's old action films). I encourage anyone who wants to have fun watching this well-made film.
