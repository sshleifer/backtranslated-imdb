I am always surprised, since the famous title track of 2001 is called "Also sprach Zarathustra", which nobody (anybody who has read, anyway) has noticed the parallels between the film and Nietzsche's famous work, "Also sprach Zarathustra". The idea of ​​man's rebirth in a starry child; an infantile form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of "Zarathustra" of N .; there is an important passage called "On as a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the sovereign as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel , always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutal, will-power (the lion) side. The fact that the song plays during the sequence of star children can hardly be a coincidence. And besides, Zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between beasts and survivors". The structure of the film adapts to this description: a brief history of man as a beast, until we really become men by mastering the weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence on man (the rope, so to speak), and then a brief look of the survivor. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra", it makes it quite clear that he has no idea how people will be able to put these changes into practice and suggests that we will have to depend on a stranger (Zarathustra) to show us how to "go under". Bowman's psychedelic sequence on the near side could be seen as Kubrick's best attempt in 1960 to paint the mystic "go below". I know these parallels are quite broad and almost certainly have been noticed elsewhere even though they haven't seen it personally. But I just wanted to mention them, if only to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a grim philosopher. Few people believe that the end of 2001 is bleak, and in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be that 2001 is above all a dramatization of "Zarathustra" updated for the modern era. Feel free to ignore the absolute snobbiness of binding everything to Nietzsche.
