I want to prefigure this review by saying that I have no idea what "Begotten" really is. All I really know is that in the beginning God kills himself, in turn giving birth to Mother Earth, who proceeds to become imbued with the sperm of God. So, he generates a child. The rest is rather subjective, and you have to interpret it your way. <br /> <br /> How I chose to play the film was this; God killing himself meant the beginning of the scientific revolution, when people began to question the doctrines imposed by the church, such as the geocentric view of the universe, etc. Mother Earth symbolized the people who began to think for themselves and refused the church "it happens because God says so" seen. The tribal people were the church that hurled themselves against them, trying to force Christianity down their throats. I'm not exactly sure how Son Of Earth fits into this. Mother Earth and the tribal people seemed to quarrel for him, so maybe he represents people's freedom or something. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the final parts of this film will mean. To beat, to rape and then to dismember Mother Earth and Son of the Earth and to grind them in the ground like a mortar and a pestle could mean anything, but that's where the fun of this movie is found; You can interpret it as you like. There must be no definitive meaning, you can let your mind wander. Sometimes you don't even know what you should look at because it is turned into a strange corner or is too confusing. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me is that I was expecting a real terrifying movie. I was thinking that I was about to receive a phone call immediately afterwards with a "seven-day" warning foreboding. What I got was pleasantly different. It wasn't scary at all, but it stimulated my imagination. Trying to decipher the cryptic message of the film was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were indeed beautiful. Mother Earth, newborn, I can think of the final scene of the forest path. <br /> <br /> So overall, I'd say I really enjoyed this movie. It's definitely the most abstract film I've ever seen, but it's not a bad thing.
