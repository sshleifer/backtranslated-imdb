When you watch the best films from Mexico, you will most likely discover that the photograph was performed by Gabriel Figueroa. It is recognized worldwide as one of the best that has ever existed. His main control of the cameras gave added value to the films of which he was a part. If added to his participation we add the direction of Luis Bunuel, you will never find a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by the greatest Spanish writer besides Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quijote de la Mancha). The story itself is superb: Nazarin, a priest who lives according to his convictions, tries to live a very Christian life, but as always there are people who do not accept it. He wanders through many places preaching his Christianity but finding, more often than not, people who do not accept him. But besides the splendid story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us through the image in scenes that make you shudder.
