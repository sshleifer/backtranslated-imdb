I was in my mid-teens when I saw this movie, and I was struck by the beauty of the young stars, the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. It amazes me to know that Alvina recently died, that Bury seems not to have worked in the film industry for almost 30 years, and that both would be in their fifties. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Elton John is incredibly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence that the characters experience in solitude. I saw the poster of the film, which labeled it as "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which apparently means something like "Two children who love each other" - English-speaking distributors were wise to shorten the title! <br /> <br /> Paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an English businessman who lives in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. The two take what they mean by a one-day vacation in Michelle's rural cottage, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home. After the birth of the child, the police come to Paul's workplace and take him away. <br /> <br /> "Blue Lagoon" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise. It's so sad that "Friends" has never been released on DVD.
