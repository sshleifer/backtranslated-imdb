A film like this doesn't come too often. I'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. Politicians and civilian hawks should see it before making decisions about how destroyed peoples live, I saw it the day after watching the TV version of "Uprising" on the Warsaw ghetto. Even with that in mind, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I felt sympathy for all the parts that this tragedy could happen. It will take some time to melt away from this. I'm surprised they didn't make a film based on Buy Sajer's "The Forgotten Soldier". This film shares the cold with the book. Both will haunt me for the rest of my life.
