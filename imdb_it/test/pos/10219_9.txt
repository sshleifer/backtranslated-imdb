This film is masterfully directed by Clive barker, he really knows how to establish a relationship between the public and the characters. I think there's a sequel to this, Barker would have to devote himself to the sequel to this film instead of making the boring Lord of Illusions, which is what I think was a real garbage. But I also think that for this reason and for the lack of the sequel, NBreed has become a classic of dark cult of horror movies.
