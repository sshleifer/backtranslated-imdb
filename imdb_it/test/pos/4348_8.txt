<br /> <br /> Oh my word !! I have never seen a film so devoid of any kind of moral judgment or consideration for anything other than the death of scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in showing a world of face-trumpet of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he feed us with hell on earth seen through the mustachioed Bronson's face, but he also shows us the spoon he's eating us with and says "look at what you're looking at now look at yourself and ask the question: are you having fun? "And even if you say NO, IT CAN'T BE !!!! You will know that after all you will know ... it is a masterpiece
