Once the slow start begins, the film gets underway and becomes very funny in many unexpected ways. The ensemble cast is really good, with Heather Graham maybe the weakest of them. Casey Affleck as his brother is really good and extremely nice, if you understand what I prefer. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the film if you just want to have good hours. Teenagers should really appreciate this movie - it says a lot about relationships.
