This film is a sleeper - I've seen every miniseries that has ever been on TV, sometimes, and this is the best. Wonderfully cast, superbly performed, and the characters are well developed. Helen Morse adapts perfectly to the part of Jean Paget - strident, in control, sharp and somewhat belligerent. Bounce well on Joe Harmon, the cowboy / taciturn / "It'll be all right" kind of guy. I was disappointed that the film did not stick to the book, as there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who don't know, this is taken from a true story of English women who marched around the Malaya for 3 years from the Japanese, who actually didn't know what to do with them. Very few of them have survived. Neville Shute spoke to one of them, and this is his story. This film deserves to be in everyone's collection that loves the stories of the Second World War.
