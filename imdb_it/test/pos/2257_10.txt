I thought this movie was fantastic. I was a little skeptical because I had no idea what it was, but it was a good story. I cried a lot and I also laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> I think it is very important that films are made about the Holocaust and how it affects people (it happened only 60 years ago!) I was in Germany and Eastern Europe and studied 'Holocaust, so this film meant a lot to me. I think this film did a fantastic job capturing this story (I won't go into details, I don't want to ruin it) but I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a film that, I know, might seem like a clich√©, but it will change your mindset about things.
