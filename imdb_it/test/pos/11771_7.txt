The first half hour of "Homegrown" was rather boring and non-absorbent, but with the progress of the film, my interest in the characters and the plot also. Several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters you are actually fond of. The story is about three hands on an illegal marijuana farm hidden in southern California. They are witness to the murder of the farm owner, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and take their herb. The three rather simple peasant hands will soon be swept away in a frightening world of mafia and local interests, while all the while trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the film had several flaws and a slow start, it was worth it. 7/10 stars.
