I love this movie (I don't know why it's called Pot Luck in England - what a lousy and totally irrelevant name!), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so I only heard the same. It brings back so many beautiful memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the sequel "Les Poupees Russes" (Russian dolls), I guess it won't be published here? My brother saw him in France and said the def was not good, but he had a very similar cast (Wendy's brother apparently marries). Does anyone know anything about this movie? and if it can be released?
