This movie kicks his ass, without exception. Bam and his clay made themselves with this film. Since I took the DVD (4 days ago) I've seen it three times and it gets better every time I watch it. I can't wait for Grind to go out in theaters. If something like Haggard will be worth the wait. <br /> <br /> Thanks, JTCellphone
