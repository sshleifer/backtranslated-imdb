Adapted from Sam Shepard's drama, this film retains many game elements such as a relatively fixed environment (a roadside motel in the southwest in the 1950s) and extensive and intriguing dialogues. A "May" woman is hunted by an "Eddie" man (played by Sam Shepard). He tries to hide from him in the motel, but he finds her. The film explores the story of their relationship, mainly from their childhood, which brought them to this point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their current dysfunctional relationship is the result of events passed out of their control. We observe them mainly to fight, make up, fight, make up and so on. An image that stands out in my mind is that of Eddie dragging May on his shoulder to kick and scream, taking her somewhere that she doesn't want to go. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also the perfect soul-filled country with the voice of a lesser known artist "Sandy Rogers". He has a country doll voice that is almost yodel in some parts of the album! This is the kind of film that will remain somewhere in your brain / soul. In other words, go see it!
