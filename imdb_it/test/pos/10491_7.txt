In the post-American civil war the President, (Van Johnson), travels to Dallas and is assassinated by corrupt officials and businessmen interested in installing the vice president who can blackmail them for incriminating documents. A hit man (Guiliano Gemma) convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the objective of the murder to discover the truth. Tonino Valeri directed this fascinating film, even if imperfect, which is obviously an allegory of Kennedy's murder. The film may incorrectly present blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas, but the film is still enjoyable and presents an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy's death was the result of a coup - that many Americans do not they could accept at the time. Oswald's murder is reproduced here as the black accused of the assassination is assassinated by the men responsible, on the way to the Fort Worth prison. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than Oswald's death with his various escorts shot down before his death scene. However this is certainly one of the most interesting and noteworthy spaghetti westerns. It's worth a look!
