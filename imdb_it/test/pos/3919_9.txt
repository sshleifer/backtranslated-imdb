I usually make horror films around 6/10, but this caught my attention. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I've ever seen ... even better than the Amityville Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was pretty good at this and I have to say he has a good future. His death scene was probably the most beautiful. I will only say how he dies ... <br /> <br /> He holds a giant pole right between the eyes and the close-ups and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was great both as a murderer, both as Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). He usually plays a policeman or a soldier, but he did very well in this. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also played very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, then Eliza stole it back bearing a lot of pain in the second half as if they had taken her finger off, tearing her lips off after being glued together, and getting a fist straight forward face from Bo. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this movie an 8/10. Fans of horror movies MUST see it.
