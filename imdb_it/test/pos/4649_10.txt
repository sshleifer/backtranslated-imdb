This is my favorite movie of all time ever !!! <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him when I was younger and I've been in love with him ever since. I had rented it so often from this video store that carried it, and when we moved I couldn't find it anywhere, so I promised myself to go back to the farther store just to see the movie again! <br /> <br /> Finally I found it for sale and I bought it and looked over and over again .... great movie! <br /> <br /> But since then it was my very first DVD that I got after getting my DVD player ... OK well I took them at the same time, the quality of the DVD is much better I couldn't believe it ! You have to see this!
