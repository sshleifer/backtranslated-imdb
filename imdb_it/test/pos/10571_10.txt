I never dreamed when I started watching this DVD that I would be totally hypnotized in a few minutes. The story was completely absorbing and fun. The acting was superb. The biggest surprise of all was my total enchantment with the love these two young women radiated on the screen. Their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender, romantic, delightful, passionately compelling love scene I've ever seen in a movie. I literally stopped breathing. I could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. Without nudity or graphic sex, they conveyed more passion and titillation than any American production could ever hope to show. Good at the author, the writer, the director and the cast.
