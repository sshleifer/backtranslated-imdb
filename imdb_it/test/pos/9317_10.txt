Before continuing with the new millennium, I will go back in time again because I completely forgot about these gems !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, Disney, despite being a "low" company in the 1980s, was able to start a series of films on television entitled "Not Quite Human", about a geeky teenager who , as in "Inspector Gadget", it looks like a human but it is really a robot !!!!! Now this SCREAMS 80S, along with other films like "Tron" and "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids" because it combines everything from the past with the technologies of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember seeing this on TV then, when I was just born or something. However, my first encounter with this film was on the Old Disney Channel (once, I saw this, and the other parts, my twelfth birthday in May of '99 !!!!!) <br /> <br / > "Not Quite Human" is a great series of movies to watch, if you can find these films again. <br /> <br /> Has it been shown recently? In this case, send me an e-mail or a personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
