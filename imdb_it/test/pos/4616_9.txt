At 2:37 a high school student commits suicide. It is not shown who took their lives or reasons, time jumps back to the beginning of the day. From here we follow six separate students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching the boiling point, ending up with one. <br /> <br /> After losing a friend to suicide, and survived his suicide attempt, writer / director Murali K. Thalluri created a revolutionary drama centered on the lives of adolescents and the horrible act of suicide. Suicide was a topic that was kept in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or by anyone who did it, 2:37 becomes even more difficult to see. <br /> <br /> With heavy and difficult arguments, Thalluri also addresses the crises of adolescent daily life. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri manages them and shows them in an extremely realistic way. The factor on Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. Respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered at times. Sometimes he approaches the documentary, he has such painful realism; interviews with each character spliced ​​through the film only increase this. <br /> <br /> 2:37 has a distinctive resemblance to the film Elephant by Gus Van Sants. While the core of each film is different, both face the lives of adolescents. Like Sant, Thalluri uses long tracking strokes, with time jumping back and forth, to show the interaction of each character from different perspectives. A decisive point for Elephant was its ethereal environment. With a carefree conversation, poor character development and long tracking, Sant created an eerie and fascinating atmosphere for an upcoming terror. While this terror is found in 2:37, the emotional connection with the characters reaches a higher level that Sant could not reach. Over time, each character's fragility creeps in, dragging you along the emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The real success of this film comes with the inevitable suicide, predicted at the beginning. The difficult part of this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience that looks at someone's life in a gruesome way. Although many films that have shown suicide, fly over the act or romanticize the act. Thalluri shows the pain and agony involved in this act and that is not the best solution. With the unknowns in the contacts and their first main roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers. <br /> <br /> The compelling and revisiting, 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film.
