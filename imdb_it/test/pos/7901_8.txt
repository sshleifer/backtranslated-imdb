Winning 26 of the 28 awards for which he was nominated, there is no doubt that this film will present itself as one of the best of 2007. The fact that it was made with non-professionals who were trained to act and dance makes it much more special. <br /> <br /> It is not a Bollywood production, but it is about art. A lower caste girl wants to sing and dance. He wants to go up in society, but there is a limit. Everyone cannot be the president in India, there is a caste system and narrow minds will not allow it to be violated. <br /> <br /> Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) leaves school at 15 and goes to work for the owner (Urmila Dammannagari), who was once an experienced dancer. After some time working with the animals, she is taught to sing and dance. The film is extraordinarily beautiful with intense colors. It's amazing what you can do with $ 20,000, as this film was a master project for the writer director. <br /> <br /> The son of the landlady (Karan Singh) returns from America to run to the office and is struck by the girl. But she is a lower caste and can only be a ship for her lust. Things are no better at home when his father drinks, eats and steals his money. She ends up pregnant and has to sell the baby to the landlady. <br /> <br /> In the end, she never rises above her caste, but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good.
