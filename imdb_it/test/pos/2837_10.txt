"Nurse Betty" is the kind of movie you can't describe on a poster or in a trailer or an advertisement. It's the kind of movie you come in and expect a more mature "Dumb and Dumber" with a temporarily insane waitress who embarks on a cross country adventure avoiding scammers trying to kill her. <br /> <br /> The fact is, this film is a wonderful and moving story about two people chasing their dreams. The best part of "Nurse Betty" is its unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to separate dreams from reality, and along with the moving drama and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what will happen next.
