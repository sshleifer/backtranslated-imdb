I really liked Fierce People. I discovered the movie by accident, looking through my lists of On-Demand movies trying to find something interesting to watch. The film is mostly classy in America and quickly attracts your attention. The characters are intelligent and articulate and the story does not stick to the usual rules of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist is Finn, a very precocious, but disadvantaged fifteen year old who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays the patriarch, Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden who is also a habitual cocaine and a slut. Osbournes has a large property and seems to live by its own rules. At first they look fascinating and sophisticated but the super-rich are different. They are used to doing it their way. The film is fun especially because it has an intelligent dialogue, a superb acting and a plot that requires unexpected turns. It's also an R-rated movie, so it's not completely healthy. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is credible and supportive in the challenging role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is as impressive as Osbourne's sneaky nephew. Kristen Stewart is as good as the beautiful little niece. High quality movies
