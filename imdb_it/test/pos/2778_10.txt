this is the best movie i've ever seen and i love it so it's so sad and loving that i could watch this movie over and over again. when I first saw it on the Disney channel I was like I'd like to see this movie again. I'd like to see this movie every day and recommend it to anyone. this is really a good movie. to all those who have not seen this movie and are thinking about it, it's better to go see it because it's really good. I love the part when the boy discovered the girl and from then on I went all alone in this movie. if I could watch two movies every day this would be loved and those are my two favorite movies I really love them
