I saw this movie for the first time in the early 1990s, and I immediately fell in love with it. Richard Benjamin and his wife Paula made the 1981 film "Saturday 14" in 1981 before shooting this film in 1983. I think they work pretty good together. this movie made me laugh on several occasions. He also has a young molly ringwald, who will later go on to make films like pink and sixteen candles in the late 80s. It's fun to look at her a little younger. not seen by many people .. I don't even think the movie fan has ever heard of this film. but when I first met him I was glad I did. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as I think it is a funny film that the whole family can enjoy. I would like to say that it is not available on DVD, so I took a VHS copy on ebay, so if you are interested, you will probably find one on there.it could be in $ 20 $ 30 dollars, but I had the mind for $ 12 dollars. I wish they would eventually release it on DVD.
