I love dogs, and the most interesting character in this film is a Golden Retriever. It's smarter, better looking and more interesting than any other human character. Like many other contributors, I did not read the book, but I doubt that doing so would change my opinion of the film. It is predictable from the first five minutes onwards. No surprises. Mad scientists create a monster that breaks free and a teenage boy and his prodigy dog ​​work together to destroy it. All in all the film is a dog. But like I said, I love dogs and so I'll give this film a 7/10 rating. Watch it if it comes on TV, rent it if you're bored and nothing else attracts attention, but don't buy it unless it's special.
