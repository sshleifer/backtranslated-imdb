Fame, I think, was the best film I've ever seen. In a way it was fun and dramatic, but that's what makes a movie. True, it has some limits, actually a lot, but I still think it's a fantastic film. Some of the fun things happen at the beginning of the movie. I think it's funny when the girl tries to play O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph go around in every art department saying that his father was great at all. He says his father danced with the Rockets and left Ralph with his typographic shoes. The Rockets, as far as I know, are made of women. And the tap shoes were just normal shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. Even the boy who read Juliet's lines in the drama of Romeo and Juliet was fun. One thing about the movie that excites me is the music. I've never heard anything like it !!! My favorite song is "I Sing the Body Electric" and my second song is "Fame". Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the way the film focused on many ethnic groups. It showed all types of people present in what is now called "La Guardia School of the Performing Arts". This film showed the triumphs and trials of many young artists, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. They all had a difficult time, but they did it their way. This film could have added about another 30-45 minutes (before graduation), but it's still my favorite movie, no matter what !!!!
