I would like to thank you for giving me the chance to be one of the first to actually see the film. It really grabs you. John Paul eventually gets to see the light and earns a living by being tied to his mothers' apron strings. I imagine there are so many families these days in the same position (especially with the children who come out of their homes older but I wouldn't say wise anymore) with very sad parents who haven't had a life of their own and who make their lives a misery. <br /> <br /> I think this film should definitely have a wider audience. I would also say that the other actors also played brilliant parts. It is such a profound and very moving film.
