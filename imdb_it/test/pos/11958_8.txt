Ok, there are always people out there who seem to make a point of not appreciating movies because they are good, but instead prefer to choose films based on how depressing or boring they are, or if they come from a foreign country. Apart from that, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American comedy for teenagers should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), surreal (Bobcat under the inspired direction of Steve Holland), and dry (John Cusack, one of the most morally dry and amusing actors in American cinema), and there is no character in this film that doesn't provide at least one funny line (ok, except Demi Moore). Yes, it's immature, yes, it's a ball of screw, yes, Bobcat dresses like Godzilla and destroys a scale model of a fish restaurant. It's also fun to die for. Watch it.
