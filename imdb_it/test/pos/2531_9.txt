This was really a "nightmare" of a movie; I saw it about nine years ago on cable TV and haven't forgotten it since. Pixote is a 10-year-old boy who lives in the streets of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico; they steal, exploit, sell drugs and kill to survive every day ... In the first half of the film Pixote is captured by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse by older inmates and guards to the rest some children; one night, Lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so Pixote and his friends decide to flee during a riot. The rest of the film shows Pixote's descent into a criminal life; does not show any feeling or remorse after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings do not serve the world he lives in ... But there is still a kind scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are on the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the reform school was there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholic scene in the midst of all these horrible events ... the boys obviously want not only for their friend, but for a better life. The "Pixote" by director Hector Babenco is a brave and depressing film that does not hesitate to show the harder reality that many people, including myself, tend to ignore or misunderstand. This film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.
