I tend to be inclined towards films about people who choose to overcome the barriers of censorship and express what they really want to express. Barry's Eric Bogosian character is like Howard Stern, but much smarter. The character himself is very charming. As an Oliver Stone movie, I guess I expect more. The film yields a little during the third act. Furthermore, it is quite obvious that "Talk Radio" is based on a game, with its long dialogue scenes. But overall, the film works. Bogosian is a great protagonist, and the fact that he also wrote the script from which the film was based probably helped him. If you want to take a look at one of Stone's most important films, I suggest you take a look at "JFK" or "Salvador". This is not his best job, but still a good movie.
