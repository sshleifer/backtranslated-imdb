The third film by the Polish brothers is still their best, most beautiful and imaginative film. Although many viewers will have a problem with the lack of Northfork's traditional dramatic structure, "Come on, Jack!". The plot is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, God with a cowboy hat, selling angel wings and a sick orphan (but everything works). The extraordinary photography of M. David Mullen makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to watch. The performances of the actors, who work with the irresistibly police script of the Polish brothers, are perfect and give the film an emotional punch. The very strong member of the public will be moved by the mythology and the folk tale of the story, by the comical and moving actors, and finally by the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Once again all these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together beautifully in one of the most incredible things you should exhaust and experiment with. A great big movie !!!
