I think it's a brilliant show with fantastic talking heads and really interesting actions. 2 guys who pretend to be masters in seducing women demonstrate their skills in different night clubs and 4 experts (same pick-up artists) comment on them, choosing the winner. Their jokes are fun and some participants are really fun to watch. Furthermore, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, many of the experts' comments are useful while you can see how it works in the field. Actually, I think this is one of the best television programs and I highly recommend it to all men, who like women. <br /> <br /> ps / I lose for my broken error.
