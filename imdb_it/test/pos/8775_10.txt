I really enjoyed watching this movie. I think it's a brilliant and underrated Alfred Hitchcock film. Everyone is familiar with the famous Statue of Liberty scene, but there is a very beautiful film before this. Robert Cummings is exceptional in what I consider his most important role, and the beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she too is very talented. But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best performance. His character, Fry, is so mean and sneaky. Even if he hasn't worked there long, the film would never be the same without him. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is a fantastic film that every Hitchcock fan should see. I give him a 10 out of 10 !!
