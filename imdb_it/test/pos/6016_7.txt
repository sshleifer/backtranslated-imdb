Based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more affectionate image of their mother than his sister, the actress "Baby" June Havoc, in her autobiography "Early Havoc" in which "They shoot horses, Do not They? " it was freely based. I saw Ethyl Merman in the original production of Gypsy on Broadway, and she was fantastic as "Mama Rose" but definitely more "Merman" than Rose. I was disappointed with the portrait of Rosalind Russell in the 1962 film version. An otherwise excellent actress, Russell was a very wooden substitute for Merman. Bette Midler, on the other hand, was better and more credible than Merman and I would recommend her performance as definitive.
