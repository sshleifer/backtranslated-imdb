Don't ask me why I love this movie so much ... Maybe it came at a time in my life where I desperately wanted to adapt, maybe it's the fantastic effects of monsters, maybe because I liked the novel "Cabal", but it's probably because LOVE Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you of the movie and the novel has no real resolution and, like me, you will probably have a WTF moment at the end. At least two sequels were planned, but they were never realized due to the fact that the film was flopped for some reasons. The study made drastic cuts to the film by cutting a good 30 minutes and did a HORRIBLE job promoting it. The publicity only made it look like another economic slasher that mainly shows the character of "Button face / Mask". This is a monster movie! About fantasy! On a place called Midian! It's a story where monsters are good guys. There's really nothing else out there like it! It's not a movie for everyone, I suppose, but it's one of Clive's many great works. Sit down and prepare to be taken to Midian - where the monsters are.
