As other reviews have stated, there are some missing videos of this collection, but what is on this record is overwhelming. There are two separate soundtracks, an original recording and a new version completely renewed. Any new Residents' music is welcome, and I suppose for the first time the listener, the new version may be more intuitive, but I prefer the original recordings (probably simply because they are "original".) The production of this DVD is video interesting, new and old are all interesting, with live performance videos probably the least interesting of what is offered (although the fragments of live recordings hidden like Easter eggs are extremely welcome). This is not a tenant, this it is an absolutely personal collection. To enjoy.
