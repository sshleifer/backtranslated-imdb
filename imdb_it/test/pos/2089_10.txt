A great movie. Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible shows all around. The images are disturbing, beautiful and sometimes wonderfully beautiful shots of the Japanese countryside and city landscapes. The sounds, courtesy of the Japanese group "Dig", are never as sharp as you'd expect from a soundtrack band. It is strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes in which they are found. <br /> <br /> All in all, they worked perfectly perfectly ... Well, if they were to do justice to the story, perfection is the only thing that anyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> The true greatness of 9 Souls is the compelling story. These days, the prison movie is perhaps something of a lost genre, and the road movie loses its appeal due to the way the world is shrinking. But this story easily mixes something new to those two genres. <br /> <br /> 9 convicts have the freedom and perhaps the opportunity to regain their places in society. will the company accept them? will they really be free from their dark past? and can they stay together long enough to stay alive and discover? <br /> <br /> Every prisoner has an interesting history. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent destinies. A sense of brotherhood between them keeps the story about drama high and provides it with hilarious comic situations. And due to the nature of their backgrounds, violence is always something waiting to happen. <br /> <br /> After all I can say is go and have a look.
