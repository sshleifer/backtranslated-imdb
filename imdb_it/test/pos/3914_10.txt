PEOPLE ARE STUPID. You don't have to cheer when Paris is killed in the head with a pipe! It is simply rude! What did Paris do to you? And if I were you? You wouldn't want people to applaud your death! However it was really bloody, which I liked and it was nice when Elisha's finger was cut. It was weird with that touch that they didn't have 2 children they had, makes room for House of Wax 2: Ressurction or something. Paris played very well in the chase scene. The chemistry of Elisha and Chad is fantastic, they deserve an Oscar. My friends and I were tearing apart when that guy said it's hot when Paris and the guy from Cousin Skeeter coming out. Greetings.
