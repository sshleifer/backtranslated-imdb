"Jaded" addresses the complex issue of abuse: authors and victims. In inferior hands he would degenerate into an erotic thriller created for direct-to-video. However, this director has managed to create a multi-level structured study with a decidedly different point of view. <br /> <br /> Since the director / writer is a woman and the principal detective and D.A. they are also women, this could have become a very anti-masculine film. It is not. Being a sexual predator is gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. Rape is brutal and not sexual. We are looking at the victims and not the titillation. <br /> <br /> The talented cast sounds true. For a film that is so little known, I was surprised by the quality of the performances. Are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this movie got lost. Maybe he's too smart for his own good. It is a "should see". Highly recommended. The sexual thriller of a thinking person.
