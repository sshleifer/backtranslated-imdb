Night of the Demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good a budget can be. Sure, most of it is quite predictable, but somehow it's still a lot more fun than the shit we see these days having passed as "Horror". I give Gore a solid 9, and the Demon one-liners are actually fun. I'm still scared of "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from the Bauhaus! There is also a nice T & A on display, as well as some great makeup effects. The second film in the series is also quite good, but avoids the lower third. The night of the demons can be dated, dark and cheap, but it still has a lot of potential. Definitely worth hiring at least. Give it a chance tonight, stay away from any ancient makeup! (you'll understand when you see it!)
