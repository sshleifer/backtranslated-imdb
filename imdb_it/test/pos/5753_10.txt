My God, this is funny stuff. Yes, it is childish in the extreme, but also quite witty ("Here's the page with all the wines on it." "It's a little early for us, I'm afraid." "Well, what are you doing then?") And the combat sequences are second to none. Despite what you may have heard, the laughter * continues * to come, and at a surprisingly generous pace. Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson's extraordinary comic abilities contribute to making it incredibly fun. twisting every drop of comedy from the script. I can only compare it to "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" - or the film is hysterical for everything or not at all; the same is true here. It is probably the funniest British film from "Withnail and I", but to say that it is an acquired taste is a gross underestimation (sic).
