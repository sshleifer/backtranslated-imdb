At first I thought this movie would bother me. It was as if I had seen this movie somewhere before. The disillusioned hero, the paternal figure and the sister of 9 years who is older and wiser than his years (see Gregory's girlfriend), but then, not at 15 minutes, she became a loud laugh, comic gem of a film. Dylan Moran (who I thought was going to annoy me) was excellent. As were Mr. Gambon and the crazy Scottish assassin. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. For half the movie I was trying to remember where I had seen it before. The word officer. She has the most incredible smile. But clearly the real hero of this film is Mr. Caine. This man should do much more comedy. This is alongside some of his best comic roles (Without a Clue, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). It is a pleasure to look at all its scenes but above all at the end. <br /> <br /> Nobody can tell f ** k how Michael can do it. <br /> <br />
