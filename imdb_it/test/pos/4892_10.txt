I never saw any of The League's works until early last year - although when the channel skipped one night, I took the end of a three-episode series. But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes even sinister characters. So when I learned that they had made a movie where the adorable creators of the show met their characters, I couldn't order the DVD fast enough and snatched it almost from the hands of my postman when he delivered it. I was so excited to see what the Gents had done and how they had done it. <br /> <br /> And it was excellent! From the very beginning when Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrified of Edward, Tubbs and Papa (Dyson, why didn't you play yourself? Are you perfectly capable as spectators of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors know it!), To Bernice who criticizes yet another of his flock, to Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary discovering that they are characters, which is a great scene. The scenes set in 1690 are very funny, with the Gents addressing an even greater number of characters and a completely new storyline. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea is fantastic, slightly encamped and very funny. <br /> <br /> The League has always been brilliant in combining humor with sadness and emotion - and the climax of this film, where Herr Lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other Vasey residents are just imaginary people that they will never be able to change what they are or their purpose - and to witness how it is breaking down, it is really sad and beautiful to look at the same time and it really shows the talent of the Gents - something for which they are terribly neglected until to date. <br /> <br /> And then you have a pretty clever ending - where you sit with wonder - with the beautiful themed music of Joby Talbot. And you know you enjoyed a very smart and funny movie.
