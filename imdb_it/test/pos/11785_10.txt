So fun is the perfect way to describe this 12-minute parody of the original Star Wars. Hardware Wars is incredibly fun. It looks like the Space Hardware Wars epic trailer. The joke is this: imagine Star Wars played by bad actors and incredible special effects. The characters include the "intergalactic boy-wonder" Fluke Starbucker, "the mercenary and intergalactic wise man ace" Ham Salad, Darph Nader, "villain" and a host of other fantastic characters. It's impossible not to laugh as you watch this 12-minute treasure. It's stupid but it's fun. You will laugh from the beginning to the end and you will feel the need to look at him again, and again, and again and again ... And you will laugh every time you see him !!! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. The 12 most enjoyable minutes ever made. You think it lasted a minute!
