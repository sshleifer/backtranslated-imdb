"A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die" is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting texture. It is shot beautifully, with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord does an exceptional job interpreting Clay McCord, an outlaw who suffers from increasingly debilitating attacks. He is looking for amnesty before his enemies approach him, but he is too arrogant for his own good when he asks for it. Robert Ryan offers the best performance of the film as governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also fantastic here. <br /> <br /> This film is very good, but it doesn't look like one of the best spaghetti westerns. It lacks too much style to be in the same league as the big ones. It has some cold spaghetti tones, but overall it's a bit too much like an American western. This is particularly evident in the musical score, which is OK like films in general, but rather boring by Euro-Western standards. The soundtrack reminds me of the music of "The Unforgiven". Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a way that is a little too conventional for my taste. If a spaghetti western fan and a western Hollywood fan were to watch a movie together, this would be the perfect compromise. <br /> <br /> All this does not mean that someone should avoid this movie. I really enjoyed watching it. As I said, it's a very well made film and I recommend it to anyone who loves westerns, spaghetti or anything else.
