Finally a gangster movie that is worth watching! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily should be nominated for her role as a tough murderous femme fatale! <br /> <br /> This film flies like a bird, just a fast-paced Gangster Mayhem! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily is so beautiful and bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see that Faye Dunaway still lives! The cast of this film is so suited to their roles. <br /> <br /> A real fantastic soundtrack winds along the side and you're overwhelmed by the Spanish soul of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is original, profound and poetic. <br /> <br /> This Flick has a lot of Substance and it never rests. <br /> <br /> The Spanish Fire gang has just turned everything on the screen. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa is a joy to watch and a Star movie. <br /> <br /> Sit down and enjoy the journey.
