This film is a hidden gem. I can't understand why this movie has no more time on the air. Errol and Eleanor Parker are a very attractive and charming couple. And their chemistry is impeccable. I really liked the touch of his daughters referring to him as his Robin Hood. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Errol Flynn. It is also nice to see Errol playing a father. From all the accounts of his own children, he was a very caring and loving father in real life. Furthermore, the supporting cast is also wonderful. You can't go wrong in supporting players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a film much better from the start. This film has now become a holiday tradition in my home. To enjoy!!!
