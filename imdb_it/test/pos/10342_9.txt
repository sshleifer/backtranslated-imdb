Browsing through the canals I was lucky to get to the beginning of this film. I must admit that it caught my attention almost immediately. I love older movies and this is or should be considered a classic! One of the most beautiful rarities of this film is that the main character was not only feminine, but was also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!
