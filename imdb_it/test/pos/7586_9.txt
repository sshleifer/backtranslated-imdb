I saw over 2000 studio-era-style sound films - including many Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and the same films as Deanna Durbin - plus a fair amount of live and studio-recorded comedies and musical works. And I assure you that no one has the task of singing in front of a camera and a microphone, or maybe anywhere, it has ALWAYS TOUCHED DURBIN ONLY here ... the monochrome soundtrack and the microphones of the 1930s and all the rest. The Canadian boy sings this piece of "Il Bacio" as he lived and wrote it himself and then appeared for a retrospective in Italy at the end of his career, not as a child who learned it from his music teacher. > <br /> If you skip this Extra on the DVD - or jump forward to Garland's solo - you're just robbing yourself, since this cheap MGM teaser just happened to capture one of the biggest performances of the 20c.
