I saw this movie on its opening night and I enjoyed it. I probably would have liked it better if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I haven't seen it yet) and continued to talk through it all. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that he was stupid. The fact is that he didn't understand that the creators were slightly mocking the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted. If they weren't in the movie, well, maybe you won't like it very much. The characters of the brand are: <br /> <br /> "The main character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "The main character's boyfriend": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "The brother of the protagonists / Remade / short" Jerk ": Nick (Chad Michael Murray)" The Annoying Sluttish Character ": Paige (Paris Hilton)" Characters who are there to look beautiful ": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) & Blake (Robert Ri'chard) <br /> <With those characters, it makes it a bit predictable who will die and who will live. Obviously, you know who will do it with what I just typed in. The film could be predictable (in fact, I had a good idea that he would die only by watching the trailer), but it was still nice It may seem silly (why is there a sugar factory in the middle of an abandoned camp site that wasn't there at the beginning?) Sometimes, but it's very easy to watch. Comedy and cold blood were the perfect figure for the weak movie lovers, but not for this, I'm not wrong, (less than "Final De") stination 2) but it works very well. So in conclusion, this film was not as hot as fire, the set went up, but the temperature could still burn the "Cera".
