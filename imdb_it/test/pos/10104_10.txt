I saw this movie for the first time two years ago in the cinema, and I fell in love with this dark story of two pregnant teenage sisters who are at home in their large country home with their father and their stepmother. Their relationship with their stepmother is strained to say the least, with the stepmother becoming increasingly unstable in her battles with younger girls. However, the film is inclined with fantasmatic effects in oriental and horror style, which adds a strange and disturbing aspect to the story which at first sight is not clear, but is all the more intriguing. <br /> <br /> The direction is incredibly good, and the acting is staggering, with the stepmother in particular incredibly good swing from one mood to another in the film. The big house adds weirdness, and there are enough points in the movie where you will jump out of your seat. This film clearly shows me why Korean cinema is perhaps the best in the world for the moment. Simply, you don't get anything like it in the Western world, unfortunately, and I can really see it influencing filmmakers around the world over the next decade. <br /> <br /> Vision highly recommended in my opinion, a true joy and fear ...
