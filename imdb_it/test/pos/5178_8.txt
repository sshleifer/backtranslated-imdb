My whole family enjoyed this film, including 2 small children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or swear words. Furthermore, no special zillion dollar effects have been added to try to misdirect viewers from a poorly written plot. A simple fun movie for families. We particularly like the songs in the film. But we only heard part of the songs ... especially during the credits ... I'd like to buy a CD with the soundtrack of this movie. This is my fourth Bill Hillman film and they all have the same guidelines mentioned above. With all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to watch, this type of Hillman has no risk. We love his movies.
