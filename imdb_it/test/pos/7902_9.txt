This is not your typical Indian movie. There is a certain sense of humanity and the characters are quite realistic. There is great dynamism in interpersonal relationships, and there is a sense of guilt, pain, passion, passivity among the many characters. Seeing this, one has an idea of ​​the heavy burden of the 5,000 years of layers and layers of history of the social existence of one of the most ancient civilizations. The final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a big footnote to such an ancient civilization, yet human relationships are still preserved and cultivated. I saw it on DVD, the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. He was surprised to learn that the film did not go well (or is not shown) in India (... but perhaps not too surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly being lost and its legacy is not taken up by the new generations, as some of the older musicians in the film no longer live today. Great movie.
