This was a very funny and fast movie. I've watched it more than once and I'm keeping my rental around to show others. I would just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone who knows, how do HK manufacturers choose their subtitle translators? I'm very curious. Please, direct me. <br /> <br /> Once again, to review, it's a really exciting film with a lot of content, subtleties that recall the classics, even if full of slapstick. Remember, for example, the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint the fans of the director who noticed that he chooses distinctly Chinese themes, trying to get rarely explored features. The director's entire collection is a way to take a look at culture in a disarming way. <br /> <br /> And I don't see how his funny girl in Chinese Festival can be overcome.
