This is probably one of my favorite movies. It tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a young age, so she was bought by her father. He falls in love with the bell named Kai. However, on her birthday, the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) arrives at the hotel that her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him for the four seasons in an attempt to save him. <br /> <br /> I thought this was an excellent adaptation of the story with great performances of the whole cast. It has wonderful special effects and the story fits very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great film for the whole family. I watched it every time it was turned on since it came out and I never got tired of it, and that's why I gave it a 10!
