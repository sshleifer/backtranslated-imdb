THE SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna. (Dir: Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> An inspirational tale of a living death; Bardem is superb <br /> <br /> The true report on the life of the Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedro and his petition to satisfy his desire for euthanasia with the right to die cannot be considered a probable source of inspiration, but this film this is it. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (superbly played by Bardem) was a virile and energetic young man when he lost his function for his limbs after a tragic underwater accident (told horribly in flashback with a visceral shock to the senses) and almost thirty years lay paralyzed in bed while his loving family took care of his every need. Although his ability to move was nil, his mind was very active and proved as adept as an inventor, a poet, an author and an artist who kept his mind occupied until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer long in his stunted condition. <br /> <br /> Enter into a beautiful but also plagued by a paralyzing illness Julia (the ethereal Rueda who beautifully combines Bardem as if they were soulmates) is hired to see Sampedro's last wish to end his life and in turn become a field aide when nobody starts to open up to you like never before. It doesn't take long and Julia begins to investigate the past of her accusation by discovering many letters hidden by her family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this, at first she is reluctant to discuss anything with her, but in the end she agrees with her that this can help her case and the project becomes a book in preparation ?? a memoir / biography through poetry and freestyle prose. <br /> <br /> The film is a harrowing story of the human spirit and how love eventually trumps heart pain in many forms, including for Ramon the unlikely love he shares with a perfect stranger named Rosa (Duenas), a single mother who one day sees him on TV inspiring her to ride her remote farm in Spain to meet him and maybe change her mind about her life. <br /> <br /> The director Amenabar, who wrote a fascinating script with Mateo Gil, allows a certain fantasy in the mix when Ramon imagines himself magically emerging from his bed and flying through the bucolic landscapes to the possible sea where he has suffered so many years ago the cruel twist that has imprisoned him for thirty years. The film is not a complete downer with a witty tone and from time to time a humorous tone that does not attenuate the impact of the final act of the story. Compliments for James and Jo Allen's remarkable make-up work also do a tremendous job of aging the vibrant Bardem with a fully aging man, who should get them an Acadamy Award. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve the Oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite the fact that Rueda's Julia is married to a loving and lovely husband, that a couple of people like that made one for the other it is absolutely impossible they were never together to begin with. This is just one of the cruelties that sounds real but is not by definition the film as a whole; it's a must-see and one of the best of the year.
