this is more than a special Saturday afternoon. Very well written if the very low key is a lot here if you look for it. Capture the cat mate / scout for example. Not only could it have been a comic, it should have been a comic book. The comics industry (as well as the film's publicists) missed the boat on this. One of the lesser known really great movies. A great script by John Sayles is a strength but also acting is good. Probably the best "superhero" film I've ever seen. Short of special effects but long credibility. This is a keeper. I've never seen a DVD of this film but I was the owner of a VHS version. Good hunting
