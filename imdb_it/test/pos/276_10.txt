I was almost dozing while watching a selection of short films late at night - but I jumped up from the first frames of "I Shout Love" and I couldn't take my eyes off it for its full, short and perfect length. With incredibly confident rhythm and performance, this film maintains its funny / sad / insightful tone. The credits eventually went so quickly and in such a small way, I had to go online to find out who was responsible for this main job. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, a great actress who is rarely seen. <br /> <br /> Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) perform a couple of break-ups. While working through Tessa's favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal the dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that do nothing but honor their talents - and the abilities of the director / writer. The film creates a moving narrative with moments of laughter and the pain of deep breathing. <br /> <br /> "I Shout Love" is without doubt one of the biggest and most memorable short films I expect to see. It has spirit, heart and extraordinary originality. It matters.
