I saw this film as a child about 30 years ago, and I haven't forgotten it until today. I can't say if it's a good image. But in those days I immediately fell in love with Jean Simmons. Memories focus on the very erotic sensation of the film, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was very young then, and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS. And still it was the young Jean Simmons. Too bad that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video; I'd like to correct my memories ...
