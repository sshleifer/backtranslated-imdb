If there are people who don't like this movie, I don't think they're human. This film distributes all the emotions and shows many aspects of Judith Light's character. Created in 1997, this is one of the best films I've seen and the film in which Judith Light starred to make me her big fan. This film, although sometimes you want to blow your child up for having believed it so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes a lot to do it! The plot doesn't have much, but the acting provided by Judith Light is incredible. It's beautiful all the time and in the end, you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to you. Overall, a movie deserves my highest praise! Thank you for doing it and redefining my point of view on the death penalty. I look forward to this film being released on DVD or some other form of media since Lifetime is starting to publish some films about clients. Although I don't have high hopes for this because it happened almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, since this film is STILL rooted in my head after all this time.
