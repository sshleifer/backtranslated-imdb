I really liked this movie. I loved this movie that I could watch it over and over again. Scarett always gets what he wants, no matter what the cost. It is really hard to forget Rhett but he can't do it. She loves it so much. This is a story of true love. It started with the wind and ended in this film. The only real way to close this film for a true true love. Have Rossella and Rhett together at the end. And here's the way he ended up with them again with their daughter. What more could you ask for? There is no better ending to this great love story. What else can I say about this great film.
