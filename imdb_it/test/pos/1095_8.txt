This film is amazing, while it is not perfect by Hollywood standards and includes a gentle look at the wide division between rich and poor, in black and white which is true in many parts of the world. It handles the public with children's gloves while providing a truthful look at the company's problems. The children are beautiful, take special note of the young man who plays Sipho. The friendships that develop are universally true, anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be taken from real life experiences as there are snips - its conversations and interactions - just as a child would remember the experience. I highly recommend this movie.
