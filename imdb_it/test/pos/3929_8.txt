While HOUSE OF WAX will never be mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, rehearsal and eventually manages to be a worthy addition to the production of quality horror films. There is enough tension and blood quite implicit here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit blood to please some of yesterday's purists. Overall, it's a pretty good movie that should fit on DVD. <br /> <br /> Six guys on the road to a soccer match find themselves stuck in a DELIVERANCE environment and what appears to have actually been pulled off a discarded Deilverance sequel and backwoods hunks seem to taunt the group. Eventually the group has to break and half of them go to the desolate city to take some parts of the car. The other half of the group remains in the field and this creates the second part of the film. <br /> <br /> House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that he is blessed by a very nice cast. Paris Hilton does well in her role but is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds a bit of liveliness, a certain credibility and a little talent. I had never heard of Chad Michael Murray, only he was a pin-up teen heartbreaker. But he has a presence for him. It imbues him with an intangible that seems to translate into his performance. He is immediately sympathetic and has a strong character trait. I really liked his interpretation of what I thought and when he arrived on the screen, the film flowed. <br /> <br /> The question now is: "Is this film a worthy horror film?" And the answer to this is a resounding yes. As I said above, a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, or even THE THE RING is not in the same class, but it is relatively tense, quite graphic and there are some very fanciful death scenes. This is not the WAX ​​HOUSE your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen and when you start to see your fingers cut off and the hot wax covering the comatose bodies, you realize that this film is a bit on the edge. <br /> <br /> I would like to see an uncut the X version of the director. I bet there's one out there somewhere that would be much more violent than this. Anyway, this is a great entry into the horror genre and it's head and shoulders above weak films like I KNOW WHAT I DID THE LAST SUMMER AND DARK WATER and a few others. Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
