It may not be an Oscar material, but this was a very funny film. I've always been a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) and Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were legendary TV series, and it was time for them to make a film. Some of the things they manage to do are brilliant, from the pencil to the back, to the rubber pants, as well as the infamous line that Richie says when he falls and a candle he is carrying enters his eyes. He tells Eddie "Candle In The Eye, Candle In The Eye", and Eddie was the simpleton he is, he sticks the candle he is carrying in his eyes. I can't forget when Eddie is riding his bike, and he needs to urinate ... It was a great play, not to be taken seriously, but the film lacked a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent comedy, full of laughter and lots of fake green vomits. At 9/10. <br /> <br />
