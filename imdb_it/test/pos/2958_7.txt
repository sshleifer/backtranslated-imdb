This second feature Lone Ranger is not up to the 1956 classic, but it is a thin film with enough rough and sagging action and moves along a good clip. The Ranger examines a series of mysterious murders that have a sinister pattern for them with peaceful Indians who are the victims of a band of hooded assassins. There are more killings and violence usually associated with the adventures of Lone Ranger and the film has a background of race insensitivity, whose comments are scattered throughout the script. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can put together the clues and expose the band of outlaws and bring them to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels perform in a colorful presentation showing the desert and the cactus of the old Tucson with a good advantage. The soundtrack is good, but the well-known theme of William Tell Overture is set aside by the voice which is interesting but lacks the beauty and beauty of the traditional Ranger theme.
