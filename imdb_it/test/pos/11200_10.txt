This is the last film in a trilogy by the brilliant Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose latest film Mayis Sikintisi - which was very Cehovian - was shown at prestigious film festivals. Unlike his previous films, the story of "Uzak" is set in Istanbul, one of the most crowded cities in the world. However, in Ceylan's film, we only see minor traces of that big crowd. Instead, he chose to focus on two characters, a photographer and one of his relatives who came from his small village to find work on transatlantic ships. The photographer, who - we understand it - also immigrated to the city, seems to be inhabited by the customs of city life, not only in a material sense. In his relationship with his relative, we initially see him as considerate and tolerant, however, when he cannot find a job, our suburban character begins to be disturbed for sharing his private "space" with someone whose date of departure becomes ambiguous. I will not reveal the tactics he develops to wrest his relative from his life to avoid damage to the pleasure of vision, but suffice to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we acquire in the routine of suburban life; "tactics" to maintain our private space, "tactics" for not communicating with other people, "tactics" to prevent our relationships from acquiring a complex nature (since our experience, we believe, is quite complex). <br /> <br /> Ceylan's film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the confines of the modern (or postmodern?) city depicting the two characters in different ways. But he does not condemn either of the two characters for having done so, rather he uses the power of cinematographic language to emphasize this difference. For example, looking for new opportunities, we always see the character from the village in open spaces. Even inside the house, he prefers the balcony as his favorite space. On the other hand, we always see the photographer inside closed spaces and generally at home. Although there are more than 10 million people out there, and many adventures, many interesting things to discover (or are there?) He prefers to sit at home, watch TV, etc. His house is like his temple, a kind of sacred place. <br /> <br /> Everyone lives in a big city and, aware of the experience he is experiencing, will find something that belongs to himself in Uzak. If you like this movie, I'm sure you'll like the other two Ceylan films, Mayis Sikintisi (The Clouds of May) and Kasaba (The Town). Go and find them!
