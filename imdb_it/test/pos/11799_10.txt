I'm glad to have HBO now. I wasn't going to watch a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next HBO movie was this, I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a chance. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just caught me in a vulnerable moment (I'm a bit stressed, I did a huge test for the studio), but it definitely gave me enough perspective on friendship, not to mention a valuable lesson in empathy. I am currently one year away from the pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and nurse was definitely a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> In any case, I just wanted to post to let the world know this is a fantastic movie and not to be missed. There's definitely something for everyone in this movie!
