Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a well-off physician with psychological problems related to the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a liberal woman who thinks she believes men should be "repaired" instead of females . Sayer retires into his lavish domain, managing Maria through a humiliating series of mind games, threatening to harass and kill her. Sayer's desire, it seems, is to dominate his body, his mind and his soul, making her become his sexual slave, obeying his commands, adhering to his every desire and whim. After the resistance, at first, Maria slowly advances towards her goal, but has plans of her own ... she says that she wants to help Sayer to give up her sadistic behavior towards women, so that she can love and not want so eager to do harm. It seems that Sayer has her under his grip, accepting some rather embarrassing scenarios (such as licking his toes, "making love" with an inflatable doll that is a recreation of himself, which often spends time topless and even get swallowed up when she slaps him on the face that carries blood from the nose) that almost breaks her, but something happens while the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with Maria ... and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to pose ending madness, Maria takes over, toying with Sayer's lust for her body. <br /> <br /> More than a battle of wills, a kind of sexual war in which it seems that one is in charge when in reality the other really has the upper hand. Through a good part of the film, Sayer mistreats Maria, forcing her (it seems) to undergo her series of psychological games of a sexual nature. His attempts to escape fail because his house is a well-designed fortress. It is a typical European art deco style building, modeled and orchestrated by a man who stayed at this weekend retreat for a while (.. walls and doors open to his command, with an area quarantined for its "victims"). But, once Maria apparently lowers a bottle of pills because of her anguish over her hands, the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him. He discovers that he really yearns for her and Maria uses this to his advantage, playing hard for when Sayer wants to hug her and devastate her (... and, I could understand his frustration because he has this charm that can make a man mad) the film ultimately functions as a war cry for women, their emancipation and revolt against men who have the idea that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. The "twist" finalizes this ideal. I could not swallow the fate of Sayer because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen. Let's see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regime is part of the normal routine every weekend before the real mind games with his victim begin. If he is so fit, and he spends so much time developing himself for the extracurricular activities that follow his regime, how could he suffer the fate that follows his finalizing the agreement with Maria in the end when he stops resisting his advances? <br /> <br /> Maria, he would admit later, is the first one who is actually abducted; the others of the past, the call girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power to dominate a woman, even if it was a fictitious farce caused by an individual deeply disturbed by the inability to connect with sex opposite to. The spontaneous decision to do it, to make a leap from the norm, costs him more than he can ever know. <br /> <br /> All this psycho-sexual subtext is rather fascinating to see unveiled, but Dagmar Lassander, such a delightful kitten, was my reason for enjoying it like this ... without her, I couldn't have appreciated it so much because she is as vital as a victim that is worth trying to get. Perhaps the highlight of the film, the delicious dance by Lassander, dressed in gauze (!), Undo the wardrobe exposing her breasts to jazz music. It's the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and your sweaty forehead. Dagmar Lassander must have been a joy for fashion designers because he wears those clothes so well ... he has such a style, sophistication and on-screen presence along with his beauty and seductive powers, Dagmar transcends the part to create a iconic character that would define his career .. even if the film is not well known (.. I found through word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and the audacious argument may not appeal to certain crowds as it regards sex (... and pain) in many different forms, dialogue rather illustrative and elaborative. At times, I could not help but chuckle at Sayer's comments against an imprisoned Maria, about how he likes to hurt women, and the thrill he manages to force them to become a kind of slavery (.. in an attempt to make the words poetic, everything seems rather mushy). But Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, for me, works best as a fetish film, a possible male fantasy with this apparently first-born idealist, captured and held against his will, forced into a precarious situation, his destiny possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. His submission and how he reacts to his aggressive behavior with her (.. there are moments when she turns to a hesitant desire to hug him, revealing a possible attraction to him that, in itself, could scare someone who looks at her) they are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitative function. My other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concert with Sayer caressing Maria while playing a relaxing melody.
