The film was great and all but, there were a lot of mistakes in the "football" scenes, I wonder if any of the guys who worked on the film have ever seen a soccer game before ..? first of all, I don't understand how he wanted to try for the boys team? in boys and girls of football I can't play on the same team and these are the rules of FIFA. And do not let me understand who, when they found out that she was actually a girl, let him continue playing ... !! secondly, players cannot paint their faces with colors and play like that, still not FIFA rules. <br /> <br /> and not getting me started on how they scored goals was ridiculous completely unrealistic. and all the players seemed not to know Jack of football. <br /> <br /> and when the duke was training Viola, because they just shot at what happened at the pass and at the dribbling. or was he shooting his only problem ?! and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room for Chelse players ?! Don't you like other players than any other team? it was like this was the only team they knew ...! but apart from that the film was good and I liked the rest, only the training and the game scenes were not realistic for me. they should have consulted with someone for them ...!
