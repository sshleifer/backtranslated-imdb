When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass would make a film about their band, I was going crazy! I love their music and I was hoping that this movie would be really fun! Now that I've seen it, I can't really say that these hopes weren't met, but I think I expected more. The film is full of the great music of Tenacious D and I really enjoyed listening to it. There are lots of jokes and I love history, at least for the first time. I don't like how the film ends. The finish is very abrupt and I think they could have extended it a little more. <br /> <br /> In general I think it's a good movie to watch! Anyone who loves rock music should watch it! It will give you a good laugh!
