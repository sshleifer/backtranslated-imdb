It's nice to see a movie with children whose idea of ​​"acting like an adult" is not engaging in sensuality. Instead, these children see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. Hoot is a film aimed at families looking for a fun day at the cinema. Production values ​​are good, especially the radical blows of Montana and Florida. The soundtrack of Jimmy Buffet is perfect. The young actors are lively and refreshing. <br /> <br /> The plot, on a trio of guys working together to save some owls from death at the hands of an empire builder without pancakes, will involve children. So many movies make children look helpless, it's nice to see a movie that shows kids working hard to make a difference. And even if the parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it was pleasant to see children who want to follow in their parents' footsteps and try to correct injustices. <br /> <br /> If you are tired of all the self-indulgent story lines on children who fill the cinema, give Hoot a shot. So take some time to talk to your children about the adventure of serving others and taking care of the world in which they live. A positive message from a positive film.
