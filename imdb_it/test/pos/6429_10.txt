When, oh, when someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground will release it on widescreen DVDs ??? Le Orme, which I only know from my habit of collecting rare / vintage videos, is a film from my collection that I not only would like to see, but I really like watching it. The fact that Klaus Kinski is the best, but only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Although several comments expressed disappointment in his limited screen time.) I can't say this is a good horror movie, a good mystery, a science fiction epic or something like that. It is simply unclassifiable in the sense of the "kind" of things. It's more like a confused, frightening (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream, full of great visions and mysteries. It is based on images and emotions, just like "Lisa and the Devil" by Bava. Both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but almost impossible to describe logically; both are presented in such a dreamlike atmosphere. Don't be discouraged by the Force Video synopsis on the back cover. It is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Although the release of Force Video from 1986 (the only one in the United States, to my knowledge) is cropped to full screen on tape, even in that format it is still excellent. Releasing remastered and / or letterbox would make it magnificent (suggestion, suggestion ... DVD company).
