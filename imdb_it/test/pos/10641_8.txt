This is one of the best films I've seen since the silent era (sad to say, I have yet to see too many except Chaplin / Keaton). Very visually brilliant, with an insanely influential style in editing and composition. Really unique camera angles (especially for his time) and extremely chaotic editing. A must see for the cinema nerd. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it is a little too much in the face of his politics (I have no problem with politics in the cinema, as long as they are thin or at least a little ignorant as a second story ). Also, it's not an "entertainment" movie, which is fine, but it's not something I will watch a billion times. This is art, simple and simple, like it or not. <br /> <br /> It is worth having an A + just for influence, but based on personal enjoyment, I give it an A-.
