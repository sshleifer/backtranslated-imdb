Uzumaki has a formidable reputation in Lovecraft circles and now I know why. <br /> <br /> Uzumaki is based on a Manga title (which, incredibly, is supposedly better than the film) and follows the bizarre events that precede a typhoon in an isolated Japanese city. I'm not going to tell you everything that happens in this film because it's a must-see movie. I saw him for the first time last night and I was speechless. He has shot in my best films of all time and has touched Pans Labyrinth as the best fantasy film (literally and photographically) released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This film is very Lovecraftian in nature without formally having any direct connection to the Mythos Cthulhu. It was created in the same way that Lovecraft composed his stories; it exudes power as an aura of "something is not right here" is intensified through a meditative phase of terror and, ultimately, of horror through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and in cinematography. This is, in effect, a "strange Tale" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Simply amazing.
