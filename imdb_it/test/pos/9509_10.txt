I have seen the films come and go in my years, and when I see a catastrophic film, I still hope that I will not be disappointed. And with this I was not the least bit. The story of an entire country that sank into the ocean was a great concept written by sakyo Komatsu, a novelist with intense theories about where this land is going. The characters were top notch, and although I'm not Japanese, I didn't need a translator to give the idea of ​​how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common good. The special effects shocked me, I was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tidal waves that flowed lava and explosions of earth that must have taken months of work to perfect. As for the acting I thought yes, it is acting at its best, the emotions spread throughout the film and I cried in the most difficult scenes. For those who love movies, it is not necessary to speak or understand Japanese to watch this film, you can have the idea and feel from every person and character to understand it well and follow it is as if you were there. My hats go to Shinji Higuchi to direct it, I hope he can get over his work with another incredible experience. Like I said, .... Fantastic movie.
