"I'm afraid you talk on the rack, where men enforce anything." This Shakespearean line of The Merchant of Venice echoes in the new film Rendition which introduces the viewer to the "advanced methods of interrogation", the interpretations, begun in the Clinton administration and become more common since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. <br / > <br /> The film features a cast of famous actors, with Academy Awards Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. They also offer secondary roles played by unknown actors, who suck the audience into the plot and show how many people can be affected by terrorist attacks abroad and our means to investigate them. <br /> <br /> The Rendition follows an Egyptian born suspected terrorist (Metwally) who is caught by US officials after his flight from South Africa to Washington DC to a prison hidden overseas. The pregnant wife (Witherspoon) ventures to Washington DC to discover her disappearance through a family friend and a senator employee (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst at the overseas detention facility that controls the violent interrogation. <br /> <br /> This film follows the emotional suffering of the torture victim (Metwally) and those involved in getting the alleged information from him. Some, like the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and horrified by the methods exercised, while others, the severe senator (Streep) and the foreign interrogator (Yigal Naor), see it as necessary and effective. <br /> <br /> The film could be described by some as a political piece, but ultimately it is emotional. Metwally's performance as a tortured prisoner is worthy of an Oscar. The film has no intention of preaching, but rather of questioning and informing the public on a topic that often has no human face. It is known that executions work, but it is also known that they produce false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply describes the emotional struggles of those involved in such serious business, and does so in a way that will affect each viewer differently. The film will keep your interest and you will see yourself engaged in each of the character's difficulties.
