First I remember running into this madness by the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, in the early days of Comedy Central. Back in those days (1990s) their programming consisted of replicas of Benny Hill and the original MST3k, complete with a bearded host. <br /> <br /> Capt. Frank Drebin (played by Leslie Nielson, obstructionism with a face of stone and dark skin) is a process created first by the fusion of various stereotypical protagonists of the police television series (I think Dragnet encounters Starsky and Hutch the Show), boiled in flask full of well-known police TV shows and scenarios. This is distilled, 3 times to produce the purest policeman every fact. Forget Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now, save it for later). Frank Drebin is clueless at most times, a terrible driver, a terrible, macho but sensitive and vulnerable blow. He is a master of police investigative methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). This doesn't make him a bad cop. The policemen are also lucky. Captain Drebin (note that he is a captain here) perfected it. Together with his partner, Nordberg, and the rest of the force, they perfectly parody the police drama during 6 episodes of gold. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialogues and citations of quotations. Most gags are a bit dated and stupid. Magic never comes from the gags of sight, however. In the center there was a meaningless and direct conversation and activity in the foreground, with crazy things happening in the background. Movies can best be described as 90-minute collections of the best gags in this series. Think of Monty Python's and Now For Something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3 or Top Secret, then you will surely like it. <br /> <br /> I've always liked the series better than movies, even though I've seen movies before. Why? 2 words: No O.J.
