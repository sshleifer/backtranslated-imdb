I was a little surprised to see all the hate comments here. Certainly not the best show for children, but people don't stop despising Barney so much after the fifth grade? <br /> <br /> Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and his songs are boring. Ok, it's kind of scary and weird. I'm fourteen, so I know it pretty well. But here's the thing. The children? They love this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a boy of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anymore. Nothing could get my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, this is how children are. Even the most patients can't sit long enough to give their parents a break. There is too much to do and see and explore, too many problems to enter. <br /> <br /> And then Barney arrived. I don't know exactly what the purple dinosaur is that is so fun for kids, but they certainly love it. I know I did it. I was attracted to the show and wanted to watch it over and over again. Yes, the songs drove my parents crazy, but to be able to observe their children as they learned and be excited about something that can really hold their attention, it's worth it. I learned my ABC and 123, the magic words and brush your teeth. I had grown by five or six, sure, but at that point at least I was a little more patient, and I gave my parents a break. <br /> <br /> My grandchildren and grandchildren have all gone by, Barney's stage is growing, much to his mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. It entertains. Of course there are Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they too are fantastic. But at the first stage, it seems that more children prefer the great singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me.
