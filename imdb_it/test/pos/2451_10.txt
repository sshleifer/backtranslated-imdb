I have to agree with the previous author's comments on the excellent performances and plot. I started watching this movie by accident ... (lazy Sunday afternoon by clicking on the channels to see if there was anything beautiful) ... and was hypnotized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Harrowing Gut! Congratulations to all (I have always admired Martin Sheen) but I was particularly impressed by Emilio! Great acting and directing work ... just great! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I will have to spread the news.
