Sean Connery is very good as Great Raisuli, Lord of the Rif and Defender of the Faithful. This is an adventure film with Arabs, Germans and the USMC that all come at some point or another. There is also a lot of humor in the interaction between the main and supporting characters. The story is based on the real incident in which a wealthy Greek-American businessman was kidnapped by the Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius replaced Candace Bergen and his two sons as victims of the kidnapping, and this opens the story to a lot of literary licenses. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film gives Milius the opportunity to remember spectators of two of the most famous (though mostly forgotten) political quotations of the TR era. Brian Keith (very good as TR) says "Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!"; and John Huston (also good as Sec of State John Hay) asks the Japanese ambassador for a dinner at the White House, "You likee knifee, you likee forkee?"
