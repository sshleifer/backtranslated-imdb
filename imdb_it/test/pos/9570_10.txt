This is the best of the films (so far) that Christopher Guest has created using his very talented cast. Previously, they had made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and following BEST IN SHOW, they made the VERY WIND very pleasant. As for their last, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less it is said the better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary on dog shows and in particular on competitors. Follow these few dogs chosen by the pre-show preparations until the big night when one of them is best chosen in the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". However, none of these people is a true fan of dog shows, but talented and improvised actors who parody many of the most common types of people who meet in the world of dog shows. Surprisingly, even if the characters are quite extravagant, there is a lot of truth to the personalities that are parodying - like decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a VERY ruthless group of people! My dog ​​owners' favorites were the incredibly tense, high-pressure yuppie couple who gave off only anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple, because they were terribly funny and smart. However, the best performance probably did not come from any of the couples, but from Fred Willard who played the world's most stupid and least talented announcer in human history. His comments were uniformly stupid and often betrayed her as an incredibly stupid person - as he was the presenter of such a prestigious show, nobody knows. The other competitors were also very funny: the professional barber breeder and the wealthy owner, the country boy and his dog as well as Winkie's "parents" who could barely scrape together enough to get to the show. /> <br /> Despite the film's impromptu style, the pieces all fit together beautifully and tell a very funny and compelling story - one that is NOT just for dog owners. Exceptional acting has made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. Smart and always fun. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find it on DVD because the extras were really worth seeing. Although a little painful to watch, I enjoyed seeing Harlan Pepper and her beach ball collection in particular!
