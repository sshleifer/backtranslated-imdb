Korean cinema has the ability to transform genres in the head, and the last of the famous director Chan-wook Park is the story of a good devoted priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress who takes him off the road and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> Partially styled similar to the "Sympathy" trilogy, it is sumptuous and obscure. Avoiding clich√©s, it offers some new tricks in the exaggerated vampire genre. It is an existential film that tries to capture the moral enigma of how exactly a person must choose to live with their own conditions rather than having fun in the desire for blood. However, the film does not take itself too seriously and there is boundless humor everywhere. <br /> <br /> Our protagonists play their role perfectly, playing with our emotions and enjoying the dark humor. There are moments of reflection on all the moral enigmas involved in the film, but it is never preached. Some might find it too long and can lull points, but it's worth giving it a chance until the end. <br /> <br /> If you like movies on the field on the left, then there are less better than the latter. Dark and compelling, it will attract a crowd. One would recommend making an attempt.
