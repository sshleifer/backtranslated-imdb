I saw this movie during the Mod & Rockers festival in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry has had an incredible life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who don't know Harry Nilsson do a little research and you will see that Harry has probably found his way into your life one way or another - maybe it was his special "The Point" or "Everybody's" Speaking by Midnight Cowboy: for me it started with "the people let me tell you my best friend" - the theme of "The Courtship of Eddie's Father" Watching this movie you can really feel the love and admiration of the real Harry's friends and peers - don't shed a tear for Harry - he had a ball ... <br /> <br /> Brett
