Visconti's masterpiece! I admit I don't know much about his work, but I can't imagine his other work going beyond this fabulous movie. Last night I saw death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and I was totally fascinated by everything I saw. This seduction was a pastiche composed of many elements: the extraordinary shots directed by Visconte, first of all his love for the long, languid blows of people who dined, swam, walked and contained a significant personage who crossed this mass of people; the brilliant interpretation of the filmmakers of the selection of Visconti's blows; acting by principles without excessive dialogue and the complexity of the scenes through the features of the face alone. <br /> <br /> It is true: the young people who watch this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a single film, a film that could not be made in 2006. A film whose time rests in those short years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century, when the artistic license was passed on to directors and money, men took secondary roles. As many of the recent IMDb commentators have written, this film, in their opinion, is long, boring (too little action) and pretentious. I suppose by Hollywood pap, these comments contain the merit. Unfortunately tragically they minimize the beauty and depth of this work and others like those of those years. <br /> <br /> Please, if you have not seen the death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a movie and a story from another time. You will be rewarded.
