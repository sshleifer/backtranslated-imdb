Tim Burton, the man behind the original film Batman and Beetlejuice, brings the world to the sequel to Batman, which surpasses the original in more ways than one. First of all Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batman's enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to make some heads vibrate in the story and the penguin works the same way the joker worked in the original. The sets are incredible and immaculate. The city of Gotham has so many dark alleys that one could never know what is happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives him a bad name is the script, which sometimes seems to expire and therefore not recover for a while. Tim Burtons directing brings superhero films to a new realm. It beats all the superman movies and the other one-mile Batman movies. Although in terms of accomplishment the new Batman begins has a bite that misses this, but Burton is a more original director of Nolan.
