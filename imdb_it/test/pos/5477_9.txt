This is one of the few films of this type that I reviewed and appreciated. While Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the overall story works well, even within the limits of Washington DC. <br /> <br /> The theme: a murderer is tracing the president, and there is only one person who can save him. <br /> <br /> It cannot be easy to make a film that the public appreciates these days, involving this arena. This film is successful on several levels. Eastwood is his usual subdued hero, who wants to save the president since the Kennedy era. He does well in this role, as does his foil, Reneee Russo (an FBI agent) Overall well done and suspenseful with the extra stars for Malkovich. 9/10.
