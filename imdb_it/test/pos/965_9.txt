NOTICE SPOILER !!!! This was my son's review of the film, which he wanted me to publish. He wrote it, I swear. <br /> <br /> With Frankie Muniz of Malcolm in the Middle and Amanda Bynes of Nickelodeon, they go on to perform business. They join the actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar and put it in a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) must go to L.A. to get it back. Jason's dad doesn't believe he wrote that essay. So every time you see Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to make a phone call to Jason's father because he wants his essay BACK !!!! Wolf doesn't do the movie but the company president does it. Eventually the family and Kaylee see the film, made by Wolf Pictures and based on a true story written by Jason Shepherd.
