For the main criticisms of the film ... The love story: it wasn't a love story. They were two upset people coming together trying to find humanity in SOMEONE. The same thing happened with the soldiers and the Russian boy. He added a feminine touch, but take a look at American movies ... not close to the love story. There was no plot: does war have a plot? I think it's a silly criticism. This is the plot. They start with 400 men and the film narrows to show the life of about 10 men and how each of them has done his part and died. Death is the ultimate end of every story. Just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean he has no plot. <br /> <br /> There was a horrid truth in this film. I would not necessarily call it "anti-war". He had a political statement of course, but the film was not just about politics. Indeed, except for some events where the captain? he introduced himself, there was never a suffocating air from Nazi Germany. They were far enough out of reach of the main Nazi party. The big cats would not have gone to Russia! <br /> <br /> Perhaps not entirely accurate and not a Hollywood success, but exhibit a good knowledge of the common soldier (I would say of almost every nationality and war) and what they have to go through. It was a losing battle, obviously the film will be depressing. And to the person who said that it was brave (and foolish) to even portray the Germans as victims: there are victims from all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you). <br /> <br /> This film is a good balance between film and documentary. Some problems with it when discussing for only one, but infusing the best of both worlds. See it as such. But be careful because it is a difficult film to watch if not graphically, emotionally. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for them to make a film about Iraq. He will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, I want to see who has the courage to do it first. (Jarhead does not count)
