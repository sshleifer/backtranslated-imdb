I bought my first album Zep in 1974 (at 17) and I've been hooked ever since. This DVD is now in first place in my music collection. It doesn't often happen that a band can boast 4 virtuosos in their formation, but here we can. Each member contributed to the band, but on stage together, the electricity they generated was larger than the 4 individuals. This masterpiece covers the entire career of the band from Led Zep 1 to Coda and this is captured beautifully on this DVD while every concert shows how the band has grown bigger over the years. Recently my copy has disappeared, but I'm happy to say that it was found in my 17-year-old son's room while the new generation discovered how big these guys were. This is a must for anyone with an appreciation of rock music. Long live Led Zeppelin.
