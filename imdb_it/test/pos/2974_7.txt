My wife and I saw this when we were 17 years old. The only good thing my father ever did (take us inside). This is "our film" and music is "our songs". Michelle's song is "our" song. Yes, nowadays, it is a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were fucking at 16, why not these guys? The film is a rich boy who impregnates the poor girl, then the rich father steals it at the end, after giving birth in impoverished conditions. She was left alone with a child. It is a love story and a story of "growth". The music is fantastic, and the story is one that anyone could identify with. Maybe one day this will be released on DVD.
