The Chasers War On Everything. 5 words I love to watch. The war of the hunters of all is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they make war on everything. They seem to love hitting the policies above all. <br /> <br /> The Chaser is one of the best comedies I've seen and is the top of the line in Australia. It's on the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC), where some of the best comedies are. <br /> <br /> He won the Australian Film Industry (AFI), but did not win the best comedy in logies. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006) the tracker aired on ABC on Friday night when everyone was out, so nobody could watch it. Well, they were moved on Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm (a better time) and the best thing is that if I miss an episode or if I just want to see it again, I can download it from www.ABC.net.au/chaser.
