Somehow, CHANGI lost the AFI awards for MY BROTHER JACK. The latter, a high-quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel, was exceptional - but, in my opinion, not as good as CHANGI. I have heard that many critics dismissed CHANGI as irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is exceptional. More than that. Brilliant. It shouldn't be a documentary - I can certainly forgive the current Changi survivors (or even survivors of a prisoner of war camp) for being disappointed by the production - but for the rest of us, CHANGI represents the remarkable power of the mateship in times of extreme adversity . It contains a part of Australian culture that seems to diminish while times become easier and less demanding, but we should never forget: Australians were respected around the world after Gallipoli and the Second World War for their camaraderie and their sense of 'humor. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; THE LAST BULLET; THE SUGAR FACTORY.
