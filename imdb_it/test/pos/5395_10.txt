This movie was awesome! I love the way he mixes dark humor with drama. There are times when you think there is no way to laugh at the situation presented, yet you have a surprising laugh. It is beautifully performed, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with an elegant and surprising finish. I don't want to say that everyone will like what I've done, but give it a chance and rent it. The DVD has great special features, including the director's full-length comments, Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch and one from Sigourney Weaver, which give you interesting information about the film. I hope my comment is useful and you like the movie!
