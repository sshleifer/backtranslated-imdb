Every episode I saw when I was an innocent child was stupid. There were some funny-looking puppets called "The Mitts" that would always discuss childhood things. They would play this song before the "The Mitts" part of the show that went like "Join the Mitts ..." There was a Groucho Marx puppet telling jokes. Before the session, this man would sing "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green puppet with teeth called Seymore. We would see more and more Seymore. He would make jokes and sing every episode. There was always a moral in each episode. An episode, a man sang "Liars are losers!" Another episode sang about sharing and caring. Seymore told me about those two little girls "Sharon and Karen". The part of Hot Fudge Holey Moley has this man who does strange things and plays strange music.
