The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a rather carefree boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that, again and again, he forgets the dates or gets late. The last straw is when Sothern has a birthday and Kelly says he's too busy to get her to party. So, not wanting to stay home, he goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after Sothern interrupts his relationship with Kelly that new boyfriend Hamilton is a "in love and leave them" type. As this is finally resolved it is not too difficult to predict - suffice it to say that in the end everything works perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a small, very modest film from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget and second-tier stars. It is clearly a "B-movie" although there are small roles played by Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell - as both have yet to become famous. This is NOT to say that these are bad actors or the production is not good. Indeed, given the production values, this is a rather surprising film in that everything seems to work so well despite having a rather ordinary and somewhat predictable plot. This is because the actors and the director did a great job comparing the story. Moreover the writers have done a good job of humanizing the characters and making you interest them. The finish, in particular, is really sweet and practically made my tear ducts flow! Because of these factors, the film earns 7 out of 10.
