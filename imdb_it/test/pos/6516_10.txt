I watched this movie a long time ago, but I've always loved it. The story is about a girl, Sally O'Moyne, who discovers at a young age that when she prays to Saint Anne, her prayers are answered, hence her missing lunch bucket and a petty neighbor who scares her and prays, that someone should give him a black eye for chatter. Well, a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye. Sally therefore believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power forever. She is known and loved throughout the neighborhood because she has notebooks / magazines full of requests from friends in Sant'Anna. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a local guy comes home from college (I think) and Sally is stunned by how adult he is. Sally has a big crush on him, but he's so shy. Should he use his power of prayer for Saint Anne for his own selfish desire or simply watch the most famous girls at school trying to trap the man of his dreams? This is a film full of fun with a grandfather who is so charming and Irish, a brother who is hilariously irritating and a sworn Irish neighbor who swings with pop pop every day. He has his story of wanting to buy the O'Moynes property which is a small house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes (his own), in other words, O'Moynes' house is an eye-catcher for his delicious buildings. <br /> <br /> This film definitely deserves a watch and is quite good and rare enough to be added to your movie collection. I hope you like it!
