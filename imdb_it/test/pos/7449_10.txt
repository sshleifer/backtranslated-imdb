What is there to say about this film? This film is simply amazing. A real feast for the eyes. In the same way that the game set the standard for 3D role-playing games 7 years ago, this film sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen the trailers and the incredible details in every frame and let me say that this film does not disappoint. You can actually see the fibers in Cloud's sweater vest. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The film contains several rearranged video game tracks that fans will surely appreciate and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is its history. His is not exactly a bad story, but this story is aimed exclusively at people who played video games. First time viewers may feel lost at times, or may not notice the significance of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you've never played because what we have here is a special film. Watch it and enjoy the beautiful show.
