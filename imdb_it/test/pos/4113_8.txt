While the numbers of songs and dance in general are not as strong as many would like them to be, the plot and message of the film are still there and resonate loudly over the simple 70s-style musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Bearing in mind that this film was made after the Hollywood Musical was almost extinct (with few exceptions being musical rock), the public that went to see it again did not appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt at something that had not been done to date. The audience that will see it today will tend to judge against today's movies and musicals and, perhaps, the huge casts of star-studded musicals. But doing it for this film, or for that matter, is an injustice to the film itself. <br /> <br /> There are some nice musical moments in the film. The first is that of Bobby Van. Mr. Van played the role of Harry Lovett only after closing a Tony, 2-year candidate (for best actor) at the Broadway revival, "No, No, Nanette". He is a man who sings and dances from afar and, honestly, the only one in the cast who was really talented and experienced in musicals. He never misses a step in his "Question Me An Answer" and rightly ... he was totally at ease like Harry. Other pleasant numbers are made by Olivia Hussey when she welcomes new visitors and while the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows her strong voice in the song "Family", as well as a well-made staging of the whole piece. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie for what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you will never grow old, hidden in the ice and in the snow-covered mountains of Tibet, found by a group of unsuspecting contemporaries wrapped in conflict of any modern culture. Take this and compare it to reality and get a movie that doesn't reach a goal. But ... take this film for the message of love and peace, tranquility and brotherly love and get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one. <br /> <br /> To some this film may seem trivial others a release welcome by the frenetic pace of reality. For the first, try not to judge and simply enjoy the message. For the second, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
