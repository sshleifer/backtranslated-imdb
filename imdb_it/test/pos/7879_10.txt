Peter Boyle has always been a great actor and he showed it with his interpretation of Bigot from a firearm, making me hate him every time he used the word "N", I looked at him with his big mouth and I wanted to break the lights . (Think, Peter Boyle was Monk once) (now supporting actor in "Everybody Loves Raymond") Susan Sarandon making her first debut needs a bath right away and enjoys sharing it with someone else in her own dirty water. I noticed that a great Raggerty Ann Doll (the creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing that Susan could really trust and love and the doll appeared in some scenes. If you really want to know how to get out of the 70s with drugs, free love and sweet dreams, then enjoy the excellent direction of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" The Karate Kid ") I always thought that Peter Boyle should have be wiped out in the end !! This is definitely a cult classic that is worth seeing and sharing with others.
