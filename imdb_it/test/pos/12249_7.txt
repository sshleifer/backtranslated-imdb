I haven't seen a lot of movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing it on Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a hard-nosed journalist, Jane Craig, who has spent all her time on the news. His colleague Aaron Altman carried his torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the former somewhat aloof sports journalist who is the new reporter. For Jane, it symbolizes everything she doesn't like about the news - turning it into edutainment, not serious business. To her surprise, Jane finds herself drawn to Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter is doing a great performance as the lively journalist. But I don't really see what he finds so fascinating in his new colleague, Tom. It is something with them that prevents us from being close and personal with him. Equally impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100% for his work, but does not get enough in return. Actually, for a while I thought it was Steve Guttenberg of the Police Academy (1984). She has some funny lines and if this was an image of Meg Ryan, they would call it a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Running for more than two hours, some scenes may have been modified or omitted completely, for example. Jane and Aaron's journey to Central America. Moreover, I am a crap with a happy ending and I preferred a different ending than a meeting between them three seven years later.
