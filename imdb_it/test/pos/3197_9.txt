Awww, I love it! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does not really need a synopsis, since it is what it is ... the cat chasing the moon, in a Spanish poem. It is art that is interesting. In fact, there was this short animated film called Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005) ... yes, almost the same thing, which leads me to believe that it might just be one rip. <Br /> <br /> But this is a very good short film, with black and white shapes that change and turn into a beautiful movement and poetic seduction ... If you believe cats are moving poetry, see this and you'll believe it more. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it has such a touching end. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
