I saw the Messiah: - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programs I've ever seen. It was one of those programs that you think oh, no, I can't watch the rest of this, but you feel obligated to see it just to see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely incredible actor, able to pass by two totally different characters, one of whom is the bad and bad person who did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop. To be able to do that, well, I certainly wouldn't be able to do it, well, not without cracking anyway. I really love and take care of Jamie Draven with all my heart and I will always do it, until the end of time, I think Jamie is the sweetest, cute and sexy guy in the world. I love Jamie in Ultimate Force, also because he looks damn sexy in the blacks he wore. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> <br /> -X-
