Recently I started attending the Hitchcock series. I always rent one of his films when I'm at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. As I said before, Hollywood is losing its touch in an incredible way, I needed to remember that there are exceptional films out there. Not to mention, I want to be a movie fan, not a movie buff. Is there a better way to do this than with Alfred Hitchcock movies? <br /> <br /> The man who knew it too much is another fantastic and exciting thriller starring James Stuart, Alfred's favorite character, and the woman who steals the Dorris Day show. They play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells James some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. James just seems to doubt Dorris and his capacity for ideas on how to bring back their son, but he makes a great comeback and ends up being the hero of the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting again, I would say that Dorris was the one who surpassed the entire cast. James did a great job busily, together, these two made you sit down and never change the movie. I loved that little comedy in the end that Alfred added. You'll see what I mean. I always strongly recommend this film, although it is not the best Hitchcock film, it is still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
