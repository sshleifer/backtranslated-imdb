Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular western / cowboy movies. But that's because he didn't have the FINANCING of those movies. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story like this, focusing on the historical involvement of African Americans (and NO, servants and "mammals" are not historical involvement), Hollywood will not be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. Producers and actors sacrificed a lot of "pocket" expenses to make "Posse", so the story could be told. I think it's just commendable. Posse may not be an Oscar material (and they don't like black media too much), but it's a start. It's fun and introduces us to the black cowboy, a character that many of us don't know.
