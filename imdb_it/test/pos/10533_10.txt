I had so much hope for Teletoon Retro to air this, but instead of having shows like this, those who don't get the treatment they deserve, broadcast things I might have seen dozens of times before. <br /> <br /> The Centurions was the highlight of my pre-teen years. I know it might seem a little clich√© but it's true. After the duke of G.I. Joe, Jake Rockewell is another of the cartoon characters I really had a crush on. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Teletoon Retro does not see it the same way as people of my generation. Otherwise Teletoon Retro would be much better than it is.
