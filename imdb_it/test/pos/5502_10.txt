For some inexplicable reason, Jerry's films often seemed to come for diatribes from some circles, though they were rarely box office disappointments. It is one of the great mysteries of life for me because his films have always had a factor of 'feeling good' for them. But this film is not only not bad: it is an extraordinarily good and intelligent comedy. To those who might be tickled by cruel or cruel "modern" humor, don't see this movie: there is nothing like this and you will waste your time. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie once on television. Since then I have been waiting to see it again and several years have passed. You would think that the idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire businessman aiming to win the war against the Nazis with his small private army of enslaved employees would be boring, right? Well, only Jerry Lewis would dare try a story like that for an out and out comedy and it works, I have to say, brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think, as with "The Mad Professor" and most of his other films, this film is the testimony of his comic genius, both in terms of concept and execution. I think Buddy Love could have said, "You know, real comedy can't just make a six-year-old hysterical, he'll do it for his dad too." Maybe some generic Nazis with monocles and lameness wouldn't like this movie, honestly. If you only see one more comedy in your life, look at this. Be careful, you might die laughing. And I'm not kidding!
