An exploring exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself meant. This film deliberately takes you through different layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues as to which layer of virtual reality you are in, putting on yourself an ontological confusion to think about. <br /> <br /> It can also be seen as a satire of video games, but the entire film could fall into the error of the imitative form. He seems unable to escape the kind of video game he imitates; therefore satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> A number of interesting ideas intersect all the time: the biological mutant is one; the interface between technology and biology, the impulse of cyborgs to transcend reality - and philosophical allusions such as Heidegger's title, together with existential questions: that is, the characters of the game are partly programmed or determined and yet partially free to alter their destiny, and they wonder how strange what is felt in the game. A character then observes that this existential confusion is just like real life, again erasing the distinction between virtual and real. Likewise, with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble into a world where you do not know what will happen next and you are not sure how to play because you have to stumble only to discover the unknown goal and rules. A virtual game within the game is titled "TranscendenZ". Also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence. They don't like it, but it's thrilling and part of the "game", which they fear is real. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game, the god of the system, is finally murdered; yet that same scenario takes place in direct parallel with a video game we have just witnessed ... and viewers believe that it is still only part of virtual reality. In the end, the film does not resolve the doubt that this is "true" but the point is clear (at least for me). Existenz means Da-sein: you are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. And its common game motifs express, like a royal road to the unconscious, our fascination with violence. <br /> <br /> However, while Cronenberg states these philosophical allusions in an interview on the film, he claims to be very much against the "Reality ... {underground name of the terrorist group" portrayed in the film both in the game and in the "real" level. " It seems that the same Cronenberg did not think much about the film, even though his impressive lineup arrives. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of a middle-central intellectual who tries to be at the forefront of inclination. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination - the bourgeois clich√©, modernist creed - despite the recognized ambivalence there. (My impression here could be due to a limited interview.) However, Cronenburg seems to lack the point that his film betrays the error of the imitative form (here imitating video games while they make a satirical criticism of them, but a criticism that he is not able to "transcend" the same form) probably because he actually thinks it is "imaginative" and radical. Yet the imaginative world of the film is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own world too real. It remains trapped in the world of computer gaming.
