I am a 20 year old boy from England. I don't cry at movies. But this moved me. I cried like a girl! This is absolutely the most moving film I've ever seen, even if the story was questionable. Joseph Mazello's small face when he dreams of crying makes me jump every time. How could someone hurt such a beautiful child? Now I will cry just thinking about it! Remarkable.
