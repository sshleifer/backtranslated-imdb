Every time Hayao Miyazaki does the "tri-fecta" (he writes, directs and animates a film), he makes a classic film for centuries. He did it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story is about a girl fish that is kept on a very tight leash together with her younger sisters by her father, a bitter ex-human wizard called Fujimoto. The fish escapes from its father and rides a jellyfish to the shore, where it is captured in a dredging operation and finds itself stuck in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborate animated scenes ever undertaken and stands alone as a reason to look for the theatrical version. Miyazaki, who is not afraid of having a busy scene, has outdone himself. There were literally hundreds of individually designed sea creatures of every size imaginable all moving at the same time. <br /> <br /> When the fish comes out of the dredging operation while it is still trapped in the bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sosuke sees it in the water and is able to break the bottle, saving it. Because it is the result of her father's magic, she is also capable of magic herself - and her father actively tries to recover it. The boy names the Ponyo fish. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can talk, her father successfully brings her back into captivity. <br /> <br /> After a war of wills with his father, Ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to transform into a human. He meets again with Sousuke in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. There is a sweetness factor in this film that rivals and probably surpasses that of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided exceptional musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple - as are Miyazaki's films in general - and should attract a wide spectrum of viewers. Although I have not seen enough to be sure, the film does not seem to be one of those that will keep scholars in lengthy discussions like Sen in Chihiro no Kamikakushi. However, this is the best entertainment movie to feel good. I gave the film a ten out of ten rating.
