For a TV movie this was definitely worth seeing. The whole acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read / seen the original and as a rule I can't stand Shakespeare, but I liked this movie (even the setting of the civil war was very well done). Don't expect to see an epic, but you should find it moving enough to enjoy yourself. By the way (on a side note) do not compare this (or any other film for that matter) to the original work. Movies should not transfer a book to the screen, but rather take the general idea and then adapt a story from it. When people say "the book was so much better" (they usually make mistakes anyway), what they're really trying to say is that the book was so different.
