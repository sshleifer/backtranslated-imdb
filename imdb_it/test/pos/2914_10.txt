Based on the book by Mika Waltari, the film This Second CinemaScope is always full of intense colors, wonderful music and panoramic show. The plot sometimes gets confused in contrite terms, but all in all it has a strong social content: man is dominated by his emotions and every action has the same consequences. But to really enjoy this movie, first watch the movie, then read the book. Although different, it sheds light on a lot of things that were not seen on the screen, and gives breath to another of the depth of Sinuhe.
