I saw this drama from cable TV. Even though I've only seen two series, I love this drama. I am waiting for other series to be broadcast via cable. <br /> <br /> Even if it describes a horrible and absurd situation in a prisoner's camp, this shows us an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They don't know if they can survive or not, but they strongly hold their hope without being discouraged by adversity. <br /> <br /> I know this film is not as realistic as other war documentaries, but I don't want to blame it for that. It makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> "Private Bill", in particular, this episode touched me deep in my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I always hate math. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about mathematics ... Mathematics is its connection between past and present, it also symbolizes eternity. <br /> <br /> 'Time, light and memory framed in a circle.' <Br /> <br /> Like other victims of the war, he lost his lover from the irresistible destiny. I am immersed in his time and in my memory as if I experienced the same thing. <br /> <br /> He experienced the great loss but has the pure passion for studying. <br /> <br /> He began his study in the field, his joy of accomplishing, I believe his study dedication has supported him. <br /> <br /> I have seen it several times, but the meaning of this film has never vanished. Every time I saw it, I felt the same deep emotions. <br /> <br /> * Their songs are beautiful, harmonious, <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can't listen to OST.
