Colombian terrorists hold a military school in the United States hostage until their demands are met. Students decide to fight back. Will they be able to do it? <br /> <br /> Silly premise but the film really works. The group of fighting boys were all coming when this film came out in 1991: Sean Astin (looks very nice); Wil Wheaton (looking miserable); Keith Coogan; George Perez (the Latin token which is very beautiful, very muscular and mostly shown in nothing but tight underwear); YOU. Russell (the token black guy) and Shawn Phelan. None of them is a very good actor (except Astin), but who cares? This is a mindless action movie. The only other good performances are from Denholm Elliott (who has a ball as headmaster) and Louis Gossett Jr. as principal. <br /> <br /> In addition to this - there is a lot of action, suspense, explosions and small brains. In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> The only complaint (and this is minor) - is a little too long (there are THREE endings) and there is LOT of random and bloody violence (the R score was well deserved). Anyway, I loved it.
