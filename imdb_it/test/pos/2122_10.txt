Grand Champion is a little old-fashioned at first sight. Andrew Morton at Fort Worth Star Telegram said it's better "If Walt Disney was hailed from Texas, he would have done the Grand Champion" <br /> <br /> The film has no video and special effects but has the heart and soul. The kids are fantastic and the range of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their children can really see :) (G rating) <br /> <br /> This is a small "simple" movie made in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb . Bring your children, bring your child friends, take your grandmother too ... they will like it and you will too.
