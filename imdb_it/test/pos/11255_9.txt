Spoiler begin The film focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The film begins with Sam and Owen as drug addicts, and Chris, the movie star, as the one who takes care of them. As things get worse at home for Chris, he asks Sam what the drug is like. Sam is out of rehab and sober at this point and tells him that he makes everything better. Chris then reaches Owen and starts using. It takes chris twice until he is a "full-time member". After a bit of trouble with a retailer and a confession to Sam, she comes in again. Then the downward spiral begins for them. Chris od's when he breaks a promise to Sam (I want some of the films to be a surprise). He dies, Sam arrives at the university to become an Architect and Owen is arrested. so the story ends <br /> <br /> ends Spoiler. Minor spoilers in all <br /> <br /> Nick stahl is incredible. He will have an Oscar one day. His portrait of Chris was heartbreaking. He was the only one who felt real in the film regarding drug use. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, acted as if he were in speed, not heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, talented but what can I say that Nick Stahl stole the movie. His drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /> <br /> The authors had to show the retreats in the film. This is the main reason why people don't want to stop. Apart from the fact that there are hilarious scenes (the mall scene, and the Backstreet guy scene, the man Stahl nailed the reactions in his head.), Touching, sad scenes (Like the scene between Sam and Chris in his bedroom after being beaten, I screamed, and the park scene.). It was also realistic. As if I were using it again when Chris wanted to rinse the drug in the toilet, and Chris used it again after he had gone to Own's, even though it had been cleaned for two weeks, the shot was too strong. it's all realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch the film for a great cast, great music and a semi-truthful account of drug addiction.
