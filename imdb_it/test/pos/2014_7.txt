"Rockstar" is not coming into any category "stairway to heaven" as one of the best rock movies of all time, but it makes you "jump" from time to time because of its high level energy. The theme of the film is about a rock band fanatic who becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this film is full of a witty script and an intellectual direction, then you will have "another thing coming". However, what "shook me all night" was the beautiful acting of Jennifer Aniston as a devoted rockstar girlfriend. I could not say the same of the rock star in person; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. I liked the retrospective journey of the 80s with the film's outlets. It reminded me of my adolescence where everything "smelled of adolescent spirit". I guess the movie is worth seeing, but for you it's better to look at yourself to make sure you bring "girls, girls, girls" with you. *** Average
