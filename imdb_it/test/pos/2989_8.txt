I can barely remember what DECADE saw this movie. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37). I started watching it like a movie late at night between the middle and the first half of the 80s, and so much of him has been with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had no idea that it was shown at theaters, or that anyone else had ever existed. I don't think I've ever mentioned the movie to anyone else. <br /> <br /> But for half of my life, I still remember a lot of the movie I saw late into the night a long time ago. I think the innocence of the characters, their situation, their mutual affection for a long period of time, has left a long-term imprint for reasons that I don't fully understand. Maybe it's because I was a teenager when I saw it, and it touched me somehow ..... I really don't know! I also REALLY wanted to know what would happen when the film ended. Oh, the agony !! <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it before, or since then, but I'd love to. I keep taking a casual look, but now I doubt it will have been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. But I would probably miss them in the TV guide even if it appears. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows of his availability in Australia, by all means send me emails and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Sean Bury ... it's nice to see you appear in the comments here. I took a look at your timeline and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond movie. What are you doing today? Oh, and do you have a copy of the movie? REGARDS!!!
