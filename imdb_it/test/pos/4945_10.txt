Soul Calibur is more solid than it has ever been ... with the new character creation, and the chronic history of the sword mode in the home version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, even if the list of characters is smaller than the home version, this version is certainly the prettiest of the two, eliminating all the "foolish / unrealistic" fighting styles "found in the home version. If you were somehow disappointed by the home version, or maybe you thought it was "too much", you could find a much more fun and direct game than Soul Calibur in the arcade. Do you think you have what it takes to become a legend?
