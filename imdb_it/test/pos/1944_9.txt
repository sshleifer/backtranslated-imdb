I've seen this movie three times. Returning to video recorders, in the 80s and again on the Encor channel last night (11 February 2010). Based on a true story that I remember being in the news, in the early 1980s, I decided that I find it too disturbing to see it again. Yet it is difficult to look away from a car accident. The most disturbing character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves' younger brother. <br /> <br /> (The story that this film was based on can be found everywhere on the Internet - only on Google. It's about Anthony Jacques Broussard who killed Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California, in 1981.) portray Generation X pre-grunge, borderline sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who cultivates consciousness. <br /> <br /> The old hippies have done a great job bringing up that generation. <br /> <br /> For such a kid, I thought Joshua Miller was excellent, like the serial killer in the movie character. In fact, he went to Yale and wrote screenplays and even directed. His acting skills in this film were incredible. The way he treats his little sister by drowning his doll and ripping the tomb of the dolls gave me the creeps. He gave me nightmares. Even with what is happening in our world today, in 2010, it is still the most degenerate film I've seen to date. <br /> <br /> The apathy and dysfunction of these families is sufficient to cause vomiting. This thrilling killing almost makes Manson's killers pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover took a little too much character. He found himself with David Lettermen to discuss his role, and almost kicked the guest in the lead. Apparently Glover had to seek psychiatric help after playing his character. <br /> <br /> Also, fight the good fight with the great Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
