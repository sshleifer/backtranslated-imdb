This is a very good black comedy, with an excellent vision of how different people have a different perception of the same situations. The three main characters met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situations, but when he talks to other people, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. This is a very good concept, probably not entirely original but works very well in the film. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. The acting is equally good, not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their reach. The comedy is very black, pitch black in some scenes, and many people will surely be offended, but fans of black comedy will probably appreciate it. Overall, this film is not for everyone, but most people who like black comedy will probably love it, as it is certainly one of the best black comedies. 7/10
