This is one of the most anti-traditional war movies on has been seen. Instead of the typical films that emphasize glory and perhaps super-human characters (such as John Wayne), this film is the exact opposite - emphasizing the dehumanization that also happens in war. The story concerns the Japanese who are stranded in the Philippines after the United States returned in late 1944-early 1945. At the beginning of the film, the Japanese were clearly defeated but due to Bushido's insane logic, they cannot afford to consider surrender. In one of the many moving moments, at the beginning of the film the protagonist is told to report to the hospital because he is unable to fight because of his tuberculosis. The problem is that the hospital will not accept it, so his commander tells him to go to the hospital again - and if they don't accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade! Well, this only happens in the first five minutes of the film - things get worse for this soldier and the few latecomers because they won't give up. Furthermore, there is a case in the film where a soldier tries to surrender but is killed. This happened much later in the war because so often the surrendering Japanese soldiers were trapped to blow up when they approached. Furthermore, the film shows the most vivid representation of hunger and madness that accompanies all the films I have seen. Furthermore, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very realistic, realistic and depressing film. You simply could not have made a better film of this type. Horrible but fantastic.
