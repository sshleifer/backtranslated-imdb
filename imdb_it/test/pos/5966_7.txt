The ASCESA is a very useful addition to the recent re-exits from the Soviet Union. Director Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of fidelity and honor in Germany occupied by Germany during World War II. On foot and in a blizzard, two members of a partisan Soviet group leave to find supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The film's focus is on how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity, while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy. However, in the end, he cannot abide by his selfish decision. The film makes extensive use of slow and wide-angle pans that go to extreme close-ups and emphasize the spiritual dilemma within the souls of every man. This is not a great film, but actually represents an intense moral dilemma against the background of a desolate and wild Soviet region.
