Traffik is a really good 6-hour drama about drugs (circa 1987). It tells three stories, in parallel, about how opium is grown in northeastern Pakistan, how drugs are smuggled from Pakistan into Europe and, finally, how drug addicts spiral out of control. All three stories are told in a realistic way and with empathy. You see enough characters in life to understand how ordinary people can be sucked into a life that is truly immoral. <br /> <br /> These are not cardboard cutouts, the opium grower is trying to feed his family in a dry area full of guns and other opium growers. The drug smuggler is a rich heartless German, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just a normal woman who has to choose between leading her "old-fashioned" life or giving up. Finally the main character, the government minister has the most difficult role as he has to face the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. He slips into the world of drug addiction and begins to steal, to suffer ill health, to emotionally attack his parents, all to be able to continue to satisfy his craving for drugs (heroin) that is destroying his life. <br /> <br /> Traffik is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV. The scenes of this show will stay with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
