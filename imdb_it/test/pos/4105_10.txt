The cast is admirably chosen and well balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is as delicious as all the music of Burt Bacharach, and is appropriate for the plot. Making a musical version of Hilton's story is a welcome change from a reprehensible reconstruction. We see expert actors who add real depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I cannot agree with the critics who neglected this sparkling gem of a film. It's a big screen treasure! Find it if you can and let its magic take you beyond the toil of everyday worries, inspiring you to find your "Lost Horizon".
