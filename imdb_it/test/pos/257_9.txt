I saw this movie at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival in Florida. What a great movie. A story of simple and uncomplicated morality about a young young man who takes care of him and who must take responsibility for his actions. Neither pretentious or showy my two teenage daughters loved him and for a change I was not embarrassed by any of the film's content or language. A real family film and the best British comedy film I saw from Billy Elliot. The film went on to win the festival's best prizes as best film and best director, not surprisingly. Ten out of ten.
