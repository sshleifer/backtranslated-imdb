The film is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how can I get the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will work. If this is not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with the respective singers? I tried searching for amazon.com but it's not there. I tried baby CD, not even there. I looked through Google to get some details but there were none. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question. I know the songs belong to Country Music and are sung by a country artist. I just need the names of the titles together with the singer. I would recommend this film or rather the songs to any person you love in the country.
