I had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival. Herzog presented the film and had a long range of questions and answers. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliantly made "documentary"; Herzog then explained that he does not consider his films as a real documentary because the facts sometimes hide the truth. Instead he writes some scenes and some ad-libs to introduce a new element that could be missed if he followed the original plot. <br /> <br /> Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Treadwell, is a real person who falls in love with; you cheer for him, feel the anguish you feel. You admire the sense of humor and joy for life that you have shown here 30 years after you were captured by the Viet Cong. You are disappointed to know that Dieter was broadcast not too long ago. <br /> <br /> As in most of Herzog's films, the image is of extraordinary beauty with a wonderful choice of background music. Especially a battle scene from the archives of the Vietnam War, but which follows Dieter's plot. <br /> <br /> The heart of the film is Dieter who returns to the infernal jungle where he was a prisoner of war makes his journey with some locals. Heartbreaking for us to watch, I can't imagine what he felt while he was tied up again. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to represent and discuss the nightmare of the Vietnam War. It should serve as a lesson for all of us.
