The Curse of Monkey Island is a brilliant video game and it is a stroke of genius by the video game designers of lucasarts to have created this sequel. All the characters are brilliant, the voiceover for the characters was realistic and fun. A great effort went into this game and deserves the 10 I voted for, keep it up!
