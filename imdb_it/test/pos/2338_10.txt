I just saw the DVD of this award-winning movie. One Life Stand is a dramatic drama that through its rhythm, its black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very convincing and honest picture. It is a story about the dilemma of life around power, sex and control evidenced by some sad solitary lives. The mother (very well acted by Maureen Carr) is tense and attracted by herself. The father appears only on the side lines, yet it is a powerful and crucial part of the drama. Money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> The writing was superb, and I liked the sensual close-ups of details like nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors, etc. The way the camera was used made it very intimate. It's a heartbreaking story, with sexual subtitles, while the rain of Glasgow on the dark streets adds to the desperation of the sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some highly memorable shots transmitted simply from a walk or a sagging shoulder - like Trise walking away under the bridge. And the dazed and wounded expression on Trise's face in the call center, which hopes to help people use the tarot, while listening to a speech from the caller for his own abuse. <br /> <br /> At the beginning we see John Paul, with his eyes wide open and innocent, with the pictures taken while trying to be a model. Trise, her mother, is disappointed and makes bad choices for him, in a way that pushes him away while she tries to hold him. The modeling of John Paul turns into an escort and the boss of Trise offers her his money, and finally they meet. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. An excellent scene is when they have a fairly normal meal, and they start to open up a little, when the father appears with his dark presence and undresses everywhere. But this and other things offer moments of hope. <br /> <br /> I have heard that sometimes the rhythm of the film was too intense, but this is a small detail in another essay, stimulating and memorable film, and something a little different. It is in stark contrast to most American films that are either total fantasy, or the real 'world' seen through contaminated glasses. This film describes life with all its edges and shows unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> This is not "light entertainment" but a stimulating and real drama. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a truly engaging and emotionally honest film.
