This satire is really, really dead and no one is spared. But even if this film has a lot of laughs in the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed "Hynkel", and speaking in a hilarious pseudo-German version), the general tone is rather sad, perhaps due the place of the film in history. And the actors aren't even exaggerating so much, I suppose. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the final speech of the Jewish barber, if only things could end up that way. He is no longer even the character to speak, it is Chaplin who says something he really wanted to say. If the technical aspects are ignored, the film does not feel dated or old, it actually moves at a rather pleasant pace. And the strong humor that we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I don't care about is the farce, but that comes only with the era, I suppose. This is an incredibly bold and tough grip on fascism, it's so hard to hit again after all these years.
