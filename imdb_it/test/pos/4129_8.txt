The film took a little breath to play fast and free with facts. But it will make you get closer to being in a time and a place that no longer exist by coming to * feeling *. <br /> <br /> As Keith Richards observes in Paul McCartney's Holly film, there is a bit of Buddy Holly in almost all the rock made from his time. The tragedy that brought him is treated with delicacy, and the rest of the film recreates the joy of a great musical career and a joyful musical body. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey interprets Holly in an extraordinary and energetic way, and his performances suggest that he really enters the music. As a fan and longtime Holly rocker, me too.
