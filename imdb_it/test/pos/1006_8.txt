[CONTAINS THE SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. In practice they had no life at all. All they did was pose and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer by color and fabric. He needed a life. Then consult a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A bar for singles was a great starting point. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, let's see what made the disco die: Jon killed him. Jon then tried to take the girls in the video store. He ended up feeling down in the mouth. Literally. The laundromat was not a prize either when Jon and his supposed date could take a look at the underwear. Jon tried to behave like a true fan on the beach, but he soon angered a real buff boy, who left Jon once again in his mouth. Literally. Jon then tried to collect girls who were walking and jogging. Useless Jon has pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned that his cat was fat, a fat man approached and stepped on Jon's guitar. He was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Jon, an announcement appeared on TV: an announcement for Lorenzo's School for the Personality Impaired. It guaranteed a lifeless person a life in a few simple steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building doesn't look exactly like TV, and Lorenzo didn't behave as brightly as on TV. Jon sat next to a beautiful girl named Mona. So, while Lorenzo taught his lessons on how to introduce himself, check his pulse and pretend to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona know each other. They leave together, forgetting about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona sat on the porch and talked. Garfield was jealous of Mona out of fear that she would take Jon away from him. Garfield imagined the future: Jon and Mona get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is delighted to bring out Garfield's story. Returning to the present, Garfield would not have tolerated. He tried to convince Jon to get rid of Mona, until he started scratching behind his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other occasionally, and Garfield was sure he would be with them. <br /> <br /> Another fun Garfield TV score! This was done during TV's Garfield and Friends race. Garfield was a little thinner. A bit '. Since the first cartoons of 1980. The scenes of Jon trying to shoot the chicks is fun, so is the one in which the fat man pounds on Jon's guitar. Good or Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (The third man of 1,000 voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The woman of 1,000 voices) is Mona.
