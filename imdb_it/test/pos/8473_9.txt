A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of "Ray", a 2004 movie with Kerry Washington, Queen King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others, all of whom give excellent support to the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has several main focuses: the first is the childhood of Charles - the drowning of his brother George who haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength taught by his mother - do not bend, do not break, never be crippled. Eventually he sends him to a special school where the gift of Charles's music is discovered. The next focus is the artistic evolution of Charles as singer of Nat King Cole, his gospel music arrangements, his foray into country music and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third goal is the personal life of Charles - his marriage to Bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and his eventual rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Since Charles lived 74 years, many jumped. Although Charles was orphaned as a teenager, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, is not in the film. While being shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his quasi-hunger as a musician is not covered. At one point, he found a jar of jelly and tried to eat it, but the jar broke. He was so down and out. Bea is shown with him when the banned state of Georgia adopts "Georgia on My Mind" as a musical theme in 1979 and welcomes Charles in his native state, yet he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which is not mentioned. He was probably there, anyway. Furthermore, he was not his only wife: he had married once before meeting her; that marriage is not covered. In the film, we are told of an illegitimate child - there were 12. It would have been impossible to get all this and more in a movie. <br /> <br /> What is not skipped is his glorious music, which seems to go on constantly throughout the film, continually reinforcing his genius and his artistic ability. <br /> <br /> The story of Charles is compelling and keeps the interest of the public alive. Those who mock her as a TV movie do not give him the credit he deserves. Taylor Hackford's direction gives "Ray" a good rhythm, and the film has a lot of atmosphere and beautifully evokes the various decades. <br /> <br /> Like Ray, Jamie Foxx lives the character and makes him forget that he is a comedian who plays a part Foxx wore prosthetics, played his piano and spent a lot of time with Charles preparing for the role. He nails him, but he is not an imitation: he is a man of flesh and blood with hallucinations to stay in the water and find his brother's body; a man full of denial of his addiction, hating the word drug addict and believing that he is not hooked; and denies his family life, thinking that his wife does not know about his various affairs and his illegitimate children (in the film, child); and a man took advantage terribly at the beginning of his career because of his blindness that refuses to be trampled on later. He asks to be paid in $ 1 so that they can be counted; when he discovers he is a tramp for a club owner and his partner and has been almost cheated by a record deal, he goes out on his own and leaves his job. <br /> <br /> One doesn't wonder so much Foxx's performance accepts it as Ray from the first time it appears to the camera. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent biography, which, like "Walk the Line", is punctuated by the artist's fantastic music. Whether you are a Ray Charles fan, "Ray" is something to try.
