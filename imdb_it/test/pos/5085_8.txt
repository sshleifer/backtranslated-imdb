Some people think it was a pretty poor TV series, with cheese effects. (considering that it was shot between 1977 and 1979) but in reality, look back on those years and think: "We didn't have computers then". so if you think about it, it's a pretty good TV series. <br /> <br /> I always thought that bad grades would kill the show, but no. the network has done. they deleted the theme "The superhero network" and abandoned a series of short-lived spider-men. if he went ahead, he probably would have been fine in the 80s, and if he was really lucky (and I mean really lucky), the early 90s. <br /> <br /> And nobody wanted to choose this series up. <br /> <br /> However, Jolly old (or young) Nicholas Hammond, of The sound of music fame, is brought to the TV screen as peter parker, the secret identity of the fantastic spider man. Along the series, Peter takes care of a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> while the series is out of the timeline (since Peter is already a university graduate, and this is when he bites, and Uncle Ben is already dead,) The audience is treated to action, to the suspense and attitude that the characters have towards Peter and his alter ego, spider man. <br /> <br /> While it's also slightly disappointing than Robert. F Simon does not resemble JJ Jameson, it is not so disappointing that Betty grant is not Betty grant, but a hot African American girl (who reminds me of Halle berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet) so really, this one was not so bad. <br /> <br /> but considering the weather, and how much drama they put into this film, this kind of foreshadows what bad TV is today. in both cases, it's fun, even for today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
