I really enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a storyline that he took up later in his career. Perhaps the most surprising thing about it, however, is how the main characters are faceless. After seeing, remember Murray Alper as the jovial truck driver, the moving turn of Vaughan Glaser as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable traveling Freak Show and, of course, Otto Kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, who completely obscure Bob Cummings as a fugitive rather than wood (compare that bridge to the similar Harrison Ford stunt in "The Fugitive" by Andrew Davis) and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and subsequent love for Cummings is never entirely believable. <br /> <br /> The other major The support player is, of course, Hitchcock himself who closes the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many people criticize older films for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with the lack of technology, even trying and transmitting what the director wants to show is an extraordinary achievement. <br /> <br /> Obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the Second World War, but being a Hitchcock is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on action. It's worth a look, especially for support roles.
