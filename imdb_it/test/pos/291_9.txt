This is a classic war movie. One of the best, a clear image fest of flashing lights, dark and dark backgrounds and helicopter blades that turn into ceiling fans. A show studded with stars of immense power. <br /> <br /> Martin Sheen is a mercenary river sent to assassinate the general who went off the road, a sadistic dictator who was incredibly interpreted by the great Marlon Brando. Also along the way, Robert Duvall is a champion with a weakness for "napalm in the morning" or at least for his smell. Dennis Hopper is an angular photojournalist with a distorted vision of war and his boss. In addition, in this fantastic film you will see emerging stars such as Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and also keep an eye on Harrison Ford ... <br /> <br /> Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla which delivers a film with perhaps more intensity and drama than the acclaimed films of the Godfather, highlights the war in its simplest form, which for the most part is something you can't see, you can only hear it, as the boat continues to climb on river, the feeling of the war being squeezed is completely unbearable. The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes the moods unusual to viewers. Honestly, no film has ever made me feel this way. <br /> <br /> Criticisms are hard to find. The greatest skill of some is that Brando has earned a lot of money for a ten-minute role, but in all honesty this is unjustified. They were well earned money, a role that physically limited him, being at the time a sick man and a role that he himself had really made his own. I can't imagine anyone better for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there are some extra parts of the great man, and I think Redux does improve the movie's miles. <br /> <br /> The final impressions are that if you are lucky to have the Redux Version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying movie with a nice 49 minute movie. Otherwise, you will not be disappointed, this film is the best and deserves great recognition and a permanent place as one of the 50 best films ever made ...
