I saw the movie at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere). <br /> <br /> A disturbing and intimate portrait of Loneliness, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something more obscure. <br /> <br /> The acting of the two protagonists (Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage) is excellent, and it's nice to have met these characters before they become so damaged. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm Calling From). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces the moments of the film without drawing attention to itself. /> <br /> I highly recommend the film and the soundtrack.
