I saw this film in its short period in "art house" cinema in '69. I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the film on the floor, having laughed so hard that I fell from my seat. In retrospect, years later, I thought it was made by Melvin Van Peebles. When I talked about it to a friend, he said that a friend of his, Downey Sr., practically filled every non-recitative role in the film: Director, writer producer, etc. He was right, of course, and my memory was wrong, except that this was one of the funniest movies ever made. The "Arab" part was particularly priceless.
