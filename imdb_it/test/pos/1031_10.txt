'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its best. Well written, well played by actors who have a credible resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative and very funny. The sets and costumes capture the atmosphere of the United States during the Second World War, and the plot and dialogue make the viewer feel as if he were really present in Los Alamos and captured by the excitement of the Manhattan Project. The only downside is that this is a British production, and some of the actors lack the ability to influence a convincing American accent. (The skill of Australian and Irish actors confronting non-native dialects is surprising). The plot is fully consistent with the definitive history of the development of Richard Rhodes' atom bomb. Unfortunately, the mini-series was only shown a couple of times on PBS in the early 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion. <br /> <br /> 'Oppenheimer' compares positively with the most recent 'Fat Man & Little' The children's film starring Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the general's chronically overweight and somewhat homely general would completely flattered) and Dwight Schultz (student of the "A-Team" TV) as Oppenheimer. As a miniseries, "Oppenheimer" has a duration of about 4 times, apart from the Newman function, but uses all the extra time to its advantage.
