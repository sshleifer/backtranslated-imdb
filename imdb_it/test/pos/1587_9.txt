The death of Visconti in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. As we watch, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. The endless opulent death of Venice is certainly; but in other important ways, it is an unsatisfactory film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and production; of his imperious ways, his layer on a layer of programmed and self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and the obsession arises, it is clear that Aschenbach has not the slightest idea of ​​who is under his traps of the golden age and of life lived with care. In fact, after seeing Tadzio, the "Solitario", as Mann sometimes calls it, splits into two. Aschenbach n. 1 absorbs the sight of a handsome 14-year-old boy, then attempts to intellectually elaborate the dizzying blood pressure as a work of art would do - a "divine" work of art. But Aschenbach n. 2, emerges as a stalker who takes control, and replaces the rational Aschenbach n. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sexual doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession - and therefore Tadzio remains a distant ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy for this game. Every bit of self-knowledge comes too strong and too late; the excitement of sexual flushing is too big to resist. That Venice is taken by the disease means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has higher stakes. When he finally whispers "I love you" in a whisper, he knows that everything is lost and the abyss is waiting for him. Any of this movie? Perhaps, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away. But there are errors: he and Dirk Bogarde create sympathy for Aschenbach; Mann, again, no. Aschenbach's view dominates the film and is expected to identify it. But nowhere on the screen is there a man who is torn from within. Bogarde moves between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculous temperament with ease - but what is underneath? Bogard's reactive performance did not dock. Mann writes a character who is, in his imagination, doing the Dance of the Seven Veils, all too aware of the consequences that this freedom invites, yet incapable, not wanting to resist. In addition, Visconti's script creates a non-original character - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach - to dramatize Mann's discussion of Art and Artists. These scenes are poorly written disasters, and the actor who plays Alfred is hard to watch. Furthermore, Visconti's Aschenbach is a Teutonic composer of the golden age, who I believe works for the film; and Mahler's symphonies replace Aschenbach's novels. Unfortunately Mahler's great music is badly recorded and very badly played. So Death in Venice, as Visconti gives us, is not the complete success that could have been, but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied. All film students, especially cinematographers, will want to take a look.
