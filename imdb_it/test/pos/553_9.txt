The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that is not overshadowed by frills and special effects; a story of what it really is. I could not help but sigh at the end of this film, alas, it is a well-told bittersweet story of growing up and relating to family and friends. The acting was really exquisite and I hope we will see both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles along the way ...
