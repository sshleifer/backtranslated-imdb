First of all, I think this film is much more appreciated by viewers who actually read "Heart Of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad, the book that was the literary basis of the film. Having said that, I think this film is stunning. It is an excellent war movie that does not focus so much on the blood and brutality of the conflict in Vietnam, but rather on the psychological cost it has had on the young "inexperienced children" who have been sent to fight it. Coppola has shown a true genius in the art of cinema, using many visual elements to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely all-round. The part of Marlon Brando in the film is what really pushed me to act. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film envelops you and reveals the emptiness of a man you've heard of and wanted to see during the film. Those who would consider this just another war movie should take a detailed look at all the literary elements that are intertwined with this film, because there is great significance behind all this. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculpted and best-made films of all time.
