Oz is set in the Oswald State Correction Institute. It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hatred and survival at all costs. in a place like Oz, you have to have your eyes in the back of your head. <br /> <br /> This completely original, intelligent and compelling drama tells how deformed life becomes as soon as you walk through the doors of Emerald City. <br /> <br /> What should be a state-of-the-art corrective structure is actually anything but that. The show highlights some of the many defects of the prison system, the underestimation of humanity that the hard killers are still able to maintain, and the only real fact: the prisoners are those who control the prison. <br /> <br /> This magnificent and somewhat surreal show teaches the importance of every life and helps to understand the reasons why most prisoners are present. This show may seem shocking at first, but to really say what it is, something like that is needed. <br /> <br /> Oz is a great representation of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.
