I just saw Nightbreed for the first time since I saw it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and while I remember that I liked it at the time, I don't remember being stunned like I was today. I can't really complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as the protagonist of Boone. I never understood why he didn't have a more successful career, because most of his early work is exceptional. As good as Scheffer, Cronenberg is even better. His portrait of psychologist Dr. Decker is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, except for the ridiculous sheriff over the sheriff. The images are good and in some big shots. The score composed by Danny Elfman is as good as it is, and is among his best works. The finish was epic, with a non-stop action for almost twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a huge success for Clive Barker, and is my favorite of his films, slightly ahead of Hellraiser. 9/10
