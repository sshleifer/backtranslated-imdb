I wanted to see it for a while: I never thought I'd look at it in a damp Trafalgar Square, in London with 15,000 other people and all with a new Pet Shop Boys score. <br /> <br />, that particular experience. A new departure from PSB, seemed to suffer from the same problem as the miniaturist Hugo Wolf when he wrote his work Der Corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short, ie songs. PSB produced a more fluid and integrated score even though it was quite static under its conditions. Nor could they resist singing: a set of subtitled text worked in this regard a free meditation on the action of the Odessa massacre during the action of that sequence itself was, I would say, too counterproductive. On the whole it was still very exciting, which is certainly what Eisenstein was trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It is a very exciting film with a choppier editing that takes the place of the acceleration of tension or action. In fact the film, although beautifully filmed and performed with passion (it has a silent film melodrama, but not in the excess of the Hollywood comic style) breathes through its accurate editing to the rhythm of specific strokes with the sense of speed with which audience will take them in. And there is also a wide range of perspectives; or he had a lot of cameras or port sequences and the stairs took a long time. <br /> <br /> Super film, which can be evaluated independently of sound, as this is how the finished product would have been. 8/10
