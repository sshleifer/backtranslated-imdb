The book "The Railway Children" is a children's book published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, a British socialist who had very strong opinions on the importance of family values ​​for the education of children, and the story she told was presumably intended as contemporary . A little surprisingly, it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later. <br /> <br /> A film adaptation of a classic Edwardian children's story with the main roles of those of children does not seem very exciting for most film-goers in this day and age. But a great performance by Jenny Agutter who (near the beginning of her long and distinguished career as an actor) played the part of the older girl Roberta (Bobby), combined with the remarkable work of screenwriter and director Lionel Jeffries and the extraordinary photograph by Arthur Ibbetson, he made this movie a movie not to be missed and one that most of his viewers find quite memorable. It is remarkable that this book, set in 1905, was shot five times between 1951 and 2000 (four of the BBC for British television), and all these versions are not only still very much admired but also very much appreciated ( something that users' comments on this database will confirm), although this may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic vintage story designed to attract especially children. Since I have not seen the four versions of BBC TV, these comments concern exclusively the 1970 film version produced for the cinema screening. Unlike most children's book movies, "The Railway Children" may attract more adults than children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the past century that many children might feel totally lost by the way they are portrayed in the film, while many older adults might think it has a remarkable nostalgic appeal. Perhaps to compensate for this, the children in the film are full of life and vitality, while the adult characters, although rounded, tend to be mostly "padded shirts". The story is mature, which concerns love, support and encouragement, not only is it timeless but it is capable of attracting people of all ages. It can be safely described as sentimental and more than idealized, but it is never in any way sloppy, and rarely justified that the adjective "uplifting" fits like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead. <Br /> <br /> The film begins with the Edwardian middle-class family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious London home when two unexpected visitors call and take away father (who is a government official). The mother has to move to a very small house along the railroad in a remote area of ​​Yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life mainly associated with the railroad and the few passing trains. This life turns out to be quite hectic in small ways and the eldest daughter Bobby grows rapidly while taking more responsibility from her mother. At one point she makes a train accident when her sharp eyes detect that a landslide has created a natural hazard. My father's story is never highlighted, but it is never forgotten and gradually it becomes clear that he is imprisoned and suspected of treason. Eventually these suspicions are clarified (we are not told how or why) and reappears unexpectedly at the local station to rejoin his family. <br /> <br /> For many years this film was not available in any home video format in North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD from it three years ago, so they clearly recognized that this rather simple movie has no still lost its charm. For anyone who does not already have one, I strongly recommend that you go and buy a copy of this DVD while it is still available - it is very unlikely that you will be disappointed if you have not become totally cynical, or if your minimum requirements for a film include buckets of blood and / or intense sex scenes.
