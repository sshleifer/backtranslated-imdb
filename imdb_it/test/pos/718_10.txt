"Art for Teachers of Children" by Jennifer Montgomery is an extraordinary disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's hard camera work and cinematography, coupled with the brilliant and unimpressive performances he evokes from his cast, heighten the sense of shocking and crude realism in this autobiographical story of Jennifer's seduction of the orientation counselor of the married asylum. The scenes between the extraordinarily mysterious actress who plays Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are among the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen captured in a movie. Did the lesson eventually learn here? "There is nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." Well, I strongly recommend this extraordinary piece of "Art" for anyone interested in thinking about independent cinema.
