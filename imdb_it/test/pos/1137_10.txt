I saw this movie once so long ago, just once, and I didn't know where it came from, and I tried for about six years to find it, and finally I found it on IMDb.com! Only the whole concept of the film is great, I think it has something to do with a race of bio-engineered beings, keeping an eye on us and our planet, but there is a person who is still not assimilated to conformity. And the way he does it, to avoid being tracked down and localized, is what makes the movie fun. I don't remember exactly how it ended, but I remember, he concluded with a great climax and a good turn.
