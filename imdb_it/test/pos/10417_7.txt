"Summer in the City" is not an American film, despite the New York setting and the characters of New York, it's better than that. The most unusual thing is the mixture of styles and genres. Director Niami shows a clever touch in combining comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama. <br /> <br /> The secret of Niami's success seems to be a smogasboard of great characters - everyone could have their own movie built around them - and then filling them with beautifully crafted shows from one of the most eclectic casts you can find in the same country and in the same film, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, from Robert Burke to Peter Stormare who here reveals that he has much more in him than the bad stereotypes he plays in Hollywood movies. Even Sandra Bernhard is fun here! <br /> <br /> A further bonus, cream on the substantial cake, is the soundtrack by John Cale.
