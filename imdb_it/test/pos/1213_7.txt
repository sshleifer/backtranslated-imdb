Wrestlemania 6, is a fun Wrestlemania, if not successful. The Ultimate Challenge, of course, is worth the price of admission alone, but again, as in many early Manias, there is too much coverage. The crowd opens up for almost everything and, as always, gives us the reliable Gorilla & The Body announcing team. Having a Face vs Face game as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely new at the time, it only made things much more tense. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Koko B. Ware / W Frankie Vs "The Model" Rick Martel. For a 3 minute game, this is the maximum. I wish it was a little longer, but what I got was damn good. Martel wins, with the Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. HUGE Pop for Demolition. The correspondence itself is rather boring, I have often had problems paying attention. Andre didn't really do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 out of 1. There's a solid talent involved here, and it's a shame that they couldn't produce better. The demolition wins those titles, with the Pattened maneuver out of the top there. The crowd blows on the roof for the end. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I got what I expected here, a standard game of boring filler, with Earthquake doing its thing. I'm not even a fan of either, so it didn't attract much interest. Quake wins with his sit down splash. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Brutus Beefcake Vs. Mr. Pepper / W The Genius. Deafening pop for Bruti. Very good pairing, with unfortunately not enough time to develop further. It has really kept my interest, and remains one of my favorites on paper. Beefcake wins with a slingshot for the pole, with great public approval. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper against Bad News Brown. HUGE pop for Piper. Nothing but a boring brawl, which doesn't know what it wants to be. Some funny antics from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Noteworthy for Roddy who paints himself half black and calls himself "Hot Scott" <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation Vs The Bolsheviks. Break record, but other than that, nothing to see here. I win with, The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Barbarian / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average for the time it got, but still reachable. The crowd was quite dead for this, except for Heenan's interference. Jessie's hilarious splits on Tito's food are more fun, so is the game itself. Barbaro wins with an unpleasant-looking flying clothesline. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag Match. Dusty & Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King & Sherri. A great pop for Dusty, and an even bigger one for Elizabeth, which looks absolutely incredible, I might add. I thought it was OK. At least he was lively, if not so exceptional. I'm not a fan of Dusty 'like that. The victory of Dusty and Sapphire, when Sherri surrenders. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> The Orient Express / W Fuji. Vs The Rockers. The crowd is rather anemic for this, surprisingly. Decent without a doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. The constant attention with Fuji, a little diminishes the game. Express wins on behalf, when Janetty is nailed with salt. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jim Duggan Vs Dino Bravo / W Earthquake & Jimmy Hart. Duggan as an idiot, pulls out the American flag in Canada. Duggan also has solid boo, but it could also be due to the Canadian heritage of Bravo. A lousy game all around, I don't care for Duggan, but that's not why he sucked. Too short in the end, really important. Duggan wins when he hits Bravo behind, with the two by four. Duggan is splashed with his problems. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers / W Damien. Some slow points, but when all was said and done, I enjoyed it. Two solid fighters who gave everything there, gave birth to a fun encounter. Crowd greatly becomes Ancy during some parts, making the wave. Dibiase wins for the count. Jake has the last laugh, giving away part of his money, to the great joy of the public. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Bossman Vs Akeem / W Slick. Nice pop for The Bossman. Too normal, and too short to really mean anything in the end. Akeem was a gimmick, I never liked it too much. Bossman wins with his slam. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Rhythm & Blues segment was practically a failure. The crowd had nothing to do with it <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. For a supply match, before the main event, it was not bad. If he had had time to go further, he would certainly have been excellent. Rude wins, with the Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title by Title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Vs Hulk Hogan | WWF Championship | That's all about the atmosphere of the crowd, and the reaction of the divided crowd, for the most part. Warrior had a decent pop, but in my opinion it was a bit overwhelming. Hogan belittles him completely with his. It is one of the best Wrestlemania games in history. With two people, who are not very well known for their wrestling, they managed to create an incredible couple that had been talked about for a long time. I've seen it many times, and my level of respect gets higher for each one, for their effort, considering I'm not a fan of either of them. Even tough life-fanatics who crave pure wrestling can't complain about it! Warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is a fun, if not overly special, voice. It's memorable for the main event, the location and the crowd, but it's not one of the best if you ask me. That said, I have fun and I give him my recommendation to wrestling mates. <br /> <br /> 7/10
