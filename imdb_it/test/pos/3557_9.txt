I feel really sick of sitcoms; you always know what is coming so that it ceases to be fun. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what's coming and it's fun to laugh out loud. I just bought the second set of the series, (3-4 series) and I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for writers or actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they offer was worth the wait. The gems that came from this series and the respect that the actors have achieved through it speak for themselves. Croft and Perry have created some pure gold, some of which shine through Hi De Hi.
