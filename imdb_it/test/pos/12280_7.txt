The copy of this film I saw is not very good. It is grainy and has almost no color in some parts. Switch back and forth between English and French, often in the middle of a sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! To make matters worse, there are no English subtitles during the French-speaking parts, which I think constitute at least a quarter of the film. But incredibly, the film is still very understandable and pleasant, even in these conditions, and I think this says a lot about how well this film is made. <br /> <br /> This is a high-level spaghetti western with great acting, an interesting plot and an excellent soundtrack. He also has a cool protagonist, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some strange characters and events, and a general feeling of melancholy. This film has written "Euro" everywhere. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a pristine negative or the printing of this film out there somewhere, because it deserves a quality DVD version, and when it comes out I will be one of the first in line to get it!
