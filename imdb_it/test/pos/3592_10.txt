The BBC's Blue Planet is simply stunning. I don't think I exaggerate when I say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured in the film. From familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to others more unrecognizable and simply bizarre in the dark depths, almost nothing is left out. With a weight of 8 hours, some people may want to check out the modified highlights, presented in the form of the movie "Deep Blue", but I highly recommend that you start the series. I don't think it will disappoint and if your kids had fun with the water world brought by Pixar's Finding Nemo I'm sure they'll love that too. I just hope the whole television was fun.
