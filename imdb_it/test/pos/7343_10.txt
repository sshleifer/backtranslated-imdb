Somehow, somewhere, somewhere ... you GOTTA see this movie. Savor the antennas and incredible extraordinary performances by talented actors. You think the Cirque du Soleil will blow your mind, wait to see what these two women do - above all, the emotional journey and Jane's battles (Dreya Weber) are universal themes to many women relationships and hold on until you're ready to let go. This masterpiece will touch women and men alike. Ned Far (director / screenwriter) and ridiculously talented Dreya Weber (star / producer) has just had the courage to say it, honestly and sincerely. This film will hit you big - see EVERYTHING you can - or you won't be "in the loop" when it becomes one of the most talked-about movies.
