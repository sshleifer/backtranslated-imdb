"L'appartement" must be among the best French films I've ever seen (along with "Hatred", also played by Vincent Cassel, and those great films by Gerard DÃ©pardieu / Pierre Richard). Cassel and Bellucci are incredible in the main roles. Besides "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Dobermann" I haven't seen a bad movie with this couple yet. "L'appartement" sucks you in from the beginning and the turns keep you electrified until the end. Fragmenting the narrative did not work very well as "Pulp Fiction". We just hope there isn't an American remake of this romantic thriller novel. (EDIT: Guess a! An American remake has been done!)!
