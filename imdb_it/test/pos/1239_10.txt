Why should I say that? Because when the film ended, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim in the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be fun. For those of you who believe that you have learned to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to your career. He won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky has learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The film was fun. What drives me crazy is how some other comments made on this film claim that there are no memorable lines or scenes. Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> The waaaambulance? Am I not a loser? Have you ever seen a big scream that I'm not a loser? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was fantastic. It was fun, it was never boring and in a sense Disney, it had a point to make. Something that has to do with life and, of course, any children's movie that tries to do it is over, but for once I didn't care. <br /> <br /> If you haven't looked at it. To do so. You will like it.
