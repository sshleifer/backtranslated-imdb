Three bizarre couples, SIX OF A KIND, get caught up in a crazy search for stolen loot. <br /> <br /> This is a lively and exhilarating comedy, with the six stars - Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, WC Fields AND Alison Skipworth, George Burns and Gracie Allen - all committed to doing what they did best: being some laughter. <br /> <br /> Ruggles and Boland make another of their cinematic appearances as husband and wife - this time rather more loving than usual. They were a perfect team - she the shrill lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and here they dominate most of the time on screen. From beginning to end, I'm a delight. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen continue the patter that originated in Vaudeville, perfected on the radio and would eventually lead to television, with George the perennial straight man and Gracie the eternal madman. Sometimes in the film it tends to go a bit over the top, but it's hard not to love it. His heart was obviously made of solid gold. <br /> <br /> As Skipworth receives a rather short drift - only fragments of his formidable personality gleam - Fields is in his element as the deplorable sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether you explain how he got the nickname ?????????????????????????????????????????? ????? Best of all, he can perform his entire classic pool routine, keeping it forever for grateful posterity. In the end, he performs the almost miraculous - he stops Gracie. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to take care of the main actors in another play. Only the fields have been refused. He felt he had reached the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. The Studio finally accepted and began the preparation of Fields' first feature film, YOU YOU RING ME (1934).
