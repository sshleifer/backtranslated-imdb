I doubt that the true story of the development of Western Union would have ever gained a true audience. Instead of talking about the construction of the telegraph system to the west, it was the history of meeting rooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and unwelcome) of the great "barons of thieves": Jay Gould. Gould picked up the company in difficulty and turned it into a communications giant and part of his attempt at a national rail system to rival Vanderbilt's. But this, although interesting, is not as exciting as the story of writing the telegraph lines itself. At least, that's how the public would see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. If he had lived in the modern era and invested in Hollywood, he probably would have accepted that assessment. <br /> <br /> The film is about how the installation of the telegraph system by the Indians, spurred on by a certain Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) is in danger. Slade, a desperate man, is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a strain on his ability to escape the police in the territories. He is compared to the man in charge of laying telegraphic cables, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton's partner Richard Blake (Robert Young), and a quasi-lawman Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother. Blake, an oriental with little knowledge of the West, is making fun of Creighton's sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it difficult to get used to her new environment. But he becomes a close friend of Shaw, especially in trying to face Slade. <br /> <br /> Slade was a true Western criminal, by the way, and the subject of a section of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in 1870. But he had no involvement in mixing Indians against railways or telegraphy companies. However, MacLane makes him a memorably evil and totally evil guy. His killing of one of the main characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he sees the corpse as if he had just got rid of a nuisance. But Lang is responsible for this, as well as other touches. Watch the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on a telegraph pole that repairs it. Spit tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who squirts a little. Then there is an Indian attack that we watch from the ground floor. In the end, Young suddenly squirts again, but it's not brown but red covering him. Look at the top of the pole and Wills with an Indian arrow through him. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting movie to watch and it's worth catching.
