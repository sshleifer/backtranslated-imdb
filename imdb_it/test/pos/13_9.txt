I work in a movie theater and every Thursday night an employee is shown on a movie that comes out the next day ... Today was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and advertisements and never expected much from it, and in no way did I really expect to see this movie. Well, this film was much more than I thought. It was a great story first of all. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did a great job of acting in this film. Being a big fan of That 70's Show I always found it difficult to think of Kutcher as anyone other than Kelso, despite the great acting he did in The Butterfly Effect, but after seeing this film I think I could finally see him as a serious actor . <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the American Coast Guard.
