This film was great. It had everything an action enthusiast could want. A lot of people getting shot and / or mutilated, minimal love stories involving sex, a hero that can be identified, violence at many intervals instead of a useless plot that only stores a scene at the end and bad that they are just asking. Bronson appears to be at his lowest tolerance level in this film and show. Ed Lauter is a great cop and he worked without problems in the Bronson plot without stealing the spotlight. The film does not provide a plot so boring or overly burdensome to watch this film once and never again. Rather, you want to see Kersey in action and the plot is enough to make it grow. This is fantastic stuff.
