Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher movie. The backwoods slasher started practically with films like Friday 13, The Burning and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step up from the typical backwoods slasher movie. Cinematography is wonderful. Acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'. <br /> <br /> Constance is a "forest" girl, but when it comes to the primal survival instinct, she is a step backwards. Not until it's about saving her and her boyfriend's life, the primitive notion of survival comes into play. There is a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the hidden sexuality of the final girls - coinciding with his will to survive. <br /> <br /> Just Before Dawn is not for everyone, but for slasher fans, it is the closest perfect you can get. Assassins are very threatening - Almost as if it were a game to mutilate and kill anyone crossing their territory. The final scene is a bit out of place. For the first viewer, it might be a bit shocking. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the backwoods slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something similar about it. The setting is disturbing and makes us feel uncomfortable. The death sequences are not particularly bloody, but I'm not sure the film needed blood. Watch it!
