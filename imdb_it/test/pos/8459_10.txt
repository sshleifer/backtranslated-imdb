Normally I don't comment on movies on IMDB, but in this case I feel like I should. I love movies, and I want to make them, and this film is a perfect example of film direction. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I saw on the small screen (originally seeing it on AMC, I think, and then on the DVD I just saw) that got me that feeling in the pit of my stomach. That little bite feeling that the director would have hoped to experience while watching his thriller. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jack Lemmon is excellent, followed by Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. I felt so much empathy towards Lemmon, the character of Jack Godell, he just wanted people to hear his warning. <br /> <br /> But what strikes me most about this film is the lack of a score, and this is also what makes it nice for me. Apart from the opening titles, there is no background music to increase the tension, because no one is needed. And while the credits run, white on black, silently pushes the point home. <br /> <br /> I use the film as an example for anyone who claims that music makes the film. I think the film should make the film and the music should only amplify it. But for The China Syndrome music is not necessary to overcome the realism and urgency represented here. The characters portray all this much better than the music they could ever have. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film, it's one of my favorites. If you like movies, you won't be disappointed. If you like movie soundtracks more, you may not want to do this.
