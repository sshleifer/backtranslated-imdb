Just like in Rififi, the most compelling scene in the film is the perfect silence of the jewelery shot. The scene is masterful in its execution, each of the thieves has their own specialized work to perform, each of which successfully combines its own unique talent towards the goal, and each, up to a month before, complete strangers. <br /> <br /> Many scenes take place very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long introduction of characters to both Corey and Vogel, since we see Corey being released from prison and Vogel escaping capture while going to prison. The two characters are then methodically reunited through destiny at a roadside restaurant while Vogel hides in the trunk of Corey's car. From this improbable irruption, the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfect and precise stroke of jewelery. <br /> <br /> However, to pull off this robbery must include the help of a third man named Jansen. Jansen is hired as the assassin. His inclusion in the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his hire, Jansen is in a complete battle with DT's and spent most of his day on his crib hallucinating lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the disordered and hallucinatory world of a dream by William S. Burroughs to a shooter with a steady and sober hand, is very fast and maybe the only real fake moment of the film, but it is only I who am extremely picky. > <br /> Another slightly false note was that of the Mattei police inspector. Sometimes he seemed to be brilliant in the way of arming the right people or gathering information and waiting for his escaped prisoner to make his move. At other times it seemed to be 10 years retired, especially in the beginning during Vogel's escape through the woods. I wonder if I had too much meaning hidden from the beginning of the film. At the beginning of the film, while the police car is crossing the city, the first image we see is that of a red stop light. My first thought is that this could be the 'red circle' and that if I had to find a deeper meaning in the film, maybe it's that this machine, or rather the people inside it that go through the red light, will be the ones that will "stop" the jewel robbery. Hmmmm? <br /> <br /> Perhaps the red circle refers to the triumphant ring of thieves? Was it the burning track? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> It's a long film, but it's not like that. The finish is a bit disappointing. He seemed too hasty for a film that looked like such a delicious treat. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
