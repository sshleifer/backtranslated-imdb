This was one of the worst episodes of Columbo I've seen, however, I'm only in season two. <br /> <br /> The typical activities of Columbo are both fun and irritating. His cigar ashes that cause him problems have been seen before, and the piece where he is always identified in some way with the killer - in this case the kitchen, Tho is the scene of the television series distracted by the main theme. <br /> <br /> Also unexplained was the reason why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting off part of the mixer wires. The reason was never explained, nor had any purpose. But the part that I didn't like most was the death of the bride. This has never been explained and is the main reason why I give this episode so low.
