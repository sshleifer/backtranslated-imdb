I'm trying to find a place to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie "Isn't it shocking?" I was 7 when I saw this movie and lived in the city where it was shot. A couple of my family's items were used in the film as props and a couple of my friend's houses were used in a couple of scenes. The shooting took place quite well in the city and in the surrounding community. I saw the film only once originally and I would like to have a copy so now I can show the family the film. I did extensive research online with no luck and wondered if anyone would have any ideas on how to try to get a copy of this movie?
