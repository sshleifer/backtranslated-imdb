Not only do I consider this the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever made, but a real tribute to the teachers. <br /> <br /> Despite the incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and take them from nothing to basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods have been criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners. Voight really showed his love for teaching and that it was natural for him. did not exaggerate in the role and found it totally credible. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> In addition to the love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. No matter how good you are at your job, if you blow up the boat, the bureaucrats will catch you.
