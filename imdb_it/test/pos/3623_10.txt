The film was seen at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London (England). We enjoyed it immensely. Although the crow and the Chinese policeman do not appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the author (writer / director) voiced / played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well. <br /> <br /> It is said that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (in the role of Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just one pint. <br /> <br /> Spike was shown the film on video before he died and by all accounts he enjoyed it immensely.
