it's a great film for the whole family. I don't think many people have seen it because I ask people and they say they never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister-in-law. my favorite scene is the whole movie I can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny but intelligent dog. if someone has not seen it, it is losing a great adventure. I only saw him because my aunt is related to Sophie and received a copy. if anyone is reading this I suggest buying the movie and I have guaranteed that it will not be a bad decision. I've seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people give them just one chance.
