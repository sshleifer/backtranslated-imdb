One must take Martin & Lewis as a pinch of salt and pepper. Why did Martin put up with Lewis? Then again, why all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocently nice! Martin sings some good songs (he syncs his lip at least once) and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other films put together. Generally I find that I can take so many of Jerry's antics before they become aggravating. BUT .... in this movie, watch when Jerry gets stuck out on a Navy submarine! EXCELLENT! Buster Keaton should have been proud. I give the film a 7.
