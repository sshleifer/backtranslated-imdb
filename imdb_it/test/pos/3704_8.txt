Mom must be one of the awkward movies of all time to watch. It features an old lady that you would like to have as your nanny who becomes the craziest fucking monster mother you ever wanted to meet on a dark night! <br /> <br /> This Nanny dinner eats a young woman's interior at the opening of the film and the situation worsens. A cross between the howling and the dead brain seems to come to mind when describing the mother! <br /> <br /> A must for horror fans who want to (if you've seen a re-animator or a dead brain, this will float your boat) and you're willing to turn off your brain for about a 'Now ... Let the blood pour! ... 8/10
