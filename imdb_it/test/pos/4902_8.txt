One of Warner Brothers' best and highest grossing films of the 1930s was this fascinating family drama about a widower who lives with his first sister who raises her four daughters. But not four daughters everyday. All of them were trained by their father musician on instruments and one as a singer. They make beautiful music together, even if it's for the long-haired set. <br /> <br /> You can see the infinite variety of roles that Claude Rains has played over the years and continue to marvel at while showing you yet another aspect of his creative personality. The opportunist Vichy Captain in Casablanca is as different as the mad scientist in the Invisible Man, as the patient and wise work in Mr. Skeffington. All the same man and all so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he lifts the four girls with love seasoned with a bit of crabby enthusiasm for their willingness to accept modern music. The Lane Sisters and Gale Page can get to know Beethoven, but they are also hep cats and can beat dads at the bar every time. And if Rains gets a little too tough about how Aunt May Robson can put him in his place. <br /> <br /> With four unmarried daughters, at the moment you know it will change. All sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Obviously the pairing process becomes a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy, but promises to solve it when the film ends. <br /> <br /> Four Daughters is also known as John Garfield's debut film. Garfield had no other film roles other than a small part in Footlight Parade years before. But he was hailed on the New York stage for his performance in Golden Boy and Warner Bros signed it and found the perfect cinematic debut role as a cynical musician who can't get a decent break in life. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1938, but lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This film was so popular that it practically generated a small cottage industry for Jack Warner. Sequels with cast members such as Daughters Courageous, Four Mothers, Four Wives cleaned up at the box office before the Second World War. And the Warner Brothers reworked it with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day playing the parts that John Garfield and Priscilla Lane had. Now those two have made beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Still a timeless mold was created in Four Daughters and the film holds up 70 years after it was first seen.
