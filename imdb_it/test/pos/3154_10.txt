In 1858 Tolstoy wrote this in his diary: "The politician is not compatible with the artistic, because the first, to prove, must be unilateral". This thought from a great mind is applicable to USA The Movie. The film could be read by those with a narrow focus like a 90-minute slam of Bush, Cheney et. to the. as well as a tear of America as an out-of-control imperialist force that will eventually be destroyed by its own madness and thirst for power. The most open viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this DVD a testimony of postmodern thought, since the main character is broken up into fragments surrounded by recurring images of the natural world in contrast with the man-made constructions; towers, roads, video monitors, radio, vehicles. Especially the threatening threat of wars that have been and must come to hatch forever. War and the voices of war are what is created, destroyed and recreated on the screen, in our conscious world and in our unconscious minds.
