I wandered into Blockbuster with a friend the other night after deciding that we were too broke and too lazy to do physical activity. He decided he wanted to see Closer, which seemed so repellent that I had to rent another movie for a time when she had gone to bed. Looking around I didn't see much that interested me, but I saw The Doll Master in the section of the new releases. Based only on the cover (A woman with a doll's face crying tears of blood) I thought it would be interesting enough to rent. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, looking almost empty at home, with all the lights off it was pretty scary. I have to admit that I have always had a little phobia of dolls since I was a kid (and I saw a terrible movie called Asylum, one of the stories involved involved a mental patient who created a doll that killed people at the time) and the the first three quarters of this film were really right for me. The first half hour in particular was fantastic. The disturbing and disturbing atmosphere really set the scene well, and without moving the dolls, it looked really threatening. But unfortunately, as soon as they started moving, everything got a little rough, I was a little disappointed when moments that could have been really scary made me laugh at the way they were shot. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, it's a horror movie, you really don't expect anything memorable. I discovered that I remembered names and faces better than most of the Asian horror films I saw, which suggests that there must have been a development of hidden characters that I didn't consciously notice. The typical stereotypes are in force in this film each with a kind of character strangeness that distinguishes them from the others, from the shy and quiet Yeong-ha and his doll Damien, to the outgoing child Seon-yeong. <br /> <br /> The plot itself was pretty good, although the ending, which included many of the free threads of the plot, seemed a bit confusing and didn't really do anything for me, even though it had a couple of fantastic twists that I won't ruin here. The basic plot is that a group of kids are invited to be modeled like dolls by a famous lonely old doll maker, they have to stay in the creepy house (adorned with scary dolls, some big ones) and things start to happen like ours Hae-heroine starts me to explore areas of the house and things start to happen to other inhabitants. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would certainly recommend the film, not to look with too many people as probably some of the moments make you laugh if surrounded by friends, but as something to look alone in the dark, with windows and doors open only a little, in case any doll wants to look with you. It really lets you guess most of the movie, allowing you to unleash wild conspiracy theories just to destroy them completely later. If you really identify with and ignore the fact that in certain places I can guarantee that you will check under the bed before going to sleep and maybe even leaving the lights on. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P As for Closer, it was OK, but I preferred this.
