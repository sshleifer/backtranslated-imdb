I have to admit that I didn't go around seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the start of a very successful summer season, this nice film couldn't help but be a little lost in the millions of dollars in special-effects movies, wasn't it? <br /> <br /> "Return to Me" has a nice and simple story in it, and is extremely well directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a series of important photos as an actress herself ... along with this!) The fascinating story is beautifully intertwined with an intelligent comedy and brought to life with superb performances by veteran and young actors. <br /> <br /> To those who say that David Duchovny has not really had a good opportunity to burst his "Fox Mulder" stamp, I agree. I saw his other film work, and it is, by far, the best thing he could have done for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, fun and lively in her role as Grace. <br /> <br /> Outside of these two contacts, however, you are surrounded by Grace's family and close friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute point, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real force. I cannot, however, go without mentioning the talent of Robert Loggia and the late dear Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I only watched this movie again on DVD the day before he died. This was his last film, and he gave a performance that an actor of his caliber could certainly be proud to leave as the finale of a great career. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Return To Me" has transformed what it would have been just a fun love story and turned it into a movie that has become one of my favorites! Take the time rent this ... it's worth it!
