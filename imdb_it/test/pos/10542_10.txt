This movie is the best horror movie I've ever seen. the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks. seriously, if you have small children don't let them see this. naturally I am a little biased due to an irrational fear of puppets and dwarves. also a double cameo of the body of the boy who makes mini me verne troyer. and some free nudity, a must in every low-budget horror movie. all the other horror films will be judged forever against this in my book.
