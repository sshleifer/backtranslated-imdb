I love the absurdity and pungent humor of Buñuel's surrealist films (such as "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Exterminating Angel", to name two). Other previous works (such as "The Forgotten Ones" on the juvenile delinquents of a marginal neighborhood in Mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message. <br /> <br /> However, I believe it is "Nazarin" that the most successful shots for the spectator's heart. While it is true that it is full of irony, it nevertheless reveals an aspect of Buñuel that seems to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of spiritual research. Here, while the director (in general) throws countless shots at the Catholic Church, it also seems to show, surprisingly, a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and his practice of selfless love. <br /> <br /> "What" Luis Buñuel brazenly praising a figure similar to Jesus? "I have always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtues ... that is until I have seen "Nazarin." My appreciation is that it satirically reveals the difficulty of following the example of Christ in a society infested by meanness, ignorance and sin, but also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as a true beacon of light in the middle to a sea of ​​darkness: no doubt, at the end of the film I was looking at him and not down at him! <br /> <br /> Some argue that Father Nazario's doubts about his faith indicate the loss of his holy values . (Alas, if he cannot do good in this world, who can?) But I would say that this "defect", his frustration, makes his character even more heroic, because it shows how human he is and how difficult his struggle is inside must be, and who says that the priest could not finally emerge from that The "dark night" and regain his trust? Perhaps only a difficult part of his spiritual journey was presented to us. The elegant and open ending (in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a stranger) allows us to imagine ourselves the final outcome of the story. I recognize in Buñuel the aggressive and self-proclaimed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social conscience; but after seeing "Nazarin", I also perceive from him a certain warmth, depth and maturity that is not so evident in his other work. <br /> <br /> For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend looking after the short film "Simon of the Desert" (also made in Mexico, several years later). It is a similar subject - the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation - but it does so only in a hysterically fun and totally irreverent style.
