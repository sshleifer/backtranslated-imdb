Like some people here, I love / love Stingers! In Norway it went on much later. This also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yes, it's true) I must say that I really love the Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'll die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers could be the series on (except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are fantastic! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally I think it's one of the best accesses we have! I know it's not like SUPER-known, but it's really a great actress! Stingers makes me want to be a cop! I LOVE IT! <br /> <br /> P.S: Do you know if you can buy the episodes?
