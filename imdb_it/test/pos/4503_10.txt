This is absolutely one of our favorites of 2007. <br /> <br /> The story of two boys who come from different worlds, but who are as close as their brothers are brilliantly told. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, and scripted - from childhood to adulthood it never falters. <br /> <br /> A brilliant vision of a lost culture, and a great way to understand the cultures and traditions of Farsi, is also an exceptional fairy tale. He is both compassionate and electrifying, uplifting and full of immense pain, joyful and depressing. <br /> <br /> With excellent cast performance and great technical skills behind the camera, this is really the film at its best. > <br /> Highest recommendation: a true slice of life that elevates and informs.
