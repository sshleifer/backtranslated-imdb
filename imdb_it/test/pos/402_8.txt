Better than the average World War II era "who-dun-it" with Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and was reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and the criminals who want to go straight ahead. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who could have some mental problems. The connection to "courage" is not particularly clear. <br /> <br /> This rumor revolves around the death of the fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have had mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a closed room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr. Ordway labels the murder. Hillary Brooke plays the role of widow Kathleen Carson who is involved with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes her sister who disappears on stage. As a mysterious novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor like Lloyd Corrigan as a crime enthusiast. <br /> <br /> Ghostly houses with creaking doors, chests in the cellar and suspicions that are never seen in daylight add suspense to the air. The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music is very good. Direction, production design and photography stand out. External shots and costumes suggest more wealth than is normally found in the average "B" detective story. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended.
