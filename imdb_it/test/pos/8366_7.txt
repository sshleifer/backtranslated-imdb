Shuai is a crude young Beijinger with a punk haircut, who makes a living selling cheap books from a stall in a covered market. There would appear to be nothing in common with the skinny, middle-aged, aspiring intellectual, Zhang - yet the two of them end up in a restaurant together discussing the pros and cons of murder (the Chinese title might perhaps be better translated with "Talk It Over "). If this makes it a bit pedestrian, don't be fooled: this film is profusely inventive in its plot, and mostly runs at breakneck speed (even if the rhythm is quite marked towards the end). <br /> <br /> If you only know the historical dramas worthy of Zhang Yimou as Raise The Red Lantern and the Shanghai triad, or his most recent martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you will be amazed; indeed, any of his other films you have seen, you will be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is by far his most original, most eccentric, most experimental work. It was shot in a couple of weeks with a minimal budget, almost entirely in place in Beijing (and making use of many regular Beijingers in minor minor roles - there is also a fleeting cameo from the director himself), and above all with a hand- held in the hand, in a spasmodic and hyperkinetic style that is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his most famous films. <br /> <br /> OK, I live in Beijing, so I find an extra pleasure in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that I am coming to recognize and enjoy (even though it was shot in '97, and things are changing so quickly here), but I really think that this movie can be appreciated by anyone. I saw it, since I have so many other Chinese "comedies" in a cinema club that projects subtitles of recent Chinese films for an almost exclusive audience; and he is the only one who can remember where the audience was laughing out loud. Some non-Chinese audiences may find it a bit too weird, sometimes a little uncomfortable, as it includes some violence and, after opening a romantic and airy romantic comedy, turns into something much darker in its second half. It is, however, very, VERY fun. <br /> <br /> It is also superbly performed by the two protagonists, in particular the longtime collaborator Zhang Yimou Jiang Wen, who is probably the main star of mainland China, and has a hatching presence on screen that resembles a young Depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie - to show that the Chinese have a sense of humor that can translate into other cultures, to prove that Zhang Yimou is much, much more than a one-trick pony .... .. and for a great time.
