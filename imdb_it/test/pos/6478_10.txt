Pat O'Brien had his best role as coach of Notre Dame Knute Rockne. From humble beginnings, Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student around 1910. He is in chemistry but becomes a wonderful football player and hero. <br /> <br /> After graduation, he teaches chemistry at the school but has the fever of football gripping him, forcing him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of training the game. In a sense, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher, certainly much better and more beautiful than the one I had in high school. (Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn to be precise.) <br /> <br /> He motivated his students. It will not tolerate an inferior academic result. He is a coach for all seasons. <br /> <br /> O'Brien captures that common touch. One of his students, George Gipp, is memorably portrayed in a brief supporting performance by Ronald Reagan. <br /> <br /> The years pass and the results are high, but Knute remains the same type of coach who testifies before Congress when football is called into question. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp is as exceptional as a Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne was destined to train football. Albert Basserman is adequate, but his Hebrew accent in the portrait of a priest is somewhat embarrassing. Basserman was named that year in the support category for "Foreign Correspondent". <br /> <br /> The tragic death of Rockne, in a plane crash, robbed the world of many other years of a totally professionally wonderful human being. The film is fantastic.
