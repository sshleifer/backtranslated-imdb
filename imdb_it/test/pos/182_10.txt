In my review I just referred to the young leading actress like Katerina when she should have been Veronika. I was so involved in the character and in the action I imagine that I wasn't interested in names. However, she and the film are brilliant. As I said, the cinematography and the use of editing by the director are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tisse '. Production design is top notch. The positioning of the actors in the foreground, in the middle and in the background within each staging date is worthy of study. Extraordinary and memorable camera movement and an ending that has an emotional impact that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Gee! Heroic self sacrificing instead of walking in the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
