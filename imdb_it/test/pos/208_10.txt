If you're looking for a typical war movie, it's not like that, so a note for all the war-thirsty carnage-pumped testosterone buffs out there, don't worry. Although the film is about Russian characters in World War II, don't expect to see Nazis, cannons, blood, blood, etc. It is not a film about people who cause a war or fight a war. It is a film about the common people who see war and the choices they make in dealing with it. <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography, writing: all 10 perfect here. You'll surely appreciate it if you're Russian like me, but even if you don't, you'll probably love it. If you don't speak Russian, look for the DVD RUSCICO version (Russian Cinema Council). It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing on this I would say is equally valid. Obviously it's not as good as the original Russian track (some things are lost in the translation), but it's just as good as English subtitles. So go take a look, especially if you're studying movies in every aspect.
