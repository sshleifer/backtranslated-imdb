I try to capture this movie whenever it is shown on TV, which is happily quite often. But I keep forgetting about videos. As it is, I know practically the script by heart, but this does not prevent me from having a good cry, in fact, I probably add it while crying knowing what will come next. It is such a beautiful film - well done, well done, good photography. I love it. One of my top ten films.
