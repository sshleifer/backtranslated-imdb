The success of SCREAM has given birth to a new wave of horror films. I'm happy with this, as a big horror fan, and I liked most of those new horror movies. BOC is a big bunch of horror. Colorful, fast and original. I see this film more like the opening of a new trilogy (very similar to Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) because it has a new twist. Instead of focusing on the relationship between kids and murderers, here we have a distorted film about couples. We have sweet young lovers in contrast to crazy doll-sized lovers. Very creative!
