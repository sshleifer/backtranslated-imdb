this is what confuses me about critics and their opinion. I usually take what critics say about a movie, on many occasions before seeing a movie. <br /> <br /> however, I saw this without knowing anything about it. mainly due to the cast. kevin spacey and don cheadle are two of the most acclaimed and in my opinion the best live actors. and Ryan Gosling is on a rapidly growing journey. his reality and his humanity that oozes in most of his portraits, makes the audience truly believe in the character and what is happening to him. He really is my favorite actor of my generation. I've always found jena malone pretty, always dark-haired, and if she chooses to keep doing similar roles then I don't complain. <br /> <br /> back to my point. this film really moved me. I thought the acting was first class. as you would expect. the film actually left the public with the end goal of a good movie; reflection and reflection that ensues after the launch of the credits. I think I will have to watch it again to decipher how this film has been critically criticized. I know their reviews need to be taken with a pinch of salt. at least I know now.
