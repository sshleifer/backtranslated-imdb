Will Smith is as captivating as the Relationship Doctor, here to treat all your relationship problems. <br /> <br /> I expected this to be a standard RomCom with little to amuse. I am happy to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is delightful and unexpectedly "cool" in this Andy Tennant vehicle. Surrounded by a great supporting cast, an interesting story nurtured with witty dialogue, I was completely taken. <br /> <br /> We found this cute, bizarre and inspiring without being a preacher. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
