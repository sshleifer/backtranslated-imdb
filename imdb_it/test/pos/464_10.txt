The lyrics and the tone of the songs completed the sadness of the film so well that you asked if the tracks had been created specifically for the film. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl is the best actress I've ever seen. His compelling and credible performance made the film. It made me wonder if she was really a prostitute. Who knows. However, the film was very worthy of being seen. LOVE, YOUR SISTER! yes, that's right ....
