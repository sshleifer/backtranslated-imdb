A good but not exceptional film, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first talkie. It is a great effort, and sometimes a notable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately the moments of genius of Chaplin offered here are disappointed by the tendency to use too useless a dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the master of the silent screen, uses too many words in this film, and his tendency to write long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue will affect his other film-talkies, like (better) "Limelight". However, Chaplin was extremely daring in making this film and his performance in double roles is certainly memorable. Paulette Goddard doesn't have the glow she made in "Modern Times" (her off-field relationship with Chaplin was getting cold at the time), but it's always worth seeing, and Jack Oakie almost steals the show like a rival dictator for La famous creation of Chaplin, Hynkel.
