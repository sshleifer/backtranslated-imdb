From the beginning, you won't be able to look away and don't want to do it. "The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the funniest souls I've seen in a long time. If you can look away from the crazy and sometimes perverse humor, it is easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work. <br /> <br /> Part of the splendor comes from the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order, so you may not understand some of the things they talk about at the beginning, but as the series progresses you will find yourself saying "ah, that's what they meant! " While this may confuse some people, after watching the show, it will be difficult for you to explain the story this way. <br /> <br /> After all, the focus is on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of any anime ever. His opening speech to his class, in which he declares that he is not "interested in normal humans" and looks for "espers, aliens and time travelers" is absolutely bizarre, but is lovable that way. <br /> <br /> Then there is Kyon, the "normal" guy who is involved in the madness surrounding Suzumiya-san. He is the narrator, and his witty spirit always makes the scene a lot more fun. He finds himself caught up in the middle of various factions trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions; ironically, they are the very beings that Haruhi is looking for, yet they cannot be revealed to her. <br /> <br /> The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who seems to be the only member of the school's literary club and also a representative of the Integration Thought Entity; she is basically an alien, although the best description of her is a computer program in a human body. Her purely emotionless answers make her comically impassive and always make you think that there is something more than it seems. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, the time traveler, who seems to be incredibly nice, a great ditz, and the subject of Suzumiya's plans to advertise his club, the SOS Dan, to the world. The end result is that Suzumiya makes her things that border on sexual harassment, making her dress in fetish uniforms. The final character is Koizumi Itsuki, the timid and perpetually optimistic philosopher who seems to be Haruhi's "esper", although he can only use his powers under certain conditions. <br /> <br /> The end result of all these characters is a comedy different from any other, which is at the same time rough and deep, and always brilliant. You do not believe me? Watch the first episode, their "student film". You'll see what I mean.
