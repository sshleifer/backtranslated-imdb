A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the images and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should be seen on the film, screened. The pixellation created by digital transfers absorbs a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to films that are already abstract and grainy. However, since this film is practically unavailable in any format, I suppose you'll have to settle for what you can. <br /> <br /> However, this excellent artistic endeavor comes from the kind permission of the boy who eventually gives us Shadow of the Vampire. It is a dark and obscure film of the genesis of the elements (as far as I can get from the names of the characters) through a horrifying and surreal process. Begotten is an excellent example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral rather than the theme. <br /> <br /> And visceral describes it. There are not many things that happen in the film technically, but the levels of emotion that will make you pass are innumerable. The same repetitiveness of some images creates a hypnotic grip on the senses. The editing and the soundtrack in particular are immaculate, and offer images incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Fans of this film would do well to see the short film collections published in Other Cinema DVD, Experiments in Terror I, II and III. Movies like these make me more and more certain that the realm of real horror lies in the abstract, in the abuse and in the non-narrative, rather than in the ghostly tales of ghosts and ax-killers. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
