OK, so I loved Rachael Ray first, but now I LOVE her! How innovative. I love the fact that she has a kitchen section - I admit that sometimes you skip that part, just because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also like that you can get the next day's shopping list on his website. I like that he has regular helpers and that he has made some of his viewers become his regular customers. I love how cute and how creative she is. I also like how he does his Mystery Guests. It just seems a lot more genuine than many other talk shows. From time to time he gets some stars and I love that. I like the fact that you talk about your personal life there and you remind people how happy I am. He already mentioned the tabloids before and it's so funny! It also has the funniest stories! Anyway, I'm a fan for life. Even my 2 year old girl knows who Rachael Ray is and he loves her too!
