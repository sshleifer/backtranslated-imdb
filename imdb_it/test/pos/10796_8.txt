*** SPOILERS *** For some strange reason Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio" based on Stephen Singular's book "Talked to Death" and Eric Bogosian's film play, on the 1984 assassination of the Denver show talk show, Alan Berg, he never got the recognition he deserved so rightly. The 1988 film was prophetic enough to recognize the clandestine movement that was developing on the American farm and inland. A movement that generated, about seven years later, the ordeal of a rabid and disgruntled Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh who hates the actions of US governments in Wacco, Texas, bringing his friend Terry Nichols the detonation of the Federal Palace of United States in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, which caused the death of 168 people, the worst act of terrorism on US soil up to that point. <br /> <br /> The film is, as far as I know, the first time that an important branch of the entertainment media mentions and elaborates the novel of the rural militia "The Turner Diaries" of the late William L. Pierce, since then has become a classic underground clandestine. "The Turner Diaries" predicts an internal and utterly disastrous terrorist attack, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, on a federal US government facility that was the FBI building in Washington <br /> station Dallas radio KGAB talk show host Barry Champlain, Eric Bogosian, is the most voted show in the Dallas listening area and is now about to become national. Barry gets his high score with his sharp wit and violent behavior when on the air. Facing all corners and not lowering problems, no matter how unpopular or taboo, made Barry the most listened to and hated man on the radio. Barry being a showman in the heart and not thinking that his speech can lead to violence, he maintains his abrasiveness towards the listeners who call, while his evaluation rises to rank. But there are those of the listening audience, mostly ultra-right type, who don't take themselves too kindly with his attitude on the face. One of them decides to take things in hand at Barry's expense. <br /> <br /> Performance of Eric Bogosian's Powerhouse in the role of the tragic Barry Champlain who crossed the line from entertainment to harsh reality in his radio actions. Thinking that he is not so important to be sought after and killed for his opinions in the air that his enemies do not like, he discovered only too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to make it out. Also in the movie "Talk Radio" there is a very young Alic Baldwin like the boss of Barry Dan who tries to make him soften his tone but in the end he goes hand in hand with his talk show style since he is killing the competition without realizing that in the end it is he who ends up being killed. <br /> <br /> Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women in Barry's life, his ex-wife Ellen and now lover and talk show producer Laura that Barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing them both at the same time. The 1988 movie "Talk Radio" is so far ahead of its time that, even if you watch it now in 2005, you still think it's too scary to be shown to an overly sensitive and delicate American audience.
