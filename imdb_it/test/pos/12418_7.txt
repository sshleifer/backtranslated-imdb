I got Monster Man in a box set of three films where I mainly wanted the other two, but I had a lot of fun. It combines horror and comedy with a reasonable effect, aided considerably by Eric Jungman's decent performance as the brilliant protagonist, Justin Urich as his hole friend and Aimee Brooks as the love interest. The film is quite predictable and digs ideas from a series of other films, but it remains fun everywhere, with some good macabre blood thrown inside. Of course he doesn't live up to the classic gory comedies, but this is still good. Director Michael Davis also runs one or two scary scenes, like in the bathroom or bar. The film is watchable everywhere if a bit messy and written and for me it has lost a bit towards the end when the title Monster Man starts to look like a member of Slipknot and the film tries to become more horror but it's not t distorted or quite convincing. Even the last moments are a bit weak. Yet, despite the lack of a lot of suspense and general nonsense, this is a good example of unpretentious comedy, often clearly splatter that should become attached to fans of the same.
