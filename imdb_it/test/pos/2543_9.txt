This is a wonderful film, about a soul of Ale. This is a journey into the heart of Ale. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. It makes the scenes talk. Especially on silent scenes. Ale's window is fantastic. The scenes in which he lies in bed are one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing. It's been a long time since I've watched a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say that this film shows that age does not matter to your soul. As well as the soul of Ale. <br /> <br /> Living in Turkey I don't care about the other side of NY. This is a universal scene that you can see anywhere in the world. As for my most universal opinion of anything else. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. Otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Baris.Sentuna
