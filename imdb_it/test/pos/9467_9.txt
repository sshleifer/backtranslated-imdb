This film is a great film, however it is, since most films are highly predictable. The biggest highlight of the film is obviously the main character Amanda Bynes, which is absolutely gorgeous and fun. She is one of the very few people in the world able to use all the 53 muscles of her face to make the strangest and most heart-breaking faces ever created. It is good for children and contains superior masculine nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. All in all, they did a good job updating an old classic, and it deserves to rest on the film's support along with O and 10 things I hate about you. The other actors also do a good job in many of their first debuts.
