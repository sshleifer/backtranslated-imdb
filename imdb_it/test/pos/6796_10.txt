ccmovieman-1 must be, as the New York Times reviewer who preferred the Janis Joplin Big Brother and the Holding Company album for the Beatles album "White" just released was called, wicked or crazy. National Velvet is a great film. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is fantastic, and I can't even discern an accent, much less one too. His performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly fascinating. The rest of the cast is superb, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> Although the dialogue is shy or sentimental, I suggest that cc has dined too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern sincere emotions and human interactions. There was a time when people actually thought and spoke that way. Not that this film doesn't have a slight hint of magic permeating through it. This is the reason for telling the story. You could also criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Black Stallion (the other great horse film) or a thousand other films for action and dialogue that seem richer than life real. No friend of mine, National Velvet resists his belief firmly in himself, with his tongue firmly not in his cheek. Something that today's tired filmmakers find almost impossible to recreate.
