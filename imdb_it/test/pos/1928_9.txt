It happened to me by accident. I was at my friends' house and he had just started watching it, so I sat down thinking that we would shoot in the wind while playing in the background. However, in a few seconds I was immersed in this docu-drama, and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and without saying a word. <br /> <br /> I never knew the story of the first solo around the world yacht race, not to mention the tragic events of a man's attempt against the odds, which he intended to be his redemption for all his misfortunes in life, but eventually he ends up becoming an example of them. Not knowing anything about the story, I looked at it with the same fervor as I imagine those who were reading about the race when it was really happening, swallowed by what was happening and eager for more information, hoping that the only lover was going to pull out against the odds and beat the pros, which makes the shocking twists of the story even more tragic, I felt like I was living the story. <br /> <br /> The story is told with great care and the interviewees clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which offers great insights, but it is also pleasantly contrasted by the archive footage of the interviews at the time of the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of solitary sailors are also optimally used, and the insights into the minds of the sailors and the loneliness that plagued them was superb. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this story is no longer known or has been turned into a movie, but also grateful. We are grateful to have this documentary-drama to tell the story of those who knew the man, instead of a bit corny film adaptation, and grateful to have caught this gem of a movie by pure chance. <br /> <br /> It is a must see, whether you like documentaries or not.
