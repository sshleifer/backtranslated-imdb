there is one of the best films directed by andrzej wajda, that story told of the young writer looking for his place after a second war (he survives the German camp). Excellent real atmosphere (the action goes on the field for the displaced), main hero (played by one of the best Polish actors daniel olbrychski) finally falls in love, but unfortunately his lady was killed. There was a beautiful scene, when he talks to an American soldier and says (on his girlfriend's death) "nothing happens, you are simply shooting us now ... his soul condition has been destroyed. 10/10
