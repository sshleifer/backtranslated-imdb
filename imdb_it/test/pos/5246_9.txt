John Wayne's first lead role shocked me. In letterbox style on AMC, I had to check and make sure I got the right date. Sure enough, this 1930s movie was made using a 55mm wide screen process. Apart from that, it presents some of the most gritty and realistic films of the West trekking I've seen. The wagons, the men and the animals are really lowered on a cliff with rope. The trees are cut by burly men - and burly women - so the train can move 10 more feet. The Indians are not the city fanatics of the "handsome boy" who portrayed them later; they are the real deal. A river that runs through in a rainstorm is so realistic, it must be real (actually, I realized that director Raoul Walsh almost lost the whole cast during this sequence). I could smell the wet canvas. Every day is an agony. The various sub-frames are forgettable, but the film as a whole is not. I can't think of another title that can beat The Big Trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail of Oregon. Good boy.
