I've seen most of the Tarzan episodes. Certainly the nominal X with O'Keeffe and Bo Derek, which is totally deplorable. <br /> <br /> I have seen this version several times since it was initially shown. <br /> <br /> The whole cast was memorable parts, great acting of the Ape sequences. <br /> <br /> Last night I saw the same on a Spanish station and on some French windows all in Spanish. <br /> <br /> As for Hudson he doesn't want Andie's voice did nothing until the end. He saw the newspapers and could hire a dialog coach. <br /> <br /> It seems silly that a story about monkeys and a man raised by them speaks meaninglessly that Hudson attacked Andie. The plot in the film was that she was an American cousin. The last time I checked Carolina was in the United States. <br /> <br /> She was beautiful in the cinema and her eyes and her beautiful hair, alabaster skin disoriented all of us males. It was not necessary to resort to Bo's level. <br /> <br /> She has remained a LADY for the rest of her career and should watch this movie (half of her life before) as a starting point. His performance, sincerity, made this film pleasant, believable that a half-wild man could ascertain his inner beauty. <br /> <br /> Great point of delivery for Sir Richardson, he stole the film.
