Originally it was only a part of an enormous epic. The year 1905 describing the 1905 revolution, Potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the Potemkin's crew in the port of Odessa. The film opens with the crew protesting maggot meat and the captain who orders the dissidents to execute. A revolt takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crew member is brought ashore to lie in state. When the citizens gather on a huge stairway that overlooks the port, Tsarist troops appear and descend the steps breaking the crowd. A naval squadron is sent to resume the Potemkin, but the moment the ships enter the range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass. Eisenstein's not historically accurate ending is indefinitely, which indicates that this was the seed of the subsequent Bolshevik revolution that would have flourished in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: Men and Maggots, Drama on the Quarterdeck, An Appeal from the Dead, The Odessa Steps and Meeting the Squadron. Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the genius level. Not wanting to make a historical drama, Eisenstein used visual plot to give the film a newsreel appearance, so that the viewer perceives that he is listening to an electrifying and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by The Battle of Algiers of Pontecorvo. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on typing, or on the casting of non-professionals who had remarkable physical appearances. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from Potemkin. This technique is then used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin, no individual is chosen as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as editing - editing and selecting short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. D. W. Griffith also used editing, but no one mastered it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic shootings of the crew sleeping on their hammocks are completed by the graceful swinging of the tables suspended by the chains in the galley. On the contrary, the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their anger with injustice. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. The breaking of a dish bearing the words "Give us this day our daily bread" means the beginning of the end. This technique was used last year at Marienbad. Furthermore, when the ship's surgeon is thrown to one side, his pince-nez dangles from the rigging. It was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the worm-infested meat. This sequence links the punishment to the corruption of the tsarist era. <br /> <br /> The best known sequence in the film, and perhaps throughout the history of cinema, is The Odessa Steps. The wide expanse of the passages is full of hundreds of extras. Rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit, but the visual images of the deaths of a few will last forever in the mind of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The angular shots of the boots and running legs that descend the steps are intelligently accentuated with long shadows threatening from a sun at the top of the steps. The rhythm of the sequence deliberately varies between the marching soldiers and some civilians who gather the courage to beg them to stop. A close-up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being hit by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of Bonnie's cashier in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the Tsarist regime. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother leads to a pram digging the steps in a sequence that was copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent, by Terry Gilliam in Brazil and by Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles, in order to identify what was probably just a five-second event. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those who are already engaged and propaganda for the unconverted. It boils with fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent Tsarist regime. Its greatest impact was on the film students who borrowed and only slightly improved the techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.
