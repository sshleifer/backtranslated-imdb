I was happy to find out that at least now this movie is starting to get the appreciation it deserves (just look at those votes). Action not top notch like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: excellent script, good actors with a working chemistry and a director who knows what he wants (unfortunately, this was the director Harlin's last good movie: "Deep Blue Sea" managed to reach the "OK rollercoaster-ride", but "Cutthroat Island, and in particular," Driven "are worth a flop!" Personally I think the turn- off at the box office may have been the "Woman as an action star" - to me. Well, give her an opportunity, because Davis offers an above-average performance and, after all, this film doesn't focus so much on the "feminine" -side, but instead on good action, buddyism (Jackson as sidekick is given a lot of space here, plus his share of action- and about a thousand murderous bars!) and on the plot (by Shane Black, the writer of "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout", the last of which is a film on many levels very similar to this ... i the theme, the intelligent plot, even as good and undervalued!) Overall: if one has not yet seen this, do not forget to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night!
