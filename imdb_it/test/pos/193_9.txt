As in a circle, the film shows the starting point, the image of the cranes crossing a Muscovite sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire the maximum possible fulfillment. <br /> <br /> At the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the intoxicating crane. It seems they may be able to live by their dreams. <br /> <br /> But man is not a bird. Life draws its rules, from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - even making a supreme effort. War breaks out, and without much hesitation Boris joins the front to fulfill his patriotic duty. He can't even say goodbye to Veronica, because he arrives late at the collection point from which the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by a cheering crowd, all his attempts to attract Boris's attention must inevitably fail. Boris is eventually killed in the war, without Veronica being aware of it for the moment. His brother Mark, an energetic musician, who obtained exemption from military service from corruption, is eager to take his place. Veronica initially resists, but on a frightening night of bombing ends up being a victim of her charm. A marriage takes place, which is never accepted by the family. <br /> <br /> Soon the feelings of guilt take hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris' return is the only thing she really wants. So it alleviates his bad conscience and his despair from selfless work in a field hospital. <br /> <br /> When the war is finally over, once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers to cheer up the victorious soldiers. Again Veronica is among them, forcing her to make her way through a wall of bodies. In his hand he is carrying a bouquet of flowers, until he finally has to give it away to complete the strangers, because one of the homecomers has just lost his hopes confirming the sad certainty of Boris's death. <br /> <br /> Once again the cranes invade the sky, drawing their rebellious lines. But now Veronica is watching them alone, and the expression in her eyes is different. He had to accept the impossibility of living according to pre-established plans, of following the guidelines of your dreams. For all humans there are nothing but helpless puppets that hang from the inscrutable strings of destiny. <br /> <br />
