"Please don't kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It is difficult to describe this show. It's like a dramatic crime. Where the bad cop is a donkey. Literally. What's great about the show are some of Assy's perfectly horrible one-liners. Digging out gems like "Adios, Blimp", Assy Mcgee offers some great laughter points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag on at a slow pace, making it almost difficult to watch. This is definitely the kind of show you will love or hate, there is virtually no intermediary. It is not the best show of {Adult Swim}, but it has some strengths. It is worth looking at just to see if you like it. I know I did it.
