For those who have access to the BBC or CBC, this has turned out to be spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, this is a show rebuilt from scratch. But in the case of Dr Who, they saved the best parts. I can't believe I'm saying it but ... this is by far the best Dr Who. This has none of the low production values ​​and sometimes a slow arrangement of the old show. The acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new doctor is easily up to the great Tom Baker, and the screenwriter (former head of the QAF) seems to have made even minor characters come alive. <br /> <br /> I know ... I'm gushing. .but this should be on the list of all sci-fi enthusiasts. I just don't know why he didn't come here ... Whatever you do ... if you've ever loved Dr Who or science fiction ... see this !!!
