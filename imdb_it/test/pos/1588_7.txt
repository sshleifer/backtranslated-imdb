Luchino Visconti became famous in the world after his wonderful production THE LEOPARD. Film fans have known the style of the director who presented himself as one of the new post-war realists, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thought and, consequently, expressed them as an artist. However, when applied to this film, DEATH TO VENICE based on the novel by Thomas Mann, is a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> The entire film is, at first sight, so unique, so psychological and so influenced by the various thoughts of an artist (director and protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach) that it seems to be "unwatchable" for many viewers . Therefore, such opinions on the film have risen as "too slow", "unbearable" or "infinite boredom". Why? The reason seems to reside in a meaningful vision that is widespread today: "THE GOOD FILM IS PARALLELY AT THE CHALLENGE OF ACTION". Here, it would be appropriate to say: "THE GOOD FILM IS PARALLEL NO ACTION". In fact, everyone would be able to say a sentence about the content of the entire film and this would be enough. Everything we find in DEATH IN VENICE has a sense of vague reality full of depth and superficiality that seem significant for every single moment. And that's when we see the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the train station, when we are given his intensely emotional memories. The intuition in his decadent mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to continue watching the film is to do his best to feel and experiment rather than see and think. Everything is destined to fade, to wither like flowers on the lawn when their time comes. In other words, everything has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, it is unlikely that you will get the idea of ​​the movie after only one viewing. It must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open. Whether you like it or not ... this is a different story, very personal. <br /> <br /> Artistic values ​​are the factor that is evident at first sight and stays with us everywhere. Beauty as something very significant for the main character who seems to come and leave; to rest as something that is going so badly and that comes from him in the most unexpected way; feeling that he finds in a teenager who appears as a model of all dreams and desires, as a forbidden fruit of the vanishing homosexual lust. Costume designer Piero Tosi does a splendid job in this film. Through a lot of wonderful wardrobe provides us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place. The director of photography Pasqualino De Santis offers us a terrifying visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes. And in the background comes the music of Gustav Mahler, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to introduce the character. <br /> <br /> The shows are first-rate, especially from Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants to rest after a hard artistic work and tries in vain to find him in the crowded Venice. For most of the film, we have a great vision of his thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaustion and despair. Although sometimes depressing, it keeps us on the right track to the end, without losing hope for the less tragic end ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) describes the model of the decadent homosexual desire but also a model of beauty and purity that seems to last long enough In short ... "Adieu Tadzio, it was all too short" says the protagonist. A great, though highly controversial, work is done by Mark Burns as a sort of "super ego" Alfred with which Gustav polemizes about ideals such as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. How much Freudian, yet how dangerous the idea could be! And always present in the Italian artistic films of the time, Silvana Mangano - here as an elegant Polish lady, Tadzio's mother. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments truly constitute the film's strengths; however, not all spectators will find them unforgettable. They, like the entire bizarre film, require a lot of effort to get on the right path in the director's individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche. Among these scenes, I consider the sequence of the beach rather important, in particular the way in which Gustav observes Tadzio. The physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to approach ... I also appreciate the shots when Gustav is sitting in a gondola and the view of the city moves in the background - as memorable as it can lift the existential thoughts of transfer. We are not the people, a sort of "passangers" in the world, in the journey that is life. <br /> <br /> In the end, I have to tell you something important. I found DEATH IN VENICE extremely strange until I started to look deeper into what the director is really trying to convey. Then, each scene turned out to be significant in its interpretation with which you don't have to agree (I disagree with nothing of the main character), but you should at least tolerate it as something the author wanted to say badly. Listen to his voice, give him some words on a page of reality ... <br /> <br /> So, there is a long way to go to understand the film, since not many films like that were made in 1971 and have been made now. Paradoxically, it seems that we are all required to have the right feelings about this film in the long run, similar to what we are all forced to experience once a strange, inevitable, generally unexpected reality that death is ... 7 / 10
