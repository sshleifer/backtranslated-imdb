Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up in Mel Brooks films that weren't necessarily the "bravest" ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (I saw those, of course, though not so frequently now), but those destined for "the whole family", Spaceballs and this film. At the time I knew I wasn't seeing a great art, but just a campy, a bit stupid, but still worthy of a laugh about Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. But to call it a family film in inverted commas means that a) adults can really enjoy it as much as children, if not more because of the little jokes and silly vulgarities, and b) once a child sees it, when they revisit it, like I have some times, it is still fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time. It's a comedy that is not only full of jokes about Robin Hood's films and other films (Padrino naturally, as well as small mentions for other films of modern times), but which also refers to Brooks's films; this is a filmmaker who is not too funny even in his style. <br /> <br /> Basic story - Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns home from the crusades to see the danger things with King Richard gone, and so goes on to reclaim his land and, of course, stealing the rich to feed the poor. Along the way he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), the bosses go with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the sheriff, and of course they continue to piss for Maid Marian's love. This, of course, is the usual clothesline for Brooks to allow the comedy to escape into the scenes, and while sometimes a joke may not work or could become stale in a repeated view, so much so that it is hard not to giggle. Furthermore, a couple of bits are among the best in any Brooksfilm, such as Godfather's bite (Dom DeLouise at his best), Brooks's cameo like the rabbi, Lewis and Chappelle's acting turns and an endless string of line quotes and a couple of ironic songs. Some are obvious, yes, some of them come from the pages of Blazing Saddles, of course, but is it a good time for the right crowd? Surely, and for parents who grew up in the 70s, Brooks works, it's a fantastic way to introduce young people to his work through this (even suggestive and such jokes are not R-rated, all in good fun).
