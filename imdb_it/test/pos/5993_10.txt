One of the two best films of the year. A well shot film, well written, well put together with an exceptional cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had a great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. Theresa Lee plays her comic role well (although very similar to a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be the Chinese born overseas surrounded by native HKers.), And I found myself rooting for innovative scenes and explosives, something I haven't done since 1. fan fans have taken control of alt.asian-movies and 2. John woo's Hardboiled. Of course, the ending was expected, but I feel better cheering for the cops of a group of young gang members. Very funny.
