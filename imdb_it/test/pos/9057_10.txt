This is really a great movie. Full of love and humor, it forces the public to really care about the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness managed to assemble a cast of great players, a small miracle for a first film. No doubt, they have been moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz brings the film with its underlying intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, maddening, yet totally lovable like Grace. Even a big turning point by Karen Black (it's good to see her again on screen) as the mad but sympathetic mother of Grace. There is a cut of wit in everything, allowing us the relief of laughter in the face of the pain of life. The acting is impeccable, the editing is tight, the direction is inspired and the music creates a background suited to the mood. Given the current Hollywood Blockbuster madness, full of big budgets, big names, car accidents and special effects, 'Max & Grace' is a refreshing departure. Give yourself a treat and watch this movie.
