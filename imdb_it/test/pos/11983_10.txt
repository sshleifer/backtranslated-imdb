I went to see this movie because there was Joaquim de Almeida. Joaquim had a rather small part, so it was nice that I liked the film by myself. In fact, I loved it! <br /> <br /> The film revolves around two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, retired guy, and Louie ... well, Louie no. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to let him come to Albert's place for a while. Louie has just been released from prison. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood and, of course, when they do something together, there are problems and Albert is always falling. <br /> <br /> The action of the film is based on the adventures that derive from Louie's visit. On The Run is a chronicle of crazy whimsical situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and screenwriter, Joseph Minion (After Hours), do not always take you where you expect to go. There are twists that add depth to this film. Obviously there is a lot of comedy, but even here there is a lot of humor. <br /> <br /> Here too there are good performances. Albert is delightfully played by Michael Imperioli. It is becoming quite well known in these days of the HBO series, The Sopranos. <br /> <br /> Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who imbues his character with an amiable and childlike quality. (no matter what he does, you just have to love Louie!). <br /> <br /> Both of these actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperioli, you'll want to hug him and bring him home to his mom. Ventimiglia, well, you won't know if you should slap him or take him home (and NOT his mother!). <P> <br /> <br /> There are also other prominent performances. Rita's character is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The public adored her. Talking to the others who saw the film was fun to discuss if Albert and Louie were their favorites from those two. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can't say that it is. Many times I wanted the director to have a bigger budget to work with. There were some scenes that screamed for greater budgetary freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work with and I think you'll see a movie that will make you stand up and notice it.) <br /> <br /> The ending sequence was a bit of a budget victim. Still, budget or no budget, the final screen, in my opinion, has brought together the talent of actor and director in a memorable and emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
