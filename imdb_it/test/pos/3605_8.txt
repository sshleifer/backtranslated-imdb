Captain Corelli's mandolin is not an Oscar candidate but it was quite good. I have to admit that Ms. Cruz can really act. You perform very well. In fact, she makes her boyfriend Tom in the drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was returning to his origins as an Italian. However, I learned something. Another chapter of the Horrors of Nazi Germany, the numerous Italian soldiers killed during the period in which they surrendered to the allies and the eventual surrender of Germany.
