This film is about a deadly poison contained in small glass globes used to kill. This is apparently done to hide a spying intent to steal the plans for a new American bomber. Now much of this plot has been repeated in other films by Chan, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. Furthermore, it was used for the first time in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE - everyone had the glass globes exploding - an element of the plot that had obviously been abused. It was interesting in Murder on New York, but from these later films it was rather pass√©. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the rest of the film was cool and the plot worked very well - with an elegant ending where, of course, the culprit is revealed. However, no aircraft could fly like this, especially in the 1940s. Such extreme dives and rapid ascents were rather foolish by this already obsolete plan. <br /> <br /> By the way, in a small role as a goalkeeper you will see Frank Coghlan Jr. - the same actor who played Billy Batson in the serial CAPTAIN MARVEL. According to IMDb, Coughlan is 93 and has retired from the film industry.
