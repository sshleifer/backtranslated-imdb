It's about getting what you want when you want it. And the message of Bluebeard's Eighth WIfe is to be careful about what you want, up to what you want for your desires. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard stories about what happens when your sexual frustration is not raised and part of your anatomy turns blue. Apart from misogynist pirates, Cooper plays a very rich man who is very used to getting what he wants whenever he wants, learning only too late that he is not what he expected and he never learned his lesson until he meets the gritty Claudette Colbert. Through a convoluted business affair (in the soul and in practice), he ends up ruining it / buying it with the intent of putting her to bed, but she won't (literally) and frustrates him at every corner, corner and room, and attraction Tourism. <br /> <br /> The film has a definite French sensibility, which means that it has strong double meanings and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge that you are not used to (and maybe you don't like to see) in Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason why I watched the film is because they are "nice" actors, and the central point of this film is that they are unlikely people, or at least nice people who have developed unlikely traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on its own terms, you will find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film ... and the satisfaction, as we have said, is what it is about. A film like that with a cast like that only appears once in a ... ummm ... blue moon.
