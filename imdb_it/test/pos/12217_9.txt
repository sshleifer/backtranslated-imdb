It is not often that a TV series captures me right away; a recent download from Surface pilot made me glue in my place for the entire duration of the episode, after which I immediately started a feverish search to learn all I could about this wonderful series. To my regret, I discovered that it had been canceled after only 15 episodes, despite his strong grades and extremely favorable reviews. Such a sin. <br /> <br /> Since then, I've acquired the remaining episodes and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best TVs I've ever watched. Simply fantastic from beginning to end, and as another commentator commented, I really liked how they ended each episode with a huge ending. I imagine to see him every week that I would have screamed with tension and only fascinated, desperately waiting for the next episode to be published. Growing up, I always felt it was what the first serial films did, ending up with a huge cliffhanger to bring the crowd back to the theater for the next episode. <br /> <br /> Well, it seems for some reason or another the seeds decided to kill him, and apparently the people behind the show must have seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things definitely get worse. I would not say that the episodes actually become BORING but many elements of the plot become a little more clich√© and, I must say, the final episode really made me feel cheated. I just hope the creators of the show had a good opportunity. The only show * SOLO * that made me feel like it was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which resonated enormously, feeling very "true", full of feeling and made from the heart. Surface was a great series, and maybe someday, some wealthy TV fans will see all the excitement of the show's cancellation and report this show. One can hope, at least. :)
