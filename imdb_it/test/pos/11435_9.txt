When I went to the cinema, I didn't expect much. I knew nothing about this movie, but it was the only movie I could see, because I was in a small town then. So I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "The stars that are not there" is a journey through the new industrial China and honestly proves it! You see most of the times the bad places in China and see what really happens with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad, but hopefully people. He is the naive Italian boy who can't believe what he sees. She is a translator from China who misses her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny but always poetic! A wonderful film with wonderful actors! So only one star is missing!
