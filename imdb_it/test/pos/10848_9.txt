This BBC series is surprisingly fun. I had only seen a few minutes before I knew I had to own it and watch it again with all my friends. I would not recommend it to anyone, modest, but almost everyone will like it - from snob cinema to entertainment-hungry masses. The protagonist is a lesbian, but it's still worth looking at if it's not your thing. <br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling is incredible in a leading role that drives her into an incredible array of emotions and situations, some of a bizarre nature. No one who has seen this series would have ever said that he cannot act. She makes us laugh, cry, light up and beat her brow in amazement. <br /> <br /> You can't really compare this story with something else. It is not a style or plot rehash. It's entirely his beast, a comedy part, a historical drama, an erotic, a training tale, a musical and more. <br /> <br /> I must commend the BBC for making this story. I can't imagine anyone in the United States (overly prudent and formidable) ever doing it. So stop reading it and go buy it.
