Pixote is headed with just a shred of sentimentality. Yet, more than imagining Hector Babenco he owes some of his cinematographic costume designers to this neo-realist style film by Vittorio De Sica, in particular Shoeshine (that film, as with Pixote, takes place mainly in a prison for children). And yet, while I might still prefer the De Sica film, if we decided to decide between the two, it's so close because it's, it's not a play on words, like choosing between two children. Both are wonderful works of drama, and with Pixote Babenco has an extra touch and a harrowing quality to deal with, in the sense that it is not filmed in conditions subsequent to a world war. So it was in Brazil - you would see it with a little more inspiration and awe in the City of God, perhaps in some of the same localities - and these children were in the streets before and after the film was made. Some are not alive about 20 years later, as far as anyone knows. <br /> <br /> The "star" street boy, pre-adolescent Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a young man without a father or really a family who will look for him and who is among dozens of other boys and street delinquents in a reformatory for children. The conditions could not be much worse and made even more unbearable by the fact that two children are killed one by one by some cause of duty guard. There is a revolt and an escape, and in the middle of the film we find Pixote with some other young people, including Lilica, a practical transvestite, not yet 18, and become pickpockets, drug dealers, anything to get by. None of this, I should repeat, is shown with a kind of boastful sincerity - certainly you would never see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis directing this kind of images in a million years - yet there is emotional honesty for everything exactly because nothing is trivialized. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene is meaningful to show how fragile Pixote lives, and how he can be killed or somehow die at any time, and therefore without even reaching puberty, yet he must be level of those around him, who are a little older (though not entirely) and become things that will haunt this person forever. Despite the use of Babener of tender and funeral music and of one or two scenes with people who cry a lot, nothing feels obligated. As with De Sica, perhaps more, given the constant conditions of the street children of San Paolo and Rio, he is a natural director of children, and coax came out of Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and others a truly excellent work that provides the right touches of the "cinematographic" drama (which is not so real that it becomes documentary, which is not a bad thing to say) and also the subtlety in some scenes. <br /> <br /> Pixote may not be as well known as Brazilian films of the 21st century that look back to the horrors of Rio, or even to neorealist films, but it should be. Anyone wishing to have a good, difficult vision of what it was like should look for it in a library or other and immerse themselves in what is the best foreign film of 1981.
