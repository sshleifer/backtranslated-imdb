Despite its pedigree, the most interesting things in this series are not the animatronics or the puppets, which, although they are fascinating, are little more than presentations, at least in the story I saw, A STORY SHORT. Actually, I hate, even if I have to admit it, the main pleasure of the program lies in that older art, storytelling. <br /> <br /> John Hurt, in Rowley Birken QC-mode, grotesque, medieval make-up, tells a story about the narration, sitting by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter's day, hungry and poor, he sees another beggar thrown out of the royal kitchen by the bad cook. The Teller story deceives the latter by giving them an excellent soup. Furious, the cook begs the king for permission to boil the villain, but, satisfied with the spirit of Story Teller, the monarch offers him a truce: for 100 nights, he must tell the king a new story: if he fails, he will deliver to the cook. <br /> <br /> The story may be old, but it is told with great enthusiasm. Anthony Minghella's screenplay is extraordinarily dramatic (as befits a playwright), witty, and with some disturbing concerns below fun, such as fears for themselves, or the culturally self-generating power of storytelling, linked to continuation of ideological power. For a program aimed at children, it is extraordinarily self-reflexive (with little nonsense about the fact that cinema is the new oral culture); despite the Americanized style, there is a fascinating sense of medieval bustle, its grotesque and its arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.
