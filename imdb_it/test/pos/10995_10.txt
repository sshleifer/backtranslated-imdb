I really liked the story of Gabrielle Burton of a mysterious gift and how it affects them in the past and in the present. The talented Burton family of five film sisters, an author mother and a dancer dad offer a fascinating plot, respectfully edited for clarity, memorably chosen songs and a wonderfully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry while the characters' vulnerability invited me into their predicamant. There was a farcical attitude about this work with moving subtitles of innocent wonder. Fanatastic
