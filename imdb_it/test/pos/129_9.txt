This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study of the ways in which people react to tradition (it reminds me of the novels of William Faulkner). <br /> <br /> The characters feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are supposed to take and look for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them away altogether. But as the story develops, the two wives, trapped in marriages without love, get together. Drawing on the strength of their friendship and love, they dare to abandon their roles. <br /> <br /> They discovered that living within their traditions is not a life at all, it is a kind of living death: without passion, without true connection with others, without fulfillment. Although they know that there will be a price to pay for their rebellion and freedom, it is a much cheaper price than the sacrifice required by a comfortable and predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful, the acting wonderfully. Perfect neighbor!
