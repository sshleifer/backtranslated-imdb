This film is a warning to all the people who surf the internet on a typical day at the office. My warning is: don't reveal too much about yourself, 2 pay attention to who you cross !! , there are spies on this internet thing. I thought it was so scary what that combination of men and women did with poor Angela Bennett, I didn't realize that someone could take their own life with a click of this mouse Angela, I thought I had done an exceptional job with Jack Delvin and that horrible my question is, why does that computer make that noise when it works? like a snap, mine doesn't do this or this. This film also tells you that there is fraud on this network. Why can't Angela do the program to destroy viruses in a CyberCafe? I also thought that, like all computers, the transfer speed to disk was slow and correctly portrayed in this film when you save the program on the floppy disk, the bar slowly moved !!! I also really liked Angela's house at the beginning of the film Why didn't anyone believe Angela ??
