John Landis was really superb when he directed Michael Jackson's THRILLER as a short film. Sure, it's trivial, the dialogue is terrible and everything seems too trivial, but it's perfect for nothing. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date are at the cinema to see the latest horror movie. When everything becomes a bit too graphic for the date, it goes away. Michael follows. On the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. Here, start. <br /> <br /> The thriller dance is incredible. It's full of those Jackson movements, as well as memorable zombie moves. It does not seem rushed, nor too long. The whole thing looks like a movie and it's actually pretty scary. Sure, it's one of the most famous music videos of all time, and it's probably also the biggest music video ever made. <br /> <br /> Overall: take it seriously. Those 13 minutes will be among the best ever spent staring at a screen. (5/5)
