I know that Chill Wills usually played the old adorable guys in the West. But his role in this segment is something I have long remembered. Wills could be a nasty villain. Yes, Burgess Meredith's fall was correct! That look in Hepplewhite's eye! It expressed swine greed, ignorance and the threat of violence all at once. A performance, I think. <br /> <br /> The segment was also good. Question: is the small black bag not able to cure alcoholism? I imagine it happened, somehow, with Fall. But the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure, if any, as quickly as possible to Hepplewhite. <br /> <br /> There is a moment that is annoying but also necessary. And it's something that seems to repeat itself in these segments of the Night Gallery. This is Serling's constant need for Sermonize. Because that's what we got, once again, with Dr. Fall. I don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black market and all his miracles or not being the one to stop Fall from preaching the benefit of the bag for humanity, all while rubbing Hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud and, therefore, he begged for Hepplewhite to hit him. But as I said, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we could not have seen Wills' performance discussed above. All done without moving a muscle or uttering a word.
