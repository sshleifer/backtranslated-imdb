I was about ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the "DRIVE IN" at the Drive in Long Beach club. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD" from which I can never forget for some reason, but what I remember are the different scenes that have left an imprint in my mind forever. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of the movie even though it has always seemed like we saw the movie. From time to time he throws away the years that I would have looked for in the rental shops and from time to time I would have checked on the web and for some reason it seems that it is never available or that nobody knows what movie I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If only you knew if and if it was available I'd like to buy that movie. If anyone is aware of your availability, please inform me.
