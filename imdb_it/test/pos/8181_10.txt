This story documenting the rise of the first Chinese emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive film production in Chinese history. <br /> <br /> Worth every penny. A visually dazzling cinematography, an overwhelming soundtrack and extraordinary characters make this film one of the best epic films ever made (foreign or otherwise). Please don't miss the chance to see it on the big screen.
