I have to grow old because I've been riveted to this film since the first time I saw it. I'm looking at him again right now on HBO. It is a very simple film about 2 people who fall in love after discovering that the couple had an affair. The plot is very thin, but the actors played very well in this film. In the mix of Kristen Scott Thomas running for the congress and Harrison Ford as a policeman of Internal Affairs, these two meet, in unfortunate circumstances, and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Perfect fit. One thing I can't understand, this film has a budget of $ 68 million. Had they been spent? Harrison Ford's plane crash or salary?
