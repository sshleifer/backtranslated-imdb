Don't watch this movie while, or immediately after, eating. <br /> <br /> That said, Begotten will stay with you for the rest of your life, whether you like it or not. Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing but the man who spasm from the ground (to paraphrase the title sequence / introduction), this will probably contain the most intense and macabre images you can ever see in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue, only image after image that describes the cycle of life. The combination of rigid black and white photography and some truly gruesome background sounds work to bring the manufacturer's message home. <br /> <br /> The film begins with God (played as a blindfolded and obviously crazy man) who cuts his bust with a razor and then dies in his own filth. After her death, Mother Nature emerges from her corpse to imbue herself with her blood and seed and give birth to Man, represented by a larva of a human who is convulsed on earth. <br /> <br /> The landscape is a sterile waste, populated by mammoth enveloped humanoids that eventually happen on Mother Nature and Man. After a series of violent scenes that describe the rape of Nature and the destruction of Man, these humanoids continue to hit the remains of corpses in the ground, and the cycle of life begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rented this from Blockbuster one night, based on the cover and hype content, but this is definitely not a Blockbuster type movie. Don't expect fiction, dialogues or fists drawn. These are intense images based on an obscure subject. <br /> <br /> Give this movie some high marks for movies and audio, but I don't think I'll watch it too often, if again. I like my dark and unique films, but this is exponentially more than I expected.
