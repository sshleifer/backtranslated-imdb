as a former television editor, I can say that this is as authentic as possible. He even brought the Letterman producer (thought as a source) to resign (eventually) in real life. Letterman was indignant (OK, so a foolish thing is that he threw softball to a round of tires on his estate, total fabrication) but the main information is hilarious, from the stupid war for Letterman once he decided to leave NBC in Leno problems with an agent who was not ready for the big time, but who let the show run (almost as a disastrous exit) from his famous loyalty. If any of you children do not understand the reason why Letterman is jealous to date, see this tape.
