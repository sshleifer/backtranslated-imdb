Wow! I just have to say that this show is fantastic! I fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of ​​the show is very original and very relaxing! It is also a pleasure to watch the performance of the two adorable leader ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are simply wonderful! I am above all a great admirer of Lauren Graham! it's not just a pretty face, it's also a "monster" of an actress! I'm not saying that Alexis is not a fantastic actress ... I would love to appreciate Lauren! however it is a real pleasure to see them on the screen, "saving" with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
