While in one country, Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali combined forces to create the benchmark of short-range cinematic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney and his collaborator Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the more important than the first synchronized cartoons (it was revealed that this was not the first, unlike other reports). It is also one of the most successful and simplistic of Mickey's short films (still in a silent film mode - the only sounds are small irs and beeps from Mickey and animals). It also passes quite quickly for its journey of less than ten minutes. But in these minutes we have the immediate sense of how much Disney has with his characters and how the new use of sound changes the way his creation uses animals as musical instruments. There is no story to talk about, just random things that happen and occur because of Mickey (err, Steamboat Willie) on this river boat. And like Mickey's best shorts, his lack of speech acts as an advantage. It's a must see if you haven't seen it as a child, but if you have it it might still be worth another look.
