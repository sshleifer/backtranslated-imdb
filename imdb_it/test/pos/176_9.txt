Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked by YouTube, I used the same sources to see a Technicolor remake done for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the previous black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gag-like ones when one of the skeletal band players constantly hits a wrong note or when one loses his head and takes another one out or when one dances with the other with a part of that other vanished - they are as fun as the previous short. It gets a little repetitive towards the end. However, Skeleton Frolics is worth seeing for any animation enthusiast who wants to compare it to the previous Silly Symphony.
