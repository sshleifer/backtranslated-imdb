This is one of those movies when you look at it you wonder if it's documentary or fiction. After the film, Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the film has a script. <br /> <br /> Bahrani's camera is silent, it makes no sense, it almost erases the director from the film for purpose, the background is not organized to make the image look pretty, but don't get me wrong; there is a lot of preparation for this film. Starting from the personal level, being part of the environment, being ignored when you film. <br /> <br /> The main character is a 'real' actor in every sense. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank all the crew of this film, showing us another country within New York. I highly recommend it if you like other people's stories. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
