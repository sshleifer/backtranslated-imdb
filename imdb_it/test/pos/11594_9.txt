The director and co-writer Alejandro Amenabar has not made it easy for the viewers of his tense story, a little too long but very disturbing, based exactly on a Spanish man's struggle to get assisted suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is compelling and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater. <br /> <br /> With the award-winning Canadian film "The Barbarian Invasions", people have seen a family together with a brotherhood of devoted friends addressing the desire of a beloved, though irascible, to end his life. In that film, the focus of attention suffered from progressive and incurable cancer and his descent into a terminal phase was rapid. Emotional as the scenes, death was inevitable - the question was how kind it could be done through the urged intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For over two decades he was a quadriplegic due to a diving accident. (Very sharp spectators may perceive a terrible irony as to why they ended up in that condition due to sudden immersion). Once a world traveler and a lover of beautiful women, now he is trapped in a still body, to which every need is assisted by a truly devout family who voluntarily renounces privacy and time to sustain their beloved relationship. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mother of two, joins the Sampedro family from what could have been pure curiosity to learn about the difficult situation of the paralyzed man but becomes both an emotional support center for Ramon it is a funny but occasionally aggravating presence. A beautiful performance by Duenas. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that Sampedro is not sick in the normal sense. He could live more decades with due care. So his sweet but persistent desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who, not surprisingly, react from different ethical and religious perspectives. <br /> <br /> Ramon is the quad poster of a group dedicated to changing the laws of Spain on assisted suicide. "Death with Dignity" is their watchword. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who enlists the help of pro bono publico counsel, Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her health problems that carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a devoted wife, she is emotionally connected with her client. <br /> <br /> What follows is an acutely sensitive game of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and his wife, their technophile teenage son, not the intellectual Ramon, and his old father who can't stop crying over his son's catastrophic descent into absolute helplessness. <br /> <br /> Moral and legal issues are interpreted through excellent acting and short screenplays, including a classroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that can take into account feelings and points of view of Ramon. It could be Spain, but the problems are alive in most countries, including the United States. <br /> <br /> Particularly fun is a screaming, close-up in the bedroom, a debate between Ramon and a Jesuit priest holding conferences, even a quadriplegic but one whose hidden dogma casually masks the absence of a soul. <br /> <br /> Special congratulations to Mabel Rivera, Ramón's sister-in-law, Manuela, for a wildly authentic portrait of a strong woman who keeps the family together. And the same compliment extends to Belen Rueda, Julia, who moves from the objective lawyer to a close friend to a woman who is heading towards a dark destiny. <br /> <br /> The director does not impose any value judgment that allows each character to express the full range of his feelings in an effective and sometimes moving way. Like "Dead Man Walking", this film can support any opinion on its deadly theme. <br /> <br /> No one can prevent a person from committing suicide if he is determined, but the universal tragedy of the Ramons of the world is that without assistance, life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a phrase that no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is well suited to the story and the beautiful Galician scenes are an intentional contrast with the limited visions that Ramon once trotted experiences from his special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
