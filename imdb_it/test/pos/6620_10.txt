If you've ever been, you have a friend or a kid who is or was skating at once, so watch this movie! I've seen it several times and I get something new every time I see it. It reminded me of why I started skating in the first place (a long time ago). It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and what I found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters, well, skate. Of course, there is a very dark side to the whole picture, which the film touches slightly. But it tends to focus more on what is at the center of skating. Only one person on a table, doing it because he loves doing it. This film was so inspiring for me that I'm skating once again (I'm 32) and haven't been so happy with myself for years ... Giving this, you won't be disappointed.
