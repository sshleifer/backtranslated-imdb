A bland title disguises this solid example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, this film demonstrates a largely successful mix of diverse elements: a period piece, a romantic drama, a detective film and a political thriller. It is interesting to note that, although made by Fox, his protagonists ?? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck ?? both were usually associated with other studies; their on-screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years. Although a little too young, Taylor is a ruthless hero (a marine personally appointed by President McKinley to discover the culprits behind an organized cleanup of numerous banks); Unsurprisingly, as soon as he tracked them down (led by the good Brian Donlevy and the thug Victor McLaglen) who falls in love with a chanteuse (of course, Stanwyck) who threw the sack with the gang ?? even if, to tell the truth, the song is far from being the fort of the actress! In the same way, in addition to having to prove his worth to succeed in their turn, he has to confront McLaglen for Stanwyck's attentions; by the way, the character of the practical prankster of the first reminded me a lot of Charley Chase in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933) which, incidentally, was also directed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor is in two about involving Stanwyck in the upcoming bait and tries to offer his resignation to the President while he runs away with the girl ?? but the jealous rival destroys his plans. The theft went wrong, we find Donlevy dead and the other two in prison; Taylor's hopes for McKinley's intervention ?? having in the meantime learned the identity of the elusive and evidently prominent "man inside" ?? they are apparently dashed when the President ends up assassinated alone (a great twist, even if the resulting suspense of the eleventh hour seems forced)! To return to the jumble of film styles, even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows things down and moves a little on the thriller aspect, does this actually emerge in a beautiful production ?? with the aforementioned actors cleverly supported by the likes of John Carradine (who inexplicably disappears after a single scene!), Douglas Fowley, Mr. Rumann and, like two American presidents, Sidney Blackmer (the bubbly Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley )
