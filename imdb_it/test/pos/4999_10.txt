The hottest and most engaging film of its kind, Lips, Those Eyes, made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work needed to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are superb and the story seems to be written. A brilliant screenplay by David Shaber (one of my favorites!), See The Warriors and Nighthawks for more ... and beautiful sets shot on location (I think) in the real summer theater where the story takes place. You can't watch this movie and you don't want to leave everything and enter the theater! Please check this video if you can find it.
