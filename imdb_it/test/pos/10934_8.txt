At first sight this film seems to be a sort of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse, once seen, never forgotten. However, seen closely in the context of history, the implication is that in order to survive in the immediate America after the civil war, one had to have a horse and not an old horse, but a really big one. And the Wing of the Eagle is such a horse. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? The native American or the AWOL soldier? History in all primitivism against civilization. As other commentators have said, it is ironic that it took an English director to perceive this fact, and then develop this simple theme in a western like no one else that can be seen again. The film is basically about this beast and the wild harshness of the environment and the people who make a living. Photography and the soundtrack are exquisite. Martin Sheen's performance is a revelation. This film, released in the same year as Sheen's other great performance as Willard in "Apocalypse Now", alludes to his abilities that somehow have never been released again. More is sin. A comparison of the two stories reveals the striking similarities between them - not least the fact that both films represent a man's journey into his soul to find redemption. While Willard is redeemed, I leave the viewer to decide if Pike will eventually be. The finish is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving; be warned Overall this is an extraordinary film.
