George Cuckor, known as the women's director, could not hope for two more talented and beautiful women for his latest film. This is a remake of Bette Davis's campy "Old Acquaintance" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delicious. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset shine as best friends who compete for everything, but manage to remain friends Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious", intellectual and elegant writer. Meet her best friend ever, Merry Noel, in a school of exclusive girls and start a life of not always friendly competition. Later in their lives, when Liz is a "promising" but blocked essay writer, Merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her friend because of Merry's casual approach to the craft she perhaps takes a bit too seriously. <br /> <br /> To Liz's displeasure, Merry's shabby novels were snapped up and eventually her old friend Liz is judging her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the arrogant smoldering bestseller writer who aims to bring together the broken pieces of his life to coincide with his latest literary triumph, but alas, things are never that simple. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes David Selby, which you might remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and, of course, a delightful and jovial Meg Ryan in his first film role since he left the soaps. <br /> <br /> Rich and Famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. It is the culmination of a fiasco of the new year that underlines the lasting nature of true friendship, and I never let a year go by without looking at New Years Eve. Look at it and you'll see why.
