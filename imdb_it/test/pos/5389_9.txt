If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His delicate intensity to correct a wrong is what made his career. "Blayde Hollister" arrives in Dallas to take revenge on Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his farm in Georgia and killed his family. Inetto Marshall runs into Hollister, trying to arrest him when he is interrupted by a street shooting between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shooting is staged to derail Hollister's law, and takes the "backward" Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas, while they change identities. <br /> <br /> It was a great start and the image holds up to the end. The action could be a bit "slow" by today's standards, but it's one of my top 10 favorite movies.
