At first, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag, just for the fun of Stan Lee. I didn't expect anything more than an unbalanced and animated version of Barb Wire with low production values, very similar to those short pieces of shit you see on Adult Swim for short-term fun, but which I can never take too seriously. Boy was I wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production values ​​than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and they seem to have taken this series very seriously and have made an effort to make it as professional as possible. <br /> <br /> Even the humor is good, on the sexy, suggestive and squalid side. It is very similar if not exactly like the style of the Simpsons. You may come across common places and a lot of predictable humor, but it's still fun. If it were going today, I would definitely see it regularly. It is surprisingly one of the best toon ever made.
