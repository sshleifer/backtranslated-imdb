What makes this documentary special from a cinematic perspective is its passivity; which commits the public to bask in the joy of gypsy music. It innovates the form of the documentary while showing a tapestry of sounds and movements that invites us to celebrate the primitive resemblance that is found in the traveling music of (historically) itinerant peoples. <br /> <br /> In fact the film itself is a single "take" of radical movement that travels around the world and passes effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next. <br /> <br /> Watching this film, your breath is taken away from the simple beauty in our common connection with music, rhythm and dance. If there is a deeper and spiritual tribute to the sound and movement of Gypsy cultures, it has yet to be turned.
