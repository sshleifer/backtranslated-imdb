Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a poem with a visually surprising tone that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island, New York, at the beginning of the century. It is a surreal experience, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply gratifying. Intertwining the dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, Emanuele Crialese's latest film (Respiro) is like an impressionist painting - the artist's cinematic interpretation of how the immigration process could have been for our parents and grandparents . Crialese's "magical and mysterious tour" was born following his visit to the Ellis Island museum, to the eyes on migrants depicted in the photographs he saw and to his research on the strict policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants. <br /> <br /> Guided by letters that read of immigrants sent to relatives left at home, Crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. For Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his eldest son Angelo (Francesco Casisa), America is a distant dream of which they know nothing. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when the postcards of Salvatore's younger son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf-mute, are described, describing the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a tree of money or collect onions and giant carrots. <br /> <br /> After eliminating their animals in exchange for shoes and clothes, Salvatore, his two sons and his elderly mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) started their adventure with more hope than trepidation, but the equation soon moves to the other side. The most controversial scene of the film takes place as they board and settle into their crowded third-class driving compartments. Using a top-down camera that shows masses of people standing, as the ship moves away, the chassis is divided between those aboard the ship and those that greet the pier and the way they are separated implies that they are torn from it all which is familiar. br /> <br /> On board the ship is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal its past or the reason it is traveling in America, but it seems to represent the beginning of the modern world in which they are entering. Although they look at each other cautiously, Lucy takes an interest in Salvatore and asks him to marry her to allow her to enter the country. The journey is insidious with a violent storm that blocks the ship. Turned in almost complete darkness, the passengers in the wheelhouse are thrown against the side of the boat and, later, the bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor like in a macabre Totentanz. The rite of passage through the immigration process at Ellis Island does not become easier and Crialese attacks the way in which illiterate peasants, in the name of the preservation of the "civilized" society, are forced to put together puzzles, perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations prove that they are "fit". <br /> <br /> A marriage brokerage ceremony feels like an auction block and young women are discouraged when they are paired with overweight middle-aged men. This is the only way they can enter the "Golden Gate", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution. Through the fog, the immigrants can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no Statue of Liberty to ask the tired and the poor, the humiliated masses who wish to breathe freely. In their imagination, however, the river still flows, waiting for them to jump inside. Even if the ending is ambiguous and a door opens onto a white wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage that we all have to take from the old world to the new
