I rented this movie, but I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very happy to find out that this is the best Brazilian film I've ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple and, above all, extremely original. We have Antonio, who is a young man living in Nordestina, a city in the middle of nowhere, in the north east of Brazil, and who is deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between the two is that, while Antonio loves his little town and doesn't want to leave it, Karina wants to see the world and resent the place. As a demonstration of his love for her, he decides to go out alone and bring her the world. He will put Nordestina on the map, as he says. And the way he does it is incredible. This is a good film; It might be a bit seasoned for some people due to its different editing work, but I think it's also the one that improves the story. It's just fun and makes you feel good.
