I saw it at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commentators here and they seemed to have a lot of fun, so I won't have too much time to give a synopsis of the movie, but you might see some Woody Allen and perhaps a bit of Federico Fellini in this collection of films of about 50 short sketches or vignettes joined together without a real singular plot. Some of the cartoons are linked together in their character and in the lines of the plot and a corner bar is frequently used as a central scene in which they always give the last call. Even the start and end scenes have a common theme that closes the film. It took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent finding the simplest and most familiar people in Sweden to be cast. This is the official presentation of Sweden for the best foreign language film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It is a beautiful film, but hardly worthy of an official presentation for the best foreign film. Last year, the official presentation of Sweden was the very fragile Farväl Falkenberg and the year before it was expensive but boring ZoZo, so once again Sweden will have no chance of winning the Oscar. This film has its moments and would have made a nice short film of 20-25 minutes, but it gets a little old and cold for a feature film. Roy Andersson directs. Gustav Danielsson is the director of photography. The publisher Anna Märta Waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have done for this. Benny Andersson of ABBA fame provides a fun musical score. It's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and I liked it but it's nothing really special and could give it just a 7.0 out of 10.
