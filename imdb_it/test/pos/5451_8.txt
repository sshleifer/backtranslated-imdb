Nice film, great story, great characters, I loved it immensely, enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The true story of life he wants to tell is more fascinating and compelling than anything novelists could ever invent. My friend, who is in the media business, said they shouldn't show insider reports like this, he gives a bad name to the business. As if. <br /> <br /> However there are some problems with the DVD: firstly, the sound volume is terribly low, so you have to increase the volume of the TV to watch it. Note that this is also the case when it is run by HBO, so it is in the original production copy. Secondly, for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is interrupted, ie the image is cut about one inch from the left side. After the five minutes it fills the screen correctly, from left to right. A sloppy technical production of the kind is very amateurish and I don't know why the director and the producer let this slip by. <br /> <br /> Yet, even with technical flaws, it's a fun story, one of the best in HBO I think.
