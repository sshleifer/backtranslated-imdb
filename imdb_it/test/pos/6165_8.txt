Compared to Battle of Britain, this is a real movie, with real characters and a real storyline. Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with the occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are the Spits, the Hurricanes, etc. Here, on the other hand, you have two well beaten characters (actually three) and a real track. I highly recommend it to anyone, even those who don't particularly like war movies. He is well shot and I wonder what the director could do if he had the big capitals behind him. And I don't think it's too sentimental. It's just that in fighters you have real people, with real feelings and real life - as real as any imaginary life in any great movie.
