Of course, in a film whose main themes are mortality, nostalgia and the loss of innocence, it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more positively by older viewers than younger ones. However there is a craftsmanship and completeness of the film that anyone can enjoy. The rhythm is constant and constant, the full and engaging characters, the relationships and natural interactions show that you don't need floods of tears to show emotions, screams to show fear, screams to show dispute or violence to show anger. Of course, Joyce's short story gives the film a ready-made structure, perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes that Huston makes inclusive are the inclusions of the poem. It is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.
