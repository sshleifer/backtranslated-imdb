I completely forgot about "Midnight Madness" until recently when I found it while browsing IMDB. Now, everything is coming back to me .... <br /> <br /> It was one of Naughton's first films (as well as those of Fox) and connoisseurs also chose Kaplan (Henry of TV "Alice") , Fiedler (makes the voice of Piglet in the "Winnie the Pooh" comics) and Blocker (son of Dan "Hoss" Blocker of the TV "Bonanza"). <br /> <br /> But the two that stand out in my mind are Furst (from "Animal House") and the same superdudic - Eddie Deezen. This time, Furst plays a villain and has one of the best scenes when he asks his father: "Why can't you accept me for who I am?" His father looks past his obese and sloppy frame and gives a simple one-word answer - "Yuck!" <br /> <br /> And Deezen ... well, it's a show in itself. Like Jerry Lewis of the last few days, he stumbles, earns mini-golf pools, puts the halves of the melon in his ears and ends up falling in love with Maggie Roswell. My hero. <br /> <br /> As for the film, the stupidity of the early 1980s is typical with college kids taking place after the curfew and doing a treasure hunt all over the city to show which student division it is the best on campus: athletes, nerds, rich children, feminists or a group of each. <br /> <br /> Who wins? Who cares, you'll have a great time watching Disney Pictures' first foray into PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Catch "Midnight Madness" in every way possible! <br /> <br /> Long live Leon!
