This production was quite good. The usual fabulous scenery, interesting and bizarre characters. It was so strange not to have Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon and Poirot's office / residence, so present in the original PBS / BBC mysteries. <br /> <br /> In the original series, so much has happened office. Hastings reads the newspaper, while Poirot "exercises his small gray cells". Miss Lemon camps whenever necessary. <br /> <br /> Poirot without Cap. Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can definitely solve the crime, but it's not so interesting. <br /> <br /> And what would be a mystery of Poirot without Hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling in love with a beautiful and unattainable woman.
