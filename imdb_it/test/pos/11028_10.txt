Another "must have" movie. Henry Brandon is the favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he came from Germany because he plays and looks so typically American! And wasn't he exceptional in "The Searchers" as Chief Scar ?? !! Another one of my favorites, I have it and I watch it over and over again. Now, if I could add this to my collection, it would be my day! This is a great wildlife and film story for all ages. The scenery is so beautiful and the suffering of the endangered snow leopards is told with so much emotion that it will arouse interest in endangered species in everyone, especially children. If I could, I'd give a copy to all my grands & great grands!
