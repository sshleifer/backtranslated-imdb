I love this little movie, which reminds me a little of the original Japanese gem, SHALL WE DANCE? (not the exaggerated Gere / Jlo remake ...) Fortunately I found it and recorded it when it was shown on a STARZ Promo Weekend, because as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'll see anything with Yancy Butler (someone remembers the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???), and she positively shines in this. She does a dance routine for a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT !! I liked all the other characters, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where have you been all these years?). This is one of those movies that I extract from time to time and I always go away smiling after watching it. Highly recommended !!!
