This is a wonderful sequel to the award-winning Lonesome Dove miniseries in the 1980s. This sequel is perhaps better than the original. It is definitely more suited to families. The language is more subdued. There is a lot of violence and a particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly gruesome. However, overall a great film. The acting is superb. William Peterson is fantastic. A great dramatic actor with a quick sense of humor and comic timing. Jon Voight rightly fills Tommy Lee Jones shoes like Captain Call. Ricky Shroder makes a great show at heart like the boy who grew up with no family to claim him. Highly recommended.
