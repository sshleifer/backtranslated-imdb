I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college and I still can't get it out of my head, even though I've never seen it since. I remember every member of the cast (the cast was perfect, as mentioned in other comments), the design, the lighting and, of course, the story, which in itself is enough to keep you glued to the set. Probably the best TV series I've ever seen next to the original "Roots".
