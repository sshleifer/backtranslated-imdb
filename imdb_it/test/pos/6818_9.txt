This short has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on DVR) they love it too. Dialogue is like this, 'real'. The acting is superb. While the effects / props weren't convincing on their own, taken with the rest of the shot, they are expertly positioned / used. The music is so disturbing, perfect for this kind of "moment" movie. People who cherish their beliefs and thoughts are shaken at their core about what they see in this movie. Most everything goes here? ', But in the end they bloom with a new understanding, and leave the film with one word to describe it: <br /> <br />' Beautiful '. The beauty of the film is also profound. I love the fact that there are no conflicting opinions, no other voices and the voices you listen to agree with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the ending made me love more! Hard reality is sometimes more a movie worthy of any plot device, or twist. <br /> <br /> (wasn't Joshua Leonard the boy from the Blair Witch Project?) :) Film of a dead fictitious boy .. great!
