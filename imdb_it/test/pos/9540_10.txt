The Railway Children is perhaps my favorite movie of all time simply because of the brilliant acting of the cast, the warm and human interaction of the 3 children and the people they meet living close to the railway in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Augutter is particularly credible in her role as "Bobbie", the older brother of her sister Phyllis and her brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships they form in their new home and the surrounding area are very real and fascinating. The scenery is lovely, the trains are part of Britain's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving. This moving film never fails to bring tears to my eyes every time and makes me homesick. I often wonder if I should have been born in that era, because I think I would have adapted well while people treated each other with such cavalry and decency. <br /> <br /> In short, I consider this film a bit of a masterpiece and a must for anyone considering themselves a "sensitive or attentive type". Edith Nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of 1900 and what a wonderful story it is. Today the little ones need to read this or watch the movie instead of playing violent video games. If we had other films of this nature, the world would have become a better place.
