I thought it was a really great movie, especially since it was ready for me. I was bored, I got it from the library and I really enjoyed it! I've seen it twice in two days and the more I look at it the more I like it. I thought the plot would be really trivial but in the end it could have been said that it would be true. I liked the main characters and thought they were well expressed and that you could see true friendship. I thought they did an excellent job. The ending was good. And you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys. What should a film look like?
