I saw "nurse betty" twice in September 2000 at the international film festival "film on the sea" in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept smiling all day after watching it for the first time and almost all night when I took the film as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a star of the soap opera opera. But what I saw was much more than that! Beautiful roles for morgan freeman, chris rock à renée zellweger. A strange mix of romance, violence and video. And for everyone a story that takes other directions every time you think you are on track. Many soap opera lovers will love Nurse Betty, the film and the character !!! - but they can bring all non-soap friends, because they will appreciate the story even more for the hard and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the cruel scenes, the thriller aspects and for the beautiful photos. And I'm pretty sure that eventually everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm !!!
