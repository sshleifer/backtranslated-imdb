I saw this mini-series for the first time as a child and although I am no longer a child, I still love her !!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, when it's on DVD, it's MINE !!! =] <br /> <br /> Great casting, wonderful plots and lots of action, romance and even a lot of well-placed comedy. I'm not a historian by nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
