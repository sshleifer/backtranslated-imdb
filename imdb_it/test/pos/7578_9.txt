I enjoyed two of the three films in the trilogy "Sarah, Plain & Tall". This, the final of the three, was certainly one of the "good ones". It is an excellent family film with wonderful three-star adult acting: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but well told. The only sub-par performance was one of the children. It was interesting to see how the children grew up from that first movie. <br /> <br /> Of the three, that initial "Sarah" was the best, filmed with a beautiful photograph. This film didn't have this, but it had the best story. He had genuinely tearful sentimental moments and a very pleasant ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
