<br /> <br /> *************************** SPOILER MILD NEXT ************ ************** <br /> <br /> We Dive at Dawn is a film made in English with John Mills in the lead role. The second time I saw the DVD version on a big TV screen and I have to say that the film is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the Samll screen. Could it have been the big screen that helped? <br /> <br /> I keep saying that the first segments of the film are confused, but once the submarine leaves the pier and begins its mission, the film also starts! The search for the German warship named Brandenburg and the adventures that followed were engaging and the detail shown in the film is interesting! <br /> <br /> I am increasing my rating to 7/10. If you like WWII movies, I think this will be interesting once the submarine is underway. Even some of the subtitle men have a sense of humor!
