Nana Patekar proves once again to be the best actor working in Bombay without a doubt. His recent films have involved screaming his jokes that do not promise anything good for the theater-trained theater. One wonders why he never received his awards during the awards season. <br /> <br /> "Shakti-The Power" was one of his gestures that was a total disappointment with Kohram (a missed opportunity to create a magic screen with Amitabh Bachchan). <br /> <br /> But Patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of journey of social justice. Freeing the streets of Bombay from the underworld in fake encounters, the character of Patekars takes control of the screen (and the attention of the spectators) and never gives up. The assembly is tight and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story. <br /> <br /> Following the same lines as today's classic cult "Company", the film is well acted, direct and should have a long life on DVD. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of seeing Nana and the main villain speak in his shelter in the open sea are destined to be part of the classics of Hindi cinema. You will not be disappointed by these policemen and robbers.
