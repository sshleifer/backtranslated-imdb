An extremely simple, well-made and recited "rodeo" Western. There was no need for flattered stars because all the cast members were ordinary people who told a true life story of a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the West 60s and 70s. But the hats come off in particular from Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his original show, especially considering he had been a real-life rodeo clown. His role went far beyond the mere role of the clown because he tackled in depth all the "ups and downs" of hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr. Coburn worked very well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the fence. In addition, he controls Anne Archer as the love interest of Coburn's Native Americans in the last part of the film. It must have been one of his first roles. <br /> <br /> It is not as flashy, perhaps, as "Junior Bonner", but in the same way it makes the heart and the impact in its interpretation. Thanks to Encore Western Channel to show this true grit of an underrated film from time to time.
