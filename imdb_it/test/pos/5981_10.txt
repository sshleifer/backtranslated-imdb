This is one of the very few films that are so overwhelming that it is very unlikely that you watch it more than once or twice in your life (other examples are the documentary by Claude Lanzmann Shoah and Come and See by director Elem Klimov's husband - which covers very much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way. <br /> <br /> I suppose this is just as good given the difficulty of ever seeing a print. <br /> <br /> Apparently it is extraordinarily obvious Christian symbolism and the admission of the existence of active Russian collaborators ensured that it was almost never seen in the Soviet Union and, of course, post-Soviet Russia has very little interest in films of that era. <br /> <br /> The only time I saw it in London at a Russian film festival shown during the Glasnost era (ie probably in 1988) - however it has apparently been repeatedly shown in the UK, so at least one subtitled print must exist here. > <br /> As far as I know it has never been released in t to the west on DVD or video so if you haven't seen it, your best bet is probably to join a movie company and annoy them endlessly to find a print and project it.
