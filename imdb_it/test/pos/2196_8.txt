Last year I fell in love with Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd, so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and found it in the library. Although I think Burton's is the best, probably because I like cinema a lot compared to theater, this is still a great production of history. I haven't seen any of the other versions, but I'm trying to get my hands on it. <br /> <br /> After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to imagine someone else in the role, but George Hearn does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is fantastic, as always and all the singing is fantastic. I found myself singing. This is a game you won't want to miss, but try to see it before you see the movie version, so you don't have a partial view like me.
