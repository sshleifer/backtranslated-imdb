After seeing it for the first time, I thought, "Wow, this is the most spectacular film, visually speaking, I've ever seen." Since that time, I have seen some that have surpassed it but it is still one of the best in that department. I'm just disgusted by the fact that the long-awaited DVD was made so poorly, the quality of this transfer hardly better than the VHS tape. <br /> <br /> The jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for the sounds of the jungle, "seeing" is almost all at the beginning since there is almost no "hearing", no dialogue until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) makes friends with Ian Holm and vice versa .... so be ready for this, if you haven't watched this movie. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, all I will say is that this is not the Tarzan that many of us have come to know in Johnny Weismuller's films ..... but it's not a complaint. For those who love action, and I'm not interested in cinematography as I do, you just have to go through that silent introduction period <br /> <br /> in this version of Tarzan, our hero returns to Scotland (his roots ), adapts to that environment (for the most part .... and a little too quickly for credibility, frankly) and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is apparently more faithful to Tarzan's books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> The special effects here were made by Rick Baker, one of the best in the business. Sharp DVD or not, this is still a breathtaking movie to watch and very interesting during its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
