I saw this movie for the first time as a child. My sister told me about it and I thought it would be more like a children's movie. However it also remains to be an incredible film. True that the subject behind the film is battered but also true this film will never stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 when I saw it for the first time and only yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after learning how it ended, I knew I saw it a billion, thousands of times that I cried like a tiny little teenager. When I saw it a few years ago I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film. So I stopped watching it for a while. But yesterday I didn't change channel, I saw it. In the end I was amazed by how much he still made me laugh, cry, think and, above all, still believe in things of value. I have not believed for a long time and this film has taken me out of my shell and opened my heart. This film didn't just have an impact. I was also very impressed by the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you want to see this movie for the first time I suggest you see it for yourself. With fabrics And be ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. This film touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, and even in this period in which I tried to understand who I am, this film helped me to realize both what I don't want and still want to be in life.
