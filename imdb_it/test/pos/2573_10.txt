This if the first movie I gave a 10 to in years. If ever a film existed that required word of mouth to be promoted, this is it. A $ 4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it is. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is a reason to go and see it. How many people knew that Jackson could sing and even damn well. Feel the books and movies that suck about salvation. After seeing this, you will never be able to forgive a trivial use of the word. Yes, it's gritty, sexy, down-to-earth truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. Isn't this the best reason to watch a movie? Those who understand my meaning won't stay away from this week.
