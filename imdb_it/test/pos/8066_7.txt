Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney, the daughter of a policeman who lives in the difficult part of the city. She is a young and rough girl of undetermined age (between 12 and 16) who loves scrap but has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical style of the Mary Pickford film. Like many of his films, she plays a girl - even though she was almost 40 when she created LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And, like so many other stories, she was at the same time courageous and courageous. As a result, I had a strong feeling of déjà vu. Now if you haven't seen his other films, this is not a problem. However, he is essentially playing a character very similar to that of SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - although these two other films are much better. Now, this does not mean that this is a bad movie - it's just not one of his best works - especially because of a rather "schmaltzy" story that is very heavy on sentiment but not particularly convincing. An entertaining but not essential vision unless you are a big fan of the silent ones.
