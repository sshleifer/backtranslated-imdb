I saw the original rough screen that shows Gencon 4 times a couple of years ago. I was glad I did, my daughter is in the movie. <br /> <br /> I stayed in the back of the room with her as she watched the younger fans sit on the edge of the seats, silent without wanting to miss a line. The standing ovation was like watching the fans when the US hockey team beat the Russians at the Montreal Olympics. <br /> <br /> I like comedies and gags. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Married with Chilren are my favorite comedies of all time. Minor shows that I won't even look at. <br /> <br /> This film will do for the players what Animal House did for the College Frat days, what Dodge Ball did for weird sports. Forget the lack of a huge budget to support production. This is pure art, it is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be happier with the entire cast and production company.
