I read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for The Consequences of Love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a Brazilian hotel, and from speculation about what he could do there. The film takes place in a similar way to us. We see the existence of Titta who lived alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. He is secret and avoids friendship. His life is dominated by order and regularly. Little by little, the truth of his existence is revealed to us until, finally, his world begins to collapse. <br /> <br /> The mystery of Titta is central to The Consequences of Love and works largely thanks to the superb interpretation of Toni Servillo. His character becomes all the more intriguing for us, as few details are revealed: that he injects heroin once a week, that he has no imagination. Although some here criticize the dialogue for not being naturalistic, in my opinion it doesn't matter - this is not that kind of film, and I think the script is fantastic. Camera work is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the film gets lost in the subsequent scenes as the mystery of Titta's existence is revealed to us, and as its world begins to fall apart. However, the tragic final scenes are just as good as the previous one.
