This is the second Hitchcock movie to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock movie I saw in full, the first was Rope, which I really liked. With Saboteur Hitchcock there was more room to move freely, while Rope was taking place all in one room. I didn't like it as much as Rope, but that doesn't mean this is a bad movie, it just looks like an average film that could have been something more. <br /> <br /> It seems like a Hitchcock movie to make a break between his worst ones. As a thriller, I feel that he can't really put me in my seat or engaged with the main character that is touring the United States. The climax of the film seems a missed opportunity to really amplify the tension. The sound design is almost non-existent. You can hear their dialogues and a bit of environment around them, but the important things are missing, the points that are torn from the sleeve, the need for music to amplify the tension, all missing. There is no doubt intentionally, but the emotional punch you would like from a scene like this is missing. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't even look like it, I'm almost trotting from one place to another, yet it feels more confined. The script itself is very average and seems to go on the most obtuse ways to get the story moving. <br /> <br /> There are performances, but nothing extraordinary. Everyone plays his parts with words written on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needs more work. What stands out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil character, after all. <br /> <br /> In the end, I wanted more from this. I understand it's one of Hitchcock's less exciting films, but I enjoyed watching it. I can recommend it, but not with enthusiasm.
