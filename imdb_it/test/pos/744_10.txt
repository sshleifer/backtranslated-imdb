'Do not Look In the Basement' is so easy to knock, but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of the true underground stars of Horrors and IMHO is largely late for proper recognition. 'Do not' is his undisputed masterpiece. This sloppy psychodrama immediately attracts the viewer into a world so strange, disjointed, claustrophobic, of sweating madness, that you have no idea what the hell is going on. He can make you feel strangely dirty, just dirty, because Brownrigg's world is this crazy, unwashed, sloppy prison cell, obsessions and all the nuances of mental illness. And use his low budget palette to wrap his blanket around you like a bad memory. There's just something so wonderfully weird all over the damn thing. In a word, classic ... Moreover, if you look at "Do not" first, then you will have an idea of ​​the crazy psychodrama style that distinguishes the other Brownrigg films. In summary, actually, there are no more esoteric than this - well, actually they do it, track down "Keep My Grave Open" by Brownrigg. Crazy genius Don't accept any substitute.
