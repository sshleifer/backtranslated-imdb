Also for science fiction this film is a film a bit off. Okay, more than a little ... My first thought after seeing was that I had lost my mind. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie waiting for another Darko. Darko fans will never appreciate another Richard Kelly film because of their crazy standards of worship. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, pass over it. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly loves creating films that make you feel stupid for not understanding the "deeper meaning" the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it. <br /> <br /> The deeper meaning - (to spare you a lot of sociological psychological chatter) Humans are selfish, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and not open the mail without a return address. <br /> <br /> Summary: The creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz that if you press the button I'll kill someone you don't know and I'll give you a million dollars. Of course he pushes it and as promised by the creepy old man gets a cash box. Then the film dives into the unusual. To spare myself the beating ... To push the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an experiment designed to judge the morality of the human race. <br /> <br /> I liked: The will of the film to ignore the guidelines on generic films. It's different. It's intense. It has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy material 101). It lets you guess. NOT AT THE END OF Hollywood! <br /> <br /> I didn't like it: why does any being with technology that inhibits another life form a plan so ridiculous? Which god as an alien has patience for this? Diaz was good, but did you need a country accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give him a 7 because Kelly didn't pay as much attention to detail as with his other films. Generally good movie.
