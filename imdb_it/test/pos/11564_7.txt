The Dakota incident is a curiosity for several reasons. From the outset it will be evident that it was realized long before anyone ever thought about political correctness. Although, the character of Ward Bond softens the border with "maybe we can communicate with them, after all they are human, even" kind of dialogue. His part is alongside the preacher who tries to communicate with the Martians in War of the Worlds. In fact, it's disturbing. Even the title is curious. The use of the word "Incident" contributes to the importance and refinement of the film that probably did not damage the box office. The invented assortment of characters and Linda Darnell's fancy dress and hat are wonderful dated touches that make Dakota Incident a fantastic Western artifact from the mid-fifties.
