It sounds straight but with a silent intensity that makes it one of the best cops in the history of cinema. Roy Scheider is the protagonist on the French Connection of a poor man who has some of the same gritty appeal. FC is a better film, but I prefer to watch this because 1) I think Scheider is fantastic and this is his best film, and 2) it has the best car tracking NEVER, one that makes Bullitt look like a cable production again to Bill Hickman, who actually plays the driver). It doesn't hurt that Tony LoBianco stops (again) to play a villain. Enjoy yourselves.
