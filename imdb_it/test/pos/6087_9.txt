'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to David Lean's films, whose epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed and, like "Lawrence", is set in North Africa, but during the Second World War. The story is complex, but it comes down to a forbidden love between a suspicious and often difficult archaeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashback by Count Laszlo de Almasy of Fiennes - the titular character. The fact that his name does not look like his English plays a key role in what takes place. He was badly burned in a plane crash, occurred just as the film opens, and is repaid in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this epic story is the vast sweep through place and time, and the development of characters as well as those of the two unfortunate lovers. The film makes it clear that true love and passion, even if with terrible consequences, can make life worth living or worth dying for. If you are a romantic at heart, and you can enjoy a movie without the standard endings and simple moral codes, you may find that "The English Patient" speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
