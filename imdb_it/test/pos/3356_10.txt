When I was engaged, my fiance and I attended adult bookstores. He was looking for his favorite magazines and sometimes a video that caught the eye. As much as I liked the direct confrontation with him caused by the media, there was never a video that I really liked. I had only seen another film when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it was a private eye that destroyed a case) that actually had a proper plot and was pleasant. Everyone else was grunting, puffing and blowing and whatever. There is only so many times that you can watch a blond child who simulates "it". <br /> <br /> This film caught my attention and I emigrated, allowing it to roam the store. He noticed (how difficult it was not so?, He smiles, I was really interested in something, lol (!) In the video section!) And I approached, buying the slightly used copy for me. We brought it home and I loved it. Here was a "Porno" with a plot. I wasn't even sure it was classified as porn, but I use the word freely. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice rejected her boyfriend's advances. He was uncomfortable with his sexuality and cautious in his comments. Bill left, and she kept checking the books. The White Rabbit ran through the library (a book, if you notice it closely, I think (it's been ten years since I saw the film) it was by Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason that drives teenagers to run in the woods follows a chainsaw that handles maniacally behind them rather than towards populated areas. It's the best way to carry on the plot. Alice finds herself in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> I can barely remember all the details, but I clearly remember the swim in the lake and the way it was "dried". I liked the way they got Humpty Dumpty Up again, the Mad Hatter member who wore his hat to wear it with pride, and the brother of Dum and Dee's team (who disturbed me slightly - then again they could have been husband wives, but I never could tell, no matter how many times I looked at him). The woman on the knight who told Alice leaves and finds your Knight (What is a good girl like you doing on a knight like this?) <br /> <br /> The part that caught my be careful when I looked about a year later there was one of the cards (3 of hearts, I think) that looked exactly like my ex's current wife! We couldn't help making fun of it for being in the movie! The king of hearts was interesting, and the queen was even more interesting. Due to the opening of the forum, I can't go into details, just say it was "orgy" and we'll leave it at that point! <br /> <br /> When we broke up, I was allowed to take the video - he knew I liked it - but over time since he was loaned out. One day I will find another copy. <br /> <br /> Btw, if anyone could tell me out which scene was cut from the Amazon version, I would appreciate it very much. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend this movie for over 18 spectators. It was soft, sweet and really 70s, but I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> ***** on 5. D.
