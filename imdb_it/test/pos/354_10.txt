* THIS COMMENT IS PROBABLY SPOILERS !! I HAVE CHECKED THE SPOILERS CASE ONLY IN CASE BUT COULD NOT HAVE SPOILERS, BUT BE ALWAYS AWARE IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT MAY CONSIDER A SPOILER AND I DON'T! * Wow ... best game from Super Mario 64. I got this game the first day it came out, and before I got it, I went to some game sites to watch its ratings (yes, they have already reviewed it before it came out), and I was shocked. I was expecting something like Sunshine because lately all Mario games have been getting worse and worse. But this has completely beaten the other games. Scores of this game even beat Halo 3! It's just great. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: It is not the best, Mario's games are never known for their plots, and this is not really a big difference. Bowser once again kidnaps Peach but this time invades the Mushroom Kingdom at a festival held once every century and takes a flying saucer, shoots lasers on the ground and then anchors it into the ground and eradicates the castle and its foundation in space . <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely gorgeous, the best graphics on Wii so far. Even the effects of water are really beautiful, if you see the water, it looks so real because the effects put them inside. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: Simply incredible, the music of this game is orchestrated. Not everything, but even those that are not orchestrated still sound very good. <br /> <br /> GAMEPLAY: Very funny, it makes you want to play more and more, and for me, since I usually tend to be very frustrated with games if I die a lot, I mean, I'm definitely not the l It's unique, but this game didn't have much for me. Now he is still kind enough, but not to the point as Mario 64 where I completely go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad, this he never did. <br /> <br /> DIFFICULTY: there are two types of difficulties, because you can technically beat the game with only 60 stars, which I think is quite easy, but to beat the game 100%, you have to get 120, as always, and that search is much more difficult, but at the same time still very funny. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: good length, definitely not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to beat it with only 60 stars, but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours. Now I didn't play so much constantly, I used to play a day a lot earlier, then in the next two days only a couple of hours each day, then in the next two days I played it all day. As for me, I think the search for 60 stars was a little too short, so if you want a long game, I suggest you take them all. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now, the film scenes of this film are superb. As I am, it looks a lot like something I would see in theaters. They are undoubtedly the best cinematic scenes on any Mario game so far. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: This game is definitely a great game, and I advise you not to wait until Christmas, take it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new, you will have lateral oscillation levels where you move only from side to side, or up and down because they will change in gravity, but even music has some old classics in it. So this game seems to be a masterpiece. For me, it's my favorite Mario game of all time, but others may disagree. But it's still a great game. I recommend to all players who want to have fun in a game to get this.
