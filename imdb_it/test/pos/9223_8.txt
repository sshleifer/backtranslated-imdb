I saw this movie for the first time when I was very young. I was born in 1985, so it was around the age when the cartoons of the 80s were big. My mother recorded it one day thinking that I would like it. I had never even heard of Rainbow Bright TV show before being presented to the film. When I saw it (on one of those old BETA tapes ...) I loved it. I became addicted to it. There are people who say it's badly written and everything else, but it's a children's film, and things like that don't matter to children. I loved the story and I particularly liked the songs and all the female characters. Of course I pretended to be them, and in the scene where Rainbow first met Krys and they were repulsed, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could absolutely refer. History was the basic good against the evil that children love, and there were enough happy moments to balance the scary ones. The world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of every child. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to see this film when I was little. It has had a great impact, and watching it now brings back happy memories of childhood. I would recommend any parent with young children to rent this movie. They will activate their imagination and provide a lot of fun. You're just a child once, so don't let them miss this!
