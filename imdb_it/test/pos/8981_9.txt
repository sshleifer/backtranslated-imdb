It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes a man can make a difference - a big difference. <br /> <br /> George Crile's best seller in 2003, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and compelling story of the most unlikely "creator of differences" imaginable. A relatively obscure member of Congress in the second district of Texas, "Good Time Charlie" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than for his libertarian legislation. Sympathetic and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well because Lufkin's good guys only wanted two things, their guns and being left alone. It's an easy road, full of well-known catwalk beauties, quite appropriately, like Charlie's Angels. <br /> <br /> When asked why his entire staff was made up of attractive, young helpers, his answer is a classic: "You can teach him to write, but you can't teach him to grow tits." No discussion there. <br /> <br /> But even the most dissolute rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere below, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities committed in Afghanistan prompted him to gather all his political experience to finance the absolute, humiliating the defeat of the Russian armed forces and, possibly, even helping to accelerate the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance, eh? <br /> <br /> Under the able direction of Mike Nichols and a clever and snappy script by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling and sophisticated satire that tells the behind-the-scenes machinations of three colorful characters that comprise "Charlie's Team." <br /> <br /> The "Team" on the screen is composed of three wonderful actors with four (4) Oscars and nine (9) nominations among them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, somewhat undervalued way that has been among his best works for years. He is helped, favored and accustomed by Joanne Herring, a rich socialite from Houston played by the still sexy Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have the bikini scene that let the world know about it? By all accounts, Ms. Roberts looks good and supports her, but the script never gives us a clue as to why Kabul and the nation are so important to his character. Perhaps the two Afghan levers usually by his side know this - but we never do as an audience. As for the third member of the "Team", Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene in which he appears as Gust Aurakotos, an astute dissatisfaction of the CIA (who does not graduate from the Ivy League) who knows the score - both in the Agency meeting room and in Wilson's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In order for the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance that the United States can provide is the ability to take down the feared helicopter helicopters MI-21 that govern the skies. This requires money, a lot of money, and finally "Charlie's Team" secretly forces those in Congress to finance the $ 1 billion effort for advanced weapons to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes the latest generation of anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets, as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Bad and bad things. <br /> <br /> That this kind of multi-billion dollar illegal activity can and will take place behind the doors of Congress is truly alarming. Every American should see this film or read this book because it reveals a truly terrifying aspect of the business-as-usual political scene that is rarely seen outside the walls of our own government. Oh mom, I wish it wasn't like that ... <br /> <br /> Although the initial result for "Team Charlie" was an absolute success, the unimaginable, unexpected end result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops from the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely "hidden", the young generations in this part of the world have no idea of ​​the fall of Soviet oppression and the end of Russian barbarism was the direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russians left, so did our help - zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, and zip to maintain meaningful relations with the Afghan people. Consequently, the general consequence is an absolute disaster: it is like the precursor of "Mission Accomplished". <br /> <br /> As Nichol's film explicitly underlines, "The ball you have set in motion can keep bouncing even after losing interest in it." Mike Krzyzewski knows, Eva Longoria Parker knows, the Lafayette's little Lateesha knows, but the typical American politician doesn't know. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were good guys. Let's talk about a Catch-22 (another film by Mike Nichols). Maybe Charlie Wilson said it better: "We did the end game." <br /> <br /> Again.
