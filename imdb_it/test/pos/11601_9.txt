It is very difficult to portray a Tagore novel along film lines. And if you forget a dark production of 1967, then it is the first time that chokher bali is done on a large scale. Overall the sets were fantastic with the right touches to make a successful drama. Prasenjit, used to doing commercial stuff, did a good job. I saw the Bengali version and discovered that Aishwariya's voice was dubbed, which made his poor dialogue a little more complicated. While the director did a good job interpreting each of the characters with refinement, yet there was very little in terms of significant storyline, probably a lack of the story itself. However, character development, including those with minor roles, seems to be the strong point. It is difficult to transform some Tagore stories into films, since only the visual parts seem to be realized.
