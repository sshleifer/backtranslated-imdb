I was on vacation when my guest suggested we attend this B-Movie festival in Breda. I was tough, since I didn't travel to sit in a movie theater, but I have to admit that I don't regret a second of this (especially with the contribution of Stephen Malkmus). It probably helped me to have no idea what to expect. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST begins as a typical costume drama. We have a young medical student who helps a doctor whose city is destroyed by a mad plague (which somehow involves exploding heads). On the road, he stops to visit his boyfriend and is thrown out of the property by his father. Traveling, he finds a girl lying on the road, another victim of a plague, and accompanies her to the doctor. Yawn, I thought. It all seemed quite predictable. <br /> <br /> And then everything went crazy and suddenly it turned into a completely different movie. Tom Savini introduces himself as Dracula, the characters begin to travel "on the other side" of reality, and dialogue becomes more and more fun. <br /> <br /> And just when I thought it was set in a groove, the image changes again, becoming really dark and bizarre. I don't want to spoil it for the first time viewers, but there is an incredible sequence of empty people, lots of talk about the abuse of religion by society and some exaggerated effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This is not a perfect movie (in case you haven't understood it from its appearance in a B-Movie festival), but it's worth the time for adventurous spectators. Fantastic graphics, fantastic soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. Acting is a bit crazy sometimes, but I think that's the point. <br /> <br /> Funny I had to go to Breda to see find an American image that looked like a British horror movie. You understand that ...
