This improves with every new look. Definitely one of the best roles of Paul Sorvino. Extraordinary musical score that also stands out for the LP soundtrack (so why not CD?). One of the first releases of the dolby stereo sound film. By the way, the original 35mm trailer for this is really FANTASTIC!
