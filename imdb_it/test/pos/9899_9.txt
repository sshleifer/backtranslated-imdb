The timing of this upcoming film could not be better, especially in light of all the turmoil in this world today. The film is a moving, captivating and witty piece. If you have siblings and you still have parents alive, this will hit the viewer well. If you have lost your parents, then it will touch you deeply. Laughter often comes, the ensemble cast works very well together and is believable. This film is written intelligently and the lines that come from each of the actors make the viewer laugh frequently. There are moments that will bring tears to your eyes. I would recommend this film to anyone who respects the importance of the family and can follow an intelligent film.
