As you can see, I have sent 2 comments on this show since 1991 ... and no, ITV has not yet made it available for general release. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I recently contacted ITV to see if there was a way to get a copy, and that was their answer ....... <br /> <br /> " Unfortunately there are no plans for this program to be released on DVD / video, however, buy copies from our viewers' requests service. Their email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com ". <br /> <br /> I hope you all now still have the chance to enjoy this short classic comedy. <br /> <br />
