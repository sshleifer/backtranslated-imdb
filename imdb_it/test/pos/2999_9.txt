I bought this film because of Raquel Welch. She was beautiful in this film playing the role of Harry (Mike Wagner), a friend. Harry a thief in search of a new robbery. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work, they put the mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his band decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to start from there on a crowd. Be assured that, regardless of what the gang will do, the result will never be the same and will keep you at the limit of your position. The rest of the outdoor is necessary for yourself. As for Raquel, if you are a fan of here then you need to watch this movie because it never looked better standing on the beach with a ******. I give this movie 10 weasel stars on the body of Raquel Welch alone. No wonder why she was the most popular actress in the 1960s. It was the symbol of sex that everyone wanted and nobody could get. Not only does it look good, but it acts even better. If you like it, Raquel Welch then you will like this movie
