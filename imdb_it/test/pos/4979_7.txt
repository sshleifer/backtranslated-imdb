John Parrish is a former Union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land at Wilkison's to Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is very low and when they start to bully Parrish and his workers, he has a change of heart, especially when things take a bad turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> Originally after seeing this I had a sense of frustration, mainly because of the cast that was involved. When you played Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same film, you hope they get a story and a script to excel at. Unfortunately they don't have the possibility to produce a western classic worthy of more revisits, or is it that my expected expectation is doing it a disservice? Well, I slept on it and decided to reflect further on the photo. I think yes it is fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work, is, when all is said and done, a plot that has been milked for all that is worth and then some. But The Violent Men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford since Parrish is as cool as the nose of an Eskimo, and it's always nice to see Babs Stanwyck play a bitch because she's good at it. While Eddie G, when you get used to being in a western, is fine in what is a written part. Robinson, who intervened at the last minute when the first choice as Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford was injured, is the one that has been changed most briefly by the creators, also supporting characters like the diabolical Wade Matlock (a brilliant smile from the reliable Richard Jaeckel} and Judith Wilkison (a radiant Dianne Foster) have something to leave an impression in. But for what it is, Robinson's crutch wearing the "bad" guy is at least memorable for all the right reasons. /> <br /> He is not shy about the action and the game of the gun, it is with the twists and the almost Shakespearean tragedies that Rudolph Maté's film rises above the banal, with everything beautifully framed by the splendid cinematography of Burnett Guffey Lone Pine in Alabama has been used in many Western scenes {see Seven Men From Now for another glorious use of it}, but here Guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn. The Violent Men is not a great Western image, and perhaps a better director than Maté could really have given Donald Hamilton's {The Big Country} novel an adaptation to be proud of. But for every problem and irk that I personally had with it, I found two more reasons to really like it, so be it, it's recommended, for sure. 7/10
