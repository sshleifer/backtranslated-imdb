Well, it's a great job by Aparnaji and some where people like this make us believe that there are many more concepts so far that need to be expressed and the film is a great media to do it. Well, all the great actors together, so nothing to say about acting or directing, but the film gave us a great message. He well predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our point of view and we want to solve all problems accordingly. So, from the professor to the maid, everyone tried their ways. So when Joydeep was arguing with his wife, he says that "he is looking for something he will never get" and his wife says "we are not all?" This was a great comment that, after the film, left me a big question: "Are we all sick?"
