Nazarin of the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is obvious, an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It is not a visual film and I think it would have played better on stage. Bunuel leads us through this man, the Nazarene who lives as Christ lived; a true follower, that is, in poverty, and without a cure for property and what the next day brings. Some might call it a parallel to the story of Christ, but any follower and practitioner of the word, life should be like Christ in a sense. But in essence, Bunuel also investigates the edge of human selfishness and the need to sin and how goodness can save us all. It is a bold statement that could revive or recite the film for some. The truth, they say, even the Nazarene is selfish because it gives it unwillingly in exchange or asking for it. His selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin, with the same face on each side. Many people represent the sides of a coin in this film, all with both sides the same. But the film is not exactly memorable when it ends and many of its perforations and ethical verses could be attacked within the same doctrine of the film. Bunuel not of the highest level, but a "surreal" dream sequence that bunuel stages where the film message is framed and which is worth noting because it shows the director's ability, Bunuel.
