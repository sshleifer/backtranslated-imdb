Another fabulous film by Catherine Breillat, this time on the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie. Using comedy ?? a new genus for Breillat ?? we get a vision of the film behind the scenes, but in a documentary style. The character who plays the director in the film is based on Breillat, the sex scene in question is taken from his previous film "A Ma Soeur" as he is the main teenage actress. But the film, like all the works of Breillat, is not just entertainment. It is dotted with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality and demonstrates a devotion to "purity" (as opposed to pornography) which is a cornerstone of Breillat's work and a devotion to real emotions. We see the character of the director harangue the young leading actress and actor to bring out the best, hypnotizing them in the parts they need to play, bringing out a part of himself that the director can see in them but cannot see in themselves until they reach the acting levels that you require of them. He makes significant films, not titillation, but shows the work necessary to produce this, and therefore gives us insights both in the decision-making process of cinema (decidedly French) and in the psychology of the male ?? female sexuality.
