I was very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries on which the last Steven Soderbergh film was based, and now that I have, I'm happy to say that it's not better than the other. They are both intelligent, engaging and extremely funny. The only real advantage that the miniseries has in the film is that they are three and a half hours longer, so we learn about the characters in more depth. <br /> <br /> There is not a false note to be had in this production, one that you should surely find the time for when PBS re-broadcasts this miniseries in 2001. You won't regret it.
