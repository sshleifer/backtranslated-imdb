This show is really cool. It's smart. It is funny. It's a great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The dialogues are really fun and well performed. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have great chemistry. You really believe you're a mother and daughter. This show has shown that mother-daughter relationships don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but at the same time it shows that sometimes it's very difficult to be more than a mother and daughter, especially with Lorelai and Emily. I advise you to attend this show. It's fantastic and certainly the best show on the air. Season 7 stars Tuesday 26 September 2006, 8 / 7c on the new The CW
