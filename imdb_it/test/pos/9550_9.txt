when fellini committed 8 1/2 movies, many commented that it was the most personal vision ever to find his perfect expression. when Dante threw the flames on the flames of his immortal passion, many were amazed by the honest brutality of his unrequited feelings for a younger woman. when onur tukel, and a cheerful band of mischievously talented and disoriented filmmakers - from the mecca of cinematic madness - joined together, during two cold weeks in December 2000, many commented that nothing more supernatural had ever been committed ... much less on the film. <br /> <br /> well, to the doubters out there, look at this original piece and find out why the ID is both fascinating and powerful. and if this is not getchya, turn around and rub it one ... it's probably now that you do it. <br /> <br /> kudos onur on a great work of art
