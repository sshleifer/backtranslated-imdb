One of the best films I've seen in a long time, precise in his vision, and beautiful and very imaginative in its realization. I can't say much without giving it away, and I don't recommend reading so much about this movie before seeing - just look at it. <br /> <br /> But ah, one must come up with ten lines of text to get a review on IMDb. Enigma. What can I do? Can I talk to you about the movie? No. I can't do it. I think I liked this movie because I saw it without preconceptions. Please do the same. <br /> <br /> I suppose we can say: the acting is excellent and subdued, and what I have learned to love about foreign films is that movies are actually about MOVIES, not stars.
