However, "The Amazing Spider-Man" was one of the best made for TV versions of a famous comic book hero. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (the best of the genre and "The Incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) were better. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Spider-Man" outclasses 1966-68 "Batman", because the high-level elements of the latter often ruin the adventure. "Spider-Man" outclasses all three television performances of "Superman" - "Lois and Clark", "Smallville" and, of course, George Reeves "Superman" who acts as a rear guard. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Spider-Man" was an action drama in the late 70s, the pre-CGI era, when the stunts they were to be performed by acrobats, not "Spider-Man" had his talented stuntman to perform the reckless stunts that defied death. His name was Fred Waugh, who wore the spidy suit for action sequences. Nickolas Hammond, best known as one of Julie Andrew's sons on the classic film of all time "The Sound of Music" were Spider-Man during the dialogue scenes. Even Hammond Spider-Man had his secret identity as Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve- Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne, and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that only the series had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode hit radio waves in November 1977, the whole country was watching him on CBS that Wednesday night. In all honesty, CBS should release this pilot episode in addition to "The Deadly Dust", "Captive Tower" etc. On DVD soon. "Spider-Man" was short lived, but had a cult following, and in my opinion it was much nicer than the cinematic interpretation of the famous comic book hero with Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS may be reluctant to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) There may not be a large market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who were not born when the series was originally broadcast in the 1970s. (B) One of the first episodes of "Spider-Man" concerned a terrorist with designs on the World Trade Center, which was attacked twice many years after this show aired in 1993, and of course the devastating attack against this the 9/11/01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> However I don't think it would be in bad taste to release this episode of "Spider-Man" even if the show was adventurous, derived from a comic book, and to camp in nature. The live action "Amazing Spider-Man" does not have a great following, but has a cult following. If and when CBS will release it on DVD this cult cult could be explained together with the episode in which Spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but as in September 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies. I like to follow the news, but I also like science fiction / fantasy. So I look forward to the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD".
