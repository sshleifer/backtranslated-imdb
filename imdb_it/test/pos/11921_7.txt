Yes, it's not a big hit, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and entertaining film. The young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comical aspects of the story, and I particularly liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / "Yogurt". I've seen it many times over the years and I'll probably see it again. Just don't think too much and you'll like it - have fun!
