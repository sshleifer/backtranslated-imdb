"The Supergrass" Britain's most entertaining film I've ever seen, is a story of sex, drugs, cream teas and seashore murders. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), moron, is out to impress his so-called girlfriend, Andrea (Dawn French), because he thinks he is too respectful of the law. So, to convince her to come with him on a romantic getaway, she comes with a pattern that will perhaps impress her and make her spend some time with him. The problem is that Dennis's lie is that he was somehow involved in an international drug tour, and as he tells her, a couple of cops listen to his boast and incite him. And so begins this witty film, full of brilliant comedy and rough jokes. Dennis is thrown into the local nick, and, to the delight of the arresting officers, there seems to be no way out (Andrea's previous attempts to explain everything was a lie were dismissed by an exhilarating "Stand by Your Man" melody from two officers'). Then commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), head of intelligence, Scotland Yard arrives. He makes a pact with Dennis, who if he helps him catch drug traffickers, then he will be released and will allow him whatever he likes. Dennis agrees, and has collaborated with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson) and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable stiff neck experience, with Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adding color to the film. His walk along the dry dock against "Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Two Tribes" is superb, and probably the best scene in the history of cinema. The two agents who nicknamed Dennis are wonderfully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin, and Alexei Sayle as the motorcycle cop is a laugh! If you want something nice to watch on Saturday night, I suggest you rent it. You won't forget it!
