When I was a child, I remembered this show, but I thought that now, as an adult, the show could be a little dated. Well yes, it is for me that makes the show more retro (and the music is very funky). <br /> <br /> This show is mostly well written. I think it's a parody of the fact that this show was canceled after a season, especially when this show was more popular than the incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think fans should ignore poor special effects and enjoy stories. <br /> <br /> This next sentence contains spoilers: My favorite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman challenging each other, an interesting idea was created in the movie Spiderman 3. Mi liked the ideas on this TV show that some will hate it. I think Stan Lee wasn't a fan.
