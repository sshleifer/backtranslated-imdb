A lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a good reason to object to the film. The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part, it spends most of the film off screen. The film also makes fun of it on several occasions, usually with a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who love the stage presence of Paris Hiltons, this could be a movie to watch at home when it is published on video, because at the screening in which I was, we all laughed at her misfortunes in the film and she is interpreted as a "woman of questionable values ​​". <br /> <br /> The film itself was pretty good (unlike the recent stream of weak horror movies), it has everything that should be a good horror; a terrifying villain, excessive violence, acts that make that average person shudder ... this film has hit all the bases. It is certainly worth looking at.
