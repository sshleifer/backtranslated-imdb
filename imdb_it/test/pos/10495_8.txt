This was the first film that showed me what a great actor Martin Sheen really is. He says modestly that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can't hold a candle for him. <br /> <br /> I found it full of suspense and I really liked the plot of the romance with the main plot (and I usually HATE love stories). There is a big twist in the end that struck me as fully credible, particularly in the early 1980s, and probably now. The final scene put me in my place. This film clearly illustrates that betrayal is often distributed by those we trust, while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect and, finally, that human compassion can be found where we least expect it. <br /> <br /> cheerful
