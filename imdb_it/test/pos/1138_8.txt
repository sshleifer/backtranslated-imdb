Ten years before "The Matrix" and hot on "They Live" this fantastic piece of production of cheap science fiction films has arrived. If you like bizarre, unconventional and intellectually stimulating, David Lynch meets John Carpenter's cinematic style that you will love "Spalato". There are moments of true genius in framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence filmed through wine glasses at an art festival and immediately after a scene involving the cues. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside the company and wants to wake us up from the dream. Similar to "They Live", "1984" and "The Matrix", it is based on the premise that we are constantly monitored by Big Brother-type government agents who know everything about us and have invisible robot probes that constantly patrol the city. All this has been revealed quite early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker invented a drug that, when placed in the water supply, will awaken everyone from the illusion of reality. Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director does with his low budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. I challenge anyone not to rewind, memorize and cite the classic quotes of this film for years to come.
