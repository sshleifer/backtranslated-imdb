This film is the most impressive Turkish film I've ever seen. Probably "Okul" is the first Turkish horror film. I must say that I was excited while watching the film due to some reasons. The first reason is that the story is awesome, I mean that at the end of the film you made all the details of the film, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no Turkish man has ever made such a film. This shows that the Turkish film improves itself over time. Although the first trial to make a horror film, it was a real success. I advise everyone not to miss this movie ...
