I couldn't wait to release this film since I heard the concept two years ago and I was not disappointed. I won't bother to summarize the story since everyone else did it, but I'll say it was just fun all the time. The performances were fantastic, as was the music, and the main characters were funny. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the film ended very abruptly - in fact the writing became quite relaxed in the second half, as if the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot was not as important as the music and the action, this did not affect the value of the film's entertainment, so it's not as bad a complaint as it seems. <br /> <br /> (2) This is really nitpicky, but the music the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the film was set. INXS's Devil Inside was from 1987 and Are You Ready was from 1990, among other errors. This bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to relax to make a good period piece, they could check the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. Again, not a big deal. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought of something else that was weird. The members of the Steel Dragon band had to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy Zakk Wylde guitarist played band members, and each of them had a couple of lines in American accents. This was also a bit lazy, but it was still nice to see the real musicians playing the musicians, so I'll forgive him too. <br /> <br /> I could probably get a nap all day, but I don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super fun movie. I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I'll definitely buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the band's singer Steelheart, if you remember them!). The highlight of the film was probably a great outtake in which Mark Wahlberg showed off with a rock song on stage and suddenly someone played "Good Vibrations" by Marky Mark and Funky Bunch. The surprised look on Mark's face is priceless. Classic rock and roll movie! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
