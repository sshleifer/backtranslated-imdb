Errol Flynn at his best in the role of Robin Hood of the West, fighting the military bureaucracy, the confederates, the Indians and the business cheats with one-handed wool bags for his great and ultimate heroic end. Not to forget the always reliable O. de Havilland in the role of Lady Mary of the West. Never try to link this story to facts and real people, it doesn't work. Have fun, because no one has ever claimed to make documentaries when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn collaborated.
