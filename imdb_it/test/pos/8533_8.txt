Monday, early this week, in July, I happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and as a fan of horror, I wanted to see something scary. I was thinking about Ammityville Horror 2, but I got something better. I was at my friends' house and he had VHS Evil Ed. No cover or anything, he didn't even see it all by himself, but he told me it was "A guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people". Well, this film was very shocking, I never saw the real brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie buries Ted Bundy and Ed Gein both! It's also quite funny, with references to The Evil Dead trilogy (and the Evil Dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) The film is about Edward, an obsessive-compulsive, likeable guy who seems to be an editor. It is then lent to another department in the building, and sent to the elegant but violent world of Sam Campbell, the Splatter and Gore department. Sam Campbell, Eddy's new boss, is telling Eddy about the big break in his films, the gruesome series Loose Limbs, and he needs Eddy to make the movie a little less violent so he can be projected across Europe. Eddy has his regrets soon, like the images and scenes that are shown to him by the lonely suburban house where he is sent to work, and then, what happens from there is really nightmare. Imagine yourself in your place! Acting is great, overdubbing is not much fun (Sam Campbell's voice is often fun, like other actors). However, the overdubbing work was done quite well, I gave this film a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to Gore's subgenre at Horror. Very good, Nightmarish, bloody ....... You just have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> quote from the movie: "Where in the f ** k is my Beaver rape scene ?!"
