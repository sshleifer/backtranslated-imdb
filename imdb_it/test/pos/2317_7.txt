This film is about a group of misfits who should be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits join together to successfully complete their mission. <br /> <br /> It follows the hilarity. <br /> <br /> Like the films of the "Police Academy", the humor comes from the extravagant characters on the boat. I thought it was a catchy movie and I will stop to watch it every time it is on TV. No, it won't make you think about your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for humanity's service, but it's fun enough for 90 minutes. Also, Lauren Holly looks sexy in a naval uniform.
