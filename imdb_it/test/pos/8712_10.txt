A sparkling film. BB is a marvel. It's sultry. She is a feminist. She is still very much in love. <br /> <br /> The film features Paris in the 1950s. It is wonderful to look at the sites, the machines (DS!) And Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very pleasant romantic comedy. The music is horrendous. Almost dissonant. On the other hand, it's fun. But it's probably the only thing wrong, at least looking at it through the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film comments on the French way of dealing with infidelity. It's that modern sense. A film like an elephant if trompe enormenent did it in the 80s. But the basic premise remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the producers for providing BB with this opportunity.
