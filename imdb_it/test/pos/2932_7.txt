I mean let's face it, all you have to do in modeling is pose for photos. The judgment is so exaggerated with his criticism. The show is still fun, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander and the top model Twiggy. I saw season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. It seems that American Idol has become sexy but I'm a guy and I only watch it for the hot girls posing in their bikinis! The show can be quite boring, when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to go on and on and it's really daunting. Would I recommend it anyway? Yes, would I recommend it to women who want to enter the modeling industry? No.
