Damn, I'm learning fast enough that sometimes when you see a movie as a boy and then again 20 years later you get a different view, especially because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - what a great director he was and how much of this film he made fly. All I can say is ... I really liked this movie because it touched an area that was in parallel with my life: friendship for a lifetime between two women. Can it ever exist? Well, in certain doses, yes ... and this film made itself felt a bit about ... "how". <br /> <br /> Being a young man with not much life experience the first time I saw it I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. At that time, I had no idea that there was a difference and what would happen to two women who found out there was ... and how that would affect their friendship. Through their men, their careers, the decades that defined them. And coming to realize something has remained stronger than anything else ... their friendship and getting to know each other more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Then I got older, studied the movie a bit ... and watched this film again with my best friend from high school. We understand the 'rich' and 'famous' corner ... and we are still the best friends ... but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece ... sometimes it can be seen as a bit campy ... a little exaggerated on points (a bit on a 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas' level for me ..) and honestly I can identify with the "teddy bear" scene because we share a bear that means more than just a fun toy filling through our tests and tribulations with men / careers, et al .. so it's not the best as it seems ....! As already mentioned, Meg Ryan, Matt Latanzzi, Dack Rambo and David Selby are great in this 1981 piece. This is a nice "chick" movie!
