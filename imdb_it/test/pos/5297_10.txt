Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli shows his wonderful touch by animating, infusing life, into every little action of the Ponyo characters. When Sosuke carefully puts his small boat down to reach the goldfish, you know you will have a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting and you really care about them. Visually reminiscent of other stories, Riisa looks like a Nausicaa raised with a son, an elderly woman in a wheelchair remembers the witch in the castle of Howl's Moving. <br /> <br /> The presence of the elements, the wind, the rain and the sea with its large and powerful waves, is so strong that I think it was never evoked in this way in any other film. It's a simple story, loosely based on "the little mermaid", and reaches the very heart of the public, just like Totoro, another true Miyazaki masterpiece. <br /> <br /> An instant classic, with a fantastic soundtrack and a catchy song during the end credits. Not to be missed.
