Cheezy? Yes. Filming wrong? I bet zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or why)? For sure. <br /> <br /> This film celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic in the 80s teen horror genre: characters without depth, which fit into a stereotyped roll that never escape for a moment; teenagers who tried to survive a murder by a mysterious force that disturbed doing something little adolescent; completely free nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of the victims; zombies that move slowly; great jokes ... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> This is not a real parody of Scary Movie, but more a movie tribute to the lost innocence of the horror films of the 80s ... when being scared and engraved could also be fun , stupid, sexy and goofy good time!
