This was the only film to be seen about the Civi war. My aunt actually played this movie as an extra in Justin and Madeline's wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on horseback. The script was genuine and accurate. The costumes were tastefully made, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I love Patrick Swayze and James Ried very much. They were the best 2 choices, and also had a great supporting cast. Civil war is my favorite thing in American history, and I love movies about it. I've seen several, and this movie and its sequel North and South Book 2 took the cake. If you haven't seen it, rent. As soon as possible. It is rather an eduation.
