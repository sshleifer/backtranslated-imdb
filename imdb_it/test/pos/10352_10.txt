When I saw it on TV I was nervous ... what would have happened if they had messed it up? Millions of families like mine living with a man with a damaged brain, in my case my father, would be disappointed. I looked at it with my mom and we both ended up crying, he was so precise and captured how well the family feels like the person who suffered the brain injury. The actors were all wonderful and I didn't have any complaints, my moms told me she wasn't able to stop thinking about it. I hope this program has made many people aware of what it's like to live with brain damage and how it is for families. Other programs like this should be made, I was surprised by how beautiful it was and it really shook me emotionally.
