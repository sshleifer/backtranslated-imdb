William M. Thackeray once said "A good laugh is the sun at home". When I saw Take Away, I have to say that the sun shone in my house. This film was superb, the opening was very well done, the story went well together, in a nutshell two chip shop owners who are normally forced to form an alliance to engage in a fight between David and Goliath against a fast food chain that builds a restaurant on their way. The ending was exhilarating even though I found many who disagree with me on this. <br /> <br /> The film was albeit very discreet, portraying contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the clash between clash and culture, the traditional Anglo Australian and Italian Australian stereotypes, and how they found a kind of "unity despite adversity ", very beautiful. <br /> <br /> I found the performance of Vince Colosimo as "Tony Stilano" an Italian-Australian fish The thirty-fifth chip owner was first-class, his acting was very genuine and convincing, through his performance he succeeded in bringing the essence back to the surface, or I should say the soul of the stereotype of the Italian Australian, who in reality is not too Italian but not too Australian either, Colosimo found that balance, breathed deeply and gave him life . <br /> <br /> Cinematography could have been better, more shots of the local area would have been nice, from what I can see it was in Melbourn and, but where in Melbourne? to me it looks like a place between Ivanhoe and Bullen, although I'm not 100% sure. <br /> <br /> I don't know why so many people compare this movie to "The Castle" even though they have similar themes that run through them, Take Away is in a separate league. <br /> <br /> I think the film was excellent with the capital "E", it has everything, it is fun, the lines are fantastic, it deals with contemporary issues facing Australian society, the story holds up well, the I loved it! I highly recommend it.
