I came across this movie on TV. I had never heard of it and I almost changed the channel, but it quickly caught me. <br /> <br /> The history of the struggle of the Burmese people against a military dictatorship was provoking. The level of brutality that some are willing to use to maintain power is hard to believe. It makes me grateful to live in a country where the government is unable to shoot people in the streets. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good discussion to keep the history of political struggle together.
