This film is a good start for novices who have never seen a 'Silent Film' and for those who believe that quality cinema started with the efforts of their generations. They are doing themselves a disservice by not expanding their horizons. The 'Silent Film' is an art form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and from the stage, it can stand on its own merits. <br /> <br /> THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927) United Artists is a fictionalized story of the relationship between the French poet 'Francois Villon' and 'King Louis XI'. Through 'Vill Louis' re-engineer 'King Louis' will defeat his nemesis 'Duke of Burgandy' to minimize the Feudal System and establish the RE as head of state and the beginnings of modern France. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional, led by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who remember him only for the decadent actor "Larry Renault" in the CENA DI OTTO (1933) or the ham of THE INVISABLE WOMEN (1940) this will be a revelation. In shape, cut with the 'Big Profile' still in evidence that controls the screen. Co-Starring in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his interpretation of "Louis XI", interpreted as "spider corpses". This is a duel of Titan actors, each of whom does not give the other a thumb. A curious note is the actor and dwarf character ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first film, his latest, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other actors of characters that would continue in the sound and that are easily shot. <br /> <br /> United Artists has spared no expense in this fine production under the supervision of WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. Costumes, props and sets are well made and not overdone like in the DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions. There is a touch of reality here. The DVD copy we saw from "Delta Entertainment" came from a good master. Although it was not "restored", its musical soundtrack was clear and the press suffered only from annoying blackheads (dirt) and dropouts. The only serious damage to the end of the last coil from the water. 'Kino' also has an edition that can be of a better quality since they perform important restorations on their prints. The best control with them. In our opinion, this is a "must", especially if you don't have "silences" in your collection. This is a good starting point.
