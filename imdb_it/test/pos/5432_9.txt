This film reminds me of great films that wake me up temporarily with the knowledge that the Emperor is really naked. Our electoral process is bare and sad. My awareness has increased and I want to see the world change. After a while I returned to my little complacency and "bubble life". In the best sense of the film, this work will turn into an edible stew for me and, like in "Network", I want to be condemned to say "I'm terrible, and I'm not going to take this anymore!" But to whom? My vigorous youth idealism was slowly reduced to a worried parent with quiet beliefs or rather "beliefs." "Man of the year" reveals how ardently and sometimes humorous I want to take our current political situation. Dobbs' line "I breathed it because I thought 'What the hell is on, it's in my hand, I'll inhale it'". It was refreshing or it would have been when Clinton was President. Why can't politicians be honest and set the tone for debates? We people must realize how much veneer is presented as real? Am I already sick of this electoral process, someone else? Let us remove the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and bring them to cover (not re-elect) when they continue with the evasion and non-representation of citizenship. This film can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians who spread rhetoric. Great movie!
