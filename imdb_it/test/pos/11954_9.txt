The comedies of the 80s (especially those with John Cusak) are fantastic. Almost all are hilly and instant classics and this film is no exception. A lot of hints about other films (Godzilla and Jaws) through the film that are so hilly that you will laugh for hours. Some might complain that the film is a bit trivial at times, but hey were the 80s and things were always a bit rough. Launch a young Demi Moore and an even louder Bob Cat and have a laugh party with your fans. If you haven't seen this, you'll do better soon !!!!!!
