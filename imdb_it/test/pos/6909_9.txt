I saw this film as part of Midnite Madness in Sitges. Set in 18th-century England, the plot covers the life of Arthur Blake from his first outing as a tomb-robber apprentice to his last confession on the eve of his execution. <br /> <br /> The plot moves along a series of mishaps involving Arthur and his partner who encounter various unpleasant characters and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes you about this film is the precision with which they managed to capture the aspect of the horrors of the Hammer period, the atmosphere is set with a lot of fog-filled cemeteries, bizarre scenes of taverns and an excellent set / costume. <br /> <br /> For a film called I Sell the Dead, did I expect the emphasis to be mainly on horror ?? don't get me wrong there are some odd moments and gore, but the tone is very comical, driven by the situations in which the characters fit in and their dialogue. The closest comparison to the scenes between the two protagonists (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the interaction between the characters in the English classic comedies Only Fools and Horses, the Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. <br /> <br /> is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm raises the film over many of the others on display in Sitges. <br /> <br /> Overall the film offers something very different from the current mainstream horror crop and will leave a smile on your face.
