Hello! Being able to speak Cantonese, I found this very amusing and I was able to get all the jokes that cannot be obtained due to language barriers. The fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. However, I have my criticisms. First of all, I find that it's not as good as the first A-GO AND WATCH NOW Project! :-) The reason is, SPOILERS AHEAD - DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM !!!!!) because in Project A, Jackie ends up fighting his enemy; the man who was sent to kill, Sanpao. This is what the whole movie tried to do and the showdown is spectacular. But in A II, with his fight against Chan, the showdown scene between Jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and most of the action is against the Empress's men. They are not "bad" enough and have only played a minor part in the film in relation to Jackie, so even though their combat sequence is spectacular, they are not the ones that Jack is hunting for throughout the film, so leave the viewer slightly dissatisfied. However, this is just my humble opinion, so don't take the word for word, go and see for yourself! It's a great movie in its own right! Take care of yourself and hope your admiration for Jackie grows! Best regards, Ian PS. Do you know the chief of police in A II? He's the same guy as First Strike, it's nice to know he's still strong!
