Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean, if you have been to Korea or you have Korean friends, you should know what I mean. Koreans are very traditional people, they see love very well. a kind of feeling that you don't find in today's world. I think this is why this film is so special. it is wrong to compare this film with "Love Letter" by Shunji Iwai, the Japanese are very good but they could never do one like Palwol's Christmas. if you have the chance, please watch this movie for yourself.
