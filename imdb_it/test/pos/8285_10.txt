AWWWW, I love this movie in pieces. Me and my cousins ​​really like this movie and I'm just a HUGE FAN !!! I hope they will soon bring the TV series to DVD. Come and mention it, I haven't seen the TV program in a long time. These geart times! Where I come from Australia The Chipmunk Adventure is known only to people in late adolescence and adulthood, which is pretty sad because kids don't know what's missing. <br /> <br /> The songs in this film are the ones I love most Rock n'roll boys / girls, Diamond Dolls and the song that will surely make you want to cry Mia Madre. <br /> <br /> This film is sure to excite both the young and the old GET THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY !!! 10 out of 10, a film so excellent.
