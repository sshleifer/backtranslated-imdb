Yes, it's "Flipper". But writer / director Alan Shapiro has put together a gem of a version. Spectacular above and underwater photograph of "Jaws" veteran Bill Butler and Joel McNeely and Crosby's haunting music, Stills & Nash make this family entertainment truly memorable. Shapiro, whose last film was unlikely "The Crush", once again shows himself as an extremely talented and versatile director. Rent it!
