"Challenge to be Free" was one of the first films I saw as a child. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I owned. I hadn't seen the film in years, so yesterday I decided to paste the tape and watch it. Wow. The story is so powerful now as the first time I saw it. I think that now that I'm older I can better appreciate the values ​​implanted in the film. (Self-sufficiency, The value of freedom and love of nature) It is a "B" film, of course, but it is what you will remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.
