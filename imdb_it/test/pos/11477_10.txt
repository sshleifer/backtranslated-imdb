This is probably one of the best Portuguese films I've ever seen ... I really liked the plot, because, about the way the story was developing, you would feel more involved in the way their world was really upside down ... There is only one part that does not seem to fit the film, which is the strip of girls ... It does not add anything important to the story, it seems to be right there for a man who has a purpose. The finish is a bit unexpected, although at the same time it is somehow expected. If you don't understand, follow me: after so many strange appearances, the viewer is so used to the oddities, that ending the film with totally unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) seems quite natural after seeing the rest of the film. But, above all, Sorte Nula is a film that makes you think hard trying to solve the mysterious occurrences, laugh with laughter with their unfortunate lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in a few minutes, when you turn your again away from something ... for all this, I consider it 8/10
