To paraphrase Thora Birch: "I like this movie a bit, it's the exact opposite of everything I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This dark movie was too low and smart to get a theatrical version, any chance of success would need an expensive promotional campaign. And a training story in which nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development, it has a limited target audience. Who has ever heard of a movie for mature teenagers? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to see it or if you can separate yourself from the DVD, you could do much worse. "My Teacher's Wife" is not revolutionary, but has a lot to offer and holds up well to repeated visions. <br /> <br /> Jason London (as senior high school Todd Boomer) is the star and adapts to this character as well as his parts in "The Man In the Moon" and "Dazed and Confused". He is helped by an exceptional job from his supporting cast. Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as a calculation tutor for Todd and love interest. Christopher McDonald is the teacher in a beautiful self-parody exhibition. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todd's best friends, and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. <br /> <br /> As someone commented earlier, this is a "mature" teen movie because romantic relationships have failed universally, at least by traditional standards of happy ending. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, with his father panting after the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the phone during all his time on screen (a device that always gives more emphasis to the comedy with each subsequent appearance). The London-Carrere novel has an unexpected charm and is much more believable than any other story of elderly women that it is likely to find. <br /> <br /> But the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends. There is no melodrama upset here, only three immature people who alternate between tests and mutual trust, without prejudice to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. In reality they manage to pull off a "credible" relationship of three people, perhaps the first in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
