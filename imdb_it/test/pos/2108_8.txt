Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs. Ninja) is pure entertainment from beginning to end due to his outrageous characters, the absurd storyline and the lack of any claim whatsoever. The creators of this film gave us a real OTT masterpiece that must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the evil one of Wu Tang, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist. To do this, does he team up with a Ninja clan, led by three masters? gold lam√© ninja, mustachioed white ninja and black ninja ?? and manages to destroy the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. It is their task to pass on the knowledge of Shaolin's finger stroke to a new generation, who must defeat the ninja and Abbott White if peace and order are to be restored. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Abbott White is a tough enemy to beat, as it is able to make itself virtually indestructible by sucking life force from naked and hot chicks (an excuse for some free nudity welcome!). <br /> <br /> Other delights in store for the spectators include a lot of very impressive fights (although some of them have been speeded up), some really amazing clothes (the aforementioned golden ninja, Yin Yang's clothes by Abbott White, and even some assassins wearing Swastika tunics), a ninja who turns into a flying carpet, plus a few cheeses for good measure. And I almost forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows on display in this movie ?? definitely a good reason not to let this gem go.
