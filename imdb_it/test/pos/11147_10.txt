This film is exceptional as Marlene and Raymond have outstanding performances. The acting in this film is the biggest strength of the production, but the script, the direction and the editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exists between the two stars. If you like Marlene and you like Raymond, you'll love this movie ..... (It's a classic comparable to Casablanca). <br /> <br />
