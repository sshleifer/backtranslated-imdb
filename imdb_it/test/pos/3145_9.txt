I saw this last night at the 7th Annual NYC Home Film Festival - a rather tumultuous place that has calmed down for this sweet and touching film by two women. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two, one older and blinder, the other, a twenty-year-old man who helps him with his mail - is skillfully enabled, and his depth is immediately evident. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases, explosions or dizzying special effects - only the task, sometimes difficult but rewarding, for humans to touch each other to help and be helped. <br /> <br /> See if you can!
