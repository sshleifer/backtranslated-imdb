It is interesting that someone has made a comparison between the "Fifth Missile" and the Star Trek episode. It should be noted that the original Star Trek TV episode in which the crew of the Enterprise suffers a spatial madness as they orbit the planet Si 2000 is called "The Naked Time", not the "Naked Now". The "Naked Now" refers to the first regular episode of Star Trek The Next Generation in which the Enterprise-D meets a scientific ship. This episode, however, refers to and is based on the original "Naked Time" series. <br /> <br /> Now, to the Firth Missile. While the crew's reactions in the Star Trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol intoxication, the conditions of the crew aboard the Montana were caused by a much more serious situation, namely the paint vapors emitted by the finish of the defective bulkhead. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than a crew that has serious responsibilities like a crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and of course this is what makes the film so suspenseful and such a thriller . The plot is very credible. At the same time, this film, along with "Crimson Tide", "The Day After", "Dawn's Early Light", "The Hunt For Red October", "Ice Station Zebra" and many other similar films give us much insight into how much things could easily go wrong and the ease with which a nuclear holocaust could begin. Fortunately, such an event has not occurred and (God willing) such an event will not happen.
