This film was amazing how beautiful it was! The plot is extraordinary and the acting is spectacular. At first I thought this wouldn't be great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the film, I was struck by the fact that I was wrong. I literally cried four or five times in this film, and despite this, I must have watched the same scenes over and over again thirty times in a week! No, the song scenes weren't as great as they could have been, but the plot is what really makes you have fun. American or Asain, I would recommend it to anyone - and I have it now. I guarantee that after seeing this, you'll get the best and the plot. I hope you feel the same, and write an enthusiastic review too!
