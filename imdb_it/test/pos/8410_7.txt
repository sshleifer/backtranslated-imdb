<br /> <br /> It is well known and has already been said: no one can play Scarlett and Rhett as Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer divorced from Kilmer from ex-husband Val Kilmer) plays her Scarlett and despite this being a sequel and not a re-make (God-forbid !!!) she still can't take the opportunity ( eg his voice sounds bad on several occasions, he has brown eyes [Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to the job. for flirting (as SCARLETT did with the novel and GWTW, of course) and for a great flirtation like Rossella, you would most likely need a higher pitch, like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I suppose I'm comparing Kilmer with Leigh a little too much but when someone has such a mastery role as Leigh did with Scarlett, you simply can't help but criticize Rossella's new perspectives ... Timothy Dalton shouldn't have hinted at any accent, because of the fact that both Rhett and Gab Margaret Mitchell's in the fi I had none. His acting was never really noteworthy (except, perhaps, his interpretation of the evil, conniving King Philip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and gives his Rhett very little (if any) freshness or vitality. <br /> <br /> The actors in the cast are in particular Tina Kellagher (an actress born with a lot of authenticity in her release) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there's Sean Bean like the cold, calculating and not to say devilish Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Rossella's possible violator. One thing I could not forgive the writer was the fact that Scarlett was raped in this film (a fact that never happened in the novel: Lord Fenton is cold and untrustworthy among the Irish in the book, but he is not even remotely so ruthless as a homologue of his screen. Another omission of the novel, but played for the film, is the character of Belle Watling, played more horribly by Ann-Margret in a cameo role, which we all may have lived without, since the book was so best-seller run-away without requiring any assistance from Ms. Watling. <br /> <br /> For a film by itself, SCARLETT is very good, but not quite at the height of a place in terms of GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel. Another actress was highly needed for Scarlett and Rhett. <br /> <br />
