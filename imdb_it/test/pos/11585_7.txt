-Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" tells the well-known (at least in Spain) story of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician tetraplegic who killed himself (helped by some friends) after 28 years prostrated by his condition. The judges have repeatedly denied his petitions of active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> - Facts (II): "Mar adentro" becomes THE FILM OF THE YEAR in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone likes it, even the opinions of critics are unanimous. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and annoys the quadriplegics of the Catholic community and lovers of life. A star was born. <br /> <br /> - Facts (III): the intensity and quality of the actors in "Mar Adentro" are simply fantastic, and this makes me wonder why we have to look at the same evil young actors in most of the last Spanish films. I don't know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there is a big difference between one thing and another); however, his work is impressive, as is that of Lola Dueñas, of Belén Rueda, or the work of all the starring guests. This is (the selection of the actors) the strong point in Amenábar's film. <br /> <br /> - Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson there at the Film School, no doubt: he has a privileged brain. He takes control of each of the technical aspects, he knows what the public wants, he knows how to touch the right agreement, even if it turns him into a demagogue (just like Spielberg - one of the idols of Amenábar-). <br /> <br /> - Facts (and V): if you criticize a film like "Mar Adentro" it will seem that you have some problems with the moral problem that the story tells. There is a trap in this type of images: you have to differentiate between the film itself and the moral concepts. If you don't like "Schindler's List" that doesn't mean you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or do you?). So, for me, it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (since it's a true story that makes it much more extraordinary). Magniloquent, self-taught, and anything but neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem said about it: those characters who are not in favor of euthanasia do not go well at all !!). 50% Hard / 50% too too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epiletto: "Mar Adentro" would not be at all in my list of the best Spanish films of the 50s of all time. No one has special merits in history, but Ramon Sampedro himself. It's the movie. Now Alejandro Amenábar will become the most international Spanish director ever, perhaps he will go to live in Hollywood; but some of us would like to see him film a simple story, without final twists, without living dead or dying alive ... "The Others" is still his best film. <br /> <br /> * My speed: 7/10
