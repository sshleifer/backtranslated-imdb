Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy IN & OUT. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who sits down enthusiastically to attend the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a candidate. He is nominated for his performance in a film in which he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for having inspired him because Howard is gay. Now on this plane Howard because he has no idea why this guy would say on international television. Howard is even engaged to marry (with Joan Cusack, in an Oscar nominated performance), so he has no idea where Dillon, Cameron Drake had the idea of ​​being gay and discovers that he has to defend himself from everyone at school, but he is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what Cameron told the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he receives birthday presents as the YENTL soundtrack and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to do FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also visits a journalist from outside the city (Tom Selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he is gay too. The moment when Selleck plants a big kiss right on Kline's lips is a classic. But all these little things questioned Howard about his sexuality and wondered if he was really gay ... with the exasperation and frustration of his girlfriend, Cusack, which is beyond confusion. The scene in which he leaves a bar in his wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street screaming about the lack of single heterosexual men in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline completely invests in the role and isn't afraid to look silly or look gay. There is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous in the film, in which he buys a record, about how to be macho, and the guy on the record talks about how real men don't dance and lights up a disco song (I will survive if the memory serves) and the narrator on the record says that no matter what you do, don't dance, but Howard can't help himself and ends up shaking his groove around the room. It is hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and taste. The film is not pro or anti-gay ... it's just a clever and amusing study on the character of a man who tries to understand exactly who he is. Wonderful movie.
