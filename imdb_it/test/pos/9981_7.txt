This is not a movie I would typically watch at 2:30 am, but I went in and couldn't stop until it was over. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf has proven to be not just a young actor here, but could handle more demanding roles. The fact that he has been given those roles in the last two years is a testament to his abilities. <br /> <br /> It was really his movie. Of course, there were others involved, but they paled in comparison to his role. <br /> <br /> It was a period in which gold was reserved for the privileged. This victory opened him up to the masses, just as Tiger Woods opened up golf for all races. <br /> <br /> As Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) told Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth): "... if Mr. Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) wins tomorrow, it is because he is the best, because of whom is. Not who his father was, not how much money he has, because of who he is damn! And I thank you for reminding him. " Go get yourself paid.
