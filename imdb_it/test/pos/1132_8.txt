I'm not a big TV personality ... but when I saw the main Greek episode, I couldn't wait until next week! I don't miss the show for NOTHING! <br /> <br /> THANKS TO GOD for DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... he acts like a bad guy, but he's so sweet ... Everyone has their own character so we have pretty much all kinds of people. You could still throw a Hispanic and chubby person. <br /> <br /> I didn't go to school in the United States, so I never liked the idea of ​​brotherhood houses and things like that, so when my husband told me about the show I didn't pay attention to , until he asked me to look at him and since I hadn't noticed better, I accepted. I laughed so hard the first night that I just needed to keep watching it. <br /> <br /> So .. I'm with the other people who voted for this show to continue! I hope for a second, third and who knows how many more episodes! It's a really good show, very funny and fun!
