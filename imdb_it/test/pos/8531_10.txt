You must love this movie! I mean, what other Swedish splatter movie could be so wicked, bizarre and totally cruel ... The whole movie is full of a kind of weird humor, like: The old cencoreguy just turns off and the boss wipes the blood away his glasses and says in a bad voice: - Your fired !!! wouppie !!!
