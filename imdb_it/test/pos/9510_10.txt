It's the best movie I've seen this year! Excellent detail and plot (for a remake). <br /> <br /> It presents a "what if" situation in which the island of Japan could be completely wiped out of this land. A stimulating situation, life and death and not to mention all of life on earth (well in this particular Japan). It also presents a brilliant and ingenious solution to this massive tragedy. Horror, action, suspense, sci fi, documentary, love story and all the history of human interest that you can find, you'll find it all here! But I also warn you that it is a real tear-jerk! Casts, actors and all are excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... this could really happen anywhere on earth! Now let me ask you this after seeing it ... "What would you do if you were faced with this situation of life and death"?
