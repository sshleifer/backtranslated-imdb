Story of a strange love and a desire to fall. Poetry about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. It is a dying Venice. I don't know if it's a masterpiece, a poem or a reflection of a director's world. It is absolutely a "memento mori". and an exploration of illusion. An old mirror of limits, signs and delicacy of death. A journey into an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. "Death" is a copy of Orfeu's journey into immediate reality. And the essence is music. A sweet and sweet music, like honey or the fire of winter. Like any regret and any sorrow. As a refuge in profound solitude. Gustav is gay by chance. He is the seeker of the last form of God's presence. Beauty, that beauty that gives meaning to life, which is sin and virtue at the same time, the gift of expectations and suffering. He dies because he has the right to hope, to believe in the reality of the miracle and in his own way. A victim? There's no way! Only Tadzio can give freedom as an insignificant sacrifice. Who has seen the sun can hope to live in the same condition?
