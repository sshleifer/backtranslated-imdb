Don't you just hate cuts that never seem to start? Sometimes it takes a full hour for false herring before real action takes place. "Tourist Trap" is not so! If it is a typical macabre cut you want ... rather than a typical macabre crash! A lot of it And constantly from start to finish! This film contains what is probably the largest opening horror film of the 1980s when a teenager, on a walk after an engine failure, is trapped in a deserted house and attacked by a gruesome collection of wax statues. Four other slaughter lambs arrive home and encounter a completely absurd maniac that looks a bit like a leatherface mix (from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and one of those crazy sculptors of old movies on wax museums. "Tourist Trap" is an exciting horror entertainment, with some genuine suspense, macabre images, extreme strangeness, morbid humor and fantastic make-up effects. The twists are not always original and the acting is rather bad but, seriously, who cares? The fast pace and the big killer icon made this "Tourist Trap" earn a place among my 5 favorite points. A bit surprising is the total lack of nudity, though. Too bad, because all the girls look adorable and after only 10 minutes, the mandatory line "Who needs a swimsuit?" is spoken.
