I've seen this movie three times and every time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. Many of us who were Phoebe's age at this time in history will understand how real it is. Life for most of us is neither a romantic pessimism or a cynically cruel one. It is a blurred balance, and this film captures this balance. It is well built, with many details in its composition. Like the movie or not, judging by the extraordinary assessments made by the demographic group of women under 18, we can know that this film reveals some important truths about how young women see themselves in the world.
