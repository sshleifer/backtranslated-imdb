I just saw this and it was great. He was in serious doubt about the DVD rental or not. So if you are ... and like watching other mindless action movies ... don't hesitate anymore. Don't let the opaque cover turn you off. The script is one of the best ever. Smart, fun, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat throughout the movie. I had already seen another movie right before this and I was really sleepy, and I usually get bored watching a second movie in one night, but this really made me wake up and didn't have boring moments. It also made me rethink many things in life and really gave me a good feeling. <br /> <br /> Even the acting is fantastic (one of Kevin Spacey's best roles). The images are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to invent something negative to say about it ... well ... I really can't find anything ...... Enjoy! 10 out of 10
