I haven't seen "Hardware Wars" in years, but I remember it as one of the most exhilarating events in the human experience, and it was too soon. Every aspect of this film was hilarious, and it was even better than "Star Wars". I laughed. I cried. After watching it, I asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just to kiss me goodbye (I'm joking about the last one). I like it when the Ham Salad mate / co-pilot tries to eat the Princess Anne Droid cinnamon puffs, and the Darph Nader character is simply hilarious! This movie would be great to watch with "Thumb Wars", and honestly I wish there could be a "Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Umpire Strikes Out". (It was there?)
