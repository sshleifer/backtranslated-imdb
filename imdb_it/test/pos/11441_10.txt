This little film brings back many memories, both affectionate and obscene, of what can happen and happens when we are musicians. The accommodations not so pleasant for the band, the management of the venue jumping up and down to tell you what to play, the absolute ecstasy of applause .............. Far from being farcical , in fact, very accurate in the way he describes musicians, professionals and non-professionals, who have traveled a great distance to perform in a concert season in a place. There are those times when everything goes perfectly, there are those other times when you immediately started losing your partner and you wonder what the hell you're doing so far from home. In the end you have to do the best because there is no other way out.
