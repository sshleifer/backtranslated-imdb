For those of you out there who have seen this picture on VHS, I would recommend the DVD. In reality, VHS is total garbage. The main reason is that the film was shot in widescreen (2.55: 1) and the producers ran out of money making the VHS version and released as 4: 3. The result is that many actors are not on screen at all, and in many endurance races, less than half of the cars are shown on one side on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the film. <br /> <br /> Many of the film's best scenes were cut before the final release. They were considered too offensive for minority groups. Indeed, the prospect of an exit in the United States has caused even more cuts in the film. For example, Americans presumably did not understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's dad and mom were destined to become hippies. Dad survives in the film as a guitarist wasted on drugs. But the following scene with the mother was cut off. The scene took place in the space of the roof of the house that was lined with aluminum sheets, fluorescent lights and full of plants ... you get the picture. The producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the first floor and when they saw the result on the large sheet, they freaked out and the scene was cut. Cowards! <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is considered an Australian cult classic. Voted second in Street machines, the best 100 films of all time, just missing Mad Max ll. The latter had over 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, the budget on ROE was so small that the director could not afford to destroy any of the cars ... although there would have been a public protest if someone had destroyed a real HO. (Compare it with Smoky and the Bandit or Blues Bros where dozens of machines have been destroyed.) <br /> <br /> So there's a real GTHO and two fakes. One of the fakes was bought by the local indigenous community of Cobar after the GTHO standby crashed into the back of the Country Boy truck. (That was not planned! The car was destined to explode from the side of the truck.) Since the budget was so tight, the car was made with a normal brown tape instead of the painting on the real thing's gold trim. br /> <br /> The 55 chev is absolutely real. The car started as a simple 4-door and turned bright and fast in the 55 "blown in the film. The engine was a marinated 545 that produced around 1000 horses. This was reduced to around 600 for shooting. The car was able to easily at 170 mph as shown in several scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Just for the record, anyone with $ 12,000 could have retrieved ALL the cars after the movie. the Dodge, the '53 Ute, the Rammer's 53 Chev ... the lot ... I wonder where I am now? <br /> <br /> SW
