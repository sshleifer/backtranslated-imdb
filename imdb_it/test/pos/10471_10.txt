The French Babbette appears in the modest home of two wet, cold and sunny Danish sisters. Fleeing the revolution in Paris, he seeks refuge in a dark religious community on the windy coast of Jutland. <br /> <br /> Unbeknownst to those who received it with such generosity, she is a great cook, a food artist. Babette gives herself to her adoptive community through parsimony, productivity and shared faith. He leaves only when he wins the French lottery - 10,000 francs. Returns charged with exotic goods, preparing a single meal to commemorate the birthday of the sister's father, the founder of the community. <br /> <br /> This meal looms darkly in the minds of the faithful who deny pleasure, but its subtleties are translated by an elderly military officer who, as a young man in Paris, has learned to appreciate the sensory experience that takes place here. The meal is the culmination of the film, a communion of love in the transitory art of food, which does not alter art, love and the meaning of life.
