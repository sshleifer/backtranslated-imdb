This film is the story of a Catholic nun as an advisor to a murdered convict on death row. The film describes what it does as a nun, which has no productive role. He may have had doubts in his real role. But in the end he interprets the role that only a nun could do, which has nothing but faith in Christ. In America, there are so many movies that describe convicted criminals or prisons. Those scenes, especially the execution, are too different from Japan.
