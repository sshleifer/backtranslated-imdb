THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting film for the HBO film that gave a detailed look at the power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and they both wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as a guest of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world but Letterman discovered that his dreams were derailed as a frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and working tirelessly to get his client work. It is not often that you see the machinations of Hollywood recreated for the value of entertainment behind the scenes, but for fans of these two late-night superstars, this film provided a fascinating glimpse into a very turbulent period in late-night television. According to this film, Letterman was practically promised to work at Carson himself, while NBC had promised the work in Leno and that's where Helen Kushnick arrived. The film presents Leno as a sort of mileto that allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance of some of Helen's strong intentions of some of NBC's greatest power players and presented Letterman as a man of intelligent and expert business that, despite having Carson's support, was trained by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it's the razor-sharp performance of Oscar-winning winner Kathy Bates in the role of Helen Kushnick holding up this movie. Bates controls the screen in one of his best, though not so well-known, shows from the venomous Hollywood agent who eats TV studio executives for breakfast. There is also a marvelous turn of the Impressionist Rich Little in the role of Johnny Carson, but it is above all a fascinating story and the performance of the Bates power plant that is worth it.
