I am a university student and I bought this film in a used bookstore because it looked really funny from the later description. Nothing would prepare me for what would be the MOST HAPPY FILM EVER DONE! <br /> <br /> It's especially nice to look if you're an atheist, like me. Because then you can see how foolish these Christians are. They seem to think that non-believers love to live in really disgusting and messy houses and they do nothing but drink beer and be mean to their neighbors. It's a RIOT RIDOSO! <br /> <br /> My friends and I watch it every couple of weeks so that we can be entertained beyond our wildest imagination! Watch this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> We hope that Rich Christiano will make some of these films to entertain us pagans!
