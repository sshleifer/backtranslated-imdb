If you go to the cinema to have fun, have fun, to fill your time, don't freak out to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of mankind, the feelings of real people, to explore the caracteriology of personalities, if you go to the cinema to absorb a magnificent photograph, make sure you put this film on top to your list, preferably in first place. The experience is profoundly gratifying, forcing the intelligent spectator to make several reflections on the meaning of life itself. With "Mar Adentro" Alejandro Amenábar has surpassed the best he has done to date, and has even redeemed some detours in his previous films that have struck a bit of being aimed at Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem set to music: Hollywood could never come close to the effect of this human story - and humanly focused. <br /> <br /> In no way should we interpret "Mar Adentro" as an apology for euthanasia; this story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is a cry from the depths of the heart for life and love, a striving towards human compassion, for understanding emotions. Sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who, after an underwater accident off the rocks of the Galician coast, was condemned to live in his 27 years in bed. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life that I have already commented on. However, Amenábar has notably succeeded in portraying this man, with his permanent enigmatic smile and his witty sense of humor, in an equally articulate and intelligent way. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem has reached the height, he met the head of the challenge - with a Galician accent, producing an electrifying, compelling, compelling performance such that the actor and the fisherman merge becoming the same person on the screen. Here, in effect, is an opportunity to remove the cap and mumble gently "chapeau". Bardem is led in his task by a magnificent cast, notably Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol) (qv) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accents that play an important part. <br /> <br /> Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves one by one, or in groups, with an excellent chemistry, thus demonstrating that this young Chilean Spanish director is an artist who knows what it is to and how to get his results; his overall concept of the film includes his music, interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on the record-breaking record by Sampedro. <br /> <br /> While watching "Mar Adentro", I found myself a couple of times to compare it and this movie with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' (qv). I refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tension and passion and that careful sense of time in every scene. <br /> <br /> The photograph of Javier Aguirresarobe is superb as usual. As I've already mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, it doesn't just film the events and scenes - it also captures the feelings and atmosphere of the moment, cleverly captures that look in the eyes, light and shadows, so that his work behind the camera is immediately another player in history. A superb artist. <br /> <br /> 'Mar Adentro' is another landmark in the history of Spanish cinema, among the top five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. This film is placed alongside this cinematographic art as "El Sur" (qv), "Los Santos Inocentes" (qv), "El Abuelo" (qv), "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (qv), "Las Ratas "(qv), 'A Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I should add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). <br /> <br /> Superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him around his bedside: not to be missed.
