I wasn't sure about getting this movie on DVD because I really have something against people who make black and white movies in the 21st century, but I eventually bought it anyway. I still don't understand why it should be in black and white, but this is the only negativity I can see on the film, and it is certainly a perfect example to see the definitive growth of Brazilian cinema. Not everyone can understand a film like this, but it is quite rewarding for those who do. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, surrealism is well suited to this film, and the acting is at least as good as that, or other successful Brazilian films like Bicho de sete cabe√ßas, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this gem will not be insulted and raped by a bad Hollywood remake. It's amazing to see how those kids spend billions of dollars and still can't make a movie that's 1% as good as this low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Good for the whole crew! 10/10
