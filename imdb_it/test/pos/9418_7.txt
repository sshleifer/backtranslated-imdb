This morning I saw two very different Holmes adventures, but you will be amazed by the similarities. <br /> <br /> Presumably it was the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (If I was King, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. It was not their first Sherlock Holmes adventure, as they did a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> He made an excellent team, but I prefer the Hammer version, which I will talk about later. /> <br /> Holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his job, and I'm constantly amused by the mannerisms shown when they understand something. They always seem to rush when they find a new clue. <br /> <br /> The very history of holding a bombing by the Germans in World War II was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.
