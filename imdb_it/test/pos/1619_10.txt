This is a low-budget stop motion monster movie taken from Brett (A Barbarian Nymphomaniac in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and offers just what I would expect from such a production: carefree dialogues (even if of cheese), some nice actresses and many stop motion creatures. That's why I gave the movie 10 out of 10 - because it offers what I expected it to offer ... and a little more: Brett doesn't make any money when it comes to putting his creatures on the screen. Throw a lot of bugs at his cast for the finale. And anyway, I LOVE stops showing monsters that, compared to CGI creations in cheaper movies, seem to be so fun to watch.
