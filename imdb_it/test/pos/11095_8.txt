This film is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story takes place around the time of the Whitlam Dismissal, in which during his time as a TRW employee, Christopher was aware of classified correspondence that admitted the CIA's involvement in Australian political and trade union circles. The film shows several scenes involving Gough Whitlam (broadcast on US TV), where events are held that confirm the classified documents that Christopher had previously read. The removal of Gough Whitlam was a coup organized by the CIA. Elsewhere in the film, it has been said that most people have no idea of ​​the level of deception that happens, ultimately to ensure that the United States is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else. In the present age, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> Christopher's life has been deeply influenced, read by the shocked, his knowledge of what and how the CIA shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of the allied nations in the United States. Christopher reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, selling top secret information to the Soviet Union with Daunton Lee acting as his exchange. Eventually Christopher and Daunton were captured and convicted of treason. <br /> <br /> On May 23, 1982, while in prison in the United States, Christopher Boyce accepted a single, 60-minute interview with Ray Martin in Australia because it was the Australian connection that deeply affected him. It made a furor in the Australian media for about a week, then it failed. <br /> <br /> I liked the symbolism of the hawk movie, and in it Chris was named Falcon and Daunton the Snowman (drug connection), but in reality the title "Falcon" was not used by Chris. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Criminal or Man of Conscience? You decide. <br /> <br /> Resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html
