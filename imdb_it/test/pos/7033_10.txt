There have been speeches on the E! Hollywood special on the Making of Dirty Dancing which is still considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite movies of all time. Perhaps the music, dance or melodrama around Baby Frances's plot turns into a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film created Jennifer Gray, whose most important role to date was the resentful sister on Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly launched as the beating heart that drives the man who sweeps away the child literally. Dirty Dancing has everything to become a big hit on Broadway or West End. It has romance, music and above all many dances. Jennifer and Patrick could relive their roles easily. it's nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as a mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the 1960s, where many Jewish families came on holiday in the area during their summer holidays. At the end of the film, it is sad to see the hotel owner, Kellerman, being baffled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and travel through Europe rather than spending the summer in Catskills. These old grand hotels are becoming Indian gambling casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, this should be a breeze! I know this movie is a favorite you don't get tired of watching 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie - 1,000 times now. Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me want my childhood days as a thirteen year old. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in history, but its universal appeal still attracts crowds and repeated observers like the 800 club whose members have seen it so many times. I look at him with affection now with all the embarrassment of Baby's first days and his first true love with Patrick Swayze as a heartbeat, Johnny Castle. No one could have imagined this little film as a great success then with the music of the sixties, two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they take him to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the public to be part of a film. No wonder he still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to look at him over and over again. Well, Australia and London both had Dirty Dancing productions. It seems that he will arrive on Broadway in 2007 just in time for his twentieth anniversary.
