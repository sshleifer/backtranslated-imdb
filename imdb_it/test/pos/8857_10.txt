The foolish saying "You can't touch it" certainly applies here. With all the horror and science fiction clone movies coming out, along with all the lower remakes, it's hard to find something worth 2 hours of your time. This is why I always rely on the classics that scared me when I was pre-adolescent. <br /> <br /> THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the most gluttonous, ickiest, finicky classic science fiction horror film that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, Mr. Spielberg too) has ever done. What really gives him power, however, is not cold blood (he is OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of terror, isolation and distrust that feeds the characters and the spectator. > <br /> You cannot be more remote than Antarctica, and in this howl, icy white is the place where history takes place. Several Americans, researchers and soldiers are stationed there. One day, they are witnesses of a Siberian Husky dog ​​running for the life of Norwegians armed with pistols. Before they know it, the American outpost is fighting a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It can turn into disgusting slimy bloody forms before it's over, but once you're done, if you haven't seen it going, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just some of the best casts. This film is the reason why the horror PU CAN be a great genre. Actually it STILL scares me. The alien blood "leaping" out of the Petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes you jump !!! <br /> <br /> Still the scariest of them all.
