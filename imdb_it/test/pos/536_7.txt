Since I'm a Natalie Portman fan, I had to watch the movie. I loved every minute. It works very sincerely. Throughout the film it seemed that Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept burning for it. <br /> <br /> I felt that there had to be a love scene involving Natalie and someone (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think it's great. I think a love scene would have ruined the tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Natalie must have a talent for choosing good movies to get into because I haven't seen her in a bad movie yet. So any movie that has Natalie Portman will no doubt be seen by me. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 7/10
