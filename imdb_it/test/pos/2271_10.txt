If anyone has any doubts about Liev Schrieber's talent, just take a look at his new film, "Everything is Illuminated", which clearly shows a man who is not only one of the best American actors, but a new director whose first effort is really an inspiration and a forerunner of what must follow. Schreiber adapted Jonathan's novel Safran Foer into a film that will live forever due to the way the director adapted the material. The film clearly exceeded our expectations because we had no preconceived ideas. <br /> <br /> For those of you who haven't watched the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandparents is limitless. Watch how his grandfather dies and while his grandmother is in what appears to be his deathbed. In a clear moment, this dying woman gives Jonathan an image and an amber-colored ornament for his collection. Looking at the photograph taken a long time ago, a young couple is seen together. Watching makes you think of Jonathan showing his grandfather and his girlfriend, taken in happy moments. Looking at the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go in search of his ancestors' past in Ukraine. Jonathan made arrangements with a travel agency, Heritage Tours, from Odessa for his trip to Trochenbrod, the mythical place from which his grandfather came. The agency is run by an older man, who claims to be blind, and his nephew, Alex, a man who loves American pop culture who has captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks a kind of English that nobody talks about and his conversation and translation, for the benefit of Jonathan, are hilarious to our ears from the use of English terms that are sometimes unheard of. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against the desire of Jonathan, who does not want to sit beside the growl and the dog barking during the journey. <br /> <br /> While embarking In search of Trochenbrod, it is clear that his companions, especially the old one, have no idea where he is going. At this point, the film becomes a road movie, as the three characters who travel the country's secondary roads know each other more deeply. While the trio arrives at the sunflower field with the house at the end, it indicates that they have really come to the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of past conflicts. <br /> <br /> The elderly woman, who lives in an isolated place, is the missing link in history. He is able to put things in perspective. But here is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan, who clearly came to the land of his ancestors, to the old. Let's watch as this old man begins to remember things about himself. This, in turn, changes the dynamic of the film when we discover how Jonathan and his guides have been connected at all times. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms in these pages expressed opinions on the accuracy of the story, which after all is a work of fiction and the freedoms have been taken. It would have been impossible to make another film by including so much that it is contained in the book. The excellent way in which the film is divided into several chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what is going to be seen. Elijah Wood, a magnificent film actor, does an excellent job underestimating Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in each film with his interpretation of the main character. The happy casting of Eugene Hutz in the role of Alex, the Ukrainian tourist assistant and translator, seems to be an idea made in heaven. Mr. Hutz talks about the best thing about the movie. His arcane use of English gives the film a fun corner that delights the viewer. Boris Leskin in the role of grandfather and driver of Alex's touring machine makes a valuable contribution to the film, as does Laryssa Lauret, seen in the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> Matthew Libatique's excellent cinematography brings the splendor of the Czech Republic's countryside to its full glory. The soundtrack of Paul Cantelon is heard in the background that adorn the film in a way that adds richness to the film. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber, the first director who will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next.
