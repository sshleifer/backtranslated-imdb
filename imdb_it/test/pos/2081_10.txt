Captured this film on TCM in the early days of A.M. It was great. <br /> <br /> Starting slowly but disturbingly ... Scott is a shady character who preaches women. In this case, two women who were due to be inherited in southern California. <br /> <br /> The beach and neighborhood sets of the 1940s are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and the nefarious shadows of human nature are exhibited intriguingly, almost in a version by Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Scott reminded me of the character of Uncle Charley in "Shadow of a Doubt", one of Hitch's favorite movies. The public learns, we do not really know what is hidden in the dark side of the human mind. This film is a displaced gem and a good buy. 10/10.
