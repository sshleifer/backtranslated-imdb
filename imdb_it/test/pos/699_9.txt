Glenn Ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and the astute owner Edger Buchanan to stage a mock robbery while the banker hides the real loot. With Ford a no-show, the two instead opt for a lucky second choice, leaving Ford safe for murders he didn't commit. <br /> <br /> Columbia Pictures' first feature film, The Desperadoes is fantastic with sets and costumes made to take full advantage of the Technicolor process, accentuating tons of well-organized western show. <br /> <br /> This has the irresistible team of a young Glenn Ford (third place but essentially the star) and a first Randolph Scott who leads an incredible cast of character actors in colorful roles, including the villain of scene Edger Buchanan as a good-natured but slightly wicked good-natured person who is not as stupid as he seems and has some memorable lines. br /> <br /> A fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama and comedy, well directed by Charles Vidor. This is one of the great westerns of the 40s and highly recommended.
