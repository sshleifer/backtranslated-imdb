Bud Abbott and Lou Costello have always had a good following among children, but in their careers I think we can say that they only made a film that could be for children. Jack and the Beanstalk was a movie. <br /> <br /> It was part of an independent two-film deal from Warner Brothers, the second film by Abbott and Costello met Captain Kidd. These were the only two films made by the boys in color. <br /> <br /> The two, without work, as usual, take a job for an early and unpleasant young David Stollery as a nanny. Even if he starts with Costello who wants to read the child, Jack and the Beanstalk like a fairy tale, the young boy ends up reading it to Costello. Lou falls asleep and in his dreams he imagines he really is Jack the Giant Killer. <br /> <br /> Buddy Baer who threatened the boys of Africa Screams plays the giant and has a giant Dorothy Ford as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine she had some difficulty with the cast, except when her height was used as a joke. One of the only players who ever looked at her was John Wayne in Three Godfathers at 6 years' 4 ". Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way were barely above her, but again her height was part of a gag. <br /> <br /> Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were the princess and the prince of fantasy and sang beautifully, but could not act at all. This was the last film by William Farnum whose career dates back to the early days of silent cinema and even to the turn of the last century on stage. He played the role of the king of Princess Shaye's father. <br /> <br /> Some not particularly memorable musical numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, except for the title song. I remember well as a child having the 78 disc of Bud and Lou singing the song and reciting the story. I was in my early single years, but I became a fan for life through that and their television series. <br /> <br /> Jack and the Beanstalk is still a good image for children for the little ones, even if I would warn the parents they warn their little hedgehogs not to imitate the young master Stollery.
