This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has everything you can hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a bad villain and lots of adventures. The story begins in Paris, where the aristocat Duchess and his three kittens live with their mistress in a villa. Life is perfect for them until the proud butler of the Mistress Edgar discovers that she intends to leave her whole fortune to the cats. He realizes that if he even has a chance to claim his fortune, cats will be out of the way. An excellent, often forgotten masterpiece of the 1970s - a time when the Disney studio produced few animations - which contains songs such as the title "The Aristocats" and "Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat", will enchant young viewers and old with its lasting jazziness.
