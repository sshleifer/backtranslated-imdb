Probably the best comedy in a long time. makes you laugh nonstop! the acting is good and there are many hilarious cameos like Ben Stiller like the guy from the guitar shop. The plot was not as good as I had hoped, but the comedy compensates for everything. I can only hope for a sequel because it seems they can still do much more. Even if 1 hour and 40 minutes have passed, in the end I wanted even more :) Also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie !! I recommend it to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely suggests it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should also buy the album, the songs are so damn appealing and fun, the music on it is also Top Notch.
