This film is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today. The story is so well built, it almost seems like it's happening across the street, right now! If you are connected with your family and the community in any way, this film will capture you and transport you to Travis's home and will not allow you to leave until the credits are finished. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often involuntarily, lead us along a path of pain, confusion and isolation. The Travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invite each of us; father, mother, brother and sister, in their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that simply do not stop. We see all of the above and ultimately joy, in the powerful performances of the main actors and the rest of the cast, making this film a real treasure for the movies. <br /> <br /> In a film as well done as this, it is usually difficult to find something special, but the portrait of Sandy Travis by Sigourney Weaver was exceptional. I would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such. <br /> <br /> Clearly a 10. Well done!
