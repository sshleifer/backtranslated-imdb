If you don't mind the subtitles, you like comic and really interesting characters, along with a taste of something different from mainstream American cinema, then take the opportunity and rent this movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, (a very neurotic sweater, the other the solitary and very silent type) who works for a jolting butcher in a small Danish town, decides to start his own business and open up themselves a butcher shop. Initially they are not successful, they incorporate something new into their recipe and become an instant hit with the village. <br /> <br /> Being an interesting story in itself, this witty film is intertwined with even more (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) which makes this film so fun and full of numerous and subtle interests which make it so interesting from the point of view of fun and at the same time warm and confusing. <br /> <br /> It is important to mention the characters created and the actors that make them credible. You can have the best script, if the characters are not credible, it can sink a movie and with this, the direction, the acting, the credibility of the character and the story come together so beautifully that they make this film very funny. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to stretch a lil, you want to see something very beautiful yet done a little differently, then I suggest you rent this movie while I'm leaving to find more from the director Anders Thomas Jensen.
