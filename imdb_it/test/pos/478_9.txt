I took this at the Chicago IndieFest and I have to say that you are ALONE more fun than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think. Funny, but sick, twisted, I can't believe he just said that, but it's really so funny. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl, who deservedly won the best actress, is incredible to watch. There's never a moment when you think oh, I'm watching a movie and she's an actress. It's too damn realistic for words. <br /> <br /> Actually there are 2 scenes that I'm still giggling and won't give them away, but in one it's in the bathroom talking about how much it gets paid for performing a certain service and how "awesome" it is . (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing !!!) <br /> <br /> In another he talks about the definition of "sex" of a teenager compared to an adult, and if it is not the most real dialogue I have heard in a movie for a long time, I don't know what it is.
