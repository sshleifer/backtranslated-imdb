I had no idea what I could see watching this old 1940 movie. Anyway, I always like to see Laraine Day, (Katie Lattimer) who plays the younger sister of Jean Muir, (Helen Lattimer) and also of their mother, Billie Burke, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). I thought I would get bored with the story of two sisters and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet Robert Cummings, (Ridley Crane) who has a reputation for being a millionaire playboy who has lots of girls and is a heavy drinker who party all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and he continues to be bombarded by his mind and simply can't drive his car. It is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film that it will surely keep your attention until the end of the film.
