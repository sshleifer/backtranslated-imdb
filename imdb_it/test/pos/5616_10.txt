Although many audio recordings of great musicians like Jascha Heifetz survive, the film or television record is very limited. This is why music offerings like "They Shall Have Music" are such rare gems. While, with modern eyes and ears, one can quibble over the plot, the attentive spectator should put the unique delights of this film in their proper perspective. The plot was designed to attract both young and old viewers of the time, but remains enjoyable to this day. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the viewer of that era. <br /> <br /> I have to discuss with the reviewer that he is complaining about a black and white film, or that they feel obliged to report that their students express such reservations. These are juvenile complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, this should offer an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in film history. Color can, in fact, hinder a good plot or music. For example, the black and white photography of "Stagecoach" by John Ford is, like the photographs of Ansel Adams, an artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Since Heifetz is made of wood, I could not agree more. If you clearly want emotional attitudes, go to a rock concert. The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to move the public, not himself. Heifetz's emotion is transmitted through his way of playing, not through his body language. He had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance from the music and transfer it to his listeners. It is the listener that should be moved, not the artist. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, a reviewer asked to see Heifetz on YouTube play the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, with Frank McHugh in the audience. This is from the 1947 movie "Carnegie Hall", not "They Will Have Music" "Carnegie Hall" is an even greater treasure than many great classical artists in their prime. We are fortunate that there are film producers who, at least in these limited cases, have chosen to show these artists. In it was still an era not completely overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator tripe we get today.
