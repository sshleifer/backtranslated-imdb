*** May contain spoilers *** OK, it was not exactly as expected, indeed it was very different from what I thought it would be, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> I usually don't care too much for that kind of music, but in this film it worked perfectly (I mean it's a rock star) but I still loved Stuart Townsend in this, and Aaliyah, even though he had a small part in the film was fantastic. <br /> <br /> And although Tom Cruise played Lestat in an interview with a vampire, I must admit that I'm glad he rejected the role even though I normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in sequels and stuff gender. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was fantastic and I enjoyed watching it, even though there were parts that could have been better. Great vampire movie.
