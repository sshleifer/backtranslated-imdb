Film viewers often say that great movies must have 3 memorable scenes <br /> <br /> to be considered really great. Broadcast news does not have three, it has twice as much. This film is very well written by <br /> <br /> James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better <br /> <br />. I love this movie for many reasons. It's great because it makes you laugh and makes you cry. <br /> <br /> Albert Brooks has several lines <br /> <br /> and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laughs) "I can <br /> <br /> sing and read, I sing while I read" , with Midnight Train for <br /> <br /> Georgia playing in the background. # 2 (laughs) Telling William Hurt's character that "You really blew the nookie's lid" <br /> <br /> after seeing Hurt's report on the date rape. # 3 (Cried) When Aaron <br /> (A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and she can't finish with Hurt's character because he represents <br /> <br /> all about journalism that Jayne finds contemptible. Finally, # 4 (laughs) who can forget the scene where Aaron <br /> <br /> anchors the weekend's news .... hilarious. This film should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love in <br /> movies, great acting, smart script and even a cameo by Jack Nicholson <br /> <br />!
