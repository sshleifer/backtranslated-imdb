Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not slip into the highest gear until the last 25 minutes or so, but when the action reaches maximum speed, it offers some really amazing martial arts scenes that require the viewer's attention. Doesn't this mean that the first hour has no value ?? except that compared to the final fight-fest, it seems a bit overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Does the plot revolve around Yuk-Su, a talented artist who dreams of being a hero ?? just like the ones he depicts in his drawings When Yuk-Su saves a young maid, Siu-Yu, who is sold to prostitution, incurs the wrath of his evil boss, Wa. Led by Sonny, a scorpion-style kung fu master, Wa's hunters chase Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su's father intervenes but is injured. After being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders, the three end up hiding in a noodle restaurant owned by their friend, Master Yat. <br /> <br /> Yuk-Su learns to cook noodles, but also regularly sneaks in to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of Jean, the muscular carcass teacher who saved them. When Master Yat has to leave for work, Yuk-Su is left at the head of the kitchen; however, he goes out to practice his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to serve the customers. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the spaghetti being served, they throw the restaurant into the trash. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su came out of stealth, he tells him that he should learn kung fu from him; it transpires that Master Yat was a killer of the triad, until he decided to try to change his ways. Under the guidance of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves his skills, even learning the art of football without shadows! Eventually Yuk-Su will have the chance to try to become a true hero when his friend, Fatty, announces that his maid has also been sold for prostitution. With Jean, they go to visit Wa pretending to be a French brothel in search of new women. When Fatty's maid is introduced to them, they accidentally blow their stratagem and finally the action gets underway in grand style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is heavily beaten by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. Upon returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su finds him on fire; and worst of all, the bad guys found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to the place of Wa to try to save Siu-Yu ... Despite some rather amusing training scenes, the slow accumulation of the final action at Wa's house is rather too pulled out and devoid of serious fighting scenes. It is a pity that the tedium was not interrupted by a decent gap halfway, rather than saving all the juicy things until the end. <br /> <br /> The last battle, however, is worth the wait in the end; Won Jin makes a stunning performance as the high Sonny kicks, moves, turns and turns with extraordinary skill and dexterity, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid performance as Yuk-Su, the artist who became a fighter. Also particularly good is the old-school kung fu star Lau Kar-Leung (AKA Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat, demonstrating that this veteran still has what it takes to kick ass! Although not a perfect movie, Operation Scorpio has enough exceptional action in its final to guarantee a vision for sure. <br /> <br /> NB. I may have been wrong some names. My DVD calls characters with names other than those listed on IMDb.
