This film has two new features in relation to the message transmitted by other equally good films about the death penalty and executions. Those are the stress also given to the drama endured by the parents of the victims - without thereby masking the hatred and desire for revenge that they feel or diminish the horror that the execution represents - and the Christian vision of all the implicit questions. We must also point out that in this film the condemned man is not the usual sympathetic innocent we see in other films dealing with executions that do not lead us to abandon the idea that a criminal execution is nothing more than a legal murder anyway. Last but not least, we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight placed in the last moments of the executive course with all the catharsis shown by the last words of the condemned and the detail with which the act of execution itself is seen in a parallel cut with images of the scenes of the murder in the forest to emphasize that we are faced with another murder so ruthless as the latter, but executed in a cold and supposedly "legal" way.
