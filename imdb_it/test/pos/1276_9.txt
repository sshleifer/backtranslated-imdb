Chris Nolan's labyrinth as the noir on voyeurism and identity is amazing from beginning to end. A first film is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", although it may be a little more difficult to manage. And yet it has a taste of originality and creative drive, and has an intellectually stimulating "twist" as it is a realistic mush. Few directors made good use of their editors and paid attention to Nolan's narrative. The story is about a bored writer who loves to follow random strangers in the street, until he follows someone, who has noticed him following others, and followed him into tern, from there the complexity intensifies and the identities begin to regroup. More natural and realistic than Nolan's subsequent work, but just as clear.
