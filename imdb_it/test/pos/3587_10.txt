The Blue Planet series is, without doubt, one of the greatest documentaries ever made on the ocean. For five years, the directors have been working tirelessly on the series, getting movies that have never been seen by anyone (for example in the title, The Deep.) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this series. Seeing the fisherman outside the small images shown in textbooks is really a pleasure, but just a needle in the huge haystack of the sea that covers Blue Planet. From the open ocean to the tide pools, from the coral seas to the darkest part of the ocean itself, the BBC takes the viewer on an almost magical journey across the ocean. <br /> <br /> I must admit that one of my first dreams in life was to be a marine biologist, and after seeing this series, the dream was revived. I have been studying the oceans of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries on coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But in all, nobody has managed to capture life under the waves as well as this group of people. <br /> <br /> Watch the "Blue Planet" series in its entirety, I promise you won't regret it.
