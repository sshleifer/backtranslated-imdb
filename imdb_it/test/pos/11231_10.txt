A dreamlike and incredibly evocative film takes place in a small town of Northfork, Montana in 1955. Government officials arrive to evacuate the city that is about to be flooded with a new hydroelectric dam. There are other visitors in the city, the angels of another time, but they are seen only by a dying boy Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a silent, harrowing performance) takes care of the boy. Irvin implored the angels to leave the place with them ... <br /> <br /> There is an otherworldly quality in the film, a dignified mourning and a sublime sadness when suddenly you realize the inevitable purpose of everything - the humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the last solitude. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the film that struck me in the same way and deeply as "Northfork", the film so beautiful and tender, so silent and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. Even now, after several weeks since I saw him, tears come to my eyes when I think about it. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a PM to one of my friends and asked "Please tell me what I just saw?" And my friend replied with the words: "You have just seen one of the greatest films of modern times, one of these days will see the light".
