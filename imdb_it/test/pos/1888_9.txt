I saw it last night and was laughing out loud throughout the second part of the film. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything, but when the film transforms and becomes crazy, it becomes really extravagant. Just one funny scene after another. My Mr. Campbell and crew hats for pulling it off on such a small budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q&A, which was a pleasure. Many of the questions people asked were rather lame, but Bruce would have turned on them and it would have been sarcastic. It was fantastic! Anyway, he loved the movie. I look forward to seeing it on DVD later this year. B sure to check it on the Sci-Fi channel this fall. I highly recommend this.
