It's worth looking at Reader's Digest. Or time, if it was the original source of the article that served as an alleged inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adoptive girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Ratnam paints a classic that plays as much as she scolds, to which she cares about everything she claims and preaches as much as she practices. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? The premonitory darkness that precedes a new conflict in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic family of a family run by an engineer-driver and an authentic bad girl? Or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredible and sinister events and ideologies? Regardless of how you look at it, this film deserves to be in your collection, if you happen to like Mani Ratnam's compelling dramas. <br /> <br /> Ratnam is a master of the past in merging imaginary stories into real-life episodes and in this film, he exudes class in adapting two real-life stories into one. I will not go into history because it is seen more than read. But what I will dwell on is the impact it has had on me and because, for all the warfare that happens in this world, it cannot destroy that simple but inexhaustible force called hope. <br /> <br /> Innocence, in its purity, cannot comprehend the complex desires of adult decadence and greed. Nor does he recognize the dangers when he is accompanied by the fierce determination to look for what he wants. It is such innocence that it drives Amudha to look for her biological parents, despite warnings that could be lost in the cauldron of civil war. Having survived a terrifying experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize he is a more lethal disguised entity, Amudha attaches herself to her cause in a way that destroys the resistance of her supporters. And finally, when the two meet, mother and daughter, the meeting is so tense of emotions that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears. Helped by a coruscating background of A R Rahman, the following scene is poignant to melt even the hottest hearts: a list of questions that Amudha must ask the biological mother. In a dramatic climax like the sequence of incidents resulting from it, a child discovers his mother, alive in the body but lost in the spirit. With the overwhelming awareness that he has no hope of staying with what he bores, Amudha does to the adoptive mother what the title of this film means: a kiss on the cheek. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, the path is clearly illuminated by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has the gift of extracting spectacular shows from famous little artists, but this should not detract from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With a skilled cast of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the beautiful Nandita Das (Shyama), she embellishes the scenes in almost all the frames she is in. The music may not be as memorable as Rahman's other offerings, but nevertheless it didn't stop him from getting another national award for the best musical direction. "Vellai Pookal" is an ode to the need to love human life as it is for nature. The dialogues are first class (try the touching exchange of Amudha and Indira on the swing, shortly after the revelation that she is not the biological daughter of Indira) and the cinematography, superb. <br /> <br /> This film is a clear statement of abandoning arms as much as respecting life and human expressions. Don't judge it as a film lesson; you will only lose one of the best in the Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman stable.
