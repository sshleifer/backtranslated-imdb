The Ator series is a brilliant example of what the B movies should be. They fail in every respect, but in such an exhilarating way that they are fun rather than sad. "Ator the Invincible 2" aka "The Blade Master" aka "Cave Dwellers" shows us the favorite Conan clone in Europe, Ator where we left it in the first movie, after showing us a long summary of all the events of the first movie . This time the world must be saved from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on the screen as a bright light (I imagine they could not afford a support). This includes invisible attackers and samurai. As with the first film, a lot of repertory material is used (including a rather obvious piece of "Star Wars"). Completely ridiculous and incredibly bad: this is a B-movie exception.
