I came across this film while flipping through the canals on the teevee late at night. He continued to maintain my interest about twenty years later, due to the important real-life lesson that teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And even if it tells a true story that takes place in the Second World War, it is extraordinarily about the bad things that happen in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought that "ethnic cleansing" as it is called today, has something to do with race or ethnicity, you will think differently after seeing this story. I imagine I was rather naive in thinking that evil follows any set of prescribed rules. Evil is like evil. <br /> <br /> This film teaches a valuable lesson, and I especially recommend it eg. ecclesiastical groups or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I don't expect it to be too easy to find and rent, but I would really like to see it again, because there is an incredible scene in which it offers a totally involuntary but interesting look at the trivial complexities competition authority ". In this scene, the protaganist, who was taken prisoner by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, is "discovered" by an SS racial authority and inaugurated in a room. There the two play a sort of game of riddles, in which the SS officer is able to determine where our hero comes from (the character of Anthony Quinn) and where his ancestors come from. Well, "come and find out" that Quinn's character is not a member of an "inferior" race, but on the contrary, he is a perfect, architectual Aryan! Which doesn't mean much to the character of Quinn, who is more interested in talking about the cities, rivers and mountain ranges that the SS boy had just named ... However, being a perfect Aryan archetype has its advantages. Among other things, she leaves her job in a slave factory where she wears striped rags, and in a slave modeling job where she gets to wear custom-made Nazi uniforms. Yes, it's definitely a better concert for a guy who has always appreciated wearing good clothes ... until the arrival of the allied armies and recognizing his face from the magazine covers. <br /> <br />
