This film must be as close as possible to perfect a film like John Ford did. The film is magical, a masterpiece, the reason Ford was, well Ford. If you want to know why Ford was fantastic, that explains it. <br /> <br /> Photography, of course, is superb, in black and white as black and white should be, wonderful shots, not a conversation over the shoulders, pure Ford, great moments, large and small. The famous Ward Bond ripped trousers. Apparently two dogs continued to invade the set and fought so Ford wanted to use them in the fighting scene, but instead of fighting a dog fled and the other attacked Ward Bond and tore off his pants, which led Ford to the end of happiness. A whole scene around braiding a rope. The way Ben Johnson burns then sniffs his rope, a wonderful omen and anticipation of the final. The ingenuous courtship of Harry Carey on Prudence. The usual ford line on being scared and not showing it. Bond's horse accidentally falls into him and his left into the film. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in that scene. Sir, help any Ford actor who doesn't stay in the character while the camera moves even when a horse falls on you. <br /> <br /> A couple of very sweet novels, which don't intrude into the whole focus, two very nice ones, not to mention the girls, the number of times the cameras focus on the rather delightful side by Ben Johnson. <br /> <br /> Many old-time stuntmen take lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful characters study mainly fixed faces, all the bad guys and the main stars. A set of villains to rival any group in any western. <br /> <br /> Many many forensic shots of faces, groups, children, women, small things that happen, foals in the background (Ford seems to love the images of foals), women in aprons, who leave the moment while the carts they cross the rivers and the camera lingers. <br /> <br /> Probably not as western as the image of an artist in the west. <br /> <br /> Lucky, the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine that such a film could ever be made again, but then it is a work of art that would be a sacrilege to prove it
