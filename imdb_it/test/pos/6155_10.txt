I saw this film in Wales in July. This is the courage of the Czech pilots who have flown numerous missions for the RAF after their country was occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place in the early 1950s, when these pilots were beaten in the political prisons of Czeckoslavakia and during the Second World War in Britain. They were imprisoned after their return home because the communist regime considered these warriors a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. Pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a subplot of love that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers have made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with the financial support of the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
