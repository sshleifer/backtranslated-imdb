This is a surprisingly large low-budget Horror / Comedy, it's fun and well done, with good performance and a really cool ending! All the characters are fantastic, and the story, although not original, is very good, besides Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) they had a fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments in the movie for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there, and decides to take the ap * ss in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is simply sexy! Also, this is one of the best low-budget horror movies I've seen in a long time. It's very gory, but in a comical way, and I thought it was very well written, besides Michael Bailey Smith he is as fantastic as the Monster Man and had a wicked trick! It is similar to movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc. Etc. And it has some suspense moments here and there, plus the gore effects are really well made for the most part. This is a surprisingly large low-budget Horror / Comedy, it's fun and well done, with good performance and a really interesting ending, I highly recommend this! The management is very good! Michael Davis does very well! I work here, with excellent photographic work, good angles, good use of colors and the use of a fantastic environment, and he has kept the film entertaining and at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood! . We make extremely bloody nose bleeds, bloody impalers, bloody stabbings, the guy is cut in half by a monster, human remains in a cooked stew, guts everywhere, guts of men fall, pencil in the eye, bleeding throat, lots of people go around without limbs, a dead and bloody squirrel, heads are crushed, limbs cut, bloody and mangled corpses, a fair amount of bloodshed, a very bloody scene at the end and much more! <br /> <br /> Acting is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here like Adam, he was a nerd but very nice, he had a fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, he had interesting lines, and I loved his character, he also seemed to be having fun, and he was especially good at the end! Justin Urich is excellent as a best friend's ass, but I couldn't help loving him since he was very funny and he often stole a lot of scenes, I really dug him! Aimee Brooks is beautiful, and she did great things with what she had to do, she had a good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was particularly good at the end, since I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is as wonderful as The Monster Man, he was very creepy, he had exceptional makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers! The rest of the cast is fine. <br /> <br /> Overall I highly recommend this!. *** 1/2 on 5
