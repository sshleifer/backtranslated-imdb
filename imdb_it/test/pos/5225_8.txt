Today it is quite revealing to see this and appreciate how far we have come in what we expect from the movies, and at the same time appreciate the way many basics have been established. <br /> <br /> Here we have a full narrative film to all intents and purposes - the audio and images are pushed to the limits of their period. The framing is limited to around the high belt and upwards - without close-ups. <br /> <br /> The compositions are remarkable; there is a transverse cut scene over the shoulders to show the dialogue; there is an insidious descent into a canyon with some angles of perspective; a skeleton bleached by the sun lies in the dust while the wheels and the legs march in the upper part of the frame; the tension in the clash between the hero and the villain is visually captured by filming over the long axis of a large tree that lies between them; and back and forth - the first visual tricks abound. <br /> <br /> Today, it is disturbing to see young Wayne bring a movie, devoid of ego or mannerism. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Walsh has recognized self-reference: the subject is the journey of a heterogeneous group of pilgrims; those that appear on the screen are a heterogeneous group of theatrical actors, vaudeville comedians, shell game artists and, probably, pretty barkers and veterans of the ten in one show. They all travel together to trace a path on how the films would have been made. <br /> <br /> It is worth at least a vision to appreciate the source of many visual ideas borrowed in subsequent films.
