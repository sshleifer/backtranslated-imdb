I saw this film on television as SCREAMERS and I loved it. I heard an interesting story about this film. When Roger Corman released it for drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent an advanced trailer that wasn't actually a movie of the movie. It was presumably the footage of a naked woman being chased by a monster lab. During the opening of the movie at the drive-in, angry customers complained that they didn't see the movie they paid to watch. The theater owners called Corman and said that their customers felt robbed. So Corman had to escape copies of the film and send the positive film to the theater owners to join the film. Since the movie was never part of the negative film, it did not appear in any video, DVD or television broadcast. Has anyone ever seen this video? Anyone who has seen this movie during a drive-in in the summer of 1981 remembers this?
