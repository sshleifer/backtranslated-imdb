I just had to add my comment to increase the average on this. Paul Giamatti leaves everything suspended in this and is a real hoot. He would probably say that it was easy, but he did a really good job and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy 4 1/2 now and girl 9) will watch it over and over again, and the humor is adult enough that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I run on TV for the really fun parts). Simple moral message, lots of decent action and disgust, "bad" adults who behave superfluously, the slightest bad language and minimal jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard.
