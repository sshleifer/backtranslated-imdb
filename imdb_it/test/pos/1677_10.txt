I see many films in the cinema (103 so far this year) and I must say that this is by far the best film I've seen this year, even though it was released in 1954! <br /> <I sat in awe and saw this work of genius and was ashamed of never having heard of it before my local art cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print. <br /> <br /> The best part of the entire film must be the 28-minute break in which there are no speeches and music, but only the sound of the men performing the shot. Pure quality <br /> <br /> Although very dark, in some places, it is lightened by dry humor. <br /> <br /> Not many films mark 10 out of 10, but this does yes and also gets a gold star for the effort !! <br /> <br /> If you've ever had the chance to watch this movie, please don't hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
