The working title was "Do not Spank Baby". <br /> <br /> Wayne Crawford went on to become a successful producer, films like Valley Girl, Night of the Comet and others, although he wasn't too formidable in this little gem. And the little-known Abe Zwick should have gotten tons of work from this movie, but he didn't. Filmed at the Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, the first Tarzan films were shot on the same lot. This film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The film was originally shot with scenes of nudity and much more graphic. For reasons known only to Tom Casey, the director, the bloody flogging scenes received an LSD card and the nudity was removed. Although this version is worthy of a look for those so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have filled the punch needed to make this a complete Slasher 70 Cult Classic.
