This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends a year in Barcelona. At that time, under the influence of all new impressions, it changes and grows. Upon his return, he has a much clearer vision of his life and eventually takes it into his hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most moving films I've ever seen, and the reason is probably that I was in a very similar situation. I come from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a completely accurate representation of what an Erasmus semester in Spain will do to you. From what I've heard the story is autobiographical, and that's probably why it's so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some examples (moderate notice from SPOILER) - Xavier shares an apartment with other students from Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks EXACTLY like all the Erasmus shared apartments I saw in Madrid. The main characters are well developed and some funny scenes are born from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish host is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who remained in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all reports are interrupted during an Erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). - There is a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy, her roommate from England who is kind of "not cool", to hang out with everyone else. It finally succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of her life. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about this film is that it is truly trilingual: the students in the apartment speak Spanish or English and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girl. There are subtitles so everyone can understand what is being said. I certainly hope that this film is never nicknamed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that for non-Erasmus students this is simply a funny comedy, but for all my Erasmus friends I can only say: this is YOUR film! If you haven't seen it, do it. But prepare yourself for some feelings of nostalgia ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
