I haven't seen it for years but when I was about 6 I saw it for the first time on VHS and I must have seen it at least 10 times. now as I said it was a bit so I could have ruined the plot, but I remember that some Colombian terrorists took a preparatory school hostage with requests for the terrorist leader (the "wishmaster") father to be released from prison. now I could just check the plot here on IMDb but I'm pretty sure it's right. In any case, a group of school kids decide that they won't stop and wait to die, so they decide to fight back. this film has always been stuck in my mind. there are so many images that I have not forgotten as the scene of Joey's death (I think?) or spitting billy in the terrorist sandwiches or the false asthma attack of children (without knowing his name). just a great movie. they could be films like this that gave me my tolerance for violence in films because, if I remember correctly, this film is rather graphic. guys who are mowed down by helicopter guns, a hand of special people that is blown up by a grenade (I'm not sure about that, but I seem to remember something like that towards the end) and the most bloodthirsty is the main terrorist he is hooded in the head in bloody detail. great action, great humor, good acting, wonderful cinematic experience. I have to see it again after all these years!
