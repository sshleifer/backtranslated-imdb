One of the best products for biopic TV, I just wish he had told us more. I read many biographies and saw other things about Carpenters, and this film did what it could, based on the constraints that the family imposed on it. Cynthis Gibb did a great job trying to create Karen. One of my disappointments is that there was no more understanding of Karen's anorexia. In the reading I made of the illness (in particular the wonderful book by Cherry Boone O'Neill, Starving for Attention), anorexia appears to be a disease of control. Karen saw her weight as something she could control in her life. He felt he was being controlled in every other aspect of his life. Don't get me wrong, I thought he really loved music, but he felt he had little control over his career. He really loved his family, but they didn't express it well, and he didn't know how to let his family understand. The film could have touched much more on this. I treasure the music I have of carpenters and I would still be alive to contribute more to today's music.
