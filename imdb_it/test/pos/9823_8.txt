Like many others, I had been attracted by the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I liked the work of Pollack and Ford on Sabrina, a well-made film and a careful rewriting of the old material. Upon hearing that this film was in production, I ordered and read the book. It immediately seemed that this would be a more difficult story to film. The characters are not always funny, there is little or no humor and the author makes numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his main theme: that, since everyone would see the other as the only one to share the unique combination of loss and betrayal caused by the plane crash, the completely surprised adulterous spouses would have sought each other out. Furthermore, imagine that the resolution could reach both through a bitter exploration of the hidden lives of adulterers and that this experience of "thick and thin" could produce a deeper love than they had before. Although much of the book is about their bitterness and their constructive hatred towards their former partners, acceptance and forgiveness are eventually found. The screenplay of the film preserves only the plane crash and the difficult situation of the spouses. Where the woman is the aggressor of research in the book, he is the man in the film and the woman is never a sought-after co-researcher. The film has a completely new dramatic subplot for Harrison Ford, which seems even more elaborate than the plane's double coincidence. Even the "congresswoman up for re-election" subplot for women is new, yet it works better. The public cannot meet the expectations of pure romanticism or romantic comedy because this story focuses on a very bitter pill. Where resolution and forgiveness are achieved in the book, however, by lifting the weight of bitterness from the reader and allowing levity, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although forgiveness is never mentioned, we are left to suppose that healing after a shootout is double duty. The Ford character doesn't have to be such an uninspiring man, and Scott-Thomas's change of accent is a little disconcerting in the beginning. This film is not the loss lost suggested by others. It is, however, a difficult film to appreciate because the rewriting and adaptation to the screen are lower than the standard previously achieved by the director's cast.
