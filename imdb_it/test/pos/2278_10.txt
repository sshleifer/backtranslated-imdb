You must love baseball, and you must at least look like Tom Selleck, but if you meet these criteria you should enjoy this movie thoroughly. Selleck plays the former Major League star who finds himself swapped (?) In Japan while his career shrinks. A really well thought out and fascinating look for Japanese habits and behavior. Great supporting performances by Selleck's manager ("Japan's Clint Eastwood"), his friend Takanashi and his performer. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very well, this is really a nice romantic movie aside from baseball. Look for Haysbert as a playmate long before he became a persistent shill for Allstate. The film closes very well. Easily in my first fifty films of all time and perhaps my favorite in baseball.
