Lovingly elaborate and terribly interesting to see Garfield's gritty and revolutionary performance (introducing a new kind of rebel acting style that would have moved to the Brandos and Clips and so on after the war) but all that fraternal affection is a bit suffocating . Priscilla Lane is a brilliant and engaging performer, but the other sisters don't really register (although everyone is allowed to be crusty and funny) and I had trouble buying any of the other male characters besides Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough actor, but he lacks the weight of the movie star to live up to Garfield's misfortune, Mickey Borden, and it throws a little out of the movie. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone in the part.) Also, I was not convinced that Garfield would have taken the fundamental (to say the least) final decision he had made. The film needed another half an hour to better explain that action; he seems terribly rushed and unmotivated. <br /> <br /> However, it is not difficult to understand how someone who grew up with this photo would remember him with affection. It is not a classic, but contains some classic moments. The two swinging scenes are pure cinematic magic.
