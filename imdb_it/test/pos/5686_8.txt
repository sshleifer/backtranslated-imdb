Black Water, co-directed and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is very simple in its execution but effective. The film is a low-cost Australian film that unfortunately won't get the recognition it deserves because, as far as the characteristics of the creatures are concerned, this is one of the best around. The configuration is rather basic; Grace, her husband Adam and her younger sister Lee are visiting some mangroves in the Northern Territory when a saltwater crocodile spins their boat and leaves them stuck in the trees. The whole film talks about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting for a strike. Apart from the Rogue by Greg McLean (another killer croc film released in 2007), Black Water is not for the public that likes to guess who will be eaten later, it is about hope and prayer that the three people will safely go out . <br /> <br /> The three unknown actors do a great job with quite challenging roles, considering that it was shot on the spot with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. Suspense is built throughout the film, we don't see many creatures, but knowing it's close is pretty terrifying. It is seat material and highly recommended if you like original and (especially) scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
