This fact-based television drama, mostly routine, gets a boost from Cole's good performance. This is the story of a highly trained military, unhappy with his wife and children, pretending his death and running off with the other woman. To support her the way she is used to, she kidnaps the banks. Predictable, but not a bad watch.
