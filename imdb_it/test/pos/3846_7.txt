A group of cats tries to find their way home after being abducted by an avid butler. <br /> <br /> Aristocats are considered one of Walt Disney's best 2D animations with its fascinating script and interesting characters, but they don't do enough to have the magic that created Snow White or the Jungle Book. <br /> <br /> The slow opening will cause younger spectators to raise their eyebrows, but once the cats have settled in the story, the fun and entertainment begins. /> <br /> Young cats create maximum enjoyment with a fascinating rivalry with a young heart, the special kind of bond with any brother or sister of any age they can associate. <br /> <br /> It is not the funniest picture of Disney there, but there are some great comic moments, especially involving cats and dogs. The representation of gangster cats is very impressive and just as funny. <br /> <br /> The story, after the boring start, is constantly fun and exactly what a family film should be. There are almost no mistakes and there are no boring moments. The journey to find a home is interesting and you have the feeling of exploring, not to mention two very strange British swans. <br /> <br /> With Disney, you always receive a strong and meaningful message. With the jungle book is where you belong, with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. However with this image of 1970 there seems to be something missing. The film has the importance and relevance of the house but it is not cemented enough; seems very far-fetched and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My sister and I found it very strange to see this while some of the main characters were voiced by the jungle book cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the bad start and confusion of his preaching message, this is a fun family film with a good soundtrack and some fantastic crazy characters that viewers of any age can identify with.
