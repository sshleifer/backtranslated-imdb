This film shows that you don't need a Hollywood budget to do something fun to watch. What struck me is how the crew of different locations was able to get together without promises of wealth to do something just because they believed it. I think that anyone who makes low-budget films can look at certain scenes as actors who can't get that line, being bothered by the police, and most of the crew disappearing after the first week. No one was paid for this, which says a lot to the people who had to go through the country and for the long hours spent editing. After seeing Stuie sell his personal property, use his money and throw away his house to make the movie, I'm a little curious to know how close his wife could have gone to leave. Good job everyone.
