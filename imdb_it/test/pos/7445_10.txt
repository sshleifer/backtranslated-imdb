Didn't you play the game? Don't worry This is for Final Fantasy VII fans out there who beat the game, and nobody else will appreciate this rare gem of a movie. Want to watch it and love it? Buy the game, beat it and then watch it. When was the last time you saw an excellent movie based on a video game? Well, that's all. <br /> <br /> The story takes place two years after the game and no brief summaries are given to refresh the memory (although I doubt that many would forget), and it will go immediately in the hour and forty-one minutes of adventure. <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters are there, including Cait Sith. The dubbing is superb in the Japanese version, each character is expressed perfectly. Cloud sounds hard and dark, Tifa sounds kind but strong ... Aeris is also perfect, it sounds exactly as I imagined. Cait Sith looks less cute than I imagined, but it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The character models are spectacular, great textures and lights. The environments are breathtaking and the battles are choreographed in a way to make The Matrix blush. For example, the camera's fantastic work goes through bike chases, where your eyes are simply screaming with satisfaction and your lungs breathing heavily without consent. <br /> <br /> Music is typical of Uematsu quality, which means it's the best. The familiar pieces are redone to accompany the graphic jump of Advent Children, which integrates very well with the visual aspects. There is also a joke for fans that involves music, it will make you smile for sure. <br /> <br /> I haven't looked at it with subtitles since I'm half-Japanese so I can't say that the subtitles are good. In Japanese, however, the dialogue is very good and every word seems to come from real living beings, not just actors. Impressive. I'll watch it again one day with subtitles to see the differences since I played both the Japanese and the American versions of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie the day it comes out or pre-orders it. If you haven't played the game but want to watch this movie very badly, don't waste time: buy the game, beat it and then come back for this DVD. I won't tell you not to look at it, but to play. It will make the experience much better and won't leave you in the dust scratching your head. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends: it's time to return to an adventure with your brave companions!
