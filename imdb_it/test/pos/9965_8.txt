Michael Radford, the director of "The Merchant of Venice", does a tremendous job of opening up comedy, as it makes it more accessible to everyone to have fun in the cinema by watching this thorny tale of a horrible period in history. The succulent production of Shakespeare's work is a feast for the eyes with its rich details of 16th century Venice. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by William Shakespeare. Having seen the game a few times, we were not prepared for what to expect. Mr. Radford is responsible for presenting the story in such detail that it can be easily understood by all. Furthermore, he used a more meaningful version of English rather than relying on the original text. In fact, the way Shylock talks in the film is not a shock at all, as he, a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> At the tremendous Pacino the portrait of Shylock shows a vulnerable, arrogant, vengeful, petty and totally human man, all at the same time. Mr. Pacino sheds light on the character of the man who is defeated in court by a quirk. His own daughter left him and his whole world seems to get away with him. At the end of the film, we see a man who has been reduced to the goal of everyone's hatred and ridicule. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, like Portia is a happy discovery. Having seen it in a lighter way, it not only surprises, but makes the best of its role and its time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a woman with a high intelligence, who comes to the aid of her husband and her best friend, who risked his own well-being in trying to help Bassanio take Portia's hand. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man looking for Shylock for a "bridge loan". After all, he knows that his ships will soon return with fortunes from abroad. Antonio gets much more than he contracted to agree the terms of the loan with Shylock. Antonio's best plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons gives a subtle performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes, makes a good appearance as Bassanio. Her good looks and her charm make an impression on Portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young Venetian, since she knows that he is the one for her. Moreover, in minor roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson, Charlie Cox, contribute to making the film a pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is the triumph of Mr. Radford because of the vision he offers us of Venice and its citizens during a horrible period in the history of humanity.
