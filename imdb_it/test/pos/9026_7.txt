This film will not win any prize for greatness. But if you have an hour and a half free and want some light entertainment, then you could do a lot worse than watching this ... <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly young and cute, the script has some really fun moments and even the soundtrack is very beautiful. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems to have fun, while Laura Fraser as Justine is sweet, funny and fun. I rented it because I like the "Spooks" series that RPJ is currently playing And here he is, he's young and passionate and the perfect candy for girls in one night. <br /> <br /> Grab some wine and ice cream and giggle.
