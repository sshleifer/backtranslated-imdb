Daisy Mudge From beyondhollywood.com <br /> <br /> On paper, "Daisy" sounds like a fan dream of an Asian movie become reality, directed by Andrew Lau, co-director of "Infernal Affairs" and interpreted as the Everyone's favorite movie girl, popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent involved, and the fact that the crew turned halfway around Amsterdam, the film turns out to be a bit disappointing, being a romantic and cliché drama that basks in misery and its own importance. <br /> <br /> The plot follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a rather naive Korean girl who lives in Amsterdam, spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists. One day, she starts getting flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer, whom she believes to be a mysterious man from her past who once built a beautiful bridge for her. One day he meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also in "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who unbeknownst to him is actually an Interpol agent who follows Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young assuming that Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. However, it turns out that the man who sends the flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, of "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), a murderer who works for a Chinese criminal union. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic and the two men end up facing each other while poor Hye Young tries to figure out which of them is the love of his life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is apparently a love story, it has the feeling of a funeral, with a slow and gloomy rhythm and a plot that piled up poverty. Half of the film's running time is occupied by scenes of characters staring out the window with nostalgia, with silence broken only by attacks of narrative self-pity. Director Lau seems to have the impression that the film is a heavy Shakespearean tragedy, rather than another dark love story. As such, the acts have a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around dazzling clichés borrowed freely from "Fulltime Killer" and John Woo's classic "The Killer" . <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of the film is full of anguish, with the three protagonists suffering as if the weight of the world were on their shoulders, and firmly refuses to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. Park Yi, in particular, as the type of excessively emotional and socially retarded assassin so loved by modern cinema, is vaguely ridiculous, from his blatant incompetence at work to his hilarious attempts to discuss Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his weakness for floriculture. This languid passivity makes the central novel of the film a bit difficult to digest, and Lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that destiny is bringing characters together is a poor coincidence. <br /> <br /> Fan of Jeon Ji Hyun should note that his character is much closer to his role in the supernatural drama "The Uninvited" by "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck", and while doing his better to pull here and there some strange faces, his performance is certainly more subdued. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from lucid production values, and Lau makes good use of the Amsterdam scenery, playing on the contrast between the gray, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside . Unfortunately, it tends to abuse the slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which when combined with some of the postcard images give the film the feel of a perfume advertisement. There are some scenes of surprisingly violent action, even if these are few and far between, and while well staged, they seem to have been cast as an afterthought and do little more than lift the wrist briefly. <br /> <br /> Despite its flaws, "Daisy" makes the vision compelling, and the story grabs almost in spite of itself, mainly due to a morbid fascination with not seeing which of the men Hye Young will end up with, but to see who will lie by dying in his arms. The self-indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre, and the film works perfectly as a pleasantly polished and whining romanticism. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the DVD presents the cut of the director of the film, which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but rearranges some scenes, making the less linear narration. Although this new version is perhaps too long, it is certainly superior, since without these changes, the film would certainly have been more conventional and would have suffered from an even darker character development. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (screenplay) CAST: Woo-sung Jung ??.
