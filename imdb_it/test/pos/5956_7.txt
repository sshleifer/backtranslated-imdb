I saw him recently in 2007 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, where he ended up among the audience's favorites. This is a parody of the French industry of the OSS 117 films of the 50s and 60s. The first film OSS 117 based on the novel by Jean Bruce was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first James Bond film, with Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six subsequent action films of espionage adventure made until 1970 with Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven all alternate as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin is in the lead role in this comedy about the series. At the beginning of the film, in 1945, he has a French mustache and looks like Desny, but at the beginning of the film it is set in 1955 and really looks like Sean Connery. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this amusing script by a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. He borrows the stupidity of Naked Gun, Get Smart and the Pink Panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that the international public will enjoy and I am sure he will be the only one of others to come of a revised OSS 117 in comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavicius directs. I would give this to 7.5 and recommend it.
