A short Three Stooges, this with Shemp. Of all those who involved Shemp that I saw, this is my favorite performance by him in a Stooges short. The basic plot is that Shemp must marry by 6pm that same evening, if he wants to inherit the half million dollars that a rich uncle left him in his will. So Shemp decides to become a bride but finds a way harder than expected, that is until they learn about her wealth of money. The best pieces here are the shaving of the hemp, Shemp and Moe in a phone booth and Larry at the piano as an accompaniment to Shemp's vocal training session. Also the sequence in which Shemp is exchanged as Cousin Basil and its outcome is exhilarating.
