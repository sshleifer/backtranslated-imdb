There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, even if it's a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore does a great job of being the nerd outcast in this film - excellent casting choice. What I found a little hard to believe is that popular girls finally welcome it - in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that, and knowing how AWFUL Drew was the character (ostrich feathers?) At the beginning of the he would have held them miles away, regardless of the rumors his brother was drumming. (And does Kole Slaw Food really make HIM so popular? I doubt it). As for rooting for Drew's character to win big as a reporter - well, I would have hoped he could have made up a story long before the dance. A little forced. That being said, it was a piece of stuffed animal that will be fun until you expect too much.
