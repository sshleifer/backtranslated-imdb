This is not so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller details of the plot, so I advise you NOT to read this review if you haven't seen the movie, because doing so ruins some surprises for you. <br /> <br /> In a sense A Tale of Two Sisters is far from the original, at least from a purely superficial aspect - part of its iconography is taken directly from Ring or Dark Water, while the plot itself (in particular what Brendt Sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the narrative) recalls movies like Fight Club (the main character interacts with someone created in their mind), Mulholland Drive (the character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic escape), as well as others minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and practically all films under the sun that deal with mental illnesses, in addition to the films of Amenabar (The Others, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (in particular regarding the tortuous nature of memory ), et al. Fortunately, all these similarities have nothing to do with the overall emotional impact of the film, and I personally found A Tale of Two Sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience. <br /> <br /> Many people have commented on the "confused" nature of the narrative, but I have personally found the plot to be fairly explanatory, even if it is partly portrayed in a non-sequential way. The narration becomes confused for some because, in the middle of the third final, the story moves from a purely subjective context (or the distorted perception of Soo-Mi's reality) to an objective, with a flashback at the end that explains Soo's origins - My nervous breakdown and the subsequent mental illness. The shift of emphasis is intended to put some people off guard, but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of the aforementioned Mulholland Drive (although we are not dealing with the perception of a character's reality through a dream but rather with his schizophrenic tendencies - something that, in turn, reminded me of another Lynch film, Lost Highway). To be honest, I don't really consider A Tale of Two Sisters a horror film as such, but rather a tragic story of the collapse of a family as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness (and I hasten to add that fans of the psychoanalytic cinema will love this film. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film of A Tale Of Two Sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films that has seen this side of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. Also the performances are fantastic, without exception, and I expect to see more of the four main actors in the future, not to mention music, but films from East Asia without an excellent soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that some people look beyond the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Due sisters and simply dismiss it as "yet another Asian horror film", unaware of its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytic approach. But then everyone in his own way. If you can ignore some of the trivial aspects of the film and simply take it for what the heart is, that is. an extremely tragic and heartbreaking story, so I see no reason not to recommend it.
