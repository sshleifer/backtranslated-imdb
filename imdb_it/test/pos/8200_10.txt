I read some mutterings on court scenes. These people betray their ignorance. This production went simply in an incredible way to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred. Courteous ways are something that few people off the field ever see. While acting may seem very stylized, it is, in fact, as close as possible to the replication of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations, as the director could create. The actor's facial expressions are a marvel, in particular the duplicate Marquis Changxin and the mother of the King. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, reflections both of the Greek tragedy and of Shakespeare in the relationship between the king, the his parents and his love. The juxtaposition of the king who transforms good from evil and the murderer from evil to good offers many points for reflection on the evolution of an individual's nature. This film would provide much to reflect on a university course on the humanities. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it almost rushes, even in the slowest scenes towards an inexorable epilogue. The involvement of large parts of the troop movements, which were quite terrifying, is suspected. It makes the battle scenes of the Lord of the Rings pale in comparison. Few directors have the opportunity to field literally thousands of humans on the battlefield just for art. I remember a scene where you can see at least 30,000 troops moving across a huge plain. The logistics for such a recovery would have been staggering. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I simply can't recommend this movie enough.
