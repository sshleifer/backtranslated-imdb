If you find that the first 30 minutes of this movie are so slow that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. Furthermore, listening to the Danish language is a bit new to most North Americans, who do not see and listen to many Danish films. However, as the film progresses it has become better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his patience. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the film, "Out Of Africa", this film aroused my interest because it is based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the main character of that film. <br /> <br /> The meal - Babette's party - was fantastic. I'm not a chef, but I was impressed! The way in which history is interpreted also varies, I suppose, depending on what is read in this, and where religion is based. If the latter, as you look at the definition of "legalism" can influence the way you interpret this story. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a good movie, but don't watch it if you're dieting.
