My opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases. I tend to lean towards the artistic, the imaginative and the different. This film is reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion" in which a fantasy situation is created to show the beauty of a magnificent creature that is not readily available to see perform at its peak except on a multitude of natural wing documentaries. Unlike these natural films, this offer uses the best film production techniques that the industry has to offer for a diva, creating one of the most sensual super-stars (the cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy depicting a love relationship that develops between a French soldier (also very nice) lost in the Egyptian desert and a female leopard he meets when he has the chance to enchant an abandoned Egyptian temple. I bought it with all my heart. If you are a little less open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in my book was the ending. It was a perfect set for a Romeo and Juliet finale - which would have taken me over the top. <br /> <br />
