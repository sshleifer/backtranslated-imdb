By today's standards, DI may seem a bit chaotic. Lee Emery's version is more accurate. I graduated from Boot Camp in Parris Island, South Carolina in 1964. Jim Moore is the closest to the real thing you could have on the screen in 1957. I can't comment on the plot but I thought the ending wasn't realistic for MCRD. PVT Owens is like many who found themselves in a much more difficult situation than expected. Like many he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My Drill Intructors was more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. Much more. The DI is more Korean Era and Full Metal Jacket is more Viet Nam Era. Today's movies allow this kind of thing on the screen. I have DI in my collection. I found it only recently on DVD.
