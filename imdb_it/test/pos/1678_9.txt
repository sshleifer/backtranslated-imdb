RIFIFIES (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> For me, it seems like a very risky idea to attempt a Hollywood remake of Jules Dassin's classic RIFIFI 1955. Scheduled for release in 2007, Al Pacino apparently will play the lead role, taking on the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business ... How will they get it out? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and continued to try his luck in France and made this little masterpiece, rightly called by some "The Grandaddy of all kidnapping and abduction movies ". In my opinion, it remains a one-of-a-kind classic, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever staged. Whatever the opinion of the film. <br /> <br /> In the last two years the REFIFY has become dangerously exaggerated. However, this classic French noir should not be forgotten. Go see it, before the remake is out there, so you have some ammo to compare the two. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
