"Tale of Two Sisters" must be one of the most disturbing films I've seen recently. In the end there is no supernatural element, despite what is expected of the whole film. The story seems to concern two sisters who, returning to their father's house after a sort of absence (revealed following a stay in a psychiatric institution) are forced to face not only an apparently schizophrenic and perhaps bi-polar stepmother who lashes out the youngest of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them that she has prepared a special dinner at another time, but a still inexplicable presence. It is later revealed that the younger sister died and exists only in the tormented minds of her older sister, who was unable to save her, and her stepmother, who was insensitive enough to let her die. Much of the detail of the strange family is not revealed in the film, but it certainly leaves a spectator with a disturbing feeling and an annoying hint of confusion. Certainly not the light vision; look at this when you really want to think about what you saw. It's an infernal puzzle.
