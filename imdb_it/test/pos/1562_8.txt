Judith Ivey as the old swindling bitch is fantastic. Emily Grace, the girl. It's innocent and exciting while learning what's going down. Excellent direction and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. The supporting cast is good. Show what happens and can happen with bad luck. Great independent film. Little cast. The pace is slow at the beginning and then moves well. A good movie to show your teenage daughter that she has the aspirations of leaving home early, on the open road and adventure. This film has a low budget, but it works because of the low life and the areas where these people move. I'll never stop stopping again without thinking about this movie and checking my tires before I go.
