I just hope I am eloquent enough to say how GOOD this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll just tell you what comes to mind. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe. I laughed, and it wasn't a bitter laugh. it wasn't a cynical laugh. it was the laughter generated by genuine joy. <br /> <br /> joy. this is a foreign word for me. I don't hear that word often, but, I did while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Will. Maybe it's Will's face. He is a great human being. "Smile on my face and there's a twinkle in my eyes." That sentence in one of Will's songs describes it perfectly. It has "joie de vivre". Trey is a lucky lucky guy to have a dad like Will. Jada is a lucky woman and lucky to have a husband like Will. He's someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I actually feel happy. It's a strange feeling. I don't feel so often. It's so nice to see, to see ... other people are really happy. I mean really happy. In this film, I did it. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm just not happy about 'handsome', maybe I want him 'extraordinary." You know, watching this movie made me think: me too. <br /> <br /> Fun. Be yourself. We all know that we should be ourselves, but we feel as if we were being punished if we did. Perhaps it must be earned. Maybe it's something we show after not being ourselves for a long time. That's why I just loved the ending. Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, Julie Ann emery will all dance at the wedding. Dancing without inhibitions. NO, WE DON'T DRUNK! except, actually be happy. I can understand that, at least, I think I can (at least, I liked seeing them happy, really happy). <br /> <br /> Women and men. I don't know anything about relationships, but, I feel. Looking at this film, I want to get in touch with someone, try hard, push, want to be with someone. It seems to make life ... something else entirely. I really don't know. I'm just guessing. but, I heard something, watching this movie. I thought that that connection must be ... must do, life is worth. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie this is. It is funny. IT'S CLEAR. IT'S TENDER. It evokes feelings. It made me think, maybe, just maybe, life is, it's really, a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Do you want to REPLY? You want to REALLY FEEL GOOD! Do you want to GET ANSWERS ON GIRLS (and the girls, the answers on the boys)? Look at Hitch. TU-WILL-GET-IT-ALL !!! <br /> <br /> GO WILL !!! You are a great human being.
