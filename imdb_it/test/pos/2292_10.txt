I agree with the guy above, it's so funny that I understand everything, but my friends don't understand. Go to Japan and you'll see a different movie after being there. When I met my friends, Dad, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I heard the same thing about Jack. scared, but at the end of the day everything went well, so I gave this film a 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to look on the plane flying in Japan next month. One thing that is really good is the ball game scenes. It makes me feel like I'm back there. This is a must see if you have any interest in Japan and Baseball. Too bad they don't make a sequel. Does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the subject with hirko on the catwalk with a roof over it ???? I need to know so I can win an argument with me ex Japanese wife. Thank you
