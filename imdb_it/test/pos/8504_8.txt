The famous French detective Henri Cassin makes his first holiday in 11 years in St. Margot where he meets Nanette, the daughter of the owners of vacation spots. Although Nanette is promised to the childhood treasure Leon, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to get married, although Nanette's father is opposed because of Henri's age. On their wedding day, Leon returns and Nanette runs after him. Nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead, and Henri vows not to rest until he can find the killer. The only clue Henri must work with is a footprint found by Leon, but he is also receiving written warnings that others will soon die. Soon Nanette's mother is found dead and Henri has no idea of ​​the identity of the killer. Thinking of himself as a failure, he returns to Paris, then realizes (and fears) that the murderer can be a single person, even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. Out of the mystery of ordinary murder that in reality does not follow the formula in others of the genre of Columbia or other B studies. The credit certainly goes to the director Lewis who manages to turn this film into a film noirish despite the setting of the film, also helped by the use of a good camera-work and lighting. Geray turns into a very good performance, probably his only advantage and the rest of the cast is able to bring their performances. Evaluation, 8.
