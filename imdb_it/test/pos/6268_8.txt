God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (as far as cinema is concerned;), science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> This, let's face it, was a little harder to look at, but another fun BAD movie. <br /> <br /> I like how people reward a bad review with "Normally I like bad movies, but ..." No buts, this was a bad movie FOR those who love bad movies. It's one of my best bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a poor man's Conan, but oh what fun. Who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hang glider and a cheesy rubber monster? It's okay to hate this movie if you like Hollywood dreks like "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really, I mean REALLY love for bad movies, watch this. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple of friends around and you're looking for some carefree fun. <br /> <br /> My rating 8/10.
