My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably hopelessly confused with the events that happen in my life when I saw it; This is the first film I saw after just getting a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. The money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between watching a movie in the theaters and paying the bills (or lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I felt at the time was enormous. As a result, my enjoyment of "Italian Job" was probably out of proportion to its actual value. <br /> <br /> Again, I took it on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I always enjoyed it immensely. I've never seen the original (although I've heard it said it's an absolute classic), but its modern counterpart is eminently recognizable if you have a taste for modern production values ​​applied to textures and themes from previous films. <br /> <br /> What initially won me over in this film was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the softer, textured and pleasantly audible soundtracks around. IJ opens with a clever, witty and pulsating arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the first few seconds. And the whole film is like that - I haven't heard this kind of shrill, booming, pulsating soundtrack since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started making soundtracks for films like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen reasons irresistibly marked here, along with some remakes of pop songs ranging from "all right" to "inspired". For the people to whom the soundtrack is important, this film is a delight. <br /> <br /> In the film: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but here is good as a protagonist, and the film does not ask him to do something he cannot do well. He's the weakest "main" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of the supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in one part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron turn into solid, fat-free performances. It seems that Norton is mostly calling him (they say he didn't really want to be in the movie), but it's still natural even at 1/2 power. My only quibble with casting and acting is with the character "Wrench", which seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to fit into the film, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame it a little on the size of the part and the nature of the late character). If I were a cynical guy, I wonder with whom the actor went to bed to be included in this film in such a supernumerary role? Nah, it never happens ... <br /> <br /> Productive values, camera work, stunts, plot ... everything is going pretty well and Gray and his production staff put things together without problems (ad except the "Wrench", see above). <br /> <br /> Dialogue has a pleasant and light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payments along the way. (My favorite moment - when the character of Norton tells Wahlberg's character that he just lost the surprise element, Wahlberg proceeds with the cold Norton cock with a right cross, and then asks him "Were you surprised?" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there ...) <br /> <br /> Obviously the film requires a certain level of "suspension of disbelief" to work, but if you just relax and get on with it (and don't think too much at the cracking mechanisms of a safe submarine, or the likelihood that someone will be able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic through a laptop, etc.), you'll have a fun ride. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job": it is light summer fluff, but it is very good for what it is, and does not try to be anything else. It's not good enough for an "8", but I'd give it a "7.5".
