This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and this alone makes it memorable. Throw Rita Hayworth his love interest and the comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his companion and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleasure, which is exactly how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the "wrong side of the tracks" in the 1940s movies) whose main attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is adorable and also plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother. Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger), who loved and lost Rusty's grandmother. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Danny who cuts Rusty loose, to the detriment of his club, because he has a chance of success that he can't give her. But, of course, it's not what Rusty ultimately wants, because, as usual in the movies of that time, the right man is the only thing in the girl's mind. There are no surprises, but everyone does their thing well. <br /> <br /> Kelly makes the first of his incredible trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window. He was the master in that type of dance, and one must still ask how they scanned everything so precisely that they really seemed to be in two places at once. The melodrama gets a little tight, and there are some free war references launched that do little, but provide the opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes this movie to the next level. It was before it became a mega-star and too smooth, perhaps for its sake. A fundamental aspect of the crudeness of his character gives it a credible and almost perverse appearance. <br /> <br /> The character of Kelly in 1980 "Xanadu" was also called Danny McGuire. This film was the beginning, that movie at the end, of a fantastic race for a dance genius. Clearly, this film meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
