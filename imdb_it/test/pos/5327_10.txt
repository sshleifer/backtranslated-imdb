I'm not Ebert. What I am is compassionate and I never felt more compassion for a fictional character than I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I don't offer a critique, but I see nothing but perfection in this film. I'm sure many of those who watch this movie will never see the same things I do, but if you look hard enough you will probably see something you didn't expect. I read that the character of Leland was imperfect. It seems to me that those who wrote this have not been able to see beyond the question that this film presents. I'm sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers provided by this movie. Open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this Leland P. Fitzgerald show you a world that really has meaning. Exceptional history with extraordinary acting. Ryan Gosling deserves to be discussed.
