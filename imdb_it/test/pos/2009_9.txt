This new Jeskid movie is great! Take a look and you'll be surprised. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a destroyed house, whose only means of escape from a violent father was through her sketchbook. Until one night his designs manifested themselves in reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil. Both the action movie and the hand-drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will make your soul tremble and blow away. Even the music is incredible, it really senses the emotional experience and drags you deep into the conflict. Directed by Jesse Cowell and animated by Erica Langworthy, with the beautiful Marissa Parness, with music by Nico Audy-Rowland, Daniel Collins, Jeff Strathearn, Matt Sisco and Selcuk Bor. Support this film and support Jeskid, he is a very talented guy. Go and see his film Shades of Gray.
