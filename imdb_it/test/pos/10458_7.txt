The film begins almost painfully slowly, a "love story" (yawn) that seems to wander off course (the whole part of the plan ...) Then, about an hour in this solemn movie is The Feast. It is worth paying attention to that first hour. The party is still solemn, but fun. Suddenly, the withdrawn and somewhat petty characters come to life, and all (you and the characters) leave the feeling enriched by the experience. <br /> <br /> Women will love this. Christians of all kinds will appreciate the profound faith shown by the characters. It's not my favorite movie of all time - no dinosaurs or laser beams, after all - but definitely a movie I'm happy to have seen. Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Jim
