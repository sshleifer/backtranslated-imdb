I saw this film when it first came out in 1973 and I loved it. Since then I've been looking for a video but I've never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. I'm sorry to say that it doesn't hold water. This glamorous version cannot reach the production level of 1937. I love the musical score of Burt Bacharach, that is if I listen to it alone, and I even bought a CD, but for my taste it does not lend itself well to this mysterious story and compelling. It just isn't good. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman performs well but Olivia Hussy is simply ridiculous and not worth dragging through the Himalayas. The best interpretation is Charles Boyer as chief Lama.
