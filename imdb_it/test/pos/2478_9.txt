Peter Watkins's Punishment Park, rarely seen, is a brutal, uncompromising political weapon set in an endless desert landscape. An anti-abuse protest party unexpectedly left on the left, the escapades at first seem so over the militarist and nauseating lines that it could come out as a distant dystopian fantastic dystopian story, one that Harry Turtledove might even appreciate. But once we go deeper and pay close attention to the abhorrent diatribe that comes from those who preside over the tented court, in addition to the rifle that guards the bloody guards, our eyes are truly open. Suddenly we realize how far-sighted Watkins' film production is, given that much of this is the kind of neo-con discussion about youth culture and the legality of divergent thinking launched today by politicians. Of course, much of this was drivel which spilled out at that time, but actually shows us how little has changed, and informs us how, somehow, we are closer to a world where Punishment Parks would be a real and scary operation. <br /> <br /> The protagonists of almost all the scenes are non-seasoned actors, chosen mostly for their reckless political opinions and the desire to have them in front of the camera. This gives an unprecedented pile of authenticity to the whole experience, since we never, even for a second, question the reality of all the chaos. Filmed in documentary style with 16mm film, this looks like a gritty documentation of a deplorable government test project that was ranked until we found it years later. At least it seems to have this story now, maybe not so much when it was released (barely). But this gives added weight to all the proceedings and helps you drag yourself into this incredible not-so-alternative universe of torture for convicted dissidents.
