"Five Fingers of Death" is a classic of kung fu cinema from the 70s. Like the film that "blew up" the HK cinema in the west, this is a must see for any fan of the genre. It's also a damn funny movie, with incessant and relentless actions, solid and mostly credible fighting choreographies and a great dubbing of the 70s ("Oh I see ... so you want it THE HARD WAY !! HWAA !!" ). <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers" is a story for revenge eye for eye ... and I mean literally, an eye for an eye! It's nice to see Lo Lieh portray a hero. He played so many great villains later in his career - including Pai Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, which was one of the characters that Tarantino used to create the Pai Mei of KILL BILL. <br /> <br /> My one My complaint is that I wish there was a better quality DVD - mine seems to be a VHS transfer. Overall this is a great movie - don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA.
