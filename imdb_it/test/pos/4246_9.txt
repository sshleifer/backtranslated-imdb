The film begins with a board meeting at a large advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board only because he is black and the agency needs a "token" on the board. Swope ignores the meeting, reads the Jet magazine on the big table and everyone ignores Swope ... Suddenly, the CEO croaks in place. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to drag the corpse away, and the council immediately and unceremoniously faces the business of electing a new CEO. And as the votes are counted one by one, the tension builds up and finally ends in an ironic and ironic climax up to the vote, which gives the viewer a delicious plate of logical implications to be savored for the rest of the film. If you've ever talked about some stupid TV commercials, you'll like to see this movie. Too bad there are no real Putney Swopes in the world.
