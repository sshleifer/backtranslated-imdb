I must say that among all modern Korean martial arts films it is worth trying. He wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop characters, but he had many good ideas. Simple story: an elite soldier who believes himself dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in the medieval days. His counterpart was previously the best friend he had and is now out to stop it. The fighting scenes are all with different swords or weapons and very fun to watch. The motifs of the figures are discovered first towards the end. You may need to look at it again to get all the right connections. And I personally ... I loved the end. I could see it over and over again. Perhaps a little pathetic, but a true story of freedom fighters ... People can be killed, but not the ideas they represent ...
