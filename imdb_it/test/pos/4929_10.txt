This has been one of my favorite movies since childhood. I watched it so many times, my tape ended up worn out. I was a big fan of this show and still am. The thing I love most about this film is that it attracts so many people, young and old. I watch this movie now and laugh as hard as I did the first time I saw it. Now I can appreciate all the adult jokes that I've never had as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my father (a big fan of the film) and I'm still quoting the lines of this film. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. "You save the seats, Shirl and I will grab Dad's snacks." I also liked the plot of Plucky and Hampton and his family going to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of my father. I love the part when they finally arrive at Happy World Land and all they do is get on the monorail. This film is hilarious and appeals to children and teens. The animation, the jokes and all that concerns are of the first order. If you haven't seen it, rent. You will not regret.
