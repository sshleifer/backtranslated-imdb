With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton has succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful film of the year, "Batman" (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, "Batman Returns" has had enormous commercial success. Tim Burton has brought Batman back again because he believes that the latter's victory over his enemy the Joker has done little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is represented by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two cheaters who are eager to take control of Gotham City will make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the appearance of Catwoman ... <br /> <br /> Tim Burton has still done a lot of work on the scenario and seems to have tried to correct the flaws of the first film. It means that the director has given way to fight sequences that are better mastered than the first Batman. But he has not neglected the psychology of his main characters for all this. If Burton had focused on the psychology of Bruce Wayne / Batman in the 1989 film, here is the penguin that obviously interested him. The director tried to make him, played very well by De Vito an ambiguous character. On the one hand, it is full of bad intentions (previously mentioned) but on the other hand, it is looking for its past and would like to be considered a real man. <br /> <br /> "Batman Returns" also appears more insane than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Mich√®le Pfeiffer who offers a bold and powerful performance like Catwoman. Also, when I'm writing this review, it occurs to me that a new version of Catwoman is currently in the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), He is sure that his performer Halle Berry should become insignificant next to Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and allows you to develop the distinctive style of Tim Burton. We also find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. As for the other adaptations of Batman for the screen, you can skip them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I knew that Christopher Nolan was filming the beginning of the Batman story and that it would be released next year. Will it match the works of Tim Burton?
