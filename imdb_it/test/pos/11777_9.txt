I just received the DVD for Hardware Wars, in a brilliant new package, with an irresistible look. Stuck in my DVD player to find lots of extra fun stuff. The extra DVD content is even longer than the movie. For those of you who have (shame!) Never seen Hardware Wars, this is an amazing parody of Star Wars (obviously Episode IV). Appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners and a waffle maker) are distinguished by Ty-fighters, X-wings, R2D2 and the death star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with Cinnabon hairstyle. Get the point, I'm sure. Crazy stupidity, and a fun ride for every Star Wars fan (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now, the DVD - wow! The comment of a director in which, in practice, part for the film, making fun of himself and the project. An interview with Fosselius on Creature Features (remember that?!) And exhilarating "director's cut" and "foreign version" of the film (all of them, of course). Anyway, this is fantastic. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater and I'm so happy to have the DVD in my collection - stuck between MST3K: the movie and Thumb Wars!
