The good news: according to reports, the director is engaged in the cause of Amnesty International and eager to convey a solid message about freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is definitely original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. The not-so-good news: "original" is not everyone's watchword when visiting movies or video stores. Furthermore, well-known critics such as Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a stage drama into a cinematic form. If I remember correctly, the title is taken from the fable that the character of Stowe wrote and made it a possible subversive and suspicious person in the fictional place where the story takes place. His dreams are dangerous for the government, represented here by Rickman as the intense and manipulative interrogator. Since those two people are practically the only ones that appear in the film, the director is a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention. In the end, I found it all fascinating. Not flawless and certainly not for everyone, but gratifying. It is not even remotely a masterpiece like "A short film about killing" by Kieslowski or explanatory like "Dead man walking". But if you like those movies or some Costa-Gavras political thrillers, you might like that too. Just don't expect explicit sermons or sequences of actions that fill you with eyes.
