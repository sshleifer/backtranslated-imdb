The second episode of "Mr. Eko" has less interesting flashbacks than the first ("The 23rd Psalm"), but in almost all other areas it is one of the best episodes of season 2, carrying on the mythology / background of the series as as good as the characters. A new Dharma Initiative station - The Pearl - was discovered by Locke and Eko, and the orientation film that find and look inside Locke's transformation from a believer ("Orientation" - after the end of the film: " We will have to see it again ") to a doubt (" SOS "-" Did you press that button, Henry? Do I need to know ") to a non-believer ("? "- after the end of the film:" Do you want "No, I have seen enough "). Terry O'Quinn's performance is as powerful as usual (" every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button "). Meanwhile, Eko takes his place as the man who becomes safe who was brought to the island as part of his true destiny, which is to continue to press the button. Other high points of "?" are a surprising, unique dream sequence in which person A has the dream of being a person B (this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of LOST could use much more) and the scene i nasty about Libby's last word before Death and the way Jack and Hurley can't know its true meaning. *** 1/2 on 4.
