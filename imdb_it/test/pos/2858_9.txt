I'm not sure why I chose a loan from my mom for "Nurse Betty". I just think because I heard a little about this movie. But I'm glad I did it. "Nurse Betty" is an original and intelligent film that has humor and a dark side. <br /> <br /> This was one of Renee's first great successes before he achieved success in Hollywood. I can understand why, she is an incredible actress. The scene where he finally realizes what happened and she is on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to get you into the movie, he plays Betty. A shy and insecure woman who stands by her violent husband, is a waitress and is in love with soap operas, especially one in which a certain cute doctor, Dr. Dave Revell. When you happen to see your husband's murder accidentally in a separate room, the murders you notice are two clients you've just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. He then loses his head and leaves the city after talking to the police and says he needs to find his ex-girlfriend, Dr. Dave Revell. So, he travels across the country in California to find Dr. Revell, and he wants a job as a nurse to work with Dave, he saw the show so many times, somehow he is simply fantastic as a nurse when he saves a woman's brother. Despite everyone telling her that she is disappointed, she looks at them as if they were crazy. When he meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George (his real name) thinks he's just a huge fan trying to get into the show. She looks at him with confusion and believes that he and she are together. <br /> <br /> Renee was exceptional, he was so believable in losing his head in the film. She has come a long way, and withering you want to admit it or not, she is adorable and a great actress. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the killers, Charlie, who is the father of the two. He is so fascinated and struck by Betty that as he pursues her through the country, he becomes almost infatuated with Betty to the point that he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley have to find Betty when they find out she was there in the murder scene and could give away their identities. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, she is scared at first, but calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a well played scene, my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. It's just great. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly good performance by Chris Rock, the son, Wesley. He is so "gun", he is just doing the job quickly and taking care of business. I loved his comedic performance at the end, where he and the band holding a captive are watching the soap opera together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a fantastic film that I recommend for a good laugh and, all in all, a nice honest film that I think everyone will like. <br /> <br /> 9/10
