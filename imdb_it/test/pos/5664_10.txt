This is certainly not the best film ever. But it's definitely worth seeing for people with a particular kind of mind. So those who love sadness and depression, and the frightening nocturnal fairy tales, the wolves and the real madness - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could only stand it once ... But since the Wolves, Saint-Lucy and the children's drawings and a headless Christ live in my nightmares.
