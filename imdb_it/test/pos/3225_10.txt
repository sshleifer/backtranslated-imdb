I absolutely fell in love with these girls. let me tell you something: I come from Romania and here is only the sixth series running every other day that is on USA TV. Check the Internet and download it from there, so I'm in line with the rest of the world. I can't believe how deep I am in this show. I get to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet which is the car of Rory which are their secondary names and things of the kind: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can't understand why, but my boyfriend doesn't like them and I try to show him how wonderful they are but without success, but he understands me and lets me be with my "obsession" with the Gilmore Girls. I love them. I really hope that if someone sees this, we will try to do it: you won't regret it
