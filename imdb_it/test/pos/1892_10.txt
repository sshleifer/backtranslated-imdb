I don't know what some people thought when they said this movie was bad. It was fantastic Bruce Campbell Classic, yes it was low budget and the special effect proved it, but that's not what you see a Bruce film because you look at it for Bruce. Even Ted Rami was excellent. I found this hilarious and amusing film that I continue to break when I remember Bruce in that pink scooter. Now I'll admit that this film is not for everyone, if you don't like B movies, you probably won't like this if you need big budget effects and the actors look good. But if you like sci-fi plots and sci-wall walls this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Hail The King Baby!
