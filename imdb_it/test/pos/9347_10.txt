The first music video I've ever seen, Thriller, my mother told me that he took me home from the hospital and when we arrived, my sister had MTV on TV and Thriller was playing, my mother said I smiled. Silly I know, but since that day I loved Michael Jackson, the music video Thriller inspired me to dance, I still memorized the dance until today. I even played it for an audience 3 times! Words cannot describe the power of this song that makes you want to sing and dance, but Michael, of course, had to raise the bar for MTV at that moment by signing on American Werewolf in London director John Landis and directing the only , the only one, Thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his companion, Ola Ray, ran out of gas in a dark, wooded area. They walk in the forest, and Michael asks if she would like to go steady. She accepts and he gives her a ring. He warns her, however, that he is not like other boys, not really, not like other boys. A full moon appears, and Michael starts to burst into agony ?? turning into a horrible werewolf! His date screams and runs away, but the werewolf reaches out, making it fall to the ground and starts hurling it at her with its claws. The scene is interrupted in a cinema where Michael and his companion are watching this scene in a movie called Thriller. Michael smiles but his date is scared and tells him he's leaving. Michael joins her and says it's just a movie, but she doesn't like his jokes about her and she walks away. Michael and his companion walk along a foggy street and he teases her with Thriller's opening lines. They pass in front of a cemetery, where the corpses suddenly start to rise from their graves while Vincent Price performs his rap. Michael and his date then find themselves surrounded by zombies, and suddenly, Michael becomes a zombie himself. Michael and the undead perform an elaborate song and dance number together, followed by the Thriller choir. <br /> <br /> Thriller is probably the best music video of all time, the funny thing is the people who want to talk to other Michael Jackson videos, but what makes Thriller so special is dance, the story , the effects, this at the time was the most expensive music video of his day. Michael naturally went up that bar again with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts. But you say what you want, Michael was the star of the 80s, there was no celebrity like him, he loved life, lived it, breathed it and embraced it. Thriller is proof that he was willing to work to give the best and that's what we got with the Thriller legend. <br /> <br /> 10/10
