On stage, the adaptation of "Picture of Dorian Gray" by John Osborne is a refined tribute to the talent of Oscar Wilde both as a novelist and as a playwright. On the screen with some modifications it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes of the game (one is an important scene between Basilio and Enrico that shows that time has passed.) The acting is still brilliant. Sir john Gielgud returns to his Wilde roots as Lord Henry, and although he has about a decade too old for the role, he becomes totally the enigmatic, lover of life and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella. Jeremy Brett is also strong, offering a touching portrait of the distressed artist Basil Hallward. Peter Firth, while not originally my vision of Dorian, manages the role with style and grace ... and later with a convincing line of cruelty. The supporting cast is just as beautiful, the co-star of "Importance Of Being Earnest" by Gielgud, Gwen Francon-Davies, plays her philanthropist Aunt Agatha with dignity and Judi Bowker makes Sybil Vane touching. The humor, pathos and tension of Wilde's work have been greatly transferred to the screen. My only exception is the hair style, many of which seemed out of place and more like the Victorian hairstyles of the 1970s than the style actual, but overall acting and writing elevates this production to a high level. level of excellence of the small screen.
