Kramer against Kramer is the story of a marital separation and its consequences. They can be devastating for partners and even more so for a minor child who in this case is played by Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about Kramer against Kramer, is his greatest strength as a film is the way parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the public as whole people with many sides of their nature. Although the film is tilted in the direction of Hoffman and other on his relationship with his son, he is not presented as any kind of saint, nor is he a completely black villain for Streep. Hoffman is a career-oriented advertising game man. He practically ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, yet it is a big shock to him when Streep says love is gone and wants to get out. He also wants not to be a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry do the best they can. The pressure of being both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job and have to pay a lower one in another agency. At that point, after more than a year, Streep decides to want custody. <br /> <br /> Both parents make compelling witnesses and affirm their case beautifully, but in these situations, the bond is always broken in favor of the mother. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars for this film respectively, his in the Supporting Actress category. I'm not sure how these things are decided, Streep gets less time on Hoffman's screen if that's the determining factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his growing awareness of having his share of the blame for the failure of the marriage. As for Meryl, it's as Hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance career and motherhood. The conflict in his psyche is recorded for everyone on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman may have won that Oscar in part for the same reason that Spencer Tracy took his first, performing the impossible task of not leaving a scene that steals a child steals the movie. Children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes as a real child, not a Hollywood boy. I wonder if Hoffman saw the brave captains and saw how Spencer Tracy faced Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done a lot worse than the Spencer Tracy channel in his performance. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs Kramer also won the Oscar for best film, best director for Robert Benton and the best adapted script. It is an intelligent and compelling drama about adults who lose themselves out of love and try to face the best they can with themselves and their child. Not to be missed if ever broadcast.
