Johnny Knoxville and the boys of Jackass go to the top for "Jackass Number Two". At a press screening, the laughter was so loud and raucous that it was hard to hear all the dialogue. The stunts are exaggerated and the jokes are more fun and outrageous than ever. <br /> <br /> All the boys put their strings at stake to make a great film, and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you will love this movie. If not, don't worry. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest pieces are the jokes that the boys play on themselves, and have no regard for what happens to them. They will do anything to make a stunt. <br /> <br /> Many critics have struck down Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film, but don't worry, he is at the center of number two, and they have enough shots in the jar to be a number three midway. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of this kind of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, Entertainment Editor, Fort Bend Herald
