A very positive message for our youth is shown in this film. Through the sport of rugby as a medium, a high school rugby coach guides his players in their behavior and lifestyle, ON and OFF on the field. <br /> <br /> Acting and directing are good. The rugby shots are right if you know some rugby or if you are very strong if you don't know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, it's worth looking at, especially at a time when this sport is gaining more and more followers every day. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a true story set in Utah. The coach played in this film has been at the helm of the Highlanders for over 30 years (and has only lost the game every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
