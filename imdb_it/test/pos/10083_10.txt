This is a cut above other films of the genre: genuinely full of suspense, intelligent, brilliantly acted and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing - but this is partly what makes it such a punch. Watch it twice if you can. You will have almost all the time not to see it when you know the turning point when you first look at it. <br /> <br /> Do not be put off by the fact that this film comes from Korea, a country not too familiar to most of the Western public. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All of these are superbly managed by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the protagonist. Worthy of particular mention is Yum Jung-ah, which offers a profoundly disturbing and disturbing performance as the stepmother. <br /> <br /> Even if he has his moments of fear, this is not really a horror film as most people would imagine. It's more a story of psychological suspense with an element of mystery. It grabs you from the beginning and we will keep you guessed until the end - and maybe beyond!
