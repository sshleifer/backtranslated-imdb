Having known and loved this book since I was eleven, was I terrified of seeing it look like a movie - and if they had made a terrible mess of it? In case you don't have to worry about everything. Everyone was very well started and the acting is exceptional, he followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison, which for me added nothing. However it's really the most beautiful love story and I'm so happy to have watched it on video so I can watch it again and again. My only complaint is - why didn't they give Kester a green vest "that made him such a nice man"? Such a simple thing, when they went to so many problems for everything else. If you get the chance, see this, it's excellent.
