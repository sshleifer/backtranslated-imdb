This film is a great example of why the Shaw Brothers are among the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is well structured, the story is excellent and intriguing, and while humor cannot be in the face, it is nestled within the interactions between characters. Once the story has developed, and the characters begin to assess the situation, the entire tower collapses into one of the best fighting scenes (tiger, crane and Hung Gar crab are very present). There is even a scene that mocks eighteenth-century Western social events and ends with intelligent and fun fights. The film ends with a sudden moment, but if you are a fan of the Shaw Brothers, you will understand that cheese is just a seasoning, and not the main course of the film.
