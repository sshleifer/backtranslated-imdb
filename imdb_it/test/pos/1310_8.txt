I have never heard of Mishima before seeing this film and although some parts are a bit boring, I still find myself attracted to watch it when it is repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told that a famous Japanese writer behaves like a madman and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses, you are gently inserted into the distorted logic of Mishima's mind. The phases of his life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a mixture of two contrasting narratives, the first continuing the story with scenes from the life of Mishima and appearing in black and white. The second narration is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged as a comedy and filmed with vivid colors. There is a different novel staged in each chapter. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, while Mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide. This means that the drama and the tension are maintained until the end. I suspect that many people consider the film boring and pretentious. I respect it, this is not a film for people who want to act and a strong plot. If on the other hand you are the kind of person who savors the opportunity to penetrate the mind of a bizarre man while watching his life told in collages of beautiful images set to music by Philip Glass, you will love it. I loved it. <br /> <br />
