I SELL THE DEAD (2009) ** 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. A messy mixture of horror and comedy that presents itself as a greeting card for the horror films of the 1960s by Roger Corman and Hammer Studios, with two cretinated tomb robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) facing the final punishments for crimes through the guillotine but not before their stories of the occult can be recalled in flashback. Funny and a few well-turned shots but really a B-movie mess that tries to be a classic cult largely thanks to the unsuccessful casting of Perlman and Scrimm veterinarians; a good Halloween rental.
