There is nothing incomplete in this Perry and Croft masterpiece - as good as one of the best episodes, fortunately it was still filmed in time before the late James Beck died sadly to be included in it to show his talent. <br /> It shows from the beginning how the platoon is formed from the state of national emergency, showing the boys as inept under the command of Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier), as usually happens in the series. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Mainwaring makes its usual desire to show authority, but chaps cannot help but disappoint him at every turn, during wargames and suspecting an invasion. They have a chance in the film to redeem themselves when they capture the Nazi airmen who take the church congregation hostage. <br /> <br /> It was a nice ending, especially since Mainwaring had been able to put himself to the test with the General, a last chance to adapt is given. A great movie, lots of good lines and laughter, it's another one for the DVD closet - I'm glad the BBC repeats it - and on this day 2.8.08 they deservedly got 'Dad's Army Night'. Not to be missed!
