Funny, fun movie about the German spy of World War II (Julie Andrews!) Who falls in love with the American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and dodged by the public in 1970 - I can't understand why. It is well filmed, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial fights. In addition, Andrews does a strip tease (strictly PG material) and sings a beautiful song - "Whistling in the Dark". The film has problems. Andrews and Hudson didn't get along during the filming of this - and it shows. Their love scenes lack sparkle and have zero sexual chemistry. Still, they turn into OK performance. The film is a bit long (even in the director's 105-minute cut I've seen) and it gets too dark and serious at the end. However, it is worth catching. Try to see the cut directors ... the other runs half an hour more!
