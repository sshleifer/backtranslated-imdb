A really excellent look at the world and the reality of being a heroin addict. The film is one that will hit those involved in the drug culture too close to home and have the knowledge of what a heroin addict is (or is around). A good movie that will never really be surpassed. Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is the way Preminger shows how dark the world of JUNKIE can become. It's worth a look - a kind of education. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain in which a toxic person lives.
