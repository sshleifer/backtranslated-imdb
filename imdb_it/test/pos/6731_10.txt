Being Cornish and raised with the history of tin mines, this film is very special to me. Filmed in and around various locations in Cornwall, it describes the story of two of your sons who were trapped on a mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The "Hunters" of the title refer to the "Spriggins" - ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that is mine. The events take place with an American who wants to invest in the local mining industry, but when the young local boy Josh is tormented by sightings of the ghost of a boy, he and his American "girlfriend" decided to unravel the mystery of his death , culminating in the rescue of themselves and some miners from an almost certain death when a new well is opened and the Spiggins save them. <br /> <br /> Filmed, even if low budget and short, but it's worth a look if you're from Cornwall and / or tin mining!
