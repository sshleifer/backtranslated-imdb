"Closet Land" tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements. You could read a lot about the plot of the movie in advance, but you don't really need it. All you need to know is that the film is about an interrogation. Along the way, we learn a lot about the questioner and the questioned person. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film amounts to a warning (actually, the film has several aspects related to it) about what happens to people's freedoms when "looking the other way" and ignoring injustices that happen to those around them. <br /> <br /> If you have about an hour and a half and you know where you can rent this, I strongly advise you to do so.
