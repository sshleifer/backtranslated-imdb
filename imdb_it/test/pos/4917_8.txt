Although for most of us, sensuality is a variable quality, I cannot remember a film that has done for me what it does. He transported me to a terribly familiar realm of desire and desire. All the compulsive attraction, the uncertainty about the outcome, the palpable fear and the excitement so attentive to that state of excitement were brought into turmoil by this film. So French and what I consider bold! No matter what your orientation, I think the danger of chasing your desire is carried forward and in the center here ... much more, for example, than with "Eyes Wide Shut" by Kubrick.
