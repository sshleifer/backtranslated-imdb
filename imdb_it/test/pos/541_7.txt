I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the part of a fickle, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must remain united. He removes his daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting career as an actor in Hollywood. The daughter is doubtful, but at the beginning she has no other choice --- the bond with her mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> In time the girl sees that the mother is in the flights of the imagination and does not have her feet on the ground. He sees his mother drifting to a handsome seductive boy who loves them and leaves them. You see that the mother does not understand. So how can he look at his mother as a guide? <br /> <br /> The mother directs the girl to a drama and sees her daughter play the part of the mother in such a way that a painfully painful mirror is held by the fly-by-night mother. This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified by the impact on her mother and apologizes, but the lesson takes hold. <br /> <br /> There is a growth of character when the mother realizes her selfish claim on her daughter and is eventually persuaded to let the girl go. It is a moving scene and a valuable lesson, which parents, as emotionally dependent as they are, must let go of the child and become their separate person.
