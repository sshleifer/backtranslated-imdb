It was compelling. I couldn't look away. While the film was running, I started to think it was powerful and confrontational, but I had no idea how much more intense it would be. <br /> <br /> The film offers an overview of what unfortunately is the life of every day for many school children. Some of us live outside that environment and walk and don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Parents need to see this particular movie, just to see what their children are going through. Parents often dismiss their problems with children as trivial, but unfortunately for a high school student they are huge. And unfortunately the problems can degenerate into a tragedy. <br /> <br /> A must see for everyone.
