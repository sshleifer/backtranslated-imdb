This sequel shows that Tim Burton was in effect the best choice to direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman who faces three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the doggy Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best series, it has everything: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really stands out. The cast is simply wonderful, although the obvious prominence is DeVito like the multi-layered penguin. Here is a guy who is bad, pitiful, funny and maybe more important, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still makes me shudder. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and everyone turns into top-notch performances. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite of all the published Batman (I'm sorry, Fan of Dark Knight). If you want a superhero movie that has a little more to offer than flashy effects and large-scale action, then take a look at this underrated movie. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made.
