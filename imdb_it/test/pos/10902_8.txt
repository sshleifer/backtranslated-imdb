After reading the comment made on this film and currently looking at it, I can understand how it feels about it. The decisions made were after listening to common sense. When the movie came out, I heard the information on how it happened. The plot was made from a real event. During an award ceremony, an actor, thanking the people, attributed the prize to a former school teacher, unexpectedly escorting the person. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people come "out of the closet" most every day. Each exit is different for each person. In real life, the outcome of each individual will be different. And the willingness to accept who I am is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For those around them, joy and honest acceptance can make life much fuller. For the film, Howard's result is outdated and much more comical than real life. And community acceptance showed others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances were crazy. Memorable quotes and the use of music are added to the stereo-types out there in the world, but taken with ironic humor. It's a movie. Sit down, watch with an open mind and laugh.
