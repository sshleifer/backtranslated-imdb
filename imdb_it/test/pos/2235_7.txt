It is a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it is a must. His non-acting and semi-naked scene will please his fans for years to come. However, the current assessment (3.2) is too low. The film may not have a good plot, and it's not a great sf-movie at all, but the acting is pretty good (and as already mentioned, Jolie's acting is pretty and raw), the film is shot in a very direct way , with very close -UPS. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, leaving Van Damme out was a great choice. Presumably, not for Jolie lovers, she'd like to see her have sex with him. This film has the potential to become a cult film.
