Christopher Nolan's first film as a director, a year before he released "Memento", and this is almost as brilliant as the classic. He uses time differentials in a similar way to tell his story, and he is very intelligent. <br /> <br /> Bill is this young writer who starts following complete strangers just to see where they live and what they are all about. One day, this man follows, Cobb, who overturns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a thief and takes Bill with some work to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of a species and a bond begins to grow between them. <br /> <br /> But there is another reason for Cobb that fuels this relationship, and in the end it all comes together to perfection. No, I won't ruin it but this is a very nice film and I'm starting to think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this is a must see.
