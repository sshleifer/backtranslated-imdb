This was the second Cinemascope show produced by Fox after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are resolved to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all the first-class elements, the beautiful photograph, the moving soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can understand which composer has marked specific scenes). However, the main acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom appears to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best interpretations come from Peter Ustinov as a slave with one eye and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress "Nefer". I find that this film in general is strong on the plot, which is rare for these great glasses produced at the time. All in all, the film makes an interesting and amusing social commentary on how Egyptian society might have been.
