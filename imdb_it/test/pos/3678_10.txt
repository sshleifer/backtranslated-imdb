When I bought this film for the first time, I had doubts, even though the cast was quite impressive. But after seeing him, I don't regret having spent the money. In fact, I'd like to spend it again and again and again on films like this ... An absurd combination of humor, drama, thrill and big questions. This is exactly what makes it a great movie. Ok, some may not like what they see, and some may even turn it off after a while. your loss. He has a wonderful way of dealing with the problems we have all faced in one way or another, and the characters you think will not have fun keeping the whole film company, turn out to be the ones you really love after a short time. For anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and life - watch this movie, I promise you won't be disappointed!
