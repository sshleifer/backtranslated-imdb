This was recommended to me by a friend who said he was cute and cuddly for a "sexual lesbian Flick". Boy was he wrong. I guess he didn't understand. Grow not understanding and then discover yourself through the trial and the tribulation is more similar. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and vibrant and the story is fun enough, thrown through theatrical performances to keep anyone interested. /> <br /> Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so many attempts to find the love she wants just to find out that she was the only person she was afraid of revealing everything, and ran out. Johdi May as "Flo" was remarkable. spent a couple of hours trying to remember where I saw her before, only to find out that she was quiet sister "Alice" in "The Last of the Mohicans" Fortunately, I grew up in a liberal family and had no problems with the try a movie like this. So many people get lost in movies like this. I'm glad I recommended my friend and tried it. But I'm sure he liked me more.
