I remember seeing this film in the mid-80s, considering it a well-structured and well-interpreted piece. Now I often work in Berkeley Square and I had to get a copy of the DVD to remind myself how little the area has changed, although my office is quite new only 30 seconds from "the bank". Car dealership Jack Barclays is also still there to sell Bentleys and Rolls Royces. <br /> <br /> It appears that the DVD is soon available for Region 2. Region 1 copy I is of poor quality. Let's hope they cleaned it up. <br /> <br /> Only the slightly evasive escape sequence of the court ruins what would otherwise be a great film, but I imagine it is in line with the caper tag with which the film goes.
