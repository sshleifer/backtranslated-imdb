This movie starts when it ends and ends when it starts. What is in the middle is a collection of comedies, philosophy, music, observations, comments, mini stories, colors and much more. See the world and our lives and tell the story of The Monkees from the point of view of the group members themselves. He also watches television and cinema and makes a visual comment. Also shaken, with scenes of war and shows how we are only pawns in a big game. It says all this and much more, but if you don't look at it objectively you won't see much of the scenes put together to combine music. It's the kind of film that can never get boring because it's done so intelligently.
