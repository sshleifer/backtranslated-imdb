Of course, it has its pretentious moments, it sounds like an art house, Fantasia live, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus movies are always a problem, but I've always had a keen interest in them. Now I will classify the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg - "A masked ball" - This segment could ruin the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole group. It is difficult to follow, above all because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a trivial thing, to this). The photograph is incomplete. The best thing is the lesbian homoerotica piece that can never do enough. This segment made me VERY worried about continuing. 2/10. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - "The Virgin's Angels" - an unclear segment, but it doesn't matter. The film has the best cinematography of the group, mainly because it is in a splendid black and white. The segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose to challenge this very vilified film for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard, I was much more impressed than I thought I was. I can't say I've seen all those movies since he made so many that hardly anyone has seen, but judging by what I've seen, this could be his best work since the 1960s. It's the most fun part of this film and the most artistically accomplished. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very funny segment, it is also quite predictable. However, this story of a husband and wife who betray themselves in the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long and complex tracking shots that depend on the actors' precise choreography. He also has a large self-referential joke on the same omnibus films. The final scene is very weak. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "Die tote Stadt" - this short segment also involves lovers of (I believe) Venice. She's pretty, with some nice shots of doves flying around the city. It's light but nice. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "Les Bor√©ades" - is not one of the best segments, unfortunately, it is more a music video than a conceptual short film. It involves the occupants of an asylum who takes part in a theater show. Music and images work well together, so at least I can give them credit for being a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Franc Roddam - "Liebestod" - a bit unlucky for the Beresford segment, this segment is very similar to it. As you can assume from my phrasing, this struck me much more. It's about a young man and his girlfriend going to Las Vegas on a fatalistic journey. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most visually striking segment, sounds in a fantasy world rather than reality. It's a beautiful story about a fallen angel. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I heard a lot about Jarman, and this is the first movie I saw from him. I hope, I'll see more in the future. This is also video-music, but it's better than Altman's segmenment. It mainly concerns an old woman who remembers her younger days. The assembly and use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotions are very beautiful. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Bill Bryden - "The clowns" - the sad clown, perhaps one of the most famous arias (particularly memorable from an episode of Seinfeld), this serves as material that separates each segement and the ending. It is simple and effective 7/10. <br /> <br /> In general, I give him a solid 7/10. It's not bad at all like you heard.
