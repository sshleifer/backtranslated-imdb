I tend to like historical films (period) and get new costume ideas for my historical group, and a friend recommended this to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it, and I was definitely rewarded !! His portrayal as a member of the English noble class was far more accurate than I have seen in the past. The comical aspect of this left my sides bad, the costumes weren't horrible, and historically, I didn't get too fucked. I also noticed the fact that England did not have a proper sewage system until much later, but no one who dares not to go into the past of the English past will not notice. A must see. I highly recommend this movie.
