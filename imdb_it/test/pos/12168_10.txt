It really is a result that three stories shot by three very different directors can be as shrewd about both gay and bisexual relationships and their struggles! <br /> <br /> "Pool Days" is about the embarrassment of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger man. A story of experience and vulnerability! <br /> <br /> "A friend of Dorothy's" portrays a common dilemma that many gay and bisexual people experience at some point in their lives: the intense attraction to someone who is heterosexual. Sensitively examined, this story really left me touched! <br /> <br /> "The Disco Years" shows another version of a non-winning situation: being involved with someone who is not only confused by their sexual orientation, but is also terrified of being exposed as something different from the simple! A very powerful story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and scared person! <br /> <br /> Although these three stories appeal to anyone with a minimum of empathy towards others, they will psychologically give more power to those who consider themselves gay, bisexual or looking. Each story is edifying in its own unique way!
