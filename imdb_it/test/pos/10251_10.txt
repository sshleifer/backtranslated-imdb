The film was very nice when it came out, I went to Cooley High and Cooley's high-level center, in 1968 I was at home as a queen and grew up and lived in the Cabrini Greens area, I knew a lot of people in the film, it was nice to see friends in the movie who lived in the area also, and they had the chance to be a star that may have once been in a life experience for them, i had good times growing up on the north side and hard times in which I can relate to the film Cooley High is no longer standing but a person like me and others still remember the fun we had while attending Cooley High, there is a lot of history around this northern area to tell.
