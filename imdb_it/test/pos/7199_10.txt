This film is the smartest comedy I've ever seen, many lines are or a parody of another film, (from star wars to dragon ball to power rangers to kung fu etc.) or somehow related to the story of anything, (Otis creates the elevator), a lot of jokes are also related to the modern world and teased because it was BC (Like the wagon wheels of the horse that run) Other jokes are simply a total nonsense but also hilarious (like the famous scene, with the dog chasing the Roman boy with little music) In fact, in this film, more or less every kind of humor is mixed. I've seen this movie 6 times already and every time I look at it I find other subtle lines. (like the scene in which waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). It is the funniest film I've ever seen, finally a comedy with a twist, which does not include the bathroom or sexual humor. Numerobis is also what makes the film, everything that comes out of that guys' mouth is hilarious. This film is almost perfect except for something clich√©, like the fact that Asterix regains his power because he is kissed, this is simply stupid. But overall an excellent film !! 9.5 out of 10
