In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised film lovers around the world with his epic Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, it came out with a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more stunning than its predecessor. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not really a sequel. It is more than a "midquel", as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first Heimat cycle. <br /> <br /> The second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold was separated from his first love, Klarchen, courtesy of his intolerant mother and older brother (the controversy had to what do with him as a minor, while she was about 25 years old.) Still irritated by those events, the young man promises never to fall in love again (a grandiose, if gruesome) scene, and decides to move to Monaco (as the director himself did around the same time), hoping to become a professional composer after a few years at the music academy.It remains in Monaco for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour Heimat 2 episodes cover that time frame, each of which focuses on a different person among Hermann's other students, people who, like him, are looking for a "second home". country ", whether it's music, movies or something else, where they can finally live in peace. <br /> < br /> Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect combination of cinema and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it seem like a soap opera, in fact The Second Heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced, while some chapters of Heimat 1 could be seen as separate stories (in particular, that concerning Hermann's adolescence). The style and content, however, is pure auteur cinema, with the familiar black and white / color transitions (actually, a little more predictable this time) and ambiguous characters, the latter element is underlined by the relationship between Hermann and the cellist Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): they love each other clearly, yet they continue to embark on business with other people, delaying the inevitable until it is too late. This time, Reitz seems to be more pessimistic about his characters (at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned that he says: "The Beatles are much better than us!"), Building whole episodes around dark and controversial themes like abortion and suicide. The decade he is exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are marked dramatically by the key events of the 1960s (especially the 1968 revolution). It seems that Reitz has made this mini-series specifically for cinema fans, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant quote from Casablanca) and clever jokes (an episode is set in Venice, whose film festival played an important role in the success of the Heimat saga). And since 1992, movie lovers have never stopped thanking him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever in celluloid.
