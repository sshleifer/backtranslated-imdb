Today I saw this movie at the Philadelphia Film Festival and I loved it. It is an interesting and skillful analysis of the all too common revelation that our parents' marriage was more imperfect and difficult than we had initially imagined. Furthermore, this film is an excellent example of the process of discovering the truths about our parents' lives after their death and the problems associated with it. However, I found the sound quality (recording and editing) relatively poor and annoying. *** It may very well be related to the specific theater and projection conditions *** I am not a director / student or other and I do not claim any understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer I found the audio portion of the film that distracts . Specifically, I heard very unpleasant noises in the film (especially a long interview with the younger sister) of the film, and often the level of background noise was higher in volume than people's voices (for example the scene where a small group was sorting mother cards). Someone else saw this movie, noticed something about the sound ... thanks
