Overall, Big Bad John was a hilarious and touching film. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has it. If you are a fan of the song (as I am) you know practically how it ends. But if you don't do it, or do it and want to see it anyway, I highly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are an exhilarating couple with great chemistry. However, I would not recommend this film to strictly urban people. You have to understand where these people should come from, and only a handful of us are left. But even a few urban people might understand it and appreciate it for what it is: a good home movie that will make you laugh, cry and be inspired.
