The first feature film Muppet Movie, and except perhaps The Muppet Christmas Carol, film puppeteers from all over the world are still looking for a guide. Disney has turned the Muppets into a disservice and this film proves it again and again. Featuring classic comedies and guest star cameos, it maintains a simple yet original storyline, the classic jokes of Muppet, the genius of Paul Williams in the song and the madness of Electric Mayhem, and comes out with a fantastic film especially when you realize the main cast are puppets. Only Croft approached Hensen's genius with puppets. Half the fun of today is playing is that actor / actress still alive ???? I can only hope that Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow save and revive the Kermit and Company from Disney's deadly grip.
