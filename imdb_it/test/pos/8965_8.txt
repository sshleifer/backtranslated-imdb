... with a single act. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, Congressman, a true character. During the 1990s, when communism over the USSR, the Berlin Wall and the war on Afghanistan (with the Soviets) stopped. He did it, a single refusal for money, and everything went down. It should be remembered, so here it is. His memorial. <br /> <br /> Return to the film. Funny, dramatic, snobbish, political or just boring. However, it is an intelligent film about political life, world government and, above all, a lesson for the world. A lesson for every politician out there, a critical point of view that refers to countries that support wars with money, guns and words. <br /> <br /> Lesson learned - The world is not a nice place to live
