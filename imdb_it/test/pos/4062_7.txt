As many of today's films are guilty, the plot is not exactly stellar, the film does not move anyone, and certainly this will not guarantee any prize (except perhaps from Blockbusters) ... but then again, who really cares. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro collaborate to produce a very funny, sometimes funny, film that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner also played their small parts well. Friend, I hope my wife is as good in the future as Miss Renee. <br /> <br /> Going forward, this "friend" cop produces great laughter in a reasonable amount of time. The movie is fun enough to avoid waiting for video / dvd output and instead to go ahead and take a look. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is in his usual top-form and is definitely fun to watch. De Niro has adapted perfectly to this type of role. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and I think any real movie fan who needs a good movie or just a good laugh will have a great time with Showtime. <Br /> <br /> Exceptional performance: Murphy. Funny. Enough said. Management work: beautiful. Beautiful action scenes, use Murphy and De Niro together as a spell, Russian nurtured in a nice supporting job. <br /> <br /> My vote: 7 out of 10. It won't move you or anything ... but it's an extremely funny film. <br /> <br /> It's Showtime ... it was a great success.
