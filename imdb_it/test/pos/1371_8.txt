I think this film was made for the not so princely sum of Â£ 8000, but it didn't show. There was nothing amateurish about production or acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could be any desert area in the world instead of a not too hot beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily acceptable as a group of mercenaries stuck on a mysterious, deserted and unexplored planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly to each other, but they were willing to fight to keep themselves and their companions alive. There were no great explanations of what was happening, which can be really invented, so much of the plot was left to your imagination rather like The Big Empty, which was also a film that I liked. I discovered that I was quite heated in most of the characters, there were some moments that were involuntarily funny, the men were so ordinary that they felt they could empathize with them and the climax and the end of the film were quite moving. I think Mr. Stirton and his crew should be proud of themselves that I've seen worse movies on a budget of millions.
