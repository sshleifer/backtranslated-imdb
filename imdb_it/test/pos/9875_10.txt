Wow, "The Curse of Michael Myers" what a beautiful film. Suspenseful, fun, creative and intelligent plot that I love. Many hate the concept of "Thorn", I love it. I think it gives some story to the Halloween series. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and turns into an excellent performance, especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are also great. My only complaint is that why wasn't Danielle Harris in this movie like Jamie? He wanted to come back, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Anyway, I love Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I think the mask of The Shape has the best in this film and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly creepy and full of suspense, the rules of Halloween 6! <br /> <br /> I love this very violent but extremely funny movie. The Halloween horror series - by far the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
