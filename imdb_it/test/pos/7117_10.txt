My sister, dad and I really take care of D & D and one evening we were surfing Netflix looking for a movie to watch when this came out. We thought about trying it and in the end I almost died of laughter. The writing and acting in this film are incredible! Witty characters, great interaction and hilarious moments have kept us open-mouthed all the time. I love this movie! It might not make much sense for those who don't know Dungeons & Dragons, but still, it's a good movie. This only serves to demonstrate that films do not need an astronomical budget and very successful actors / actresses to be a success. Watch it if you want a good and clean comedy.
