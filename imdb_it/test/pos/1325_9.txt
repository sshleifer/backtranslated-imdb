The first season said practically how all the elements of the Marine Corps (ie land, air, helicopters and jets) would work as a team. This is the season to which I attribute the highest score! (True, there are still many "freedoms" taken in season one, but the stories were more credible.) <br /> <br /> The following seasons were a horrible attempt at Melrose Place and Top Gun! <br /> <br /> I was a Marine stationed in Miramar at the time and I remember turning the show around in the San Diego area. I got to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> The character of Rowland was good. <br /> <br /> The character of Brolin was good only in the first season. For some reason he relaxed after the first episode of season two. <br /> <br /> If you want to see how the Marine Air Ground team works, the first season is to watch. /> <br /> If you like Melrose Place and soap operas like plots with an attempt to merge them into Top Gun, then see the last two seasons.
