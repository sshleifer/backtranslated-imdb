I just finished watching the film for the first time in its entirety (although I saw some parts when it was first shown in Britain in the mid-90s), I really think it's a masterpiece of late cinema 20th century. Undoubtedly a film of this kind raises many questions, such as why are there any narrative differences between Hermann's' 60s in 'Heimat' and Hermann in this film? For example, in the first film Hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather (he finances Hermann's electronic music), while in "Die Zweite ..." there is little mention of his father until the last episode. <br /> <Another point interests me; reading about Edgar Reitz I am struck by historical similarities between him and the character of Stefan, (spoiler on the way) in the last episode we discover that Stefan won a prize at the Venice Film Festival, (Reitz won a prize for best debut working there for his film "Mahlzeiten"); Reitz's film company is called 'Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion' and Stefan's is also the eponymous name. I am interested in Stefan being an autobiographical character because, apart from Helga, he is probably the least sympathetic of friends. <br /> <br /> Maybe Stefan is a fake track, I don't know, what I know is that I loved this movie and I wish more were made, except for "Cache" and Werner by Michael Haneke Il " Grizzly Man "by Herzog does not have enough ambition, boldness and passion of this kind in modern cinema. I look forward to seeing number 3 now.
