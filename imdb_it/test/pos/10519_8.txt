I tried to remember the name of this film for years and years. Finally, I read something today, 09/03/2005, which mentioned the name of Stacy Keach, and it reminded me that I had seen a film in which it was in 1974 at the Atlanta Film Festival, therefore, I did a search on Google for Keach movies and I found The Gravy Train. We had to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they were unable to show it, and instead we replaced The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we would not have been able to see much-acclaimed Duddy Kravitz, and that we had heard nothing about The Gravy Train, and since then I have heard nothing about it. <br /> <br /> However, I remember we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was and, if I remember correctly, it was pretty funny. I'd like to find it on tape.
