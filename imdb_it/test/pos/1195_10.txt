Milos Forman's original HAIR was the perfect film that actually revealed how life was changing in those years, not only in the United States, but especially in this country. One of the film's plots had to be used in other films to come after Hair, for example in American Graffitti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness. The characters in the film were like solitary "cells" in a "body" that was changing everywhere. Overall, a very good film, perhaps a little undervalued. The role of Annie Golden was secondary but she did very well. It was the film that practically launched John Savage as an actor. One of the Chicago members played his role well even though it was a secondary role.
