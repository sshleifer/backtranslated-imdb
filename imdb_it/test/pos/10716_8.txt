The Oscar-winning "Kramer vs. Kramer" follows a business man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day Ted's wife leaves him and their child in search of a better life, forcing Ted to become closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two bind and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfectly Ted's wife returns to the city and wants the exclusive custody of her son. Ted then goes on a mission to not let his son be taken away from him, and fights his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives a huge performance together with Meryl Streep, and the young Justin Henry is awesome. It is a sad emotional trot of a film, but it is a very well made and stimulating film. The film won the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1979 Academy Awards, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Streep. If you don't mind a tear, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great movie to watch. Degree: B +
