"In 1927 a young man, alone in a single-engine plane, flew nonstop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the entire North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field in Paris, a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles. and of the spirit, Charles A. Lindbergh influenced the life of everyone on earth - because in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight the air age became a reality. This is the story of that flight ". /> <br /> Billy Wilder adapts to the Pulitzer-winning novel by Charles A. Lindbergh with the same title, in what is the reconstruction of Lindbergh's historic solitary flight of 1927. Driven by a considerably strong lead performance by James Stewart (himself a pilot) like Lindberg, and containing a clever script by Wilder and Wendell Mayes, Spirit Of St. Louis is a well-told story. <br /> <br /> what sometimes threatens to become a monotonous film, Wilder continues to scan it using flashbacks for Lindbergh's life. After the event has been well told, like the danger that occurs when Nungesser and Coli lose {they are not found} while they are experiencing the same journey in reverse, we learn things like when it comes to buying his first plane and working with the flying circus. All this is related to the understanding of man and his obvious passion for flying. This also helps give us a complete picture of Lindbergh, thus putting us with him in his isolated cockpit as he embarks on this dangerous journey. Fighting isolation (his only company is a fly) and chronic fatigue, this is where Stewart perfectly portrays Lindbergh's devotion to the task. Aided by an exceptional soundtrack by Franz Waxman and the effects nominated for the Louis Lichtenfield Oscar, Wilder's film turns out to be an engaging story of human interest that has achieved highly professional production. 7/10
