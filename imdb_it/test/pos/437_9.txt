Jean Renoir's homage to the Paris of the late nineteenth century is beautiful in many respects. Not only does it seem to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, it portrays the geographical Paris; the roads accessible only by stairs, the unpleasant end of a fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell, in an uncompromising picture of the show that is in stark contrast to the image painted by Hollywood. There is an obvious comparison with the "42nd Street" by Lloyd Bacon, which had been made about 20 years earlier, with Ruby Keeler as a feeling of dance, a light-haired boy who had come to New York to enter show business, which saves the show when the star fails - "You're going out there a guy from the choir, but you gotta get a STAR back !!" "Julian Marsh" by Warner Baxter is a director who suffers from his art and is not appreciated. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" continues to clash with genital politics, but when he talks about the show it's more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. He's all about the game, except - for his pointy thing. He has a new profitable business sewn until his mistress becomes jealous of the woman he recognizes as his next lover. His prospects increase and decrease with each coital journey he undertakes. <br /> <br /> Danglard takes Padrona 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) who swoops in, where she sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo the baker, and discovers that she is a lively dancer. Use his charm and the prospect of money to attract Nini to study dance to get on stage. The prospect of money and fame fascinates Nini, and becomes the next mistress of Danglard, as well as a student of the Cancan, which Danglard has nicknamed "French Cancan", to satisfy the current Anglophile tendency in dance. <br /> <br /> Both "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are tributes to showing business - to modern entertainment - that has its own iconography and presumption. "42nd St." is centered on Julian Marsh, a great Broadway show director, who organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement. The juvenile male is a middle-aged twit with lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, the tender tender with a secret wealth to hide. Danglard, on the other hand, passes from woman to woman, seducing them with the promise of fame, linking them to what must have been a very persuasive investor. There is no doubt that he is heterosexual and rather active. Post-natal scenes abound. <br /> <br /> Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo, he discovered Esther, a Piaf type, and started preparing her for her work singing the theme song of the movie while playing it on her violin. This naturally arouses Nini's jealousy just as she aroused Lola's jealousy. (And of course Nini had already renounced the privilege of being a tsarina!) The whole film is about how Danglard's lust cost him money, but how his annoying horniness is subordinated to his love for the show - like the public demands devotion - and it is this powerful combination of phallic persuasion and tantalizing fame that makes Danglard the hero, while asserting that a true show lover will never profit as much as money. At the conclusion of the film, Danglard, having overtaken creditors and jealous girls, approaches a new attraction by watching the incredible (and believe me, it's incredible) the performance of the cancan. "Have you ever thought of being on stage?" he asks, and the curtain goes down. Meanwhile, poor Julian is sitting at the fire escape of the theater listening to new Peggy Sawyer fans who despise his contribution to the show's success. (I won't even enter the central line of "42nd Street", "Oh, Guy, it was GREAT of you to COME!") <br /> <br /> Also, I won't go into the abyss you have legendary Parisian entertainers, including a brief vision of Piaf, nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural. Certainly there is an example of the styles that generated Trenet and Aznavour. But it's the memory of an assertive and welcome masculinity, something invisible in any Hollywood musical with which it could be compared, it's a pleasant relief from the androgynous 1930s Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire, not to mention by Dick Powell), let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in films like the repugnant "American in Paris". All those fountains! We will save our comparison of that turkey in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and his deconstruction of the American male for another day. <br /> <br /> That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision in post-war France, of a type of male evil that may or may not have existed, is practically beyond the point. Whether he is a man or John Wayne or Edward Everett Horton, he is perhaps more focused. Whether he is a man who likes women is never questioned. I, for example, wouldn't mind living his life at all. I wonder if Gabin was so lucky. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney". I have never come this far. Baz's Moulin Rouge ... well, Paris no longer puts that kind of thing in the Seine.
