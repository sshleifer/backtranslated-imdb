I consider this film one of the most interesting and entertaining films of all time. He has so many very intelligent thoughts in it, that anyone who thinks the film is terrible has not understood it and is not able to recognize really profound philosophical themes, which are in it (in all 3 Schneider films) without a doubt . Several universities in Germany and throughout Europe have studied Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and about jazz musicians in Germany (maybe in Europe). It is mostly inspired by the great M. Devis and T. Monon. So if you don't like it, that's fine, but please don't try to convince others that it might be stupid, cheap, boring or not fun. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H. Schneider you should "give up".
