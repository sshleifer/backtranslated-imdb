"I know I am human. And if you were all these things, then you would attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide itself in imitation, it will fight if necessary, but it is vulnerable in the open, if he takes us over, he has no more enemies, nobody has left to kill him and then he is defeated ". <br /> <br /> John Theater "The Thing" is one of the funniest horror movies ever made ?? fast, intelligent and purely exciting from beginning to end. Here is how all such films should be made. <br /> <br /> Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the film focuses in particular on a group of American scientists. We are not given any introduction to their mission, but we are pushed into their existence when a couple of seemingly crazy Norwegians appear in their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> Soon it becomes clear that the "dog" is actually a change in shape of an alien organism, which manifests itself on the physical form of its victims ?? in other words, it begins to eat Americans, and imitates them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemies <br /> <br /> The bunch of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell) , start fighting for your survival, using ingenuity instead of muscle. If the thing is really between them, then how will they reveal it? How many things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed altogether?) <br /> <br /> The creature's origins in the film are easily explained: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft crashed to Earth and was frozen in Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released him from his natural prison. <br /> <br /> "The Thing", the film itself, is similar to the iconic "Alien" by Ridley Scott "(1979). Many comparisons have been made ?? the protagonists are stuck in a desolate area, chased by an enemy rarely seen as he manages to kill them one by one, however, "The Thing" is for all practical purposes he arrived first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous story "Who Goes There ? "by John W. Campbell, Jr. (written under the pseudonym of Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted for production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was" The Thing From Another World ", an unquestionable classic, but to be honest, it hardly resembled the story, and the Carpenter remake makes it fairer. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​what the physicality of anyone can adapt is essentially makes this film so great, and is the most vital link to the story.In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably represent the organism that changes shape, but thirty-one years brought much progress in SFX. <br /> <br /> The creative effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of transforming what could have easily become a gore-fest of cheese into a mess of blood and surprisingly scary (and realistic) fear. The Thing, although it never actually takes a specific shape, is constantly seen in a morphing phase, and the effects are simply superb. They still have a handful twenty-two years later. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone (nominated for a Razzie award at the time) is a bit too electronic and metallic, but still disturbing if used correctly. > <br /> From the fact that his cast is entirely made up of males, to the fact that his final is one of the most stimulating and atypical conclusions of all time, "The Thing" ?? by any standard ?? it's unconventional Hollywood at its best. Not surprisingly, at the time of its release, "The Thing" performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." ?? released the same year and characterized by a much gentler alien ?? it became by far the grossest portrait of the two. <br /> <br /> In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every way imaginable. Spielberg's story is obsolete and flopped during his 20th Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing", on the other hand, has gradually scaled a scale of cult classics ?? it is one of the most famous not famous films ever made. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is known for having a very irregular career ?? from his extraordinary "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and foolish "Fuga da L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his best film. Even though her reputation over the years has never been so honorable as to make her a place on most "big movie" lists, "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ?? closely controlled ?? masterfully made. Is it a bold and brilliant thrill that is both unique and chilling? a real relief for movie lovers who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This, at least, is really unpredictable.
