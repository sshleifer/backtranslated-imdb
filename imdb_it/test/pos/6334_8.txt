This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. A lot of people love it and it's creative at a creative level. Most of the episode has no dialogue, which is a brilliant idea and "Hush" handles silence really well. Furthermore, this episode presents Tara, which I really like. But I don't like Riely or the Initiative or Maggie Walsh and they seem to have a lot of time on the screen in "Hush". Also, I don't think the Lords are that scary and I'm tired of looking at the float around Sunnydale. I know I'm in the minority, but I tend to accelerate parts of the "silence". Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you're watching on DVD, I suggest you watch this episode. It's really a classic. <br /> <br /> "Hush" revolves around the entire city losing their voices. The skelat-looking demons called gentlemen arrive to collect seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human scream they die. So they steal everyone's voices in the city. Buffy and the Scoobies try to figure out what's going on, while the Initiative also begins to investigate. Meanwhile, Xander comes to realize how much Anya means to him and Willow meets a witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally come face to face as the Gentlemen fight. They are both stunned by what they have learned ... It is a commando and she is the Slayer. Eventually Buffy saves the day, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life. <br /> <br /> In reality, the creativity of "Hush" cannot be seen in a basic outline of its layout. It is the overwhelming silence of the episode, which makes it so exceptional. The characters try to communicate in different ways (white boards, pantomimes, obscene finger gestures, etc.) and everything works really well. After a while you forget that there is no dialogue because they are so good at expressing themselves. During the "talking" parts of the episode, there are many references to the importance of "really feeling" each other. Anya says that Xander won't really talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander's protests and insists that Spike moves into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word "oil" to "patrol" when she talks to Riely so she doesn't have to explain her call. And then finally, when Buffy and Riely really learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's all very nice. <br /> <br /> There are many good parts in this episode. I like that people keep forgetting that they can't talk. Both Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley cannot use the voice recognition function in the Initiative lift. People try to scream. Basically that's what everyone would really do if they suddenly didn't talk. And I think it's funny that Spike has to move to Xander. (They will also share an apartment for a while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a childish funny quarrel that is simply hilarious. I also like the beginning of the relationship between Tara and Willow. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty nice together. It's nice to see them just starting out. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, I don't understand how the Gentlemen choose their victims. They simply seem to float in the dorms and choose random people. Also, I don't like Riely. I never liked it, but at "Hush" I'm almost waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat him. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything is going well ... and then it suddenly fell. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: Giles "Who are the Gentlemen?" conference at the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and his heads are simply hilarious. Makes some flashcards similar to the first of "First Date" of the seventh season. Virtually every time Giles starts drawing monsters, it will just be fun.
