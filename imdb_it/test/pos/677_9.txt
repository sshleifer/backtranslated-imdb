When I saw this movie for the first time it was 1956 and even though I saw it recently, I haven't changed my mind. I think it was the best film by Robert Ryans, because he played someone like my father, and he was schizophrenic in real life, (my father) even though he never murdered anyone, but he was more struck during the second world war that he made worse. It was so good to have him humorous just to get through the day. (My mother and my brother had to do this) When I saw Robert Ryan portray this kind of man, it was a good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.
