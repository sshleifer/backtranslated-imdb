I like movies that show real "American" people and tell the truth. The film is simple and seems to be beautiful. He played here in Norway (Amazon says above that it is USA / Canda but the box says "All regions".) I have to say that it's not for American viewers, it played here in World Raw Views, a theater. The cut was different and much better: watch it and you'll like it or maybe hate it Sorry, Bush lovers, but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense, to get angry and hate it. all of it in it, but I am the first to be apart, it is not for empty minds, it is long and too difficult to follow but to the second vision it makes more sense. I loved Owen's words and the poem made me cry.
