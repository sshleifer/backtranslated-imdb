The third movie I saw at the philly film fest was this extraordinary dramatic film from Japan. After being released from prison, nine escaped prisoners planned to find the "key to the universe" of which a tenth detainee who did not leave spoke about them. Along the way we know each of these men quite well. Everyone has their dreams. For most of the film it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a change happens that the film ends up being a tragedy. All the actors give great shows. I can't say much more without ruining the film, but suffice it to say that you end up trying some of these individuals. At 2 hours, this film is a little too long, but no less good. I have no qualms about recommending it with the warning that it has some disturbing violence for the tender heart. Toshiaki Toyoda left home this time, and makes me want to look for his previous films and look forward to his future. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A
