The 221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication. For most of the original broadcast years, the series was ABC's most watched programming piece. <br /> <br /> The new Pop Flix DVD set contains the first 16 episodes (September 15-December 29, 1949) and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 of the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the the same one available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release, so these are probably in the public domain). These sets make the movie "The Legend of the Lone Ranger" superfluous since all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the film are included in these versions. <br /> <br /> The first episodes recall the radio because the narration of the voice-over is much more used as an introduction and to introduce key moments of the plot. <br /> <br /> The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear and evil distinctions and without romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) made his debut in the Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation into a Lone Ranger state, his collaboration with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) and the domestication of his "Silver" horse. <br /> <br /> There is a unique code of positive morality that infuses every episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good but adopts the appearance of evil. While a masked man in the West was normally feared by good citizens and an Indian was warned, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do harm. A recurring theme is that when Lone Ranger and Tonto meet an average citizen for the first time, they are greeted with suspicion and at the end of the episode the citizen was convinced of their value. The ending of the brand was a secondary character who asked the question: "who was that masked man?" <br /> <br /> To really appreciate the series you have to accept it for the simplistic moral fable it should have been. If you don't take it seriously and you still wish for some self-reflexive field-parody element, you will feel frustrated. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
