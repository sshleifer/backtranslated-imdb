Why did Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) take his five college classmates to a scary abandoned school building that used to serve the children of the black sheep of wealth? This answer could reside in a diary in his possession apparently written by his dying father. What they came into contact with is actually a revived episode that involves another group of six people, with five of them presumably encountering graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard (Paul Naschy) that occurred 20 years ago some years ago. But as they search for a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as that horrendous moment of time repeats as the group runs for their lives, often in states of panic as the murderer begins to hunt and destroy in a bloody manner . Will Ramón and all his friends be able to survive this night of horror or will they turn into ghosts to repeat the same night as those that precede them? <br /> <br /> The fashionable Spanish slasher has that professional brilliance and powerful and shocking violence to match. Some witty exchanges between the characters ... heard in their dialogue are references to the pop culture of American horror films that could annoy some spectators. A crazy Naschy is really fierce with children as he cheerfully attacks them ... a bloodthirsty maniac who performs his violent acts with gusto. I found the musical noise a bit annoying and the directors often use the flashbacks of the previous events of the film as an appeal to the public. I don't think these tricks are necessarily necessary, but I heard that the director wanted to communicate deeply with the viewer, then the use of cues and flashbacks. A small diversion for the plot of this film continues to move and the camera follows the rhythm of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation that is presented to them. Your enjoyment of this movie could eventually come to your acceptance of the supernatural paranormal aspects of the plot. The moments lived over time and a murderer who continues his work apparently from the grave. The turn seems a bit off and abrupt, but this could (or maybe not) work considering the way the story unfolds to explain why Ramón's father is shown among those ghosts that recall those horrible events two decades earlier. I will say that probably this film would not hold up if examined in detail, but as a slasher film, it is a breath of fresh air.
