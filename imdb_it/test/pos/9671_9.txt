Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He created a witty, culturally strong and simply hilarious spectacle. <br /> <br /> For those who think that his "offensive" approach to social or cultural topics doesn't make significant comments, just "offended", he can be pointed to this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (leaving the stem cell lab): How long was I in there? // Guard: five minutes. // Peter: Why aren't we funding this?!? <br /> <br /> Because it really. <br /> <br /> Thank you, family boy, for not only being the most entertaining show on TV (with the possible exception of the much-loved, much-missed futurama), but also being smart enough to use.
