Look, we've evaluated this entertainment value 10. It's a safe comedy, not an epic like The Lord of the Rings, or Gone with the Wind. Still for the comedy, particularly these days, is a 10. <br /> <br /> It is not a long film, it moves quickly and easily. Kelsey's Grammar at home is the role of a brilliant but brilliant captain of a diesel submarine, compared to the US Nuclear Navy in a war game, designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (a bit ironic for this plot ... pre 911) Don't take this subject seriously because it's mostly a laugh from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is 2nd in command (as "Frank Burns") and pulls a lot of laughter. All the others are perfect for their parts too. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple appearance, you have 90 minutes and you need a laugh or catch me and you are not a prude (theirs is a language and a little insinuation) so rent it, or buy it (we have done) and have fun! I wish they were a part 2!
