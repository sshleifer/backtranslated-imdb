Fantastic make-up effects and special effects create a truly terrifying monster, especially when the atmospheric shadows and the smoke of the sad rooms of the apartment are hidden. The characters are magnificently developed with extraordinary and surprising performances by an ensemble cast. Produced by Donna Switzer, the newcomer Ron Switzer has also written the script of the film to the rhythm of the face, weaving a thrilling roller coaster ride of twists, turns and terror that makes you guess right down to the last frame.
