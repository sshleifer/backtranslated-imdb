This short film was in the fourth part of the "Short Cinema Journal" - a film I rented from Netflix but which appears to have originally been a series of monthly films for people who like medium-sized modern shorts and I love having the DVD chock full of commercials . I have tried two DVDs of the Journal so far and felt infuriated by the horrible way a viewer has to navigate the disc to watch movies. Talk about an overly complicated and too complicated way to do it! While I have and will continue to see as many short films as I can, I really doubt that I will bother with the Journals because of these factors. <br /> <br /> Now it could be because I didn't like the record so much that I wasn't favorably disposed towards this Portuguese animated short. This is certainly possible. However, even if this is the case, I feel that the other reviews were too positive about this simple little film. Some of the works of art were really beautiful - I liked how simple black and white drawings suddenly became three-dimensional settings when the camera moved away from a boring distant shot and dived into the city below. This was nice and took some work. But as for the story of a cat who wants to go to the moon, he did nothing for me. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE - I saw this movie again on a DVD called "Cartoon Noir" on 5/09. It was a rather unpleasant collection of art films. However, this time I saw THE STORY OF CAT AND THE MOON with a completely different audio track and the guy made the difference. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, he had an accented French storyteller who spoke English in Film Noir style. While I usually hate dubbing, this time he really made the film. The narration of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or do not understand the subtleties. Unless you speak the language, try searching for the other version (provided you understand English).
