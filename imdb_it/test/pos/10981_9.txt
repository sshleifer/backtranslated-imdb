Witches, colorful characters, family relationships, facing adversity, living with fun and humor. This film has everything and more. What a great story of "every man (and woman)", with plot and script of first quality. It offers only clean fun, lots of laughs, lots of smiles and pure fun for the whole family. The other reviewers describe the story some. Will I offer you this comparison teaser ?? he is part of "Best of Show", "Grumpy Old Men", "Millions" and some other comedy and life movies in one. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie probably has a limited version and is probably not very available for rent. But now it's available on DVD and I highly recommend it for purchase. If you like good old-fashioned and fun family movies, you can't miss "Manna from Heaven". This film is a sure fire for the blues or to chase away the darkness in days of bad weather or in difficult times.
