** SPOILERS ** Simple film on simple people whose problems are too complex to manage. <br /> <br /> Natalie aka Sara Ravenna, Shirley Knight, was overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she is now pregnant is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Taking off from her homes on Long Island, New York, Natalie has no idea where she is going, but hopes to find peace and tranquility somewhere in the heart of America. It is on the Pennsylvania Turnpike that Natalie picks up the hitchhiker Jimmie "Killer" Kilgannon, James Cann, who looks as lost and confused as she is. While Natalie, who calls herself Sara at the time, soon discovers that Jimmie had a serious concussion while playing soccer on his collage team and was reduced to such a simple individual that he is so passive that he leaves it to everyone, even in followed in the movie Natalie, trample him. <br /> <br /> At first nice Natalie becomes very annoyed by Jimmie's self-pity for not standing up and being used as a doormat by everyone he comes into contact with in the film. Not knowing what to do with the child, Jimmie Natalie finally manages to get him a job in distant Nebraska as a cleaner in Alfred's Reptile Jungle pet market, Tom Aldrege. Being the kind and simple person that Jimmie is, he leaves all the animals out of their cages causing havoc in the pet shop and gets him fired by his boss Mr. Alfred. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, anyone who thought she'd finally arrived with Jimmie ends up back in the Reptile Jungle when she gets a speeding ticket from the trafficker Gordon, Robert Duvall. It seems that Mr. Alfred is also the county district judge and is the person with whom Natalie will pay for her traffic. While all this is happening, Gordon, the policeman, had developed a strong liking for Natalie and wanted to carry it in the sack, in his trailer, the first chance he could. Gordon, a widow with an uncontrollable 12-year-old daughter, Rosalie, Marva Zimmet, needs a mature woman - with so much love - to make him forget her many social and psychological problems and Natalie is exactly the medicine the doctor ordered! <Br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** Wild and shocking ending with Gordon completely out of his mind and trying to rape Natalie, who refused his drunken advances, who finally got Jimmie out of his torpor self-pity and come to his rescue. There is no happy ending here with Natalie being rescued from being beaten and raped by Gordon, but by Jimmie, who was bouncing around Gordon like a ping-pong, ending up dead for all his good and noble efforts. <br /> <br /> Jimmy was by far the most tragic and understanding person in the entire film. All Jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with him and all he ended up getting was the end of the stick. By all, the only person who initially treated him with kindness and understanding Natalie Ravenna! Eventually Jimmie, even though he was treated as dirty by everyone, despite his willingness not to offend, even those who trampled him became the most likeable and at the same time heroic person in the film.
