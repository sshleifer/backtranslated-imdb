This film was well played and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu were alive today! This film paints a picture of what Stu Unger's life might have felt like. It was interesting to see how connected he was. I would have liked to see more details on Stu's party, his ability to play and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But all in all, this film was well made, well acted and the story touched on many facets of a life that was full of many events that were bigger than life. <br /> <br /> This film is worth renting.
