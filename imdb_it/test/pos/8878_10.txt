This film was one of the laughter movies I've ever seen. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Momma is represented in an excellent way, and was one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film it starts in a different way than you would expect. Larry is trying to write a book and he's having problems. Larry teaches a writing class and Owen tagged after Larry tried to convince him to read his story. Owen eventually asks Larry to kill his mother, and in return Owen would kill Larry's ex-wife. The whole movie was really hilarious. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when Owen writes "Throw Momma from the Train". Larry gets upset because he has just written a similar story book. It turns out that Owen wrote a pop-up book for children. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie. I gave a 10.
