While my children enjoyed the movie (and later announced that they want to buy it later), I think I got more out of it. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I didn't use the sharp comment out loud, but I thought it). It's a good middle-aged movie, a bit mushy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the child stay with Bruce Willis after knowing his mother is dying?), But all in all, good weather. He also gave our family something to talk about - did my children think my life was boring? What do they expect at 40? How do you not like a movie that has a nice chat with your children?
