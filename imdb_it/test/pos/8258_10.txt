please, why not put this awesome movie on DVD, I've been searching for years as the previous writer, what is taking in hand or showing it on TV. it's so underrated that it's one of the most romantic and wonderfully written books I've ever read, and I think I've read some. I seem to think that it was read on radio 4, but I can't even find it. Why not try it and do it again, I promise it will be the greatest, people love this kind of story, so please release it and take us out of our misery or let's make it up, even though I doubt it could be improved. Someone has read the same author on earth or seen the film with Jennifer Jones, this is superb, but not to the same extent.
