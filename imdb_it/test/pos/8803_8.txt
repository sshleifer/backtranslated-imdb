I went to expect not much from Human Traffic and I came out really happy! The film is well made, played and very elegantly filmed. It has a lot to offer - it's a film that I highly recommend, especially to those who liked Trainspotting (or those who like to discuss the debate in the field of drugs and the media). Terrible fun.
