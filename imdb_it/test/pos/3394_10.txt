Anyone who has played this film was a genius, every character is perfect for his part and everyone does an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good cross-section of what life was before and during the civil war, the difference between the rich, the average whites and the black people. History offers some insights into the real problems of the time and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday life at that time. The plot is compelling and the drama draws attention to the whole film. There are characters you will fall in love with, there are characters you will hate and find yourself emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Both my wife and I fell in love, and we'll see it again in a few years, I'm sure.
