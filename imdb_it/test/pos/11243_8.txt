Of course, there seems to be only about 17 minutes of real content in each episode, but it's definitely fun to watch. You may find yourself creating yourself in the chair while a friend puts his foot in his mouth and gets knocked down, or chuckling and shaking his head when a ridiculous line really works. The host group has more than a good-natured, friendly (I dare say Canadian) commentary style compared to the ruthless programming of American reality. I think the people who complain about this show don't understand the joke. They are taking the show more seriously than the show does alone. Keys to the VIP is a great caricature of reality shows, sports television culture and the club scene. I hope they make another season and I would be interested to see if an American version appears. It is certainly a fun and original premise.
