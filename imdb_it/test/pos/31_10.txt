I just saw The Dresser tonight, after seeing him only once, about a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> It is not a "great" film, and it does not try to make a great success, but my God, the splendor of the two clues leaves me speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than fantastic in this film. <br /> <br /> The Dresser is the story of Sir, an old Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), a sort of waiter, producing a production of King Lear during the London blitz in second World War. These are two men, each dependent on each other: Sir is almost helpless without Norman's help to coax, tighten and bully to make him come on stage for his 22nd performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life through a third party through Sir; without Sir needing him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a movie based on the characters; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and, as such, requires top-level actors to bring it to life. Finney, just 47 years old, is completely credible as a very old theatrical actor, very sick, petulant, arrogant, but brilliant. Hisses and smokes against his fellow actors even when they are taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing than the carving dresser, who sometimes has to behave more like a mother than a valet for his elderly employer. The employer is really the wrong term to use, though. Although technically their relationship is that of an employer and an employee, most often Sir and Norman behave as if nothing were an old married couple. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in the cast of this film but there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay and Ronald Harwood's wonderful script. This does not mean that there are no other good performances, in particular Eileen Atkins as the champion of the long suffering Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets and what could have been. <br /> <br /> Although no one speaks these days, it is worth mentioning that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Film, Best Director (Peter Yates ) and Best adapted screenplay. <br /> <br /> I had remembered it as a good movie, but I was not prepared to be completely hypnotized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is, and have a great time all the time, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.
