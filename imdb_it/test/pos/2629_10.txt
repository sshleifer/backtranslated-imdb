I saw this movie for the first time at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time favorites! It's a classic: the intriguing plot, the great characters, the suspense and the shocking ending (all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Monterey / Big Sur coast) never gets old. Roy Thinnes plays Johnny Brant, a captivating character who becomes more mysterious as his true identity develops. The acting is great and credible; viewers are involved in the web that develops between the husband of the workaholic, the disenchanted wife and the seductive stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I've been looking for a copy to buy for years - I guess TV movies aren't released on video, unfortunately. Great movie, see it if you can find it.
