Human Traffic is undoubtedly the most original and compelling film I've seen in a long time. It documents 2 days in the life of a group of young people, bored by their daily existence and from endless jobs and from ecstasy to raves at the weekend. It's hilariously funny and extremely touching, and sometimes very sad. In the same genre of "Trainspotting" he has a great soundtrack and presents young British stars on the rise. The film was made with a minimal budget and I look forward to the future offers of writer / director Justin Kerrigan when his talent will be discovered by major filmmakers.
