This is a video version of a theatrical production, with extra footage for the video edition. The result gains both the drama of the stage and the impact of the well produced film. George Tsypin's set, with sculptures and masks by Julie Taymor, is superb. <br /> <br /> Jessye Norman is terrific, and you can hear (and see) the young Bryn Terfel. This production is stunning, emotional and majestic. If you don't see it, you're lost.
