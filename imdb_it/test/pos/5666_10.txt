<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, obscure, obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, it reminded me of Edgar Poe's stories. Probably not a masterpiece, but leaves us with the memory of strong images, refined music, fear, sadness, confusion and a sentence that says it all: the wolves are coming. GIORGINO is quite forgotten now, and when it was released no one seemed to appreciate it. It's a shame. If you ever get the chance to see it, well ... try it.
