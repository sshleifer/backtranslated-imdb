Good film, there were all the elements of a good movie, story, actors, script and direction. I was on the edge of my place all the time. <br /> <br /> No doubt, it's a low-budget film, but I liked it more than most big-budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice on the phone and then only fear. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance. It's an excellent part of the film. <br /> <br /> I liked the growing ambiguity towards the end, even though we know the protagonist may be involved, we continued to see everything from his point of view and asking: Who is the murderer?
