Everyone has the right to an opinion. The only critic that matters is yourself. I think this is a great movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In "Caddyshack", Rodney Dangerfield is fun, but hateful. He was asked to follow up, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows the saying that "less is more". It's fun, but a man with real family problems, a more rounded person. It is not a drama, but a film that makes you feel. Actually, in some places, you're sorry for Jackie Mason, especially when his daughter joins him. <br /> <br /> It has a good soundtrack and, overall, is sorry. A good ending for the series. <br /> <br /> In the television program "Alf", Alf says he shouted in "Terms of tenderness". His wife, Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says he shouted to "Caddyshack 2".
