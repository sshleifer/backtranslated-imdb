The best part of the movie was when Alan pulled down her panties and cut the razor on her ass cheeks and around her ass. It was also fantastic to see Alan's son go up and down like a violin elbow later in the film. <br /> <br /> Alan was as tough as he was when he got annoyed and pushed his four eyes open on the couch. <br /> <br /> I laughed for days on the razor cut. A brilliant idea of ​​the writers. Alan must be reported in Eastenders so that he can do the same with Peggy. <br /> <br /> Alan is back, and this time he is armed with a razor. Be careful if you are a girl and he finds you and pulls your pants down.
