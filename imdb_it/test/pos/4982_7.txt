The Violent Men is a pretty good western that surely benefits from its excellent cast. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is the great breeder who tries to squeeze smaller breeders, one of which is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to placate her boyfriend (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) kills one of Ford's hands. Then you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is Robinson's intriguing wife, the kind of role she specializes in. Dianne Foster plays the daughter who comes to admire Ford. <br /> <br /> The Violent Men is nothing but a "B" plot with a cast of "A" but it is very well done.
