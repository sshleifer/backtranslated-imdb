I thought this movie was incredible. I absolutely loved it, even though my brothers didn't do it much. The special effects were exceptional and this film is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that was disappointing in this fantastic film is that it is difficult to watch two or more times in a row. This film is absolutely on top of anything else I've ever seen. It was everything I expected from a movie. I just loved it. Furthermore, it was quite suitable for children. This film helped me to understand that when you think about it, everything is possible. I would give a pure 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies put together. Absolutely amazing. I love.
