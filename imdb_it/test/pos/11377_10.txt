This film has it all. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy and excellent script and direction by Paul Thomas Anderson. I have seen this movie several times and I have more fun every time. It does not age, it is constantly fun and stimulating. Easily the best role of Burt Reynolds, and he does a great job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also give excellent comedy shows. There is no weak element in this film.
