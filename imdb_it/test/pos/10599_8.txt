I saw this movie with the hope of a good laugh, but when I saw it I didn't stop laughing for weeks, they are such bad actors and it made this movie much more fun to watch. (By the way, Ryan Dunn didn't eat the toy car, he pushed it up the ass) The casual appearances of skaters and Vitos parts were fantastic. Give me some Vito grapes! No Valo, your grapes are in the store. I wouldn't recommend anyone under the age of 13 to watch it, frankly they wouldn't understand half of the lines or what they're talking about. I love VLB and after watching this movie I couldn't help but go and buy it or the Viva La Bam series. What is the deal with this stupid comment? Must be 10 lines what kind of Bull-sh1t is that? I should be able to write so long or in this case as short as possible. I will keep typing until he tells me I can actually send it. It was just a waste of time, I expected to say what I wanted, it wasn't too much, but then I was told that I had to keep inserting more and then correcting my spelling, so if I hadn't spelled something right , get what I still mean. This is incredibly long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live with the Sword are killed by those who do not ~
