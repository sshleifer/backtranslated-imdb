Eichard Gere and Diane Lane return to another romantic love story. They're an excellent team, BUT somehow this movie won't be among the best, <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe who uses a screenplay by Ann Peacock and John Romanao, for the Nicholas Sparks novel, does a job to be able. This is the umpteenth story of two strangers who meet and fall in love, then go on like this, then when they are about to meet again and start a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER but not really. Tragedy happens, one of them dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we already seen this. <br /> <br /> Who has never seen this type of tear gas, I hope you like it more than me. This story is about every clich√© that exists. <br /> <br /> The only reason he has the ratings I will give him. it is because of fine acting and excellent production. The cast in addition to our 2 stars includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. they all perform very well and do their best with the material they have received. <br /> <br /> There is a good but unfinished storm sequence, the sex scenes are well done, no nudity and almost no foul language, <br /> <br /> Classifications: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 of 10)
