I totally agree with GarryJohal of Singapore's comments on this film. Quote: "Yes, not Singaporean can't see what the big problem of this film is. Some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly Singaporeans are the ones who actually" understand "it. it's still completely true, and as a Chinese-Malay, I "understand" it even if I don't speak Hokkien because we also have similar "problems" in Malaysia, I know it's really hard to understand and accept this as REALITY, but it's NOT a "true story". I was glad to see this movie out of Malaysia, because it will surely be banned in Malaysia too, which means you get it in "VCD or DVD illegally copied" or hopefully someone is kind to " share it "on the Internet. This is not another violent adolescent drama ......." because it portrays the reality that exists in Singapore (and also in Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + humor). I was just a little sad to know that this film had about 20 cuts in censorship. What a waste!
