HBO has created this show to show us the most realistic view of the prison possible and have done a hell of a job. Oz was created by the creators of Homicide who wanted to show an original version of the prison. This show is what launched the idea of ​​every other original HBO program like The Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under among others. Oz is the nickname for the Oswald state penitentiary, an imaginary prison in some states of the United States that is never declared (although with accents, crime scenes and distribution of the NY race it is obvious). The main unit of imprisonment examined on the show is Emerald City, an apparently ideal prison unit with more privileges than those designed by a unitary liberal manager named Tim McManus. Overall this show shows us how it really is if one wants to survive in prison. <br /> <br /> There are about 10 bands shown on Oz. First we have the Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve the living conditions of blacks everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said, a black militant minister who wants to destroy everything that is racist in the justice system. As a group they are not so much anti-white but rather anti-injustice. Our second group of blacks is Homeboys who are essentially street blacks who want to keep all the bad ghetto behaviors and manage drug trafficking. Their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence. In this group, a terrifying character is Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African prisoner who is essentially the most terrifying character in the world. This band as a whole receives lateral help from the Irish at times and is always in conflict with Latins and Sicilians for drug distribution purposes. Being that Oz is mostly black, the Homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside. <br /> <br /> Latinos and Sicilians, like the Homeboys, have a different leadership due to the violent deaths that occur during the show. Sicilians have virtually the right to say how any illegal activity is conducted in Oz. Latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be able to shoot well if they are not in control. However, unlike Homeboys, these gangs do not have the same internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irish who are mentioned above are a smaller band led by a manipulator and snake Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to stay healthy with all the powers of the drug and manages to manipulate things on his way whenever he wants. They have no illegal control but are at least on good terms with all who are. <br /> <br /> Among the whitest prisoners, we have the Bikers and the Aryans. Motorcyclists are just a group of tattooed addicts who help Aryans get out most of the time. The Arians are the most hated and hateful gang for almost all Oz spectators. They are led by Vern Schillinger who is one of the most racist, sick and sadistic characters to be seen. Both gangs do not control anything illegal, they just let the darker-skinned prisoners see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white prisoners are soft. We also have others. The Others is a band of foreign inmates who are not necessarily a problem for any other prisoner. In this group we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a girl whose life is forever altered by prison. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man tied to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who recounts the show and introduces the public to each inmate. The character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and Augustus tells us how long they will be in prison. Finally, there are Christians and gays among the gangs. Christians simply remain religious to avoid going mentally and the Gays are a group of cross-dressers who are often raped by other inmates. <br /> <br /> This show delves into many issues concerning the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any prison film. Since the language is unpublished, we have here more racist epithets and swear words than in any other television program. Augustus Hill's commentary provides us with a good way to really understand every problem regarding Oz. This show is as good as it is not at all for light to medium heart. He explicitly shows the use and distribution of drugs by any means possible, prison rape, murder, fatal stabbing and general gore of anything else he has seen. I think it's the most influential and greatest show ever created, but I can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show. If you are interested in prison shows and films, Oz is a must see.
