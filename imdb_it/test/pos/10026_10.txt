Warner Brothers has significantly changed with American history in the hit movie western of the "Big Trail" director Raoul Walsh "They died with their boots", a somewhat inaccurate but totally uplifting biography of the cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film tells Custer from the moment he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn. This is one of the most important roles of Errol Flynn and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn joined quite often afterwards, and "They died with their boots" brought Olivia de Havilland together as a romantic interest for Flynn for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute black-and-white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences, romantic and humorous scenes and severe dramatic clashes between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious errors concerns Colonel Philip Sheridan who is shown as commander at West Point before the civil war. In fact, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. In fact, the commander was Robert E. Lee as shown in the previous film Flynn "Santa Fe Trail". Another historical interval concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of the Union troops during the civil war. Warner Brothers introduced Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer neither drank nor smoked. Nevertheless, these and other historical tricks do not take anything away from a truly splendid film. <br /> <br /> "They died with their boots" opens with Custer riding the West Point Military Academy in a masked uniform with an African American carrying his luggage and taking care of his dogs. After the guard's sergeant realized he was a guard of honor for a future plebe instead of a high foreigner general, the sergeant transformed Custer into a cadet in the standings Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy of "City for Conquest") to take charge of him. Sharp carries out practical work on Custer by installing it in the quarters of the major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of the "Task Force") who immediately manages Custer. Of course, the volatile Custer attacks Sharp in a public brawl. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of "The Sons of Katie Elder") is ready to dismiss Custer from West Point for unseemly conduct. Apparently, Sheridan can't expel Custer because Custer didn't sign up. Once enrolled, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits at will. When the American civil war breaks out, West Point graduates in cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat. One of the last cadets pushed to war is Custer. Eager to enter the fight, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth "Libby" Bacon (Olivia de Havilland of "Santa Fe Trail"), and they engage each other, despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart of "Carosello") who detests the view of Custer. It seems that Bacon crossed Custer in a sedan and insulted one of Custer's friends and our hero scolded Bacon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in Washington, Custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but Major Taipe has refreshed his heels. Custer befriends Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon") and shares his appetite for cremated Bermuda onions that become one of Custer's characteristics. Scott not only makes sure that Taipe assigns Custer to the Second Cavalry, but Custer also appropriates Taipe's horse to reach his command. During the Battle of Bull Run, on 21 July 1861, Custer disobeyed orders from none other than Sharp, hit his superior officer and held a bridge so that the infantry could cross it. Injured in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Custer receives a medal rather than a court martial. When Confederal General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union army at the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the possibility that the South could triumph. When a brigadier general cannot be found, Scott encourages Taipe to promote the first available officer. A mistake is made and Custer is promoted. To the incredible, Custer embraces the moment and breaks Stuart's advance. After the war, Custer slows down and starts to get him drunk with the local saloon boys. Sharp presents himself as a promoter of crooked railways and with his father they try to enlist Custer as president of their railroad so they can get funds. In the end, Libby intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan, who was in command of the army, and returns him to active service as commander of the 7th cavalry. When he takes the lead, Custer finds the seventh cavalry a drunken sack and is not surprised that Sharp commands the liquor at the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first encounter with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn of "The Guns of Navarone") and takes him into custody. Obviously, Crazy Horse runs away, becomes Custer's opponent, and they fight. <br /> <br /> Once Custer has quelled Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp with Taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other Indian nations. They also make Custer accused of hitting Taipe in a saloon fight. On the way to Washington, Custer discovers the treachery of Sharp and Taipe who cashed a golden blow in the sacred Black Hills. The settlers go wild and the Indians hit the war path. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the Little Big Horn in an open-body battle against 6,000 Redskins. The "Stagecoach" Bert Glennon lenser captures both the grit and the glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry that leaves the fort at dawn is spectacular. As an additional premise to Custer's imminent demise, Libby faints after leaving his rooms for the Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots" benefits from an excellent score by Max Steiner that incorporates the melody of the "Gary Owen" regiment.
