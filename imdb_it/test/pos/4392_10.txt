I thought this movie was great! I saw it when it came out in theaters, so I don't remember all the details. I remember that it was based on the story of Homer on Ulysses. The names of places and events have changed, but it is still possible to see the similarity with the story. <br /> <br /> I found it amusing how they would get in trouble and how they would get out of it. I really liked this version of the old stories modernized much better than Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. <br /> <br /> I will agree that in some parts of the story it is a bit silly at times, but all in all is a great adventure with some great actors.
