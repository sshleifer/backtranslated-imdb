If there's one cartoon that helped put UPA on the map more than any other, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This story of a boy who only speaks in sound has kept his charm for the last 57 years. In addition to the effects, he loved music, abstract animation and backgrounds, the narrative of Marvin Miller, practically everything. And he won the Oscar for best animated short film of 1950. Happy to have seen it on YouTube after reading this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. Even the creator of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Bill Scott, contributed, how wonderful! I hope to see the subsequent short films made in the series, if not on YouTube, then perhaps in a DVD collection. Now I guess I'll watch another UPA nearby ...
