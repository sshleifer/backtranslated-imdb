Maybe I'm reading too much, but I wonder how much hand Hongsheng has had in the development of the film. I mean, when a story is told by the main character as if he were himself, I would think it would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. And that would make it a bit biased. <br /> <br /> But ... even your family and friends may have helped you get the details of Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been told by the prospects of Hongsheng's family and friends. They saw her transformation and were not so messed up with drugs that they remembered everything. <br /> <br /> Even though Hongsheng is full of himself, the consistencies of the pose of Jesus Christ make him look like a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he is obviously still alive while he was cast as if himself) for the happiness of his family. Eh? <br /> <br /> The spectator sees it at its lowest points while maintaining a superiority complex. He lies on the grass that descends from (during?) A tall man alone and with his father, contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, celebrates his freedom on a bicycle while stretching his arms, his head bent towards the side. <br /> <br /> It's fabulous that he doesn't have drugs anymore, but he's not a hero. He went from a high point in his career to acting at his most vulnerable point while under the drug to return somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> This same device is used in "Blow" by Ted Demme where the audience identifies with the main character who is shown as an imperfect hero. <br /> <br /> However, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a recommended film, especially for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling you get when what we assume to be the home of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage for a play. It makes the viewer feel like Hongsheng's life was simply a game told in many difficult parts.
