It's just one of those movies, you love it or hate it, my girlfriend and they loved it, told my brother to rent it and he hated it, he said it was too flashy and conversational, then again it just usually goes see great action movies, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. Were there some great new talents (I had never heard of leads before)? Des Brady (the directors' brother?) He was particularly good at it. At first I played with the right, I thought he would never redeem himself, but he managed to crawl out of the black hole he had created and in the end I really found myself on course for him. A very surprising film with a lot of heart, if you can live without a number of bodies and explosions, this is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the United Kingdom.
