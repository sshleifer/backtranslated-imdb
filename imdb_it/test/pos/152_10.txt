After seeing Oldboy I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work, partly good but never nears Oldboy's level of humor and originality. This makes it not like Oldboy in the plot or style but the same level of quality is there. <br /> <br /> Acting is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances. Kim in particular manages to go from the gruesome scenes of horror to surreal comedy without the slightest mistake. <br /> <br /> The plot is weird with lots of twists and turns and it impresses vampire clichÃ©s. /> <br /> Direction is full of rhythm and humor and some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. It boasts what is probably the strangest love scene you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
