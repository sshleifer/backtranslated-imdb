Dan Finnerty and the Dan Band are so good, they have to be seen to believe. Does anyone out there have a copy of the Bravo concert for sale ?? Please, if there is an upcoming release, let us know. I checked the Bravo site, but there are no future dates scheduled for a repeated performance by the most endearing choreographed guys, the Dan Band. What great energy emanate, that let slip with a tender American boy attitude, based on the delicate sensitivity of the butch that wraps itself in sequins and tears, making men and women fall in love with them. I hope that enough people can influence Bravo's powers to bring the show back into our lives, like a six-month special.
