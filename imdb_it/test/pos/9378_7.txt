Edward Dmytryk directed this dark film on a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. Robert Young talks about hatred, Robert Mitchum crosses most of this photo, and Gloria Grahame revisits the finesse she displayed in "It's A Wonderful Life". It is Robert Ryan who gets to the heart of the matter: anti-Semitism. He delves so deeply into his role as Monty Montgomery (imagine parents named Lawrence calling their son Larry!), That the drama lies exactly on his shoulders, and is more than up to the challenge. Without him, the film would be the order of the day. Ryan played a number of memorable villains in his day ("Bad Day at Black Rock", "Billy Budd"), but this performance put him on the map. With Sam Levene as the victim of the murder.
