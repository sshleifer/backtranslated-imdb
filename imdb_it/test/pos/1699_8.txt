this film is not as bad as some claim it is more pleasant than the original. maybe that's why some people hate him so much because they don't want to admit it is a good movie (not great). <br /> <br /> Most if not all fx were made by CGI that I didn't care for at all was a funny movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) I thought the best guy in the movie Julie Delpy was pretty attractive, he brought sensuality to the film. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of jokes in the film that I thought were good. this film is in my collection but the original is not because I don't like it as much as this. I wasn't bored when I watched this movie that made me look unlike some horror movies I could mention as oh say = driller killer & suspiria (the silver dario movie), to name just two. <br /> <br /> this is a Werewolf movie ok it should be in people's collection if they like werewolf movies, maybe I'll get the original at some point, maybe. I have only one complaint and this is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been more than he was but other than that the film was fine. <br /> <br /> evaluation for this film 8/10 a werewolf ok film not the worst out there. <br /> <br />
