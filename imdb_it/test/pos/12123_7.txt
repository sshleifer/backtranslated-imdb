I don't know if it's right for me to review this. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. I never realized that the movie industry was creating heroes with members of the mafia and cold-blooded killers. When The Godfather came out, I thought they had broken the patterns, but decades have produced a series of well-represented crime films with the most important stars and directors who made them. This is obviously low budget, but it is certainly well done. At some point in all of these I feel like I want to take a shower. If such characters really exist, it is difficult for the soul. I always intellectualize that humanity will rise above this kind of thing. This type of crud must be stopped. I hope that people who go to movies like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. I feel the same way in the slasher movies. Why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment? In all honesty, I'm judging this about acting and directing, and for what it is, it seems to work pretty well.
