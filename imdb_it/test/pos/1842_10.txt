Great movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a big fan of David Duchovny and he's great in this movie! I'd like to see it in more films of this nature. His talents are definitely underutilized and he has much more to offer besides "Agent Mulder" (although I'm a big fan of that series), anyway, I want to see more. It is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST! A great love story that shows that love never dies ... it is with you forever. Minnie Driver is fantastic and how can you go wrong with a cast containing Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This film has not received any kind of recognition, but it has earned one. Great job Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... even the soundtrack is fantastic! **
