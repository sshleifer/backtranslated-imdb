This film has an excellent premise and is really a cry to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster movie. As a reminder (and some years have passed since I saw the film) the action begins with a London omnibus full of people. There is a horrible accident and a passenger dies. The rest of the film is then told in flashbacks, with 13 characters on the bus and their recent lives explored in intricate detail. At the end of the film we return to the crash and discover which of these clear and lively characters has met a gruesome end. Great things, a bit like good tabloid news enriched with precise and even past details. If only it were available on video ...
