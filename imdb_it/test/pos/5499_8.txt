In The Line of Fire he gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is tormented by John Malkovich in this exciting film. Malkovich says he will kill the president, and purposely calls Eastwood, and presses his buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cool, but very intelligent mentality to his character. Everything he does, he does it for a reason, and he is not afraid to kill. Eastwood must overcome the suspicions of his superiors to capture Malkovich, but nobody wants to listen to him. The result is a suspense-cracked film that turns into a scene of tension in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson increases the tension and we feel at every turn.
