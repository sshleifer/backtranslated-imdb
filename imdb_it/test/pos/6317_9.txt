I saw The Consequences of Love at the 2005 Rotterdam Film Festival, it was the first of ten films I saw there. The Consequences left the strongest impression of the ten films. From the first shot, you know the film will be something special. The beautiful photograph has left me in awe of what can be done with a camera. The music is also on par with the images, completing the colorful and elegant images like architecture. <br /> <br /> Toni Servillo plays the main character of the film, Titta. He is a tax expert who has gone wrong living in a hotel. Every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story sounds around this. <br /> <br /> It is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion for anyone; He looks calculated and well dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who have no meaning for him. For example Sofia (played very well by Olivia Magnani), who works as a waitress in the hotel where she lives. Even if he has been working in a hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if he greets him. One day he confronts him with this and the next day he sits down at the bar, instead of the usual window seat. Hence the story really begins, and will take place in a story of love, sacrifice and mafia. <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin the rest of the film. Watch this movie if you love fashionable movies like those of David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Don't see it if you're an action fan.
