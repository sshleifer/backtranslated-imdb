The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I've ever seen. All the technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, acting, direction, rhythm, etc.). HISTORY is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Seemingly beyond death, our main character finds himself dwelling in a world without beauty, passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationships are insensitive and uninspiring, and when everything becomes too much, he tries to close it in front of a train. But it doesn't end - he can't leave this strange world by suicide! Returning to a man who seemed to feel the same isolation and solitude, our main character joins him in digging a stone wall in the hope of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music. Just as they break through - and I won't reveal that much, it all ends and the film ends strangely as it started. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that you will love this movie or hate it. I feel that it is like a magic poem, open to many different interpretations and all valid like the next one. If you like new experiences in the cinema and want to be taken away from the Hollywood crap party, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I don't evaluate easily!) Because despite its darkness, this film left me with a sense of something bigger ... something mysterious and beyond ourselves. Very well!
