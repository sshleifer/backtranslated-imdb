I became a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm already a little biased, but I think this film is great, although there may be some lengths. It is a romantic non-romantic vision of the Great Liberation of the 60s, stylistically amazing (great scenography!) And, in my opinion, still very watchable. <br /> <br /> Basically it is an ironic reproach of the story of Adam and Eve who are driven out of paradise after tasting the forbidden fruit that has passed from an apple to a hypodermic full of heroin, the woman seduces a man to use it thus accelerating his destiny. the boy seems to be condemned and destined for an intensive life and an early grave starting from the great sequence of the title onwards. There is no place for any hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is rather sad, I was captivated by the beauty of both the beautiful Ibiza resort and Mimsy Farmer: I discovered that her character was at the same time superficial, enigmatic, captivating, annoying, interesting and boring, somehow it represents what men see in women in a simple and inoffensive way. in general are they put a lot or use ?? which appears to be a trademark of Schroeder. <br /> <br /> There is even a little humor, mainly expressed by Stefan, the main German character and his accent. Is his main nemesis not a snake but an older German of dubious reputation? and supplier of heroin - called Wolf. Even if it is a German name and Stefan is German, he pronounces it English verrry and in terms of jealousy spits his girlfriend's name at regular intervals ?? becoming a crying boy ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to earn a cell. "Once the boy snorkels and then awkwardly climbs a rock with his rubber fins ??? never had the most fun male frontal nudity in the history of cinema.
