Well, in 2002 I have a little delay to do. And looking back on an unpleasant year, Best In Show shone. No great plot. Little action Just a ride of magnificent characters. Particular reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a stunning pair of television commentators. Very well. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> Ron (Visa 24Mar2001)
