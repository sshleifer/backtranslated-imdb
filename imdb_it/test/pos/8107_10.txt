Here we have the inimitable Charlie Chaplin who abandons his slapstick past to address the grave theme of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. He describes two characters: the sweet and innocent Jewish barber, a war veteran, and the ruthless and ruthless dictator, Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of Hynkel and his armed thugs, who habitually shake its inhabitants, or leave them alone, dependent on his mood that day or week. The barber is among them, but is a friend of his former commander, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to keep things quiet for a while, until Hynkel condemns him in a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, particularly the barber, and the exuberant young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise will be - who will be the only one of these Jews to put their lives in danger to get rid of Hynkel and his cronies? We don't need to guess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead player for the dictator, and is equipped in his image, accompanied by Schultz, also in full military equipment. Hannah flees with some of her ghetto friends to the village of Osterlich, where Mr. Jaeckel's cousin (Maurice Moscovich) has a farm, and can live peacefully for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself was arrested by his armed forces, considering him a well-known barber. The latter, meanwhile, was escorted with Schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The ten minutes that follow are pure Chaplin himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom and denigrating greed and hatred. Although Chaplin began production in the film in 1937, some ingenuity can be forgiven. He apparently was not aware of the seriousness of this persecution and hatred, and said that if he knew all about it, he would never make the film, because he most likely believed it would trivialize the situation. He has a wonderful supporting cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful Billy Gilbert as Herring bumbling, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as the dictator Napaloni, his rival for the conquest , veteran European actors David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene that has choreographed with the globe, with only a musical accompaniment, is pure, luminous and bright inspiration, as well as Paulette Goddard at the end of the film, smiling through her tears. I've seen this movie before, but there's always something new in it for me. Last night, when it was over, I sat there in tears. I challenge anyone not to be touched.
