Here's how I summarize! There were others who said: Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think mine is more precise, but I'm not neutral on this point ...; o) <br /> <br /> This film is a kind of explosion of the past. It reminds you of the old movies (of the 50s and 60s) and not just because it plays in that period (1955 to be exact, with the exception of Flashback), but it is the mood in which the film is set and show on the screen! The main actor here (which is how he was said to me very popular in his homeland, France), is perfect in his role here. He is the spy with the number 117 attached to him. There's a character that sums it up in the movie, asking a question, whether he's good or not ... you'll see when you watch the movie! <br /> <br /> This is really very funny and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with an old school touch, but not taking yourself seriously or anything else seriously, then you need to watch this! : OR)
