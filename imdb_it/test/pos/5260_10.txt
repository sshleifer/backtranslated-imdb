People who don't like this movie seem to have an academic vendetta against it - those of us who don't own the original can enjoy it completely. <br /> <br /> My husband who had never seen the original said "I don't want to see a girly movie". I assured him that "women" is just a great movie, not a movie for girls. He had a great time. He was very happy to have gone and enjoyed more than the "boy" movie we saw the day before "burn after reading". <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I think the new ending is better. Maybe not so fun, but it was beautiful. At first I couldn't understand why they had made some changes to the plot <br /> <br /> but when I had the end and Debra Messing gives birth and brings the first male into the movie, I cried. Is this something to love about men? they are our children.
