In 1942 Belarus, two Soviet soldiers are captured by Nazi Belarusians. In captivity, the attitude of the two men towards their destiny is very different. One of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and an incomprehensible spirituality for the other man. Larisa Shepitko's latest film is one of the most beautiful war movies in film history. The cinematography, by Vladimir Chuchnov, is incredible - especially in the opening sequence, in which long, slow, tracking shots that portray loneliness and the almost desperate nature of the winter landscape in rural Belarus create the perfect atmosphere. It is easy to make a comparison with Tarkovsky's films, especially as Tarkovskij Anatoli Solonitsyn's alter ego has a small but important part in The Ascent. The acting is generally brilliant, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in the part of Sotnikov. The film reveals an antiquated belief in the power of religious passion, which feels tied to characters like Dostoevsky's Prince Myshkin or Tarkovsky's stalker. However, this is not a weak point in the film, but rather one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest and human, that it is impossible not to be moved. The emotional richness of the film cannot be overstated; the answer is not so simplified as a brief summary of the plot would make you think. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complicated relationships between them, somehow recall The Commissar, another great Soviet film. The Ascent deserves a second view, in addition to a third and a tenth. It continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images and emotional complexity.
