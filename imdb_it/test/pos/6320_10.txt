I own this movie. They are actually from the same city as the director brothers. But that doesn't make the movie better. But if you want to watch something not serious one night, and you don't have high expectations, I highly recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are trivial and the plot is trivial. But it contains key elements of a horror / comedy. I just want to see some kids from the cities making a movie full of effects. And I say "good" to the Campell brothers. Now they are making more films and are continuing a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the films that will help them start a great career with a great future. Speed ​​Freak Productions and Compound Pictures described in one word: POTENTIAL
