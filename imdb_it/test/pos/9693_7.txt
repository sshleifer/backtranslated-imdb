This is not the kind of film that really deserves critical attention. No Oscar will win - it's not really a very good movie. Heck, it's not even a movie - just a series of short and disgusting skits that come together to create entertainment. And as much as every critical bone in my body shouts to give this movie a bad score, damn it, I'm going to give it a much better score. The kind of people who are about to enjoy this film are not the kind of people who really care about what critics have to say, so I won't give any snobby criticism of Jackass's quality of existential surrealism that permeates and comments on how our society is. ... oh forget it. <br /> <br /> What to say? There is no plot development, character development - it's not a real start - there is a semi-funny ending that isn't as fun as the skit that precedes it, and everything in between smells like humor swimsuits that younger children laugh. It's actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Leave all your preconceptions about a good movie at the door. Jackass: Number Two is just crap. This is really all that is. I give this to the directors, though: they come up with rather fanciful things. You will probably be ashamed several times, would like to vomit a couple of times, move and move uncomfortably while people on the screen do stunts to death and vomit. Vomiting, crap, urine, sperm .... virtually every bodily fluid can be seen in Jackass: number two. There is nudity, sexual humor abounds, and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> It's fun. If you're the kind of person who finds this stuff fun, you'll probably like Jackass: number two. I laughed several times. Like I said, it's pretty fancy stuff. I never wanted to vomit, even though I have a rather strong stomach. I only accept the premise of the film: a bunch of idiotic guys suck strange for fun. Once you get over this, by accepting it and going with it, you'll like it. The only flaw in the film is the sheer excess of all the strange and disgusting things. There are several very imaginative and very disturbing scenes, but they drag you in many places while they make less interesting ones. Towards the end things resume, but in the middle of the film the resistance hurts the quality of the film. In a half-hour television show this is not a problem, but with the duration of the celluloid film, it is inevitable that at some point the boredom will occur. After a while crap just becomes desensitizing. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, Number Two is a fun, imaginative and, above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you with a feeling of pain, nausea and hilarity. Go see it if you have to, but hey, if you know you don't like this kind of thing, don't worry. You will only be disappointed.
