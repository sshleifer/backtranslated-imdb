I've seen this movie maybe 100 times, I never get tired. I saw this film the first time when I was 7, and since then it has left a mark on my memories. It is an enchanting love story that brings the sun out in most people, even in the darkest moments. I think this is a movie to "see" and one of Anthony Quinn's best performances ever. I just hope the TV channels send this film more often. It inspired me in a positive way and I will do it to many others. If there's an actor I wanted to meet, it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be a fellow man on silver screens ,,, ever. I wish Anthony Quinn was still alive. God bless his soul.
