I remember when this movie came out and I watched it a few times on VHS. I was so happy when it was FINALLY published on DVD. I was hoping for widescreen, but to the point I would have taken what was available. I love how they used color in the film, the outdoor scenes are so alive with color. Trees are the greenest I've ever seen. Most of the film was shot in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful city located on the St. Croix river. They must have places that are really sought after for filming, because they have done a great job. The story is well written and direct. I would rate him as one of Peter Horton's best. I'm also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (the director of photography) has not done more. He did an incredible job. Even the acting is there. It's amazing to see two such young actors pull out this kind of film. Annabella Sciorra did a great job as Dexter's mother. Who wouldn't want her as a mother.
