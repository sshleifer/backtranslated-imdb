Yes, I know that this film is intended as a comedy! And the humor is exaggerated! But the topic of people becoming less intelligent in the future may not be so far-fetched! I can't say that it will happen, but if we don't take care of our education system then this could be a possibility! I noticed that some schools no longer teach the facts! (Like history, geography, basic material). The focus is more on learning practical skills! The theory behind most subjects can be boring, but it is essential to understand how things work! In the film there is this ridiculous example of people cultivating crops with Gatorade instead of water! Well, we can laugh! But if you've never been taught that water contains the minerals needed to grow plants, how would you know! For me this is a scary notion! So now you understand why this topic is no longer fun! It could be that Mike Judge has fun but at the same time warns people of a real disaster if education doesn't improve quickly! I'm taking this movie too seriously! Yes of course! To each his fun! I loved the work of Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead and Office space)! In these he was able to be critical and fun at the same time! In "Idiocracy" I lost this! Most events are too absurd and, as I said before, they are very scary! I think if you're in the mood you'll like this movie!
