Bridges' dramatic film about a reporter discovering some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear power plant is well directed and a very interesting film from the late 1970s. It's not surprising, but it's solid, the acting is pretty good especially Jack lemmon, but even Douglas and Fonda were good. It was a pretty good script and Bridges' direction was solid and appropriate. This is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s, but it is one of the best. A good first film by Michael Douglas and Lemmon in his first film .--- IMDb Rating: 7.2, my vote:, so in simple words, solid but not surprising ... this is what this film is, solid but not surprising 8/10
