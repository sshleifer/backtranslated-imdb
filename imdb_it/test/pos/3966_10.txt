Accepted ... let's see. The only reason I chose to watch that movie was the hot dog shown in the commercials when Shrader (sp?) Said, "ASK ME ON MY WEINER". After that I had to watch that movie and watched it with a couple of my friends ... and WOW was great. One of the best films of the year. The whole movie was laughing like crazy! The plot of this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) is not accepted in any of the schools he applied, so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he became college. So do the finishing touches and make sure your parents make fun of you ... until, the more students look at the website and see the clicker (ACCEPTANCE IS A CLICK AWAY) and all these rejections come into this school. They face many problems and fail to achieve anything right. 10/10 YOU LOVED IT NOW IT HAS WATCHED
