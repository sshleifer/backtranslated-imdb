No bullets, no secret agents, a funny, fun and credible story. I met some of the producers / actors in this movie at the theater. They seemed to be as interesting as their characters on the screen. You may not have heard of this movie on TV with high dollar commercials, but it's definitely worth a try. I spent $ 8 on a movie ticket on many other films that weren't so funny. Waiting for future projects of this production company.
