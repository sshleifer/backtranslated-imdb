This series when the Dinosaurs lived for 65 million years ago. The Dinosaur looks very real and they are very realistic when they move. The way the climate changes is also very interesting. <br /> <br /> I am very interesting about how dinosaurs lived and died. I'm also interesting in the way the dinosaurs behaved. <br /> <br /> The color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discover. They think what color they had. <br /> <br /> The most interesting is why the dinosaurs died and what happened next. <br /> <br /> The BBC made a brilliant series of how dinosaurs lived and died!
