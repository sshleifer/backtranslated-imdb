NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere to the screen in a simply beautiful story about a man and a woman hungry for more in their lives than they currently have. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene of the film to their last embrace. The settings, the beauty of their mutual attraction when it develops when they meet for the first time, and the story that follows, and when they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance which is screened in an audience with tender care. James Franco in another micro role is just the right casting, and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house, is a real film of autumn 2008 to remember forever, as was THE NOTEBOOK.
