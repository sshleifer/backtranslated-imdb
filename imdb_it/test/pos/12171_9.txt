I gave 9 of 10 points. I was sitting in tears almost for the whole movie, because I had to laugh! <br /> <br /> Of course the story wasn't excellent, but it wasn't boring either. Erkan and Stefan were assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful Nina. While doing this work, they rank among the "first lines" of BND and CIA. Of course the two are neither born bodyguards nor gentlemen, so they run from one disaster to another; and they do it in such a fun way, that when you watch scenes you won't be able to stop the tears! As actors those two "stupidly smiling" characters do quite well, better than some so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> Do you think the two heroes' speech is curious or "pseudo-foreign"? Well, if you hear a lot of Turkish-German people in Munich exactly like them, you'll remember Erkan and Stefan. And perhaps, in 10 years it may have become the common discourse of young people. (God forbid!) <br /> <br /> So if you like to laugh, watch this movie!
