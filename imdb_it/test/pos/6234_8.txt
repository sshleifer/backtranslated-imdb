The Slasher movies started could be 30 to 35 years before this film, but believe me this among those pearls that will stay longer after you have turned the TV. Especially if you are an easily scared person this is the movie for you for which you would not have the stomach to take it full. Even after so many years the film has not lost its charm and thrill. <br /> <br /> No blood, no blood, but the thrill will surely make you relax your spine. the film begins with a bang and remains with the same rhythm until the end. BGM has a broken nerve and I remember that this was the one copied in many Indian films those days. King favorite? No wonder why ... this is the only reason I wanted to see it and it didn't disappoint me. "Don't turn off the lights" ... because you won't find Enrique but you could be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! be careful. not for the heart ... <br /> <br /> Two shots up and I'm going with 8 out of 10 which is quite low, but I still keep my votes for Dramas ...
