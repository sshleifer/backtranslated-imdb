"A Tale of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological horror that left me speechless. The film offers some delicious moments of horrible horror and is extremely disturbing. The small cast of actors is really excellent, with the protagonist Im Soo-jung in particular memorable in the title role. Kim Ji-woon's direction is well managed and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The plot is slightly confusing, but some scenes are wonderfully disturbing. The action is rather slow, but I wasn't bored. The house, where the film takes place, seems incredibly threatening and isolated. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is together with "Ringu" and "Kairo" one of the most original Asian horror films I have ever seen. Look at this masterpiece as soon as possible. My vote: 10 out of 10.
