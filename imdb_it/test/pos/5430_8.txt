Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when it's unleashed and sets aside his sloppy approach to drama. He manages to revive the usual frenetic pace of Barry Levinson, and there are moments in this film when it really shines. <br /> <br /> Like the friendly American president in "Man of the Year", Williams takes up the hilarity and outrage that was once associated with him. What makes it so attractive is its humanity and sympathy. Here is a man who can whip his audience but who really loves them too. His humor is like barbed wire, yet it is cathartic. It is what makes it very attractive to people in the film and in real life. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney once again plays an intelligent woman in difficulty. She is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think she boxed a stereotype and unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. Walken practically goes through his thankless role, and the climate scene in the SNL scene barely floats on the water. <br /> <br /> Enter for some hilarious moments, and those are priceless. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise fun movie.
