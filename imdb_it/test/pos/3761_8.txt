"Pearl Harbor, friend." This film is brilliant! Of course, it doesn't flow exactly like a multi-million dollar comedy, but the jokes that are constantly being thrown are incredible. I am one who goes for nonsense, very similar to "Dumb and Dumber", "Airplane" and "Wet Hot American Summer" and I must say that it easily ranks there. Movies are no longer written with this kind of sporadic comedy. Too many jokes in this are a surprise to the viewer who is honestly surprising that the more you don't know and praise this slapstick masterpiece! When you look at this, you will easily find more than 20 quotes that you will find to mention later ... and after seeing it again you will find even more!
