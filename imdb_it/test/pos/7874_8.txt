It was a rather unnerving look at a seemingly functional family compared to his daughter's drug addict. The father gets tangled up and eventually kills the drug addict boyfriend. Rolling around guilty, he reveals to a drunk that he redneck what he did. Things spin quickly before they completely degenerate. The ending you fear scares the viewer, but it is still able to scare when it finally arrives.
