One of the classic low budget 70s movies, this film was found in a video chat shop in London for only 50p. (interestingly, the package lists the star of the film as "Charles Bone", which looks like a porn star, but once the role of credits is obvious that the image is aligned to the right of the TV screen, so that all the cast i members have the last letter missing from their names) <br /> <br /> From the moment the narrator introduces us to the situation of the desperate tenants of a dirty New York apartment building, you know you are ready for a roller coaster ride of fromage. The direction is from Ed Wood's "One Wood" school - if one or two buddies watched the crew of the crew, then what the hell? <br /> <br /> The films end with a twist that puts The Usual Suspects of Shame.
