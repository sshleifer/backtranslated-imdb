Set in a California detention camp in an indistinct future, an English film crew goes to trial as young students and political dissidents are tried under a fictitious "Insurrection Act" that allows the US government to suspend civil liberties for its own citizens in emergencies without the right to bail or the need for evidence. In such cases the government is authorized to capture and detain anyone who it believes can engage in future sabotage activities. The group on trial includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. <br /> <br /> Those convicted by the conservative court can choose between a long prison sentence or three days in Punishment Park, where they can reach their freedom by reaching an American flag in the desert. They must do this without food or water. They must also be prosecuted by armed national guards and by the police who can return them to the camp if caught to face the penal sentence attributed to each convicted person. The reality is different; those who choose Punishment Park are hunted and killed or brutalized without any hope of gaining their freedom after a policeman was found dead in the park. The park appears to be a training ground for the police and guards who need to dominate these acts of repression so that they can be used in open American society. <br /> <br /> Shot on 16mm and in the documentary style developed by Watkins, in his famous Culloden and the controversial The War Game for the BBC; interacts with prisoners and guards and observes the unconstitutional process, cutting between them to create a totally convincing political film that still remains vital and relevant. Using his knowledge of the medium, Watkins produced a cinematic portrait of driving, implacable and ultimately frightening of a completely fictitious American political detention camp that would not have convinced if it had not been for its impeccable construction. Many of the actors are amateur improvisers with broad characters. The sparks fly in the test scenes in which each case is heard, partly due to the fact that Watkins kept those on trial away from the jury until the shooting of those scenes. Watkins also states that actors often express their opinions that certainly explain the ferocity and credibility of their performances. <br /> <br /> The film has been heavily criticized for polarizing the opinions of those who see it. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unequivocally represents that conservatism and war are the root of America's social problems. While these criticisms may be valid, it is important to consider that the film is working at an imaginary and metaphorical level and it is perhaps the realism that the film builds so skillfully that it encourages such a heated opinion on its content. In fact the most important theme of the film is the problem of polarization itself. "Conservative" judges and brutal law enforcement officers are on the one hand and "liberal" inmates are clearly on the other, without concessions made by either party. This seems to be the true meaning of the film. The new law and the park itself are the outgrowth of a situation in which the mediation between the two political positions has been lost. <br /> <br /> Done during and in protest against the Vietnam war and the treatment of those who opposed the war in America the main themes of the film about the government's persecution of its citizens and the conservatism that affects civil liberties continue to hit the same agreement in the era of the patriotic act and identity card. There is also a disturbing agreement with the news from Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners at the hands of the allied forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal "terrorism" is such a volatile issue that the film cannot fail to connect with current attitudes to the subject. Not surprisingly, the film had a history of chess distribution, being marginalized to an extreme because of its content, but the disturbing fact that this film may still remain so relevant today suggests that the wait was not for nothing. Punishment Park is a film that has had to struggle to be seen everywhere and requires your attention.
