It's About Time "Kate Jackson" took her credit for this movie .., I remember watching it and trying to figure it out on TV .., my grandmother was lying in bed dying of cancer and I was just 15 years old. I didn't find out years after Richard died long ago, I miss him in the other shows / movies he was in. <br /> <br /> I still have a copy of the VHS tape but it is NOT "CC" "or Closed Captioned for the Hearing Impaired and this is the ONLY flaw in the movie that I can remember or know until today .., not I was able to find a DVD or VHS copy that has subtitles in English too.If someone out there knows of a copy on VHS or DVD that does CC'd or has English subtitles please let me know. <br /> < br /> thanks - Cofffeenut
