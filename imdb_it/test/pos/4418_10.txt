I enjoyed today's show !!! It was a variety and not just cuisine (which would also have been excellent). Very inspiring and engaging, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what would happen. She is like down to earth and as beautiful as possible, like one of us who made the show even more enjoyable. Even the special guests, who are friends, have made a nice surprise. I loved the "first" theme and the audience was also invited to play. I have to admit that I was shocked to see her go under her time limits on a couple of things, but she did it and, wow, I'll write those recipes. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with the family. Those who have not yet tuned in, find out which channel and time, I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
