Well, I'm not a film critic or something. But I have my opinion for this movie. I think the best of this movie was Amanda Bynes, she played her role for my look very well, I saw a lot of her I liked this film the most! When you watch this movie, you can simply relax, go down and watch it. You don't have to try to search for subtext or something. The film is really fantastic. Maybe I liked it for the actress, maybe for the whole scenario, but I liked it. The whole atmosphere that was created. In a moment I felt like I was in that university, in that room. It is not another dramatic film that is made to win Oscars, it is just a good movie to watch in your spare time.
