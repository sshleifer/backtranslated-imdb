As I sat in the theater almost crying alone for the atrocity that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks called the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel which is Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel-Prequel angels and demons, and they have learned their lesson. <br /> <br /> Acting wise all are much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, but he is better at it, because he works more to give the film the feeling of being a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor does the best job of all the actors. It could also deserve a nomination to come in March, but doubtfully. He convinced me to the end. It is dynamic and faithful, but rational and realizes that the Church needs to put their past behind them. Even minor actors do a great job. <br /> <br /> Technically and visually the film is much improved. The Cinematography is much ... much better, and the visual effects are superb. The final sequence of explosions at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterly job, taking you on a tour of Rome. <br /> <br /> Estimated essay, Ron Howard does an incredible job this time keeping the story in motion, and not boring us with a history lesson considered to denouncing Christianity. The film makes you feel like you are in the game more. In our weak minds to find out whether or not Jesus had children, he is not at the top of the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion that kills thousands of people, including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason why I think the plot is so fast is due to the excellent score. I can't say enough about the score. Sometimes it was epic, like something from the Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it looked like a Bourne Movie, which is a nice mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this film is that it's ridiculously far-fetched. The chances that the Carmelengo is someone of Ewan McGregors age are highly unlikely, and the odds of a cardinal with an adopted child being elected pope are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole Antimatter thing, which has yet to be created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 .... <br /> <br /> Overall Angels and Demons is much narrower, faster, more exciting, and most important film of the Da Vinci Code. This must see the thriller for all those who love history and mystery combined into one.
