I think this film version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is pretty good. It's certainly fun. Well, it's not a masterpiece like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ('95) but there are very good things ... especially the setting of City of Bath !!! .. The Royal Crescent, the Roman baths, the fascinating Georgian atmosphere .. This is excellent. If you are a Bath fan like me, you will love watching this movie! The performances may seem a bit too "melodramatic", but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, is deliberately mocking popular stories of romance and terror and of the society of the period. The only disadvantage is probably the female protagonist since I personally have another idea of ​​Catherine Morland's physical appearance. Even the music is a bit "unusual" ... but I find it strangely acceptable even though it has nothing to do with the historical portrait period. I wonder what dear old Jane might think ... :)
