When I sat at the cinema to see it, I expected to see some sort of elegant ironic action movie, which had been implied by the trailers. However, it appeared very early that this film was trying to be more. Normally, I don't approve of films that try to entertain in all possible ways. For example, this film tries to mix the action with comedy, romance, light-heartedness and gritty seriousness all at once. Most of the time this kind of approach doesn't work in movies (just look at Batman Forever) but I was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they took it off. <br /> <br /> The end result is a very funny film that should interest the most mature movie recorders. (However, the weak of the stomach should be warned of one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller bring out a brilliant double act and Ken Stott is an excellent villain. This mix with superb costumes and some decent action scenes makes a watch a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> However, the great disappointment here for me is that in having "The Gentleman Highwayman" there was a real opportunity for a good dialogue but the script definitely lacked incisiveness and there were few laughs of belly. Ok, so the jokes weren't terrible, but for me it highlights a problem with recent British films; ignoring some noteworthy exceptions, scripts written today are still relatively mediocre compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.
