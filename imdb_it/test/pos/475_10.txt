I have difficulty putting into words how wonderful it was. From time to time you see a movie that sticks only to you. "You Are Alone" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I mentally repeat the scenes every day, analyze them and retrace the emotions, as if seeing them for the first time. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I don't like about the movie. Incredible soundtrack !!! The finish was perfect. Very emotionally exciting !!! It was compelling and compelling. <br /> <br /> I loved Jessica Bohl and her performance was the biggest I've ever seen. I admired Brittany's strength (that strong woman). <br /> <br /> The tag is "When your darkest moments come to life". We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says I would never do it, when we really have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of everything and this film directly explores that topic. The film's honesty could be my absolute favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Gorman Becherd for a perfect work of art !!!!
