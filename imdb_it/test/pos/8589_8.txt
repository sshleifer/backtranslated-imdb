Good Movie, acting was formidable above all by Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well directed. <br /> <br /> Also show how Lumumba was cornered by the Belgians, the US and the United Nations and how they called him a "communist" scare people like they did to all true true African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It shows how Western countries preach democracy while they have something else in their minds. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. <br /> <br /> Show how Lumumba couldn't control his people, yes, they were his people, but before we blamed him, was any of the people he mentioned in his government like Mobutu becoming enough? Or his colleague had other things in their minds, to find out going to see the movie! Certainly Mobutu did, he continued to pillage the country for the next 35 years, before it was overthrown and fled the country. A billionaire died. <br /> <br /> Some flaws: There was too little explanation as to how the man (Lumumba) had to get up in the first place. Furthermore, there should have been a wider explanation of the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Zaire when it was under Mobutu. There had to be an explanation of why he (Lumumba) couldn't keep the second largest African country in one piece. And also what was happening to Tshombe and Katanga. If you watch the film, Tshombe controlled the Katanga region which (if I'm not mistaken) is the number one copper producer in the world. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a great movie to watch. You will learn something new about Africa, its leaders and its people and you will probably open your eyes because this continent is driven by wars.
