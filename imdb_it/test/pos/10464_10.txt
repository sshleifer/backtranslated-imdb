This film embodies the soul of the modern "elite" foodculture, although the film is 17 years old. The fundamental principle of the film is: food is much more than a nutritious material. It is also a powerful symbol and a means to culture itself. The main characters get drunk literally with the best wine and food, they are inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture, while they let go of their puritanism and their ways that deny passion. Karen Blixens' short film exploits the difference between Northern Europe and Southern Europe, to highlight their approaches to food in a different way. While the strict and rather boring Scandinavians are infused with "Eros" from the south, the party begins. So what are you waiting for? Go and watch it ... again!
