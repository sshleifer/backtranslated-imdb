I saw this movie the other night, and I have to admit that it was probably the best film of this generation. It turns out that I wasn't born until 1988, but I can relate to this movie as Cary Grant can relate to having an STD, or Burt Reynolds for being a burnout. Marky Mark has not been fooled by his brief spell on New Kids on the Block, which I will call "the best band in the world (aka BBW)", as if it were totally a tale of morality about transsexual fugin 'a little poo, so be careful! I like them all and I still support Marky Msrk because he needs us more than ever. He is the only boy who survived the disinherited.
