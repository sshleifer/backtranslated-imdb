This film played in Lexington KY for 7 days. I saw him on the last day of his race and I regretted not being able to recommend him to others because this is a film that screams for the big screen experience. The aerial shot in which the crowded ship moves away from the equally crowded basin is a masterpiece, as is the scene in which the two main characters flirt on the bridge - almost a ballet and more sexy in its suggestion than many other more explicit films than these times. It occurs to me that more people will not have the opportunity to see this beautiful film in a theater; the DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: if you live in a university town, see if you can put pressure on it to be shown at a campus film festival.
