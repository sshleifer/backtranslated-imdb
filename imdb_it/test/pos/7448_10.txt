I'll start with a disclaimer: this film is NOT recommended for anyone who has no interest or has never played FF7 before watching. The film is based on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey plot elements. And it does it very subtly. Do your homework before watching this wonderful CG movie and I promise you it will be much better. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, this film has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I've ever seen. The whole experience seemed like a long FMV sequence from the game, on steroids. Yes. Attention to detail in every scene, especially in action-oriented ones, is so impeccable that it left me in awe. <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack is simplified to help the audience focus on the quality of the animation more than the music. Once again, for those who are familiar with the history and background of FF7, music should not surprise anyone (even if the timing and positioning of each soundtrack of the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music it simply improves the animation). br /> <br /> Once again, myself, having played only once on FF7, I really liked this artwork by Square Enix. And this is the feeling in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you liked the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will make you jump out of the water. If you are in the unfortunate majority that has not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on Playstation or PC, doing so before watching the movie will allow an exponentially larger experience. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to take note of the quality in the animation of this film. The characters move smoothly. Every scene background comes to life and tells its story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependence of the plot, I urge you to review the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that lead to another level of entertainment above the typical plot storytelling narrative method. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura have created a new bar for animation and quality storytelling. Advent Children has inaugurated a new era for CG animations, allowing the subtleties found in each character to speak in volumes about themselves. <br /> <br /> Thanks Square Enix. The wait was worth it.
