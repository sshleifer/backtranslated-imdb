He counts as one who is happy not to see Hastings in this episode. Dr. Watson of the poor man does nothing for me, he simply drags down every scene he finds himself in. Japp is often necessary in history as a representative of bureaucracy, and a small Miss Lemon is good for seasoning, but Hastings swings painfully dark in excess of sense in several episodes. If I have to sit down for another void "Oh, I say there!" I'll take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, the more Poirot you get in a Poirot story, the better. Each line for Hastings is an outlet from Poirot. And I've never read the books, so I don't really care about loyalty to Christie's characters. Many viewers / reviewers seem to have a problem with separating movies from books. If you want the book to be written, then read it. I don't see the point of watching the TV version if you know what will happen next at every stage. Theater is not prose - don't expect a transcript.
