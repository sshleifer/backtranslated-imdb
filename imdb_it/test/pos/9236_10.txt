After seeing "A Texas Tale of Treason", you feel a renewed disgust with the nature of the Hollywood beast. Within the interviews and conversations of all those involved in the project there is a common sense of camaraderie and rebellion that extends over backgrounds, social classifications and even geography. This can be attributed to the hard work on the interesting commitment of the whole production for the project and the love for the history of the original film and the complete creation of the void that is its creator. The scale of the people involved in "Waldo's Hawaiian Party" was surprising for me, without budget, without glory production. There were no trailers or craft services, no services, yet everyone was stuck there with it. If nothing ever comes from this project, the Antstuie Productions have laid the groundwork for being a serious and honest company that is never satisfied with just taking, selling or making a movie for money. I would like to see a director of L.A. go through the guerrilla process to get a shot. In this period of CG and green screens the most realistic reality of life cinema is missing. The masses can have fun with their entertainment spoon fed with pleasant and censored bites, but there is a large group of people in the world who share the opinions and insights of the directors who continue to make films for the love of the material or love of storytelling, not DVD sales or box office sales. I loved this documentary, and I hope IFC has the cahones to pick it up and broadcast it so that maybe, just maybe, another person will decide to take a camera and film real life so the viewer can have a temporary understanding that all users around the world are the same and anyone can be a real storyteller everywhere.
