I went to the screening of "SISTER HELEN" at the Sundance Film Festival and I didn't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I was riveted by the people in this documentary. Sister Helen is an incredible character !!! The directors captured the essence of Sister Helen's fantastic soul and brought me into an unknown world. I was completely satisfied with the trip and was taken aback by the end of this film. <br /> <br /> This film is about those who want a second chance at life.
