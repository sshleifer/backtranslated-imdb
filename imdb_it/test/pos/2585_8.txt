My roommate and I received free tickets for a Pre Screening, I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking inside I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily exaggerated, etc. But the film is much more than that. It is a story of two people helping each other. It is not exaggerated, and the film is done in a careful balance so as not to make you shudder or say that it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Here is the beauty of it. If he tried to take himself seriously, he would have failed miserably, but instead he behaved with humor (a little involuntary) and with a surprisingly good acting of Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the film is good enough to put it aside. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film, if only for the fact that it is something different to try.
