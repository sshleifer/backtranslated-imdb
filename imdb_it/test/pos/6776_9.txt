This is, by far, the best film I've seen in a long time. It is an absolutely original and beautiful plot. It is not boring, nor too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but does not detract from the plot. The fact that it's not in English is probably the final touch. The end leaves you satisfied in a way I had never seen before in a movie. <br /> <br /> I wish I had found this movie before. <br /> <br /> Other lines. <br /> <br /> more lines. <br /> <br /> more lines to many more lines, I'm done
