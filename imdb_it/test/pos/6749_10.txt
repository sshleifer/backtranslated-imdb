This is an excellent B-film horror film that borders on horror and comedy. It is a scorpion genetically mutilated in space. Can it become more unreal? It is a hybrid of "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre". The film was shot in Stockholm with a mixed cast of Americans and Swedes interacting beautifully. Director Martin Munthe does a great job of finding the comic highlights in this script and gets some laughter from the audience. The film was shot with few or no money and it is exciting to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the qualities of a B-movie horror movie. It's comic and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It's nice to see that movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing it if you like this kind of movie.
