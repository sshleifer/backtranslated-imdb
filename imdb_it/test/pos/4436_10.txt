When Nathaniel Kahn embarked on this journey, he barely knew who his father really was. At the end of the film, he found it and came to terms with the strange life he lived as a child. Louis Kahn was the father. He was an architect architect. His drawings were perhaps too complex, as he tried to create buildings that did not conform to popular trends at the time. It is ironic that he never achieved the fame that was so easy for some of his contemporaries. He had a vision and never left it. We can see the characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left to humanity. Each of his creations is unique in that it does not imitate the works of other architects. <br /> <br /> The life of Louis Kahn was rather complicated. He was married, yet he had dealings with two of his assistants who produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife. <br /> <br /> As a boy, the life of Nathaniel Kahn had lived in a secluded area, away from his father, who only visited late at night. Louis Kahn never recognized these children, although it is clear that everyone knew the existence of others. <br /> <br /> It is tragic that Louis Kahn died alone in Grand Central Station when he returned from a journey without making peace with women and children whom he never recognized as his at his side. He probably did a lot of work with all his children, but he remains a detached figure throughout the film. We never know the man, although in the end Nathaniel, in his attempt to discover his father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a personal account of an artist's life. Thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost entering the life of Louis Kahn and his extended family.
