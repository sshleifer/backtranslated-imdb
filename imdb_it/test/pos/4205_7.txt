The first Dead End Kids films (before being renamed "the Bowery Boys") were all very entertaining and well-made films from Warner Brothers. Although they are quite formal, they have written, acted, and endure well over time. DO NOT confuse them with the cheap Bowery Boys movies from Monogram Pictures - despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films were of different levels than the previous films in quality. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the robust John Garfield who wins the lightweight boxing championship. Unfortunately, shortly thereafter he finds himself in a drunken binge and is accused of murder he did not commit. The problem is that he was so burdened that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man, so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo. In the end, he meets the gritty May Robson and the Dead End Kids - as well as a woman who knows himself will become his girlfriend in due course. <br /> <br /> Where the rest of the film is not all surprising, but due to the quality of the film, it doesn't seem to matter. Garfield and the Kids are at their best and this is a film that everyone will surely enjoy, except for the most demanding viewers.
