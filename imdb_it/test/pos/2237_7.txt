I took this movie late at night on TV, and I expected a low budget campground "masterpiece", I was surprised by a pretty decent movie. The unique acting abilities of Angelina Jolie (or should I say her lack?) Make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, though terribly mediocre, are at least not terrible. <br /> <br /> There is a plot; a fairly complicated plot, involving conspiracies and the lengths of a couple (a human person, an android) will go on to pursue their illegal romance, with an "elder brother" figure and an android murderer thrown into the mix. Production and set design were also much better than I expected. I haven't seen the original Cyborg, so I can't really compare it to much else; granted this film is not Blade Runner, but as a guilty futuristic late-night pleasure, it's worth watching.
