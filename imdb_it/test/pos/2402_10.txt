Internet is a wonderful thing, isn't it? I'm watching a recorded episode of one of my favorite documentaries of all time, "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War", from my DVR in Florida, USA, to my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing a review on this series and I've just read another review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would just like to say that for Minh Nguyen to make the declaration that America brought the Vietnam war is one-sided. I know that America was the main player in the West, but it takes two parts to make war. The Soviets and the Chinese were the main suppliers of weapons to the North, so because Mr. Nguyen does not mention them in part as ignorance (well, I think we all know why he does not mention them, or why ignorance is raised in a communist system and in its political dogma, or because it is afraid to tell the truth for fear of being arrested). Furthermore, Mr. Nguyen, I imagine that the parts on the North are the main aggressor in which all the war in your country has not been shown, so to blame America again shows ignorance. Regardless, it is interesting to read a review from Vietnam (obviously that it could also be invented, but I will take it as real), at least the communist east is a bit open. As for the mini series; why do i love him It does not focus solely on American involvement. This was a war that began 15 years before America was involved and the series covers every aspect of history and this is a real advantage. The material used is top quality, all the Vietnam war programs you see now will use the same movie so you will not miss anything by watching this old series. The date on which this series was made is another advantage. It has all the main actors interviewed that you can't do now because they died from old age, it's an important historical reference. Thirdly, Richard Basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice sounds as distinct as the voice of James Earl Jones and I think this is a great praise. I don't think you could find a best war documentary ever made, it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it until the year 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians of both sides of World War II, does it for the war of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> OK, I see a few biases, its subtle, a 70s-80s-like bias like the NPR "All Things Considered" bias in which everything looks so simple but when the eyelids they end up shaking their heads. In this case, the subsequent episodes do not shed much light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, DO NOT THINK ????? <br /> <br /> From a veteran of the OIF war who lived the same thing 30 years later.
