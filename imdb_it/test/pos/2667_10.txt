For all those disoriented by the length and rhythm of this film ("how, why does it show the ships that dock for about 15 minutes?"), Here is a word you might want to think about: <br /> <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an underestimated concept. Of course, you'll often see beautiful photographs and so on in the movies. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a strange belief among filmmakers that anything that is not related to the plot or the character must be removed. This is depressing. There is nothing wrong with creating a wonderful sequence that has nothing to do with the plot of the film. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason other than to be beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so. <br /> <br /> '2001' requires you to look in a different way than what you normally watch movies. It requires you to relax. It requires experimenting with strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, conspiracies and characters are good, but they are not being-all and the end of everything. There are several KINDS of the film, and to enjoy '2001' you have to tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, free from the banal conventions of everyday movies. <br /> <br /> "All art is quite useless" - Oscar Wilde.
