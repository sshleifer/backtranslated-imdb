I haven't seen this good movie in 50 years, but I'm entering a comment anyway. <br /> <br /> While the JACK WEBB film was undoubtedly intended only as entertainment --- showing Marine's basic training on Parris Island in realistic terms as a tough character-building exercise - it was said that the army feared that the film would discourage recruitment. It didn't work that way. The film showed that joining the Marines was a bigger challenge than most young people ever did, and (guess what?) Offering a life-sized challenge was exactly what many kids wanted. Personally I knew many guys who joined the Marines shortly after seeing THE DI. The lines in the recruitment centers were suddenly so long that the Marines had more recruits than they could handle. <br /> <br /> So it's fine. America will always have young people trying to transform themselves for the better - while the slackers and the losers born limp towards nothing. <br /> <br /> What we do NOT have in 2007 are films that inspire patriotism, devotion to duty of any kind, positive values, etc. What we have are films that inspire the empty head of being empty heads, beer drinkers darting beer, other negative values. Exposure n. 1 is that the troubled childhood and the epic of SUPERBAD beer is now at number 81 on the All Time Great Films list. Values? What does it mean, values?
