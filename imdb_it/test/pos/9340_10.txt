Before this clip, music videos simply had to show an artist. Michael Jackson's "Thriller" has created a whole new section of music videos that can honestly be called mini movies. "Thriller" follows a couple as they travel to the girl's house from a movie. On the road they meet the zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is the one where the zombies stumble over the couple and the girl turns to see that Michael has turned into one of them. So they do a little dance. The scariest thing about "Thriller" could be the fact that it is always more fun and entertaining than many films made. After twenty years it remains the first music video. <br /> <br /> P.S. My music video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet Child of Mine" 3 - Nine Inch Nails "Closer" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
