This is the first James Cagney film I've ever seen. I've never been interested in his films before because I thought I wouldn't like anything in that kind of cinema and because I heard that most of Cagney's films are the same. I must say that I really liked it. By today's standards for films, it wasn't special, but I found it surprisingly fun. Cagney didn't look like a tough guy, but he played the part very well.
