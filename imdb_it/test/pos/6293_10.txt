One of our all-time favorites. When we need a laugh ... it is enough to put this and laugh from the beginning as if it were the first time we saw it. This film has a good family humor. Pauly Shore is brilliant! Without plans for Thanksgiving, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holidays with a conservative coed, Becca. Crawl, being a big city boy, has to adapt to the life of the farm if he wants to fall in love with Becca. But Crawl isn't the only one learning new things. Crawl teaches Becca and his parents how to be more open about their feelings and accept others. This is fun for viewers of all ages.
