This film has the courage to suggest that it might be better to simply accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway. As one who is more excited by the idea of ​​taking charge of his life and moving forward, I felt slapped in the face, but that's okay: I don't have to agree with a movie to love and respect it. Great acting of Streep and Hurt, and of all the others really, and some wonderfully eccentric scenes. A serious film. And get a handkerchief.
