Is it a murder mystery? Is it a procedural police procedure? Is it a stage behind the squalid French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all this, but more than anything else is a fun comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in the post-war period in Paris. It may be surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of such gloomy films as Le Corbeau or geeky talents like Diabolique and The Wages of Fear, is the director of this one. Clouzot, however, was a shrewd director. "In a mystery of murder," he says, "there is an element of playfulness. It is never completely realistic. In this I share the point of view of Hitchcock, who says:" A murder is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny this, you could also film a documentary. "" Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful film, and it's not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer in the music halls and dinner clubs. It is a flirtation, she sees nothing wrong in using a bit of sex and talent for her stage name is Jenny Latour and she really loves her husband, Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier), Martineau is kind of a sad bag, he is his companion and arranger, he is a little bald, a little chubby and jealous for a defect , then we have their neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant), blonde, beautiful (think of Rita Hayworth) and capable, she and Martineau have been friends since they were children together, but Dora is absolutely not thinking only of friendship when he looks at Jenny, then comes George s Brignon (Charles Dullin), an old man withered, rich and dirty, who often makes Dora take "artistic" photographs of his young protected women that he proposes. He offers a movie contract to Jenny and suggests a dinner at his house to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny immediately replies, "You're jealous of the rich! Well, I want my share of their dough, they're all for the real!" "Six Dad was a worker", replies Maurice. "And then, under Louis XV, I would have been Madame de Pompadour! I would have warmed up the tights!" <br /> <br /> And after Brignon was found dead with a bottle of champagne smashed next to his bloody skull, there's Dora trying to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine has the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with aching feet. He saw everything. He served in the "colonies" with the foreign legion and returned with a adopted child and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antoine stares at him. One of the first things Antoine finds was not just a person with a bottle of Brignon, someone shot him in the heart. Who did it? In a short time Jenny, Maurice and Dora are all inventing alibis, lying and, at one point, confessing. How will Antoine discover the killer? Will we have the chance to see some great music songs sung by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with the time and perseverance of Detective Antoine. They leave us with many kinds of love that lead to all kinds of motifs, from jealousy triggered by hair to yearning looks ... and everyone played with a nice mix of Gallic fun. <br /> <br /> Clouzot takes us to a Paris of squalid but non-threatening neighborhoods, to trampled music publishers where the songs are played on the piano for buyers, to restaurants with discrete private dining rooms. Above all, it takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs. We can see Jenny singing, with couples sitting and single men wearing coats and hats standing. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film, in fact, takes place largely in this environment. With Jenny singing about "Her little one-between-the-one, her sweet between-the-la", we follow her from trying the song of the publishers to a dress rehearsal of a mischievous performance with Jenny in a feathered hat, a corset , stockings and not much else. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant all do a wonderful job, but it's Louis Jouvet who keeps everything together. He was a wonderful actor who didn't like making films. The stage was his world, and he took films only if he liked the director and made money to finance his theatrical work. Jouvet was tall with a long face and wide cheekbones. He wasn't conventionally beautiful, but he had what it took to dominate a scene. To see how skillfully he can interpret the play, look at it in Drole de Drame. He is a fascinating actor. At one point he says "I took a liking to you, Miss Dora Monnier". "Myself?" she asks. "Yes. Because you and I are two types: when it comes to women, we will never have a chance." Jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to this line, from the sad regret to a sweet amusement.
