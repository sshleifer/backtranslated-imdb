Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half of the Batman Returns movie. In Tim Burton's first Batman we only had Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> In Batman Returns we have what I think is the most perfect Batman movie (though better than Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role that will never go far beyond the character of Batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains he is dealing with. First you have Danny DeVito who is deliciously crazy like the penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Cat-Woman, who I dare say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel so about Pfeiffer because of the way he becomes the Cat-Woman who starts out like the pungent poetically Selena Kyle and then really dives into the dark side of his mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from looking to be a hero for a villain and then in the end I think of a hero. Even in this extraordinary cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck interpreted by the extraordinary and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there is something in this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance always better than it already is. <br /> <br /> Story wise I must say that Batman Returns is much more successful this time than the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story is the fact that Burton had the courage to go in a much darker and more convoluted direction than Nicholson's. You have the story about the penguin and how it tries to trick the people of Gotham into becoming the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide who she really is and what she should do with her new character. When it comes to Batman, I feel that in this it is more the ring leader who holds the two stories together but, of course, kick the ass at the same time. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric, just like the story that is happening inside it. Gotham City has never looked good on Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have the chance to see it that way, definitely do it because it really adds to the overall Batman Returns experience. <br /> <br /> So, all inside, I really feel that, of all the Batman movies, Batman Returns or not believes the Dark Knight for me, because while I enjoyed that movie for the extraordinary interpretation of Heath Ledger as Joker, I felt that something was missing from the film. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see a fantastic movie with what I feel is a perfect cast, then this is the Batman to light up the Bat signal.
