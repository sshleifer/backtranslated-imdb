Two city boys are driving through Hicksville, USA, when a rusty monster suddenly appears and repeatedly tries to drive them off the road. He takes a mysterious blonde hitchhiker, they stop in front of a truck-stop full of redneck amputees, one of which warns those of the 'demon out there'. But they don't listen. Big mistake! "Monster Man" by Michael Davis mixes comedy with surprisingly good horror. The film borrows heavily "Duel", "The Blair Witch Project", "Jeepers Creepers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" "The story is pretty stupid, but there is enough blood and violence to keep splatter jokes happy. I especially liked the performance of Justin Urich, which offers the film its comic relief, yet the total lack of suspense is difficult to forgive, this is a possibility, if you have time to lose.7 out of 10. I said Aimee Brooks is it sexy?
