Wow! What a nice warm and rural film! The story focuses on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young male tramp, whose journey takes him to a quiet rural coastal town. He stays there with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), their youngest daughter, who makes me friends, has a passion for horses and wins one at an auction. This horse is a beautiful brown stallion; reported by his previous owner as a "murdering pirate", but Velvet renamed him Pie. Not long after, Velvet suggests entering the Grand National race, Mi and his family are against the idea, but soon they agree and Velvet and They started training me for Britain's most famous horse race? ? This film is a beautiful example of how British films are. I remember seeing him for the first time when I was eight and during the summer holidays. My parents recorded it via TV and warmed it up instantly ?? watching it almost every day instead of the large collection of Disney movies I owned. <br /> <br /> I think it was one of Liz Taylor's first films and one of the best! His character is naive but sweet ?? his acting is extremely convincing, especially when he portrays his love for horses. It is also a good opportunity to see Angela Lansbury in one of her first roles; who plays the elder sister of Velvet, who spends most of her time in the film while being hit by a guy in the city! I must say that she was a wonderful woman when she was younger. Beautiful blond hair and a face with rosy cheeks. Even if he doesn't play an important part in the film, he has a series of scenes - so don't disappoint his fans! Parents who read this, should I stress? if you can get a copy, please do it! If children love animals ?? I strongly suggest you show it! They may find some boring scenes, but see Velvet riding the horse throughout the film and entertain the children provocatively. An adorable and nostalgic film. I could just leave and wear it now!
