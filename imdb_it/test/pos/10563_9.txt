The plot was well structured and interesting in itself. However, it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without ruining you. To avoid this, I will not talk about the story here. <br /> <br /> I consider this film a good adaptation of Sarah Water's book, compared to the previous "Tipping the velvet". I read the book first and then watched the DVD later. The film has kept most of the spirits of the main characters in the book. Obviously, due to time constraints, the film in the last 30 minutes seemed to be in a hurry to cover part III of the book. Therefore, he was not able to illustrate the scene well when everyone met in the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs' place and in the following ones (the book also seemed a hurry for that scene in the kitchen). Despite this, the film did a really good job in representing history. It's really worth watching. It is not yet clear when BBC-America can broadcast this film. Sin. <br /> <br /> PS: I noticed that the ages of Maud and Sue were fixed between 20-21 and 17-18 in the book; the second is more reasonable while the former is closer to the actresses' ages.
