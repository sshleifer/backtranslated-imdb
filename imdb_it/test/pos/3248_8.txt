A good story, well acted with unexpected twists eg. the brutal murderous criminal Bryan Brown who teaches his son Macrame. Although he succeeds as an action drama in which you hope the good guy (Ledger) and her boyfriend succeed, he also has a hilarious ironic black humor eg. the bank thieves who become "winners" of the radio competition and their reaction, the revenge of the busker etc. Worth watching.
