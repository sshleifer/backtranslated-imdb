Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very popular anime on almost every page of reviews you'll find on the web. So I really wanted to know why, and I was far from disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you manage to get past the first very bizarre (but rather amusing) episode, you will find yourself in a very funny and very strange world. A very well designed and perfectly animated world, that is. <br /> <br /> I can't tell much of the story without ruining it, so I'll just say it's a high school comedy ... yet it's not. I can't really say what it is, really. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm a huge anime fan, and I have about 50 complete series, and I'm not kidding when I say that even though I haven't finished watching Haruhi Suzumiya, she's actually in a position very high in my personal collection. I fell in love with this at first sight, and I assure you that, at least, you will not be indifferent to its irresistible charm. Trust me, I don't go around giving a 10 to everything I look at.
