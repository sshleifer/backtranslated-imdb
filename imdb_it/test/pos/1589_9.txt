This is a compelling adaptation but at the same time of the Thomas Mann novel with the same title. Dirk Bogarde gives his best performance on screen - he believed it himself. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must register the nuances of his distressed character - a composer (a writer in the novelette - the only great alteration) who goes to Venice in 1910. Visconti is having fun in the portrait of beauty, he is passing and the hint of underground decadence. Visconti mixes the music and imagination of Mahler in his most beautiful film from "Il Gattopardo" (another sensational film, which greatly influenced Coppola's Sicily in the "Padrino").
