Many films try the ambitious. Few succeed. This film is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although advertised as a black comedy, this term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. The multi-dash Michael Parness has managed to weave elements of the most absurd comedy with incredible human emotions. A remarkable feat, to be sure. <br /> <br /> While the comic aspects are certainly present, the heart of the film lies in its protagonists: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy compared to true love - falls on them and they reach it, taking it from the opening scene to the heart that culminates with the climax and at the end touching. David Krumholtz, as the main protagonist and as a storyteller, maintains the picture and does an exceptional job. We see the world through Max's eyes and Krumholtz instills them in a sort of wonder and hope that one would not expect to be credible coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide. From this point there should be no doubt that he has really achieved the status of a leading man, well deserved after more than a decade of memorable secondary roles. Natasha Lyonne could be a sort of revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less demanding roles. The role of Grace has an expansive scope, which requires her to show great anger and great tenderness, sometimes within seconds of each other. He manages to convince us of Grace's profound desperation that lies just beneath her alternate torpor and mania. <br /> <br /> A comedy of a minute kind is not a laugh, so don't watch the movie strictly expect from the humor from the beginning finish. Think more of drama than comedy. There are some very dark moments, as one would expect given the subject of suicidal individuals, and some strangely real moments delivered in particular by Emma Adele Galvin as Max's sister, Sis. The funniest scenes are those populated by the myriad of actors named in secondary roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes, the other supporting characters that populate the institution where Max and Grace meet are the real surprise. Guillermo Diaz is a thief of unbridled scenes like the strange frantic freak, Hector. Ralf Moeller, like Bruno, acts like a straight man but has his charm and charm. Rosanna Arquette completely lives the role of Vera with the venerable vitriol of a forgetful truck maid. Even his tough character finally melts, as do all those who are touched by Max's literally eternal love for Grace. <br /> <br /> Can love conquer could be the question behind the film and even if the realist says no, film is an escape from reality, even if only for a few hours. I recommend seeing this film as an antidote not only to reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens. Spend a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does wonders for the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
