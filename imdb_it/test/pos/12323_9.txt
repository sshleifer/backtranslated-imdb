So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for this, but it is usually the need to break down a complex novel to the size of a script. The Dead is unusual - it had to be "padded", as the story itself is a relatively short little gem. It could indeed be the best story in English. In a magnificent, bare language he tells of Gabriel Conroy's realization that his life and the lives of so many people around him are controlled by the memories of the dead. Even his own wife of many years loved a man who is now more dead than he. <br /> <br /> Bringing such a short story to the cinema would have always been complicated. John Huston has done a magnificent job. He never gave in to the temptation to play or use the fantasy technique to expand the story. It's simple and true, with exceptional acting. The only small misstep is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. <br /> <br /> It is really rare that a film version of a literary masterpiece is in itself a masterpiece, but I think it is fair to use this term for this film. It's not a skill film, but it's simple and pure - I always think of Ozu's films when I think of The Dead, it's at that level of purity, simplicity and profound wisdom.
