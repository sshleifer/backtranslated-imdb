I saw this movie a week ago and I had to persuade my friend to come with me because this movie seems to have negative reviews. Of course it's not about 'Human Traffic' or 'Lock, Stock ...' but it's not a flop at all. I think the fact that there are so many movies on a big budget at the moment means that it has been ignored but it shouldn't be. I guess he decides to do what he wants to do: entertain us for an hour and a half and leave us happy and content. I'd rather go see it "The mummy", which seems boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Don't listen to critics, Star Wars fans don't. This film is worth seeing, if only to see the splendid Luke de Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go see it!
