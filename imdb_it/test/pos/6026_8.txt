I ran into The Last Stop one day at a video store and they were only selling it for $ 2. I decided to try it and bought it. It was good enough, I liked it. The story is about several people caught in a hut somewhere in nowhere due to a snowstorm. There is a police officer, Nancy, his ex-girlfriend, two brothers who have just been released from prison, an older man and his lover, a black man and the couple who own the huts and their son retarted who he never speaks. Suddenly someone is found killed and a bag full of money is found. Everyone is suspicious. The Last Stop is a pretty good thriller, I'd like to give it 8/10
