First I must say that this film is much less pretentious than the Da Vinci Code. of course, you have the problem of religion against science, but don't try to make a big statement about it. it's basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene in particular (involving fire) I found extremely well done. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the changes from book to film. although when I was following the development of the film I complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of the others, I must admit that I was wrong. it was pleasant that the film did not follow the book in exactly the same way as it was done in Da Vinci. if you're a book purist, some of them might upset you. However, the BIG TWIST is still there, so don't worry about it. in the end I'm glad they removed some stupid partial plots and didn't even try to mention the possibility that Langdon and Vittoria would reunite. <br /> <br /> The performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. okay for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> I would give a 9/10, mainly because it offers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment
