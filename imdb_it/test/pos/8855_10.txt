In 1982, two films were released weeks apart from each other involving both aliens. ET by Steven Spielberg and The Thing by John Carpenter. Of these two, ET was the one that won the hearts of people around the world, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced by Spielberg's warm and fuzzy alien fairy tale, they stayed away from The Thing in droves. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to understand why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the hearts of the beating heart. The other is a hard and uncompromising film that depicts alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess the audience felt that ET was a much prettier prospect than the Thing's tentacles and mud-covered saliva! <br /> <br /> It took some time, but The Thing continued to win over a substantial cult audience. How it should. Because The Thing is the rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and reinvents them in surprising and imaginative ways. In fact, Carpenter does his job so well that he can make a film that is every inch the same as the showrunner of the genre, Alien. And this is even more rare! <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film follows his source material most faithfully from The Thing From Another World. It keeps the frigid waste of Antarctica as a setting, because it is the perfect background when you try to establish a more intense sense of isolation. But even if a little exaggerated in the characterization, the remake enters directly into the mentality of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and the fear that surrounds them slowly. <br /> <br /> Frequent Carpent contributor Kurt Russell returns, warm on the success of Escape From New York, once again launched as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot in an Antarctic research station (the one they're researching is suggested by anyone). The problem begins when a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby station flies over MacReady, trying to shoot a Siberian Husky from above. <br /> <br /> They end up dying from their problems, and while the field tries to solve the mystery problem of what happened, they take the Husky and add it to theirs. Except this Husky, he is not a Husky at all. But an alien that changes shape. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it, they massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion make their way among the 12 men of the crew, until no one is certain who is human and who is not. <br /> <br /> The Thing is one of John Carpenter's most beautiful films. In fact, I'm tempted to say that it's the best film I've ever made. Overcoming even classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason I put The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it looks like his last film that could really be called a classic. All the others have since felt as if Carpenter were beating him up. Films that did not result in refined refinement and frayed intensity so prevalent in his previous works. <br /> <br /> But The Thing had John Carpenter at the height of his powers. He has never generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the fierce Assault on Precinct 13. From the moment the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter increases the level of tension without stopping. And when he delivers his fists, they arrive with an agonizing shock. <br /> <br /> The film is a mixture of pure atmosphere and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem to be in contrast with each other, but in Carpenter's hands they blend beautifully. Approaching Rob Bottin of Howling fame, he is ready to endure some of the most amazing transformation effects you could ever see in a horror movie. Amorphous forms. Half-formed human characters were in stark contrast to the wide-open jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. In fact the effects of the film are so surprising and provocative, The Thing was targeted to be too realistic! <br /> <br /> That kind of thinking completely misses the point. Only exchange movie values. And there are many. Carpenter stages a set of effects only when he needs them. It is in the most peaceful moments of the film that he seems particularly in tune with the story. The Thing is a story that is often puzzling with shadows, whispers and implications. Characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strong clothes, but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Since we know almost nothing about the cast, it makes the current situation much more confusing. We are never certain, at any moment who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and keeps its mystery in subsequent visualizations. <br /> <br /> A special mention should go to the excellent soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. A thud button pulsates every two seconds. It creates an eerie and spooky feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene in which they undergo blood tests to see who is human is loaded with such dexterity by Carpenter, you could find yourself biting your nails without even realizing it. <br /> <br /> The Thing is a pure and genuine classic. Even the ending leaves you with a vague suspicion that not everything is solved. An undervalued film, which deserves the revaluation it has received. And much better than ET!
