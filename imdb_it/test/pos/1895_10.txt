If you watch this movie, you will mention it and you will still refer to it for a long time. It's been years since I saw Dolemite and I still mention it until today. It is a true classic. It is so terribly horrible to make a hilarious vision. Every terrible line of dialogue is absolutely incredible. Every shaky shot of a work of art (?). And every punch and kick so executed. You won't believe your eyes. It's all I can say. If I can understand how fascinating this film is, I will not be able to stop and I will go beyond the 1000 word limit of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie. You will be in hysterics. O 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
