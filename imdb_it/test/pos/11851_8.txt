Well, the film was much better than I expected. It's not boring and it's not original. It's not really a stupid romantic comedy. The situations in which the characters fit are very unusual, of course, we are still talking about a movie, but the main characters are really plausible. Donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he is only a pawn in the film, a means of demonstrating something. The ending is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same pieces of shit that you can usually see in movies like that. I really liked it and I'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of film. Worth watching. Moreover, it is more direct than other films, the plot always rises, the characters themselves stand up. And they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them as an artifact from the given holly god, yada, yada. At the end of everything you really see is going through everything, the movie makes you feel something, you might even learn a thing or two. It is not the usual idiocy that produces hope, which dampens the tissues. It's a good film, not a consolation prize for tearful women all over the world.
