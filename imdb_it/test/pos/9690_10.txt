Jackass Number Two is easily the funniest movie of 2006, beating even the exhilarating Clerks II. It's one of the best sequels of recent memory, beating Jackass The Movie in every way. Now this movie could be the most fun, but it's also the most offensive, terrifying and utterly disgusting. You will feel sick several times during the movie. I am completely serious when I say that I don't eat anything before watching or during this film, because it is likely that it will literally come back to haunt you. Keep the drinking to a minimum as well. You have been warned, because, as the slogan says, it will make you beg for mercy. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two follows the madmen of the hit show Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (Chris Raab Himself 'Raab is absent) while performing the most scandalous life - menacing and revolting imaginable stunts. I will not say what the stunts are, but I warn you that any scene with an animal will be disgusting or psychologically frightening, and that a cast member (again, he does not say) will flirt several times with death in the film. <br /> <br /> What makes Jackass Number Two so much fun is not the stunts, but how the cast reacts to them and make them. To put it in simple words, if they loved doing it and they had so much fun, you will too (this is valid for 99% of the stunts). All the stunts are very original and 90% of them have never been seen before. You'll see some recycled, but they're amplified. You wouldn't really think about directing the factors in a film like this, but it does; Directed by Jeff Tremaine makes the film much more fun, because it provides a guide for the band in their comic moments, which is simply brilliant on his part. He could just sit and sleep during the shoot (actually, in the movie you will see that he slept during some shoots), but he went out there and helped these fools do the most fun stunts he could. I give Mr. Tremaine two compliments for that. Another great thing about Jackass is his mine of famous cameos, and this time include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson , the Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor, and director / actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, because it's even more fun to see these men as part of the movie. Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and simply wrong movies of all time, if not more. Nevertheless, it is so original and so funny that it won't interest you. You'll be out of breath, laughing so hard that you cry and jump from your seat laughing for the whole movie. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this movie. You have been warned I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two very much. <br /> <br /> 10/10 --spy
