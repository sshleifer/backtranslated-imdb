I found this move beautiful, fun and uplifting. Initially the local sites of the film, shot here in Buffalo, intrigued me. Later I found myself lost in the power of the film. How can a gift of God be repaid? The ability of the characters to rise above their basic nature and to respond to God's touch has warmed my heart. The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. I left the theater with a slope at the pass, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. What else can a movie do? Hollywood, I hope you pay attention. America loves positive and optimistic films.
