LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film, based on the novel by Colin Wilson The Space Vampires, the script ignores most of the novel's concepts and structure (in fact it owes much more to the serial QUATERMASS than to the novel) but the scenes leave the novel inside it's almost identical to those in the movie. And speaking of the script it must be one of the most disconnected in the history of cinema, even if it was written in the chapters by different people. Let's take Carlson as an example, he disappears after the first scenes of the shuttle that led me to believe he was dead, then he finds himself in the middle of the film to explain the plot to the British besieged and it is this lack of attention on the part of the writers this ruins the film . And there are a lot of other awkward scripts like the heroes who come back to London by helicopter and don't realize that it was run by zombies until they're flying over. <br /> <br /> I could go to great lengths on these weft holes, but LIFEFORCE is really fun to watch until you use your brain. It's nice to see a science fiction horror movie from an age when aliens were portrayed as cute creatures that the children hid in their bedrooms, so that bad human adults couldn't get their hands on her. The special effects and pyrotechnic effects are very good, there is a lot of action and stunts and LIFEFORCE presents one of the most memorable aliens in the shape of the space girl. When I mention LIFEFORCE in a conversation with males it is always a race to say "Do you see the alien in LIFEFORCE? Can suck the life force out of me at any time" It is hardly surprising to observe the demographics of votes that this film is most popular among males of females <br /> <br /> "Don't worry, a naked girl can't escape from here". Too bad <br /> <br />
