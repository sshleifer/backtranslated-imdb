The premise is quite original and well thought out, but unfortunately, siding a good story is a very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent effects. Jeff Fahey does his best in a poor cast, as beautiful Linda Hoffman always does. They should make more films together. The film, while not deserving much praise, deserves at least a vision.
