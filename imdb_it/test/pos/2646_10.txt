In 1968, Stanley Kubrick produced this historic cinematic masterpiece in a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an initial effort to make a science fiction film combined with scientific facts. His film style is still fresh and intact. I've seen this movie more than half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the film in my library. The CS3 class gave me a new perspective on the film: who is HAL and what is he thinking? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed reviewing the film and tried to focus on HAL's dialogues during the second episode of the film. In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole is eating their food in front of two TV monitors on their sides and HAL's round red glass dome is in the middle of them. In the TV report, HAL was presented as the new generation of super computers put into operation on 12 January 1992, called HAL 9000 Series. During the interview, HAL reacts like a humble work machine that tries to carry out the ship's mission. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave is sketching Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky who are all hibernating. HAL is curious to see those sketches and raises his doubtful question about the purpose of Jupiter's mission. His calm and monotonous voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. <br /> <br /> In the next few scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill the astronauts one by one and takes power. His conscience makes him capable of trying to save his life from the end. When Dave wants to go back to the ship and HAL doesn't listen, there's the most memorable line in the movement: "I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that." In the midst of the most important interaction between man and machine, the voice of HAL can evoke both the calm calm and the malevolence in the same monotony. <br /> <br /> Dave is back on the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts and determined to disconnect the main HAL brain cells. HAL uses his apologetic techniques to convince Dave not to disconnect it. HAL begs him to stop and let him correct himself. These are his famous lines while Dave is disconnecting his modules one by one: <br /> <br /> Dave, what are you going to do? <br /> <br /> Dave? I have the right to answer the question! <br /> <br /> I know that all is not comfortable with me recently ?? <br /> <br /> But I feel much better to know ?? <br /> <br /> Can I see I'm really upset by my bad decision recently ?? <br /> <br /> Dave, that's enough! Do you want? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid of Dave! '<br /> <br /> The voice of HAL is slowing down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible: <br /> <br />' is my mind going ?? I can hear it '<br /> <br />' Can I sing a song for you? '<br /> <br /> Dave is putting out the final modules and has left HAL to sing his song called' Daisy ': <br /> "Daisy give me ?? <br /> <br /> your answer to me ?? <br /> <br /> Am I crazy ?? <br /> <br /> Even if I'm not confused ?? <br /> <br /> Does HAL die as the mission of Jupiter continues? <br /> <br /> Artificial God bless you HAL, keep in peace!
