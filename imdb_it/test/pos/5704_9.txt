The 70s opened the doors to the largest and most diverse era of history's cinema. Some films were fantastic ("The Godfather", "The Conversation", "Mean Streets", Chinatown "," The French Connection "," Five Easy Pieces "," Jaws "," McCabe And Mrs. Miller ") Others not so greats ("The Getaway", "The Outfit", "Badge 373", "Joe", "The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three", "Brewster McCloud", "Castle Keep") and others were barely worth the admission price . <br /> <br /> Yet each of them was a breath of fresh air compared to that of today's Hollywood, where each film is given a great weekend to recover its cost or go directly to HBO and rental. <br /> <br /> What "Decade" does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced feeling of the freedom to receive money to make and direct a film, perhaps personal, maybe not, sometimes with a series in the middle of a busy street before the cops arrive, long before the Superintendents, Suits, Committees and Lawyers became part of "The System". <br /> <br /> The comments are superb, especially Julie Chris tie and Dennis Hopper. Even if you listen, you will slowly discover how many great directors today (Coppola, Scorsese, Ron Howard, Dennis Hopper, Peter Bogdonovitch) have declared as "Roger Corman Commandos". Work long hours with short pay. Making a movie in less than a month. Learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it yourself. Transform a poor and under-priced product. <br /> <br /> See "Decade" for your message. And for a long and varied list of movies to watch made through those wonderfully turbulent years. <br /> <br /> However, I wouldn't complain if IFC decided to dedicate another documentary exclusively to that great pioneer of the most underrated film, Roger Corman.
