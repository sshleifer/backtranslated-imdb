This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea of ​​TRE MONETO IN FONTANA a few years earlier. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and has the opposite of some industry veterans, Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who struggles to lose her life. It is hard to believe that anyone can refuse this beauty for any reason, but Louis Jourdan, with his beating heart, does just that. A bit like it takes you back to Paul Neuman who refuses the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor in CAT ON A TOT ROOF HOT, right? Diane Baker, the third damsel in distress, meets and dates to Robert Evans, before he became the producer and husband of Ali MacGraw, for which he is famous. Hope's fiancé, from home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. He also meets Stephen Boyd, a workmate, who has interests in our hope. All three women have their drama in front of them. Crawford almost steals the movie. His presence and his usual strong asshole are fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the leaders with a yen for pinching the back of our protagonist. It is deliciously charming. Also in the cast is Martha Hyer, wasted on an ungrateful role never really explored. It's a pity because I like this actress who never seems to have that unique role to distinguish her abilities. He has a crush on a married man in the office played by Donald Harron, with whom I had the pleasure of working on a couple of Shakespeare works in New York. He is a distinguished actor who is also wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> All in all it's very funny, in Technicolor and cinemascope, directed by Jean Negulesco.
