"Idiocracy" is the latest film to come from Mike "Office Space" Judge, and certainly follows a theme similar to that of the film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively talking. It's a story of Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is, literally, the most normal boy in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become the test subjects for a military hibernation chamber project. They had to remain suspended for only a year, but due to lack of supervision, Joe and Rita are forgotten and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future. <br /> <br /> Here's the scary part: this film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 has become absolutely retarded. Without natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the most rapid, intelligent and strong people due to the progression of the genes ... only the people who reproduce more. Unfortunately, those people happen to be well-being suckers, trash idiots of trailers that breed like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of stupid people has caused a negative effect on the growth of society and now Joe and Rita are the two most intelligent human beings on the face of the planet. If it helps, imagine the entire population as a simple hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. Seeing this nightmare dystopia, Joe learns and tries to track down a time machine to see if he and Rita can go back when they came, and that's basically the whole plot. <br /> <br /> But despite how one - Dimensional dimensions I can make it seem, this film is higher than you can imagine. The nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses (warning signs, if you want) of the modern facets of everyday life and turn them into the wreck of the train in "Idiocrazia". The film has some really fantastic windows of realistic delay set on a pedestal. I don't want to give anything and ruin the lines for you, but let's say it's quite complete. I can see how some would say it's just a lot of toilet humor, but, strange as it may seem, it has a purpose; to show how stupid these people are. <br /> <br /> This film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone prides themselves on discovering this fantastic / funny movie when it comes out on video. My only complaint about the film would be that the flow of storytelling sometimes breaks so you can do a hitchhiker-guide-to-galaxy exposure on how things must be where they are, but it's a necessary evil and it's better implemented here. Apart from that, good characters, funny jokes and better than average social comments wrapped in a funny bow. <br /> <br /> Final note: If seeing our youth become gang-banger, I want to be, act like redneck / ghetto trash and be proud of it ... if you are polite and cultured in any case and you can see how the our country is getting out of control in an abyss of stupidity, for god's sake, watch this movie.
