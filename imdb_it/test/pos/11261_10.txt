This film is about three teenagers who have been best friends for the longest time, and they go into the most messy race of their lives. When heroin becomes the drug of choice in their city, these three boys find themselves involved in all this. This movie portrays heroin addiction very well and is something you can't stop watching. MTV has never been the best in making movies for TV, but this one has very good content to not watch it. I liked this movie, at first I thought it would be the worst movie I'd ever seen, but then as it went on it got better and I couldn't turn my back on it.
