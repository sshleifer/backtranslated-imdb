Lifeforce is certainly one of the best Tobe Hooper films. It has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it looks like a typical horror dream. The film is really creative and I think it's due to the script by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. The beautiful cinematography and a good disturbing atmosphere make it a solid film.
