A serial killer, Carl Stargher, kidnapped and killed young women by drowning them in a cell full of water. He is arrested by the FBI, but is in a coma and his last kidnapped victim waits in a timed cell to fill himself with water <br /> <br /> Take a look at the aforementioned premise and you will see that there is a lot of saw it all before looking at it. The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is to turn an old and old chestnut weave into something completely different from what you expect. If I mentioned the plot, there is a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter Stargher's mind, so he creates a completely different film <br /> <br /> This would not be enough to make THE CELL a different thriller class but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually surprising surreal thriller. Paul Laufer's cinematography in which the opaque primary colors are in the foreground is surprising but Singh does not let it end there, things like the costume designer in which Stargher wanders through his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes has a visual impact that makes it much more a race for a thriller <br /> <br /> What prevents THE CELL from becoming a classic film is that it begins to become increasingly aware of the fact that the entire film revolves around images rather than having a natural narrative. We see a third character, an FBI man enters Stargher's domain but this seems more like a forced plot only to introduce the public to more surprising but very disturbing moments <br /> <br /> It should also be emphasized that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a very depressing atmosphere and that prevents the film from being if not pleasant, therefore engaging. A scene in which an FBI agent tells a case in which a pedophile beats a rap only to then cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair that you could reach for the shutdown button. You will probably have to watch a huge amount of thrillers until you see another puzzling like this
