Turning Isherwood's somewhat obscure and utterly brilliant novel into a light comedy laugh could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but somehow it wasn't. The story moves quickly and the images in black and white are stunning, as are Harvey and Harris making their way through an extravagant Weimar Berlin. Fun!
