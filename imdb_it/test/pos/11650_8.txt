This was the most inspiring capital punishment film ever! He refused to look one-sided and the emotions he felt throughout the story are as real as they can be. This film had one of the most "human" (and I use this term in a good sense) a compassionate religious character of all time! This film led me to go out to find and read the book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen exercised more a spiritual tone than a religious one (which is also rare). And he presented both sides with the problem so that the people on both sides who watched the movie didn't feel a point was left out. And we have to thank the director for this. This is not a movie for entertainment. But it is a film that conveys a message that can reach the center of your heart. I can't think of another movie like this.
