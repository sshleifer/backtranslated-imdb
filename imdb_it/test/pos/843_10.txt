I couldn't wait to release this DVD (and it's the sequel to "Female Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song}) for a while. I really enjoyed the first two films of this series. After having just watched this movie, I should say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> All three of these films were directed by Shunya Ito, but the great thing about them is that even though everyone has the same protagonist (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are all very different from the others. <br /> <br /> The first film (Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie, but the Scorpion character is very intriguing - very reminiscent of the antiheroes of many spaghetti westerns. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second film (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real tour -de-force Not so much a WIP movie as most of the film has S corpion and six other prisoners who fled on the run. <br /> <br /> This film (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. This sounds much more than a dramatic crime. Once again, our heroine is on the run. But this time, she managed to maintain a certain amount of normality in her life (relatively speaking anyway). She finds a job, finds a place to live, she makes a friend outside. But of course, everything must unravel in the end. FPS: Beast Stable has a more direct story that is told at a slower pace than its predecessors. But I found it engaging from beginning to end. And don't worry: there is still a lot of debauchery to shoot in this movie! But I think these films transcend most exploitative films because the most disturbing elements are interpreted in a more decisive tone rather than being used exclusively for the value of shock in-face. Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I got shivered. But I didn't feel I had diminished the value of history (well, maybe a time or two). One thing I liked most about these films is the continuous accumulation of the Scorpion myths. With this entry the character development is used much more widely than the previous two. We see that you are much more than a vindictive stone bullshit! <br /> <br /> As I said in this review, a fourth film followed. He also presents Meiko Kaji as Scorpion but has a different director. Without giving anything I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely useless. The fourth film is still quite good, but it seems to play a superfluous note to an amazing trilogy. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in extraordinary films. FPS: Beast Stable can be seen as a piece in its own right (like the first two films), but I would also recommend looking at others first if you haven't already.
