Don't let the wildly different reviews of the movie discourage you. You will love it or hate it according to your tastes. However, if for no other reason, see "Greystoke" to experience the excitement of a great actor who grabs your heart while breathing life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor as far as he could perfectly handle Shakespeare; rather, he must be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he has portrayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibilities as an actor. His reading of the part of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke, his last performance, must be appreciated by all those who love theater.
