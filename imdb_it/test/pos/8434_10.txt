I wish Hollywood made more films like The China Syndrome. Because this marks at every level. <br /> <br /> It has an intelligent and credible script. It shows you that it's not just nuclear energy itself, but the money involved in it, which causes danger. And the film also gives you a fantastic look behind the scenes of how television is made. <br /> <br /> Assign a thriller role: the first time I saw it, it kept me right on the edge of my seat. And it marks like a movie of characters: I'm really interested in the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and, above all, Jack Lemmon are fantastic.
