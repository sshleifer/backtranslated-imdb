This film certainly deserves to be included in the horror genre, but not for obvious reasons. The horror of "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is not based on sudden shocks or large guts and guts CGI; is a psychological horror film that grips the viewer's curiosity from the beginning and builds an aura of mystery and suspensive questions. The best thing is that the ending does not provide a clear answer, prompting the viewer to analyze what they saw and decide what really happened. <br /> <br /> Do not be discouraged by the seemingly slow pace at which the film begins, and don't expect to immediately jump from your seat. This is not the classic hack-and-slash movie with orchestral punctures designed to make you afraid of anything in particular. "A Tale Of Two Sisters" slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things that elude explanation until the end. Even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy and obvious as to make the entire movie fall in order. The film requires its viewer to reflect on what they have seen and to try to square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. Some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The real fear of "A Tale Of Two Sisters" does not lie in shock or showy scares; It is a psychological and heartbreaking horror that challenges conventions and widens a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film. It is no exaggeration to say that this film also stands out from the so-called "Asian Horror" genre. In fact, it would be a mistake to align "A story of two sisters" with films like "Ringu" and "The grudge". This film can be understood from a variety of viewpoints, some that require no suspension of credulity, others that embrace the supernatural with all your heart. <br /> <br /> Whatever way you choose to interpret this film, it is one that requires an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions about Asian cinema or horror in general.
