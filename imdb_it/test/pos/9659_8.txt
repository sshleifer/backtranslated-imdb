It's a film about love, violence, illegal business and Romanian magnates. A Romanian story combined with a Western adaptation that translates into a modern international film that can be understood both by the Western public, but also by an Eastern European public that HAS FORGOTTEN the conservative communist regime on film production. <br /> <br /> A film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create increasingly tense situations as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> A story that impresses with its vision of the neighborhood's hard life. Two young people make illegal car races. They work together as a team and thrive from their occupation, but when asked by a local tycoon to lose a race things start to get messy and the fuse of the bomb lights up creating a very tense movie that will keep you close to the screen until the end of it when you still ask yourself many questions a long time later. <br /> <br /> Brilliant acting of both Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac together with high-quality directing and screenplay by the young but also the talented director Radu Muntean gives Furia a unique charm. All this and many other elements that can be noticed as you watch have created a film not to be missed by all movie lovers around the world and its message is clear to everyone, not depending on the race, the language we speak or the Country. It is a real hope for Romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the most advanced Western cinema. I hope you enjoy watching it because I am sure that all the people who saw it appreciated it
