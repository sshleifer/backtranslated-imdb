In the original French version, the bars of Numérobis (big, funny voice - Jamel Debbrouze) are very funny. <br /> <br /> But in the translated versions (I saw the German and English versions) it is not half good of the original. <br /> <br /> But: goof Special Effects, almost the complete comic strip (with differences, as the figure of Lügnix (German name) is inserted in another comic book. <br /> <br />, the Asterix comics are cult, but when you watch animated comedy films from 1968 to 1998 you'll see much better jokes, a better story and the old "charm" and "charm" of cult stories. <br /> <br /> For the francophones I suggest looking at it in its original version, with or without subtitles, if available in different languages.
