This is one of those films that was never advertised and therefore missed when it was originally screened in theaters. <br /> <br /> I found it while changing TV channels and I was immediately absorbed by this story of an old rodeo whose carelessness and lack of responsibility wounded everyone around him. I often wanted to see the movie again but I couldn't even remember his name, and I never saw it in rentals. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the video of the rodeo was of the highest quality. Despite being an action movie and with Western settings and themes, it could be appreciated by anyone, regardless of their taste in movies.
