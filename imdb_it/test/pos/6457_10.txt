I first saw this film on cable in the 80s and it shook me to the core. He appeared again on TV about six months ago. <br /> <br /> Filmed externally, black and white cinematography represents graphically the New York of the 50s as the gritty "urban jungle" in an era when there was much more industry and port activity city, particularly in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes has always given a special intensity to his acting, and it is magnificent in the role of army dodger. His short 1959 TV series "Johnny Staccato" is also a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But it's the superb acting of Jack Warden as the brutal and brutal boss who caught my eye. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this movie, then watch a 1962 episode of the TV series "Naked City" entitled "Specter of the Rose Street Gang (available on video)." If you are a fan of film noir, this is a must see. To enjoy!
