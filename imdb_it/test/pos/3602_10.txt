These critics must find a new job !!! This film is based on a TRUE HISTORY, which made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the fog of war and tragedy love can conquer everything. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece captured my heart and soul as if I were there too. The Blue eyed Cage and the delicious Cruz were fantastic! Together they perfectly depicted how a Mediterranean couple can only get close in time of war. This film will touch your heart as if it were mine you have to go and see it !!!!
