Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very intimate episode. The most noticeable element of the film is its silence; nobody talks. I do not think that Besson, despite what is evident in most of his latest works, considered it to be any kind of interesting found. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and the transport of emotions, no matter how light. Although I was not glued to the screen, I see in the reflection that it is a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. His vehicle is the stylized science fiction film. Part of his reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of his humans is not necessarily interpreted as a perfect human being: the hero, a lonely wanderer in the desolate new world, is taken by an elderly recluse, who refuses to keep the his part of a food exchange between him and a brutal and brutal character played by Jean Reno, and so Reno looks for everything he can, using mainly brute force, to get what he wants. So the antagonist is right, even if he is not a good person, and the protagonist and his nice foil are both wrong, even though they are both good people. <br /> <br /> It is filmed clearly and sharply in black and white, modified and captured in a simple but spry and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? They, like their characters, are left to the bare necessities of communication. This is one of the few really good films that Luc Besson wrote. His previous work is almost always better than the fuzz he now produces.
