My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his production company Studio Ghibli was when an English version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What an extraordinarily creative and unique cinema experience! So on that note, I managed to get my friend in the cinema to see this new Miyazaki movie with me, especially because he loves everything Disney (the American distributor of this movie). Once again, all I can say is "Wow!" What a fantastic graphic about the way the water is depicted as the ocean ... and what about the transformation of the title character from a goldfish to ... and to see how the behavior of some characters changes ... and , well, watch this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices used for this dubbed version in America: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good choices to everyone Does it all make sense? No, but it is part of the childish charm that permeates everything. There are a lot of funny scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they meet. Oh, I think I wrote too much, so I highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.
