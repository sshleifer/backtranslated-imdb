What the hell, people expect in horror movies these days. Must be something macabre like 'SAW' or is it just shit ... ??? Now, I don't pretend to be an omniscient expert, but I am around 47 years old, I saw and I own literally thousands of films and honestly I think that this director really gave this film a good and sincere effort. Believe me, I was getting ready to shudder as soon as the dialogue started, assuming it would be terrible and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a Mamet script, that's for sure; come on !!! with all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, especially in Horror, I thought this was closer to the top of the pile than most. <br /> <br /> The director used a lot of sharp and intelligent framing angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this type of film. Assembly and timing were very good. It did NOT resort to the tired and worn-out clich√© of excessive "slasher" violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During a scene of nudity absolutely delicious and completely free (but tasty ..., uh, I mean good taste), I COMPLETELY expect it to be cut and diced ; but, AMAZING, we enjoy its heavenly beauty and that's all ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** Furthermore, the tension was built very well, leading to a pleasantly ambiguous ending where you're not quite sure what both what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We actually see the doll talking to her, but in video recording we don't do it. Furthermore, the mother sees Pinnochio moving and being rather mean; so BOTH are the mother and the mentally ill daughter ... ??? In addition there is the original "killer" and what the mother had suggested concerning a possible influence of Evil. But even with all this, we are not STILL completely sure. WHO was doing the killing ***** END SPOILER ***** So all in all, I think it was a good, strong, sincere effort to create good old style Full Moon style and with LOT moderation on violence. And without the typical SLEAZE launched without reason (only the beautiful, innocent, beautiful scene of the shower, which I will remember until the end of my days ... :) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS around, a DEFINITE, strong 8/10 !! !
