Being a fan of time travel stories, I was surprised that there wasn't a "device" that sent Russell Johnson's character over time. It has just appeared in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I liked the premise of the dangers of "altering" the future by changing the past. Other Twilight Zone episodes on time travel such as "No time like the past", "Once upon a time", etc. They were more to my liking because of the use of time travel devices. Perhaps if Russell Johnson's character had been the same character played in "Execution" it would have been more acceptable to fans like me. As science fiction fans know, no character should ever "die" in time travel episodes. All types of twists can be applied in these types of stories. This was the only fault I could comment on this episode.
