The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian television series. Well-defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting venues, great guest stars and a film environment combined to make this series special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir switched to Sascha Hehn from Germany does not appear (unfortunately) for having enjoyed the success of the small screen in his native country. The ABC has repeated the series many times, but a DVD version has not yet happened. <br /> <br /> The series is timeless. It is probable that today it has a resonant tone with the spectators as in its time. Force ABC ... releases The Outsiders on DVD !!!!!
