This was easily one of the most bizarre of Ernest's films, especially with regard to production design. What did the pink guard uniforms have? Unfortunately, this film has probably destroyed the Ernest series, turning the series into a live video series. However, Jim Varney gave one of his best performances interpreting Nash, his criminal alter ego. A misstep in the series, but it wasn't bad in most cases (Electro Man's routine was classic)
