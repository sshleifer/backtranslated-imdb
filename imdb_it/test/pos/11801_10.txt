Let me tell you that I was VERY surprised at the production value of this film. I was able to see soon and I must say that this is the best Christian film (if not only) for the Passion theaters. <br /> <br /> Don't let the PG-13 vote scare you, the assessment is appropriate due to the serious issues faced in this film (divorce, juvenile pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the film is free. This is definitely a film that a group of young people from the High Junior could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is that this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a film of the Family without the sensation of the 7th Paradise. <br /> <br /> There is laughter, and many times in the theater everyone laughed, the pieces of humor were natural and did not seem scripted or forced, and this made the right rhythm in such a serious film. Teenagers and young adults, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many, if not all, of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see these topics covered in this type of film. The plot is in no way predictable, and eventually hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown how all the powerful know everything about "The Word", but instead people just try to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this movie ... not for a long time. <br /> <br /> Acting is first-rate, the point of writing, and you are not hit chief with all the preaching Christian rhetoric. This is a great movie that will make you and your kids think, talk and maybe question their morality (or lack of it). If you want to see a quality family movie in January, check your local listings for this movie, and you could learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25-year-old male who just wanted to watch a free movie film.
