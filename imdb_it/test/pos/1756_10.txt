Hi again, I've been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 in Los Angeles, California, in 1942. What a wonderful story to be good to one another, kindness and charity. Forget about the bugs related to each other. It was like they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult children. What a beautiful color in this film. I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the film, which I can't remember the "why" of it. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
