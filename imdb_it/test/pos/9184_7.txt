Having not seen the film in its commercial debut, we only caught it on DVD. Waiting for the worst, "Hitch" turned out to be a pleasant experience due to the three principles it contains. Thanks to the direction of Andy Tenant, the film has an easy rhythm, and while predictable, the comedy has some winning moments. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a sort of "date coordinator" for losers like Albert, who isn't exactly what one would consider a drum. Still, Albert is a genuine boy who, without professional help, would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. Enter Hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles he cannot overcome, and even if Albert remains overweight and never succeeds in mastering social graces, he conquers us because he is a real, in stark contrast to all the bogus ones who go around Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The basic mistake that most production designers make in preparing Hollywood movie venues is how foreign to reality they are. The apartments in which these characters are placed are so rare to discover that only thanks to the magic of the films these people can live in places like these. Evidently, most of the people in the film have to do with fantasy because most city dwellers would kill for such fabulous spaces as those they show in films, not to mention the same people depicted in the film that they would not be able to to afford them. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to enchant without doing much. The surprise of the film, however, is Kevin James, who like the overweight Albert, not only won us over, but showed that he could resist in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine as Hitch's main interest. In minor roles we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco, among others. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie to watch thanks to the inspired director of Andy Tenant.
