Christian Duguay directed this little spy thriller early in his career. He plays on TV quite regularly, albeit with horrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed. In the end I was able to see the theatrical version on a $ 3 tape from the local video store. The naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to impersonate the infamous Carlos the Jackal, and becomes a bit too busy with the role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays Quinn's superiors, with Sutherland a true fanatic and Kingsley as the most balanced. The first half of this funny movie shows that Quinn has been trained and indoctrinated. The second half makes him go out on the field, making love with the woman of the Jackal and shooting with various enemies. The idea is to make the Jackal look like a guardian to the Russians and let them take care of the most famous murderer in the world. Things don't go exactly as planned. Sometimes, I almost expected the cast to burst out laughing in some trivial dialect, but they all play it very straight. In the end, this is a terrifying little thriller that deserves your attention. The former lover of the Jackal who teaches Quinn, very lovable and very married, to make her angry, lick the blood off her face and then descend on her, alone is worth the price of admission.
