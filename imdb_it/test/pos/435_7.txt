This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge ballroom. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, as it has many cliches that lead to the inevitable conclusion ("will the show still continue?"). Obviously none of this is new, it was pleasant and well done. The musical numbers are frantic and beautiful to look at the end. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was rather the player, but this was sterilized in the American film. But, in FRANCAN CANCAN, the characters have a fully functioning libido - but nothing is shown, so the film is good for children. <br /> <br /> Nothing new, but well done anyway.
