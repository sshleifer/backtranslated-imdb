Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, due to the question that Kieslowski seems to thinly ask the public. Three men are at the center of this chapter and Kieslowski presents the two involved in the murder with both good and bad traits (in our case, almost overwhelmingly). With such vile characters, I found myself almost pleased that they would receive some sort of punishment. However, when the time for the murder comes (and it is the next effect on the murderer), Kieslowski takes an interesting perspective and seems to ask those of us who share my opinion: "Aren't you as guilty as this man?" This type of indirect address of the public makes the end of Dekalog Five much deeper than Kieslowski (as usual), which does not fall within the literal boundaries of its theme. Just like the other parts of Dekalog do not take the theme of their commandment in the literal sense, not even Dekalog Five. He asks us what murder is, who is more guilty of murder, and what the appropriate punishment should be, if it exists? It is a fantastic film, and typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning.
