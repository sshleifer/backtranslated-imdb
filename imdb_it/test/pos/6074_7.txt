The English Patient is one of those films that especially deserve the highest praises. I say, most of it, because this film, although very serious, intense, profound and really reflective, still suffers from some inconveniences. First of all, why, why are modern films so long? This lasts more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really difficult to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the film were shorter than an hour, it would have been useful only for something. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Academy Awards, The English Patient is still very good. It is a profound and insightful treatise of the human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and courage. Ralph Fiennes is an exceptional exceptional actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for anything just to save his lover's life. It is large, even if for half the time it is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is very convincing and sweet as usual. He adds a lot with his excellent interpretation and the plot of the love story with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all huge and all very strong. And then there's the desert of Egypt, then there's the deep, cloudless sky, the green groves of Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, landmines explode. Even the war is here. It's obvious, terrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, horrible bloody bodies, then naked bodies, adultery and everything. I do not know what to say. Much of the work of a splendid actor, so much of realism, so much brutality that war entails. This is not a movie for relaxation. It makes you think.
