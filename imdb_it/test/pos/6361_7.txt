Dan Ackroyd in his first stars such as Johgn Burns, an evasive mental asylum who stands as his own shrink to go to La La Land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular guest (Charle Grodin in his first snarl) takes a holiday. Along the way, Ackroyd joins Walter Matthau, a mad colleague, and the rest is sheer hilarity. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well with each other. Ackroyd's beautiful wife, Donna Dixon, is on her way to ride like another shrink. The ending seems a bit hasty and contrived, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my highest score, an 8. A gem from the 1980s lost.
