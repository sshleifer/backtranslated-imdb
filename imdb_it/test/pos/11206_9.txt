When you look at Distant you know you're not watching a French movie, there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations, just to make you understand what is going on. It doesn't even seem American, there are no chases, shootings or violence in the car, unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of a subdued catastrophe. Sometimes the relatively long medium distance shots can remind you of 'contemplative' Asian cinema, but I remind you that the director does not push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese directors, but then again this is not a film by Taiwan is a Turkish film. I don't know what that means, I don't even know if this should mean anything. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a correct plot and yet, those few lines, those a little long-strokes kept and that often mitigated tension gradually builds a sense of something that happens, a sense of "plot", for lack of a better word that grows on you. At the end of the film you may have the feeling of losing those two cousins ​​who have many things in common but are worlds apart.
