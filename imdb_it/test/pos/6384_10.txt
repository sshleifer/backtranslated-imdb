I saw this film as a screener and it is the best film I saw in a very short time. I loved it !!!! James Franco is so hot that he and Sienna Miller make the perfect pair. I don't want to give away what happens, but they do play a couple of newlyweds who go to Niagara Falls on their honeymoon and some beautiful and wild things happen along the way ... The film is really very funny, sad and original. I can't even say what it reminded me, but go see it! I cried so much but I loved it and I want to see it again as soon as it comes out! Even my friends cried. I hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when? I would really like to see it if I were you
