I waited years for THE DEAD to be released on video, having practically worn my tattered VHS copy. This is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. It takes place at the Epiphany Festival (twelfth night), and is a simple, moving cartoon of characters participating in a dinner prepared by three women from Dublin. At the center of the story is a couple without love, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wanted to experience the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. All the performances are wonderful and the script is wonderfully intertwined with the various dinner characters. Of course, his starting material is James Joyce's short story with the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept completely intact. John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest directors has had a truly appropriate ending with this film, which was scripted by his son, Tony Huston; plays his daughter, Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife, Maricella. Thanks to Lions Gate for collecting the rights to this film and publishing it on DVD. For lovers of all things Irish or for people looking for a thin, but incredibly moving holiday film, this is a real gem.
