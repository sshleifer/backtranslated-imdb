The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a twilight-themed story of the strangest fashion. The film focuses on a young middle-aged couple living in salary for salary in 1976. One day a mysterious box appears with a red button. Later that day a ghostly gentleman arrives and tells them that they have a chance to press the button and receive a million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. It's a disturbing and provocative question, outlined with suspense in the trailers and TV commercials. But know that you don't know what to expect until you see it. Sometimes pretentious and a bit melodramatic, the film is ultimately effective due to its good performances and intriguing arguments. It would be unfair to ruin any plot twist for you, but just let it be said that the film will provide the aspects you expect and not completely fulfill the others it begins to outline. There is a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film that is both interesting and annoying as it was not so obvious in his other top movie Donnie Darko. There's not much more to say without ruining the film for you. is intended to inspire a lot of coffee chatter later. However, I would also like to say that it is well shot and has an aged appearance appropriately for it and is worth looking at. Check it out.
