Wow! It is difficult to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is certainly one of the best episodes of the first season. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the Arctic with an unknown organism that provokes a murderous aggression, the drama cannot be better than this. Paranoia reigns supreme even though Mulder and Scully have doubts about mutual sanity. I've heard people complain about the similarities of this episode with the movie "The Thing". I didn't see it, so I wouldn't know. The ice deserves more to be seen to see Mulder and Scully who are really testing their developing trust. This episode is intense and full of suspense until the end. You will not be disappointed!
