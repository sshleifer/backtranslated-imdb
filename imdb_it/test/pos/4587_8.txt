You can read all types of references in the world of Idiocracy. A futuristic world populated by pampered and self-indulgent idiots powered by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in "The Time Machine" by HG Wells and "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley among other satires. /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, a narrator explains the rapid degradation of humanity for over five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps from which all futuristic technology has come in the meantime. Most of the criticism of this very funny (and amusing) film seems to surround this omission and the consequent denunciation that the world is not "realistic". As if "realism" had ever been a necessary quality of satire. "Brazil" is realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, how about "Gulliver's Travels"? I did not think "Idiocracy", although perhaps not indicated as the best of its kind, it hits the same notes and generally does so successfully. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I did not find futuristic technology as a problem. It is easy enough to understand that Mike Judge is saturating the current trend towards automation and simple product interfaces, so that even idiots can use them. As in "Brave New World", the company in the film seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency at some point in the past (apparently created by the "intelligent people" now extinct to appease an increasingly stupid population), leaving the rest of the humanity free to indulge in all the worst selfish impulses they manage to stir up and become even more stupid. The film takes place precisely during the last yearning of humanity, as everything begins to collapse definitively. It may still be "unrealistic", but if so, it's a brand of unrealism very well presented. <br /> <br /> Stupid people spend most of their time on the screen, of course, but they are just the victims - they know nothing better. Mike Judge saves his true hatred of smart people in power who died when the film starts, but who are very much alive right now, in the 21st century. People like scientists who pursue "hair growth and prolonged erections" have no other reason than the possibility that they turn a profit into their treatments with snake oil. People like politicians who allow corporations to simply buy the FDA and the FCC. People like media executives and their stupid yuppie minions - who allow the destruction of all culture, morality and health to get drunk fast. <br /> <br /> After all, who is really to blame, the Morlocks or Elois? The Paris Hiltons of the world, or the brilliant executives and advertisers who put it on TV and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave it there? This is all implicit in "Idiocracy", though. A line here, a suggestion there (testify to the hilarious self-doctor who literally does all the work in the health system). It is one of the few aspects of the film that is NOT beaten to the ground by the unnecessary narrator. That's where the viewer can take it or not, but it's one of the most interesting themes in a film that is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. Too bad that so many people leave the film thinking that it's just an excuse to show the farting rear areas and the people who get hit in the groin. Not that even that stuff isn't funny, and maybe it's a little absurd. But in "Idiocracy", it's not as simple as it seems.
