I bought this DVD recently and was totally struck by the fact that Rush's songs sound like when I first heard them in 1980. Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart's lineup is so talented that I want to list them again and yet. <br /> <br /> Songs I remember like Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio were played and the 40000 plus fans sing to us and have fun and I swear that half the audience was under 25! <br /> <br /> The writers who put Rush down like Rush fans like me are a bunch of jealous demons who love to taste the rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco. <br /> <br /> Rush does not wear make-up, wears nails, synchronizes his lips, wears lipstick, gets into trouble with the law and brags a band member how long they have not been married. All they do is entertain! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD a 100 out of 100.
