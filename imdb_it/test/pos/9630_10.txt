I really liked The Patriot. This film had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. A line from wesley mclaren's film (seagal) has stuck in my mind to be very faithful to our society, "western medicine is in the practice of prolonging the disease and I'm in the business of treating it". <br /> <br />
