I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The film had all the components that kept me interested as I watched it. I particularly enjoyed the twists and turns along the road and the surprising ending. Craig Morris has the potential of Brad Pitt both in appearance and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter has taken this film to a new level. I loved the cast. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the talent, the places and the script were fantastic. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is a very talented and talented director. He gives his job at 200%. The film has a great plot. I hope there will be an Eddie Monroe 2. I'd like to see how Nicolette finds out after getting her loot of money. Eddie Monroe of Fred Carpenter is in Hollywood.
