I saw this movie in September with my mother. I was expecting a good movie and saw an excellent one. This is now my most precious film. He didn't leave me after I left the theater. The situations in this film reminded me of my late grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were also incredible. This film made me realize how important family relationships are. Rent it. I can't recommend it enough.
