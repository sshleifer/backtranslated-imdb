Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family as they spend the summer at Kellerman's Family Summer Camp. We see her discover herself falling in love with the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The film is full of wonderful dances (hence the title!) A bit of fantastic music, and fantastic scenery. He handles some difficult problems with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (the shocking spoiler here!) A happy, wonderful, good ending! You know how it will end from the beginning, but that's not the point. The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I need to see every time it comes on TV ... it doesn't matter that I've already memorized it!
