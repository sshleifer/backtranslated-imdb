In the last episode, he plays Kelvin Inman, Desmond's partner in the Hatch. Destiny, eh? Yes, yes! <br /> <br /> I believe we will all have to wait, to see what is in the lives of wonderful people in that strange island, in the middle of nowhere. Knowing that many of my favorite characters, Desmond, Sayid and Mr. Eko, have an unclear fate <br /> <br /> I believe that along with 24 and The Shield, this is one of the best TV shows ever, of course, keeping Twin Peaks in a special place.
