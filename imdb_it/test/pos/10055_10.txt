I have to classify this film at 10 years. I'm sorry, but I think it's a classic comedy. so if you're assigning it to other Madonna movies ... well, what? Do you want to tell me that it wasn't his best film ever? Mira Sorvino didn't win an Oscar for almost the same performance, not ten years later? please, this film deserves much more credit than it gets. moreover, I like to consider it as a sociological study A + on the lifestyles of the 80s. do you remember when you could steal from Sam Goody and Cartier on the same day? Remember when women proudly wore bushy eyebrows? so it wasn't "Last Emperor", it was still good. there are some movies that I would be willing to watch every day. three, actually, that make my day positive and make me smile. if you like "Who's That Girl?" so I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".
