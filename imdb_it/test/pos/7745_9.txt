I rented this gem several times! It is a small but somewhat sprawling masterpiece that takes the viewer from the glitz of Manhattan to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes' On Screen Marriage With Real Life Wife Gena Rowlands Is On The Rocks. Find meaning in an adventure with Susan Sarandon who is in Greece while their daughter, played in her first teenage film role by Molly Ringwald, falls in love with the son of the Greek tycoon who courts his mother on a sailing yacht nearby. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Raul Julia plays a goat who lives in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the "hotspots" for the character of Molly Ringwald to confront John Cassavetes. Everyone eventually joins in a classic closing scene where everything is reconciled. Raul Julia, the goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat. This film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sensuality and more. Watch it!
