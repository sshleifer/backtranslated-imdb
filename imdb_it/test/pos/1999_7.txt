This film comes from Turkey where no horror film tradition is found. First of all I was afraid of looking at just an adaptation, but after seeing it I changed my mind. It has an original scenario. A love film that uses the theme of horror. Most players are not famous young people, but their performance shows that a new generation is coming. Perhaps this is a sign that Turkish cinema returns after 20 years.
