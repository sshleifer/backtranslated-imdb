I was shocked at how good this German version of films like Scream was. Overcoming all modern American efforts in slasher movies. <br /> <br /> It's like what all those movies don't do. Cute characters, true mystery, suspense, graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This elegant horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out over the years. German cinema is only getting stronger lately. It is a pity that many people do not go to see such films because they are being lost. It's easily available on DVD, so even if you hate subtitles I think you should see it. It will be one of the best horror movies you will see in any season.
