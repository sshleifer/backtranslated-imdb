Kennedy-Miller could not have done a better job of dealing with a very demanding exercise: making dry political events work like a human drama and providing an impartial representation of explosively controversial topics. <br /> <br /> The key to his success at the first count is a brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by the performance of Max Phipps like Gough Whitlam of other commentators here. The highlights for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history: Hunter couldn't have been more perfect for the role. In the second count, the series avoids the "myth of objectivity" trap through a narrator who expresses the director's sympathies (Phillip Noyce, who most recently demonstrated his leftist credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), while being fairly impartial and nice in his dramatic portrait of all the parts. The adherence to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme popular among Labor partisans was perhaps a bit partial, though not so ruinously. In particular, the credit is due to the sympathy shown to Kerr and to the extraordinarily difficult position in which he was inserted, whatever may be thought of his actions. <br /> <br /> However, there is a sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the representation of the Jim Cairns / Juni Morosi case. Those who come to the unprecedented series for these events will have the impression that Cairns and Morosi are the innocent victims of a slanderous campaign by an itchy journalist. Producers may have been detained in this regard by unfounded Australian defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested that their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would admit until a year earlier of his death). However, more could have been done about the bizarre fashion in which Morosi ran the Cairns office as Treasurer. <br /> <br /> Speaking of defamation, there are a couple of confusing occasions in which dialogue is obscured due to injunctions taken by the offended principals - with a beep on one occasion and a ringing phone on another. A further curiosity: the release of the DVD exalts a joke from the scene of the comic relief in which a customs officer (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at Sydney airport. The next one in the queue is a disheveled-looking hippie, who now receives only a flash of disapproval from Chubb when he presents his documents. In the original version, Chubb said something like: "drug bust in Bali, eh?" Obviously this line does not sound truer in the wake of the case of Schapelle Corby, which has dramatically shown that those arrested for drug use in Bali can expect much worse than deportation.
