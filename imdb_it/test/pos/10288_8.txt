All thanks to the writer / director Gilles Mimouni who modeled this tortuous and tortuous plot of deception and betrayal. While maintaining maximum control, it keeps the public at a safe distance, never allowing them to become fully aware of what is happening. Even his ingenious denouncement guesses you. <br /> <br /> The three central performances are also first-class, with Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey integrates strength into its supporting role. Giving away the details of the plot or character specifics wouldn't be right. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast effectively uses the camera to sweep us through this puzzle, and the editing of Cardine Biggerstaff keeps the story one step ahead of us. Peter Chase's theme is sublime in his marriage to the ideal of the script. <br /> <br /> Many might say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to tackle several deeper problems about love. For me this is simply a haunting and elusive enigma that weaves a fascinating network. Only the French are capable of such excitement. Hollywood would have ruined everything with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday 2 March 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> No one does thrillers like the French. When they do it well, they do it really well. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell is as intriguing as the deceptive Max, Romane Bohringer as obsessive as the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is as mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot of Gilles Mimouni is a vortex of deliberate deceptions and fatally crossed threads. <br /> <br /> All credit must go to its manipulation of the intelligent plot and the performance of the three protagonists. Like Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and exciting. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
