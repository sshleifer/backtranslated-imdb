"The five characters in search of an exit" must clearly be one of the most intelligent and best "Twilight Zone" episodes ever made because of his abstract ideas and the thoughtful plan in which the characters have to try to discover the identity and ends as a surprise. You have a soldier, a dancer, a pipe player, a clown and a hobo who all woke up together at the bottom of a wall and nobody knows how they got there and they don't know who they are. So the episode starts with a very interesting drama and suspense from the beginning, thus making the soul in search of the interest of the spectators for wanting to know the characters as true identity and background. Moreover, the episode adds even more intrigue to the fact that it places different types of characters with different points of view and lifestyles all with a single goal in common to escape and find identity, and peace that is very compelling for the viewer. Only at the end I don't want to spoil those who haven't seen a surprise fall! By demonstrating that many times you may want to stay where you are far away in your small protected world and be away from the masses of other people's world, as you will see the characters are loved in a different way than people in a very different form. Really great and cleverly made a real shock shock that shows the viewer the unexpected and cruel fate that sometimes happens when you look and look.
