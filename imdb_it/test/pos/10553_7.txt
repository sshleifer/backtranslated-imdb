I have a problem with cinema snobs who consider Americans to be despicable semi-alphabets who cannot appreciate the subtlety of the most sophisticated Europeans, the French, the Italians ... almost none of the continent to which English is a foreign language . If the humor of "My Father the Hero" is different from that of "Mon Pere ce heros", it is because the sense of French humor is different from the American one. It's not better, it's no longer "intelligent", it's just different. If you think it's crude for Hollywood to "borrow" from French cinema, consider how much French cinema has borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where would Belmondo and Delon have been without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style he is idolized in France. Stand out ........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the unfortunate divorced father of a 14 year old daughter on vacation in the Bahamas together. Unbeknownst to her, she introduces him to the other people in the hotel as his lover to make himself more interesting to a boy he keeps his eyes on. Not surprisingly, complications arise. There are "hommages" on "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" inserted in a fun way and M.Depardieu gets along very well. Makes a good impression of Maurice Chevaler with "Thank goodness for the girls" which is actually fun and quite moving as his audience, who everyone believes is the lover of a 14-year-old girl, getting up and leaving two - of - two while strolling away, blissfully unaware of what is happening. When he turns towards the end of the song to recognize the expected applause, the expression on his face is priceless. Without him the film would be really very average. With his huge trembling figure that dominates the screen is very funny. No pecs, no six packs, just a real human being. Formidable!
