I saw fantabulosa! because in the last few years Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors, and if you've never seen him before, you're ashamed of yourself before, and secondly, get your hands on a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love. This production did not disappoint - Michael Sheen turned almost magically into Kenneth Williams and gave a show as tragic as it was clever. Not to draw anything from other performances, but like Kenneth, Michael really did steal the show. I don't know how he does it, but every performance I saw giving Michael seems metamorphosis until the character he plays is really, absolutely credible, and no matter how much I try I can't criticize him. Must go get my tea, have fun!
