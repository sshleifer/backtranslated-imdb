... the opportunity that gave me to look at the Irish past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing him with my mother who was from Cork and, looking, we talked and learned a lot from her about how things were then. <br /> <br /> Stuff like Deasy and Co. was a non-alcoholic beverage company from Cork; how the rain can really destroy a crop; how farmers had to harvest; as in the ballrooms women and men really had to stand along the opposite walls before the men advanced and asked the woman to dance; on the bellows that kept the fire burning; as the priests really called the list of donors of the church and their donations and some of the currency of that time (which my father helped me by showing me a case that showed the pence, the shilling and the crowns used then (which were legal tender Also in England)). <br /> <br /> I didn't pay much attention to how good the movie was, but I was very grateful to have the opportunity to look back on a period of time that for some is Irish. History, but for others, including some of our parents and grandparents, it's just their childhood.
