One of the first reviews of this film ends with "Only for the big fans of the main actors or the fans of the exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood movies ...", as if those were not a sufficient reason to love it! Anyone who, after watching this movie, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, or the realism of political motivations, or any other extra-cinematographic concerns, simply doesn't like movies. Watch it and be intimidated by the stellar strength of the two protagonists, the exotic, the romantic, the photography and the music, and the bold adventure of a truly evasive film. This is proof that Hollywood can "make them as before" when it really wants. A solid 8/10.
