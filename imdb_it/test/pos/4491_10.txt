I will never forget the completely absorbing effect that this show had on me when I first saw it. From the moment when the Major is surprised by the Clown, by his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation ("We are alive, we are people, we must have memories!", An inexact but close quote), to his intelligent attempt to improvise escape, this is a compelling drama. <br /> <br /> The little touches remain long with the viewer after watching it. The moment when the adorable ballerina dances for everyone, towards the unlit key, the Scottish musician's shrill bagpipe; The melancholy observation of the Tramp, "A miss is a mile long", the shaken conclusion of the major that they must be in Hell. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and performed. Susan Harrison's breathtaking beauty adds to the memorability of the strange and moving story.
