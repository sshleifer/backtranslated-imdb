'' Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit '' is the same kind of animation and the same creators as '' Chicken run '', but the story is now another: Wallace, an inventor who loves cheese and his Gromit, the intelligent dog that is always helping Wallace with his problems, is trying to keep rabbits away from everyone's vegetables, as there is in their city, an annual Giant Vegetable Contest. But when Wallace tries an invention he made, to prevent rabbits from avoiding the plant, what's going to be cursed is him. Before watching this film I didn't know that these two characters already existed and were famous. I loved Gromit and I think it's one of the coolest dogs I've seen before. <br /> <br /> aka "Wallace & Gromit -A Batalha dos Vegetais" - Brazil
