The ever delightful Kevin Spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives. After making us believe that it is a muttering murmur (just to expose the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic The Usual Suspect; this time leads us to believe that it is Prot, a nice alien who takes on a human form while walking around the Earth. <br /> <br /> Prot is a singular stranger apparently appearing out of nowhere, only to be hospitalized in the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon takes an extreme interest in him, and even thinks about whether Prot is actually a supreme being on the planet K-PAX, or maybe he is just a forgotten human being with serious psychiatric problems . While the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex and enlightening path that leaves behind a series of intriguing / philosophical questions.
