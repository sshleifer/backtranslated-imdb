I would like to present the following joke. <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, the soldiers are seen wallowing in the river, asking to be taken away and trying to escape. Some soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and try to embark with their luggage. Soldiers are not issued and never carry suitcases in a combat zone. They have bags, backpacks and walking shoes but no suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of place. Also, if you look closely, you'll see that the suitcase floats above the water. This is probably a good indication that it is empty, otherwise it would sink.
