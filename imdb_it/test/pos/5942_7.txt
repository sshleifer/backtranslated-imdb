I have to be a bit skeptical when I went to the cinema to watch OSS117: French comedies tend to be so satisfied nowadays that only the stupidest have achieved a high score at the national box office. But I was surprised that although humor does not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French vision of the world in 1950, which represents OSS117, are hilarious and the director has managed to recreate the cinematic style of that time with amazing fidelity. In short, a bit of a surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of various secondary actors. And for once, Jean Dujardin's style (which can upset the nerves of many people) fits perfectly with the character he plays.
