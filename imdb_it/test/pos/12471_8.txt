If you are looking for a modern film version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller that surpasses the machinations of unscrupulous white guides or cunning, members of the black tribe, while you are saving the animal kingdom, this is NOT the movie for you. This is a tale of Tarzan's "legend" since its inception in intelligent and adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and true to the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is not an action hero, but a man divided between two worlds: the natural and the civilized. In an extraordinary performance, Christopher Lambert interprets this anxiety with absolute realism. If it slips out once the cat is out of the bag: the public (especially the adult audience targeted by the film) will laugh and the movie will completely lose its grip. It will collapse into the depths of the cheese. But Lambert never lets that happen. (Forget what you might think of him in other films, when I saw this movie in the theater in its original version, I thought he deserved an academic award.) <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, like other commentators they noticed. I disagree with most of them as I found nothing wrong with Andie McDowell's execution. I wouldn't have nominated her for an academic award - the role is undemanding - but she totally agrees, as it is. I don't know why his voice was overdubbed too. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the African segment of the story is absolutely beautiful. Capture both the beauty of African wilderness and the exotic waiting that reigns in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is lush and exotic, and the colors are vivid. <br /> <br /> But this is also a "vintage" film, and photography also beautifully depicts Victorian England, the countryside, the city and the interiors. The costumes are exceptional. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or intrusive. <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than some scenes in Wolves Dances. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young Lord Greystoke, interpreted convincingly by Christopher Lambert.
