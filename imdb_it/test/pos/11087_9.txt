this movement was intriguing and engaging; however, the story was a bit clumsy and difficult to follow at times. Even though the two main actors did a great job, just seeing Senn Penn act with every fiber of his being and stealing every frame made this film truly memorable. Later films revealed him as an actor not only of a role: he also showed a comic touch in Sweet and Lowdown. Surprisingly talented and not the light weight I thought it was. /
