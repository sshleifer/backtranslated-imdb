Nothing exceptional here except a well-made story of an abused deaf wife (Fonda) of a little crook (Bochner) who gets involved with one of her husband's and her lover's plans. Sutherland and Weber are policemen attracted to what appears to be a mysterious murderous investigation and the story just passes by.
