A teacher from a small town (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered from amnesia and is indeed a secret government murderer! Soon, there are men behind her and a small private detective (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> This was full of action, with some fantastic special effects and very funny jokes (especially from Jackson). Although sometimes the action can get a little silly, who cares? After all, aren't movies made to be a good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The film itself was a beautiful moment. Don't expect to have to think too much, because then, if you take it too seriously, the movie really won't be fun but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.
