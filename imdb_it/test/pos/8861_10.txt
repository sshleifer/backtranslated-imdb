Many people have a movie that they consider their favorite movie. My film will always be The Thing by John Carpenter! The main reason why this film is a cult film is perhaps the splatter effect created mainly by the genius Rob Bottin and that this is the film that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from NY) In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere and, of course, the acting. I've seen thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the last 10 years), but no one has had the impact on me like this, not even the big "Das Boot". <br /> <br /> Here is my suggestion for you who like science fiction and horror movies: put yourself in the good chair of your home. Make sure you are not interrupted by anyone. If you don't have a projector, sit by your TV and watch this movie miracle. Let it absorb you and you'll see it my way! <br /> <br /> Best viewing time: end of February between 5 and 9 pm.
