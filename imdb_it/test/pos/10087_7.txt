Another Asian horror film full of intense and gruesome moments. Another Asian horror brand is the complexity of the plot, which is also here. IMPORTANT SPOILER IMPORTANT! <br /> <br /> The film begins in a very simple way: two sisters go to live with their father and stepmother after being put into a psychiatric institution after their mother has hanged herself. The sisters seem very hostile towards the mother - especially the older one - and seem to ignore the father. Everything goes smoothly until the mother blocks the young sister in the closet and the older sister tells her father. Then it hits you, "your sister has been dead for years". It turns out that the older sister has not yet recovered from the death of her mother and what we did not know is that the wardrobe in which her mother was hanged fell younger sister and killed her too. Like her stepmother, she is the alter ego of her older sister - revealed when her stepmother (actually her sister's alter ego) is sitting on a sofa when the real stepmother enters! I hope it was made clearer for the confused Asian horror fans out there. <br /> <br /> Finally - my favorite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke and explodes in a panic attack. Very scary! 7 out of 10
