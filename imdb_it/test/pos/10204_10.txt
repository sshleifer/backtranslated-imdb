Lang makes Hawks and Hawks in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling into the typical deterministic, dark and guilty ending for the finale. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and chased, we don't know why - he runs into the wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but finding out that Creighton is in a bad way, he decides to fix it for first This is mainly conveyed through facial expressions and very short and cut dialogue - in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears. <br /> <br /> Cut a few weeks or months later, with Creighton under repair and responsible for an expedition to lay the wire that goes west from Omaha. He hires Shaw as an explorer, who tries to leave when he finds out that Creighton is in charge; but Creighton wants it anyway, paying off a debt and perceiving something quality. Also hired is a tender, son of a benefactor of the project, but atypically the oriental Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent as it immediately shows in a fun but exciting bronco-busting sequence. Both assumptions are fighting for Creighton's sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore) who - again not typically - seems capable of taking care of herself like any man. The camaraderie between the three men, the comic elements involving an involuntary cook and various rough and sagging types, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and remind me more of Howard's "Red River" or "Solo" Hawks Angels Have Wings "of most of the Lang - but they are so well played and the action proceeds so naturally that it doesn't matter, and it doesn't alter our pleasure - if perhaps it changes our expectations - like the usual Langian themes of the past haunted, the dark secrets and the immense attraction of the simplest, most destructive and wicked ways come to dominate the next part of the film Shaw's old friends return to haunt him as the wagon train and its wires move westward, the attacks they get on the crew, and Shaw has to fight with what, if nothing else, he has to tell Creighton of his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane), leader of the outlaws. <br /> <br /> Splendidame It was soon shot in Technicolor and moving smoothly from stages to western settings, this is for my money the best western of Lang and one of his best films, powerfully transmitting like any of his films the tragic incapacity of men to escape their past and building a new future Scott is as good as I saw it, showing more at a glance that many actors can do in a paragraph of dialogue, and the rest of the cast is uniformly well. The inevitable clash between Shaw's past criminal life and his future potential is extraordinary, and a surprise even for a long-lived devotee of Lang like me; and even in 1941 it seems that there was no place more charged with meaning at the edge of civilization than the barber and the dusty road outside. You can shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really be that while the old bonds still hold you. <br /> <br /> Genius.
