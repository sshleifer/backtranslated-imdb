I saw this movie at Christmas and what a fantastic movie! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Although I heard that the film is not very accurate from a historical point of view (Hollywood never is) I still enjoyed it since I knew little about real events. I thought Errol Flynn was as brilliant as Custer and he has since become my favorite actor! His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic! He brought me close to tears as he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) rode to the death with a small horn. <br /> <br /> I always knew that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor like he was my favorite actor and I grew up watching his movies as a child. But it wasn't until I saw this movie that I realized how fantastic it was. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 10 out of 10 !!
