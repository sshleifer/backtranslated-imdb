I found West Point a nice movie, although I doubt I would watch it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as another hatefully funny young man who got his success by the end of the film. It is hard to believe that the celebrity has mentioned Joan Crawford less than a year after the making of this film, since sometimes it seems rather embarrassing. <br /> <br /> I apply the comment made by another about "Huddle" by Ramon Novarro (1932) to this film too. There is a great movie waiting to be done here, but there is something missing. The background and the integration of the Corps were well used, but I was less involved than I thought. Perhaps the character of Haines has gone too far, or gone too far. His "repentance" did not seem real enough; and what kind of message did he send to play all the games in the last minutes of the Army-Navy game? Where is "the Body" in this? He might even have eliminated the other ten men and let him do everything by himself. Furthermore, I strongly doubt that the weak and pungent character of William Bakewell ever had a real counterpart at West Point. <br /> <br /> All this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a refined look at the everyday practices of an honorable institution. Thankfully, tradition still means something even at West Point, unlike the vain "traditions" of Ivy League schools, committed only to their heart these days. <br /> <br /> As for the score: it was appropriately martial. But there was a distinct overuse of snare drums. Using them to knock on the door, scene transitions, and ALU, as well as in well over half of the scenes, has become quite boring. It has rather diminished the visual experience. I was ready to say "I GET THE POINT ALREADY" <br /> <br /> Having said that, enjoy the movie, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.
