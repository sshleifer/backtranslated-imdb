There was something in the three original films that made them so special and delicious, probably their length. Unfortunately this lacks charm, but ends up being a funny movie. <br /> <br /> The bright and sparkling side is that our favorite plasticine figures are still doing a great job, there is a good plastic animation, there is a stupid plot, but well structured and fun, an exciting, a fun adventure, a good plot idea (a bunny and a giant competition) and good new characters! <br /> <br /> In addition to lacking the original charm, the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that humor, although good, is slightly exaggerated, especially compared to the original films. <br /> <br /> The famous Giant Vedgetable Competition is approaching and Wallace and Gromit are helping control rabbits to eat anything, now I'm Anti Pesto. They are doing a good job, but soon, there is danger on foot. A rabbit was close ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for all Wallace and Gromit fans and people who like plastic films, enjoy "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Wererabbit"! :-)
