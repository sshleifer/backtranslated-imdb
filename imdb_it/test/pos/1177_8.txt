Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both unfortunately missed, have once again proved to be a team dedicated to their profession of bringing funny moments to the screen. This film is just another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time two brothers-in-law play on a ship as dance instructors on board. <br /> <br /> Of course, their leader is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who likes to harass these guys. It's funny how Lemmon gives Matthau a quick dance lesson and how the latter dances a wild rumba with the boat owner, Rue McLanahan. Too bad the dance mates Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor have so little to do, but their parts require it. Matthau falls in love with Dyan Cannon, aboard his gold digging partner, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Matthau doesn't even have money. The widower Lemmon falls in love with Gloria De Haven, who looks more beautiful than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious career.
