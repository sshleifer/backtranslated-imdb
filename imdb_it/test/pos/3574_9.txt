An intelligent and well-received film that is worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this exciting and truly intelligent film shot entirely in Bogotà, you can hear the total meaning of the word "Bluff" (even if it is a Colombian film, the title is presented in English); ! <br /> <br /> The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who finds his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) in a relationship with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas was left without a girlfriend and without a job. Nicolas's revenge in Mallarino consists in following him and getting his photographs with his new report Alexandra (Carolina Gomez) to blackmail Mallarino to get money in exchange for not showing the photographs to Margarita. <br /> <br /> The story is really smart and well connected, to the point that you will fully understand the meaning of the title, the film shows a thriller with lots of scenes and comic characters, resulting in a real pleasure for someone who loves movies focused on a good script. <br /> <br /> It distinguishes me here that this film is different from the typical Colombian films that show a dark and violent image of our beautiful country, which is something really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show the typical Colombian lifestyle, so it could be held anywhere in the world, I disagree with this: (1) the film is completely filmed in Bogota, so you can see the streets, and images of the true Colombian capital (I hope some Americans and film producers watch this, so they stop showing the Amazon jungle, or the Mexican towns in Bogotà as in some Hollywood movies), (2) the characters, the dialogues, the accent (with the exception of Nicolas from Argentina) I am totally from here, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has a typical Cali accent, (3) you can also see social and cultural differences from the common people in Bogotá. I hope all this, in addition to an English title, will push people from other countries to see this masterpiece by Martinez <br /> <br /> Excellent acting by Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, exceptional as detective Ricardo Perez and good acting of Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A film worthy of export, which people from all over the world will surely understand and appreciate!, Do not miss this 9/10 film!
