This film is really worth seeing - Robin Tunney excels and Henry Thomas proves to be one of those rarities, the 'actor' child who grows up to become a real actor. The characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they might not have been convincing - but all the actors are simply stunning. The cast of this film must be classified there with that of "Girl, Interrupted" (both films coincide with the brilliant Clea Duvall). The score and the musical selections fit perfectly, and there is a lot of action to prevent the film from becoming just a character study. If you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but I'll say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.
