I say that there could be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what I'm discussing, even though I don't really think it's giving away anything important. Any "surprise" is really irrelevant to the success of this film or the viewer's ability to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> While not without some minor flaws, this is a beautiful and moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives. Yet at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small comedies mostly subtly woven. For most of the film, it proceeds at a fairly slow pace, but it doesn't seem slow at all as the film attracts one into and into the lives of the characters, and at the beginning it is mostly rather carefree. Some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful portrait of the lives of such nice characters that it can be watched almost endlessly. As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moves to the end and progression is wonderfully managed. <br /> <br /> In the end, some of the characters decide to rob a bank and even though it's maybe a little hard to believe, this is beyond the point. It's a wonderful addition to emphasize the love these friends have for each other, while at the same time heightening humor and adding a little more irony to the film. And, even if it is not original that a group of old touches a bank, the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully, making it really very funny, like when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to "camouflage" the fact that he is old. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the other comedy is rather low-key, but still a lot of fun, so I was constantly chuckling. <br /> <br /> Actors are probably the real key to this film. They enter the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities that are pulled out smoothly and beautifully. Of course, the film talks about the personalities of these characters and how they take care of and interact with each other. It happens so well thanks to them and if minor actors had the roles that the film could have failed. <br /> <br /> Gule Gule is not without sadness, but simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience. In fact, the film is so moving and full of so much love from characters so rich that in the end it is a very warm, satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness. I could watch it again and again.
