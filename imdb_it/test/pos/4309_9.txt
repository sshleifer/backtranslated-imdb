If you haven't seen this movie, do it. It's a genremix like I've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny things, a film noir, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best orgasm played on Film, beaten only by Sally), a pitch by Orson Welles mixed together in an opera of art. As a work of art it doesn't have to be logical in the end, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I owned a copy of the TV on VHS but lent it to an ex-girlfriend and now I can't get it back. But the film should be released on DVD in Austria on 10.06.03 and be sure, I'll buy it.
