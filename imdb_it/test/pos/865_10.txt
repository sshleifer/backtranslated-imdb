If you've ever been a fan of "The State" of MTV, then these three guys will be familiar to you, but even if you've come across the internet as I did, you'll soon appreciate their unique brand of comedy. <br /> <br /> Born from their standing comedy trio, "Stella", Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant surreal comedy cartoons to show at their shows, and now after being available only to download from two websites, they appear in glorious splendor on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> Think of a sketch of uncensored comedies, and you'll be halfway there. No stone of decency has been left. to those who like their rough, self-indulgent and bordering childish comedy (and I mean that in the most flattering way) this is the DVD for you! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth the comment of the two Michaels and David alone, you can't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions, shudder at their own antics with s ex toys in turn beat each other on the back and hurl abuse. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> He has to say something about Stella's appeal that Julie Bowen likes and Paul Rudd is willing to take the action so fearlessly. And you should follow their good example, throw preconceptions in the wind and prepare yourself to laugh at yourself.
