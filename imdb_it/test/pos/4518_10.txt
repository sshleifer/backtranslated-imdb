The kite runner should win an Oscar! It is perfect in every sense, history, script, acting, cinematography ... One could never imagine that it was shot in China. The story of two childhood friends and of what follows in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression. The representation of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is all too real and terrifying. I haven't read the book, but I've seen comments that put the film down because "the book is always better" ... It doesn't really matter. No one put down "Gone with the Wind" because it wasn't true for the book! In fact, he won the Oscar for best photography and several other Oscars. I think this film is brilliant - BRAVO for the writer and director, and the actors!
