Let me say that GRANNY has been extremely well done with the violence of horror and the suspenseful moves that are sure !!!!!! the best indie horror movie I've ever seen and that only lasts 58 minutes ... It's my 5 movie out of 20 favorite of all time. People should love this. I give him a 10 out of 10 !!!
