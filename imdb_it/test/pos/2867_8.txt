I loved it. <br /> <br /> The camera's corners are fantastic, it's not as nervous as a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Very funny. A lot of people were screaming on the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a great job with his various psychological emotions. It's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. <br /> <br /> Kane is far less frightening and more believable than most movie psychopaths. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations. There aren't many twists here, but it's clever and original in its own way. Good, creepy, B-movie slasher.
