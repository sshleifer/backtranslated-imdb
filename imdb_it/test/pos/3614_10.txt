A beautiful and sensitive film that brings home the uselessness and cruelty of wars, no matter what the so-called reasons are. The performances of Cage and Cruz have been quite impressive, but it is for the oldest Greek characters who have the highest praises. Irene Papas is gorgeous like never before! Although some scenes seem a little long at times, this film will be a strong Oscar competitor.
