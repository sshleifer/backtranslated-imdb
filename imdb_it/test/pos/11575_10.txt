"I fought with death, it is the most exciting challenge imaginable: it takes place in an impalpable dullness, with nothing underfoot, without anything around, without spectators, without fanfare, without glory, without the great desire for victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of lukewarm skepticism, without much confidence in yourself, and even less in that of your adversary. When it is the form of supreme wisdom, then life is an enigma greater than some of us think it is. "Marlow in" Heart of Darkness "by Joseph Conrad <br /> <br /> It is difficult to make the subject of death lyrical in any work of art. Yet the films have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living beings, and can be chosen rather than legislated. "Scelto" is Alejandro Amenabar's key word for Sea Inside, based on the true story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice dressed in love, poetry and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancerous professor says goodbye to friends and loves of a lifetime before he takes his life, then you're right. In fact, Sea is better because he spends the most intimate time with the protagonist before going, a remarkable feat with none of those moments in the less boring or uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and dominant voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of hard realist and poetic sophist. Belen Rueda plays the disabled lawyer Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover for Ramon, increasing in brightness while his life degenerates with the disease. Added to the already almost soap opera, Lola Duenas is Rosa, a visitor who initially tries to dissuade Ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romanticism of disability ?? This guy has an incredible fortune that attracts important women and can't move a finger. But we can talk, demonstrating the last argument about what women want: the love that speaks, not only makes. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from mentioning the great film coming out for an Oscar that presents euthanasia as its culmination to not spoil the experience for beginners. Sufficient is just to say that both films are successful in opening both sides of a controversial topic without forcing a specific point of view. The religious right has the right to complain that the previous film and the barbarian invasions celebrate suicide; he does not have the right to blame the Sea Inside beautifully balanced of the same. <br /> <br /> "A life in this condition has no dignity," says Ramon. The irony is that he behaves with supreme dignity that makes him doubt his determination to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is a formidable entry into the 2004 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Language Film.
