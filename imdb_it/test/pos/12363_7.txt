I just finished watching this movie for the first time, and I have to say I'm very impressed. <br /> <br /> How sad. As full of despair. How nightmare. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, in my mind there are several scenes ... the first appearance of the ghost carriage ... the soul of David Holm as he rises from his corpse ... his spirit on his knees, pleading. <br /> <br /> This film takes a simple story - that of the ghostly driver of the ghost carriage, destined to collect the souls of the dead for a year - brings it into the current context of the film and then uses flashbacks as a means of explaining like David Holm ends up in his difficult situation. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it published on DVD so they could see it more. Everyone should.
