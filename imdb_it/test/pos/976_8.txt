Can't understand why IMDb users will evaluate this movie 5.2 / 10? It's really great, very funny. I highly recommend this film for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! <br /> <br /> The story is about a 14-year-old boy who always tells lies, at home and at school. One day he did his homework to write a story of a thousand words. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it down and give it in 3 hours, or he should go to the Summer School. Yes, he wrote it in 2:45. "Big liar", I think it was a story of himself. On the way to school he hit a limousine from a famous Hollywood producer, and gave him a ride. But the boy has forgotten the story in the limousine. He told his parents and the teacher, but obviously they didn't believe him. And the film producer, took the child's story as his new movie, "Big Fat Liar". When the child saw the movie trailer, he told his parents that he had written it, but they didn't believe it. So, he and his friend had to go to LA to try something: the truth is never overrated <br /> <br /> Enjoy this beautiful film, you won't be disappointed. Don't trust the 5.2 / 10 speed, it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: sorry, my english is not good enough to make a better comment!
