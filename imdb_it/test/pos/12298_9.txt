When Melville's "Pierre or Le ambiguity" hit the bookstores in 1852, his first "Moby Dick" publication a year earlier, the public response was similar to that found in IMDB's "POLA X" reviews. The newspapers have even published titles such as: "Melville Insane!" which, of course, was not. But when we compare the writing styles found in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre", we find in the latter a clear detachment from the simple and often declamatory style found in the first. Clearly, he was imitating the overly florid style of Victorian novels, now forgotten, which easily made his immortal "Moby Dick" easier. He was not happy, however, to realize the kind of product his publishers wanted, and that he would surely sell. His version of a Victorian love story was a bit twisted, cynical, perhaps, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternative title: "The ambiguities" is quite appropriate. While Pierre tries, and thinks to find, the truth, we become increasingly uncertain about what and who to believe. As he seeks happiness, he becomes increasingly sad. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or almost modern France. Even if, in some way, it leaves little room for the imagination and shows us graphically the incestuous relations to which Melville could only hint, the ambiguities that make the novel and its message so attractive are perfectly intact. The questions he poses are those that few films have thought to ask, yet the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend a reading of the novel, which is much shorter than "Moby Dick", first see this movie. I hope more people will discover this tempting movie.
