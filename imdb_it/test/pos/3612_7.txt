Here is a story of war well done, well shot and well acted. The portrait of the Italian and German occupation of the Greek island of Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt as the father of Pelagia and the doctor of the island is superb, Nicolas Cage does a good job as captain of the title, Penelope Cruz does a good job of beauty and beating Cage. There is heroism and humor, there is drama and romance, and it is set on an idyllic island. <br /> Strangely, a very similar plot, or I should say almost identical, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel of the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of the beautiful Pelagia, daughter of doctor Iannis, and their life in Kefalonia during the Second World War. Pelagia's girlfriend, the local fisherman Mandras, enlisted when the Italian army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses. When the Axis finally prevails, with great help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays an important role in maintaining the occupation in a peaceful time. While Mandras joins the partisans, the charming Corelli and his mandolin are quartered by the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a story of communist revolt in post-war Greece, a portrait of Mussolini's madness and, above all, an ode to life on the island of Kefalonia. <br /> <br /> Some of these elements return to the film, but in general, it is a book that is impossible to film. I'm glad no one ever tried it. <br /> <br /> The film "Captain Corelli's Mandolin", however, is worth seeing. Make sure you read the book * after * you see the movie.
