Having graduated in Western history when I was a college student, seeing the opinions on the Second World War are quite uncomfortable and altogether completely wrong. World War II was the bloodiest story that ever took place in world history. While the Axis Powers have led many crimes against humanity that is still the vision today and many correct forget that not all German soldiers were out to exterminate the Jewish population, not all Japanese soldiers turned a samurai sword and have flew kamikaze missions, and not every Italian soldier was a fascist. Most of these Axis soldiers were normal people like you and I had a terrible conflict and I happened to fight for a country they loved. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Stalingrad was undoubtedly the most lethal battle in the history of the world with over 1,500,000 losses suffered during the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its commander, Lieutenant von Witzland, while they are reassigned to the eastern front to fight the Soviets in Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as a sort of main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all normal men and seem completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very sad when it comes to his portrait of fighting and the life of a soldier during the battle. We are shown numerous macabre battles and intense violence outside of battles (including a sequence of firing squads). Altogether the battles are the first examples I know that portray the loss of the limbs and in general the sequences of death and the violence in the face. Much of the inspiration for the save battle sequences of Private Ryan seems to come from this movie. <br /> <br /> The film does not aim to make the German completely innocent of everything in the film. Many of the high-ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are used to, evil. Most soldiers are just ordinary people who often talk about home. The film makes it quite clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and the army were completely unaware that the genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers of the German army were simply fighting for a cause that they did not understand and wanted only to go home rather than freeze to negative temperatures in Russia. <br /> <br /> the film really shows how hellish the war is, especially the second world war. The battle scenes will strike you with its gritty realism and the plot is easy enough to follow while you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war movies, don't expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a depressed state of mind only from seeing the life that most of the Eastern Front soldiers have faced. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
