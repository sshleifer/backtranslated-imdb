I just saw this with my three children - 12 years old (boy), 10 years old (boy) and 8 years old (girl) and this film was a good old family adventure. Although decidedly aimed at the children's market (I would say 5 to 13 years) it was certainly watchable and, as a parent, it is a pleasure to find a film that caters for a wide range of ages, while remaining suitable for the whole family to watch - especially younger children. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a little nerd with a vivid imagination (this can certainly be seen in his open-eyed sequences) that foils a kidnapping and the most important art theft while he is on a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is an airplane mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft, but is also a top-gun on his computer's flight simulator. This is useful when the pilot and co-pilot are out due to a series of mishaps and there is no one left to fly on the plane. I don't want to give the plot any more.
