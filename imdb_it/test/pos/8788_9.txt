The Saboteur by Alfred Hitchcock is not one of his most viewed films; made between two images much more popular and critically praised, Suspect and Shadow of a doubt, it is generally considered as a minor effort. I agree that the next film is innovative, drawing Hitchcock entirely in the American mainstream for the first time, but Saboteur is at least as lively as Suspicion; its main flaw is its less charismatic protagonist, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> To Saboteur we find Hitchcock making his way around America, literally, as his main character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist whose crime he was accused of. Cummings is very young here, and quite engaging. His childhood (but not immaturity) fits perfectly with the character he plays, and it seems appropriate, since the director, although middle-aged, was reinventing himself, and an older and more established star could have thrown away the things. The bubbly heroine of Priscilla Lane, which was not typical of the director, was a very common type in American films of the time; and she and Cummings offer an openness and youth that the director needed both of his life and his work at the time. I can't imagine older, more solid types, - Cooper and Stanwyck for example - doing better, as they would, carried, too much, too much luggage between them. <br /> <br /> As is the norm in Hitchcock's films, nothing is as it seems. Where Saboteur stands out from his best known films is that the public is ahead of the game. Although Cummings is an incendiary defendant, we know he is innocent. The bad guys become obvious soon enough; and the film depends more on the plot than on the ironies. The pleasures that are there are incidental, and here the Master does not disappoint. There is an interesting interlude by Tod Browning with some circus fanatics, who help Cummings evade capture. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Frankenstein Bride, Cummings spends some time in a blind man's house, which, apparently, is Lane's uncle. Was the director studying American key films of the previous decade? In any case, these and other unusual and discursive aspects of the film give it a playfulness and variety, which, when adding the pretty young lead factor, make the image look like the work of a younger man, still learning the his job. <br /> <br /> The subsequent scenes in the film, in New York, are more suspicious and typical of the director, as the image gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it moves. In the end I find it a satisfying job; and since neither Cummings nor Lane have a dark side as an actor, not even the film has one. It is deliberately light and suspect semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could pull out, in an American environment, the kind of story he had done so well in England. He succeeded very well. The next logical step: Shadow Of a Doubt, a film in which the main character travels from east to west and with a set of completely different values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
