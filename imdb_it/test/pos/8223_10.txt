The Regard of Flight and the Clown Bagatelles interpreted by Bill Irwin are some of the most amusing (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) that I have ever seen. My father recorded this special when it first aired in the 1980s and since then my family has loved it. We quote it back and forth quite constantly. It is a shame that the copies are not readily available for purchase. I have a bad VHS copy that I acquired from a specialist distributor a few years ago, but Mr. Irwin's performance deserves proper DVD treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with artists / producers, as well as other examples of modern clowning . <br /> <br /> Bill Irwin's talent deserves more visibility for the mainstream public than it has enjoyed in its limited-appearances. I share "The Regard of Flight" with friends quite often and although I am always greeted with a bit of skepticism when I say that it is a mixture of clowns and vaudeville that I still have to have someone who does not realize that he is not seen without loving him. In the event that the powers that could ever happen on this IMDb announcement, please consider releasing this and other works by Bill Irwin.
