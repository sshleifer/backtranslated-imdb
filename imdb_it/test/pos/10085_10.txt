This is one of the best movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> It's so full of details and every time you see it you'll find new things ... As if the father was in the shower but still feels just a voice, and when girls play the flute, they can't do it at the same time because then there would be two girls, and there are none. <br /> <br /> I have some problems discovering, in the middle of the film, that their "uncles" are visiting them, but why does his wife freak out?!? Otherwise a fantastic film. !!! The best Asian film ever. <br /> <br /> I hope people like it. There have been so many movies, in which the protagonist is skit-so (The machinist, Secret Window and so on), but this film is much better than them !!!
