I am a First Class Petty Officer (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this film strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were unlikely. The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) stepped inside the sinking ship to drag the ship's captain out of the engine room ... it would never have happened. Swimmers are not allowed to enter any boat, regardless of the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (presumably in Kodiak), looked more like a NASA command center ... we don't have any hi-tech equipment. Thirdly, the Captain of the Airstation will not handle search and rescue cases with about 10 people on watch. Actually it would be an E-6 or E-7 as a SAR controller and maybe another 2 support staff members like an assistance SAR controller and a radio watchstander. Otherwise the film was dead, I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates into the CG and their search and rescue roles instead of just Aviation based rates. Some scenes from the "A" school reminded me of my days and their nonsense and I had problems in my younger days.
