I like going around a museum. You can appreciate the great talent of the main composer, Michael Cimino and this fabulous desinger art of light ..Vilmos Zsigmond. As I said, I am like being in paradise discovering all the creation that this man can apply to a single frame. Imagine when you can look at a moving picture of this artist. I can say: this film is one of the best.
