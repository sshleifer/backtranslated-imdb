Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by the crazy Robert Ryan in "Beware, My Lovely", a 1952 film by RKO. Lupino and Ryan have made three films together and have worked well as a team, both being experienced professionals and strong performers. In this film, based on a Broadway play called "The Man", Lupino is a widow of the First World War who rents a room in her home. She is very active and well-liked in her community and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to move forward. The man who rents his room goes on vacation, and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her do heavy cleaning at home. She is friendly enough to start, but then terrifies her, locks her in the house and does not allow her to answer the phone or door, while becoming violent and no longer in touch with reality. <br /> <br /> The character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of the film that escapes when he discovers a corpse in another house where he is working. It is not clear whether he is the killer or not, since he seems surprised to see the body. It could be a double personality, as when his personality becomes ugly towards Lupino, he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out. He doesn't know he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket and he doesn't know why he has tickets for a party he bought from children who came to the door. <br /> <br /> "Attention, My Lovely," is a film full of suspense, and the two leads give exceptional performances. The tension increases to a very high level and ends in a way you don't expect.
