Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn: fast, noisy and moody. Despite my initial fears, Kris K carries his part quite well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. A lot of blood, steel, silver, fire and exploding bodies provide a pleasant 110-minute distraction. If you like the black Matrix look, then you'll like Blade, Blade even has a "dodge bullets" sequence.
