There was much of Little Vera that was strange to me. All in all I liked this movie, but the way the characters behaved was not what I was used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they drank, fought or screamed and it was often a combination of the three. After watching the movie I felt tense because of all the clashes that took place during the film. I was still very interested to see the story if this middle class Russian family. Throughout the film we are reminded of the industrialized state of Russia because of the repeated blows of a train passing through the screen. He gave the viewer the sense of a life lived mechanically. The characters seemed focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. There was no feeling of happiness for the whole film. The only time a character wasn't screaming was when Vera fell in love for her boyfriend Sergei for the first time. This was very short because the viewer later discovers (after Sergei has locked Vera's father in a bathroom and Vera lets him out, after which the father proceeds to stab Sergei) who is violent. Another time Vera is informed that the only reason she was born is that the family could have a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to observe how both Vera and the family are able to cope with the behavior of the other. The film was certainly worthy of being seen for its representation of what life in the areas of Russia might be.
