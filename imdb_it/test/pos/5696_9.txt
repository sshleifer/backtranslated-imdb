While many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic, I really connected. There is no plot as such, rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped on a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water below them. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the acting was mostly very good, although the roles were quite challenging at times, and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was quite terrifying and I felt really nervous for them. I found the entire film rather unnerving because of the total helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival. <br /> <br /> The crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film, and believe me, I saw my fair share of crocodile film. The creature moved well and had a real threat and, although the audience I was with didn't seem too enthusiastic about the film as a whole, it still jumped and panted every time the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> Script-wise, I would have made some changes, especially towards the end, but this was not a big problem. For fans of slow-burning survival horror set in the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately I think that for many viewers looking for a thrill and higher production values ​​from their cinematic experience the point will simply be lost.
