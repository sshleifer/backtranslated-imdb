In the credits of "Shadows", after reading "directed by John Cassavetes", you can see some white letters on the screen: "The movie you just saw is improvised", they say. I always look for the fact that words have been so important in movies since the directors started using them because, basically, there is no film without a script and many other reasons. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and believed in the freedom of words; "Shadows" is the perfect example. It is a film without real main characters, without real plot lines; they are mostly people in different situations, talking. Yes, some of the situations are connected but Cassavetes, apparently always in a hurry to talk, uses a fast-forwarding technique when the characters go somewhere or run away from someone and aren't talking. <br /> <br /> Appearances are everything in this film. For example, there is a brilliant soundtrack, full of jazz influences and lots of fantastic solos, and there is a character who claims to be a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the names of the characters are the same names of the actors). However, we never see him playing the trumpet or playing with a band; he doesn't even talk about music and he only wanders around with his friends around the city. They talk, a lot, and everything they have in mind; going from how intelligent each of them is to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture. <br /> <br /> "Shadows" is fun in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not educated. The only important female character in the film (Lelia), however, wants to be an intellectual. But again, he has a very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book he is trying to write and how to face reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. At that same party, a woman is actually making an intellectual declaration, full of complexity, and asks a boy next to her: "Do you agree?" "Yes," he says, but you can tell he doesn't know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, a singer (Hugh), talks about his glory days on occasions, and we see him perform only once; but no reference to the music industry there. The focus of Cassavetes is the relationship of the singer with his manager (Rupert), who for the most part of the time provides chat about trivial things and not real "musical" interviews. The important thing about the trumpet player in "Shadows" is the time he spends with his friends; the girl of the intelligent aspirant is her way of managing romantic relationships (one of the strengths of the film) and the singer is the link with her manager ?? Appearances. <br /> <br /> The reason why interpretations are not important in this film is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, without caring if they were actually good. I think some of them are not, but surely they know how to improvise in a scene, and you can see how well they do it. "Shadows" is not about artists; speaks of a way of making films, based on the magic of conversation; and there you could say that the performances mean something. <br /> <br /> That's why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker, constantly in the eyes of every character, constantly searching for expressions that come with natural language. There is a scene where the trumpeter and his friends are trying to catch some girls. They are three, so each of them sits next to a girl (the girls are three two) at three different tables. They all talk at the same time and the camera shoots across the table, and sometimes friends look at each other while they say what they are saying? It's natural.
