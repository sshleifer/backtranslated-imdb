I love this movie. At the beginning I didn't expect much from this film since I didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed that it had gone on video shortly after having just opened it in theaters. Also, I didn't think David and Minnie could make a good pair on the screen. (I've been expecting a lot from on-screen couples since I saw "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should have played Minnie and vice versa. I don't know, I just think that Joely should have stayed in the movie longer with David. They seemed perfect for each other. But it's just the figure that in a movie, the girl next door always takes it. :) (As in "While you were sleeping"). I was very wrong. This movie was awesome !!! Everything has been done brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt did a great job of directing. The lines were perfect with clever cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** ATTENTION: SPOILERS AHEAD !!! *** <br /> <br /> I like how everything intertwines with each other. For example, at the beginning, Elizabeth and Bob were talking about going to Italy, and in the end, Bob meets Grace in Italy. Sydney (the monkey) who stands with Grace as she did with Elizabeth is an example. <br /> <br /> *** NOTICE: SPOILERS END NOW !!! *** <br /> <br /> Something I didn't like about the movie was a bit unrealistic. Well, I don't think a man can outdo his wife in a year when she was the only woman who ever lived in his whole life. You'd think he'd be isolated from the world for years before he left his house to talk to someone. Instead, a year later he goes on a blind date and falls * instantly * in love with a woman he has never seen in his life, but feels a connection with. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a great movie. It made me cry two or three times, and made me laugh endlessly (the scene in the restaurant with Bob's delicate date for bottled water was hilarious!). It's definitely up there with great romantic comedies like "You've Got Mail", "Sliding Doors" and "While You Were Sleeping". <br /> <br /> COME NOW TODAY !!
