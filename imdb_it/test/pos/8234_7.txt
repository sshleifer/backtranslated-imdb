Note the release date of August 8, 1945, about a week before Japan surrendered in World War II, so there will probably be a message for us in "Beyond 21". Irene Dunne (It happened one night, the 1939 version of Love Affair) is Paula Wharton, who goes to live in a military base while her newspaper publisher's husband is in a training school. Alexander Knox (the longest day) is his hubby Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, Gentlemen prefer Blondes) as the suffocating head of newspapers, in charge. He also looks for Cora Witherspoon as Mrs. Gates, from The Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. War history written for the point of view of wives, which was not too common in those days. funny comment on the squalid condition of "married houses"; Irene's wardrobe in this film was not at all shabby ... since they never had to leave their house, it seems that the entire budget of the film was spent on her always exquisite clothes and hats.
