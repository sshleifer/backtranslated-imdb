I have always been fascinated by ninjistsu, who would know that it will go much further. In "Ninja III", it's creepy and intriguing fun. A ninja is hit by the police and uses his spirit to take revenge. The victim, an adorable young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). He falls in love with the policeman who was involved in the shooting. The love scene that the V8 pours onto his body threw me out! The death of the ninja attracts the attention of another in Japan called Yamada (Sho Kosugi) who comes to America not only to save Christie, but to put the ninja back in the grave. Simply because he put Yamada's left eye with a shuriken (star-throwing). The fighting scenes were excellent. I liked the part where the plywood falls on Yamada, and breaks it with his foot. And when he was captured, he tells the officer that Christie was involved and that everything will be fine. Rule of thumb: never underestimate a ninja. He pulled out the other cops without killing them. And he did his thing without worries. Of course, Chirstie did his best to try to put the ninja in his place to use it as a tool of revenge. It was a good movie, great for martial arts fans. 3 out of 5 stars!
