I remember this film, it was the first film I had seen in the cinema, the image was dark in places where I was very nervous, it was 74/75 and my father took my brother and my sister to the Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire, in England. I remember the tigers and the large amount of snow in the film, even the appearance of the Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery I think one of the tigers is hit and he will die. If anyone knows where to find it on DVD, please let me know. The cinema has now been turned into a fitness club which is a real shame because the nearest cinema is 20 miles away, I would love to hear who has seen this movie or any other similar one.
