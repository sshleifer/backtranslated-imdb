This film seemed very faithful to life. I liked the ending that seemed to work out naturally without big moments but with many small moments coming together. It could be said that it is an honest love story. No matter what the "sexual orientation" of the main characters is, it is still a story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes that involved the family. The setting is during what for some people is a very stressful time. That is to say "the holidays". Christmas to be precise. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, this addresses issues of love, adaptation, expectations and prejudices that cannot be overcome. In the end, Alexandra and Casey make a choice for each other, knowing that love is difficult and giving. Very well.
