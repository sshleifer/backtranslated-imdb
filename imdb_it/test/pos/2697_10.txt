I haven't seen a better play than the King of Queens for many years. I consider it one of the best ever. I just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a bizarre trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed and later asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thanks AA. The acting of the whole team is first-rate and in particular by Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but the acting is superb from all the casts. I love all the cast, they are so funny. In the King of Queens there is a difficult side that I love and is rarely seen in today's television comedy. Both Leah and Kevin enjoy each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously fun. I just bought the second season while I was at Az this week and I intend to buy the complete set the next time I'm in the United States. Even my son, who is 20 years old, loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic of reaching different generations. I would like to thank everyone involved in this fantastic show - it is so appreciated to see this kind of TV show in what I think is an era of poor TV in general these days with the exception of Seinfeld and similar replicas. .. Thanks for a great show ..
