The problem with today's TV is that people have been ruined by "lite" television viewing. This type of television show is the equivalent of the music of lifts or "easy listening" jazz. The typical idea of ​​"continuity" spectators is to remember who was eliminated from the island last week and wonders who will be next. Show them a program like Surface, Firefly, Dr. Who, or anything with a storyline of more than three episodes and ... well, they'll just go back to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of sheep watching TV don't want to curl up. They want excuses for not thinking. They want to make sure the "boob tube" lives up to its name ... and they don't want shows that they try and go to another location. For this reason, Surface and many other high quality shows that should last much longer have achieved the ax. <br /> <br /> Viewers do not want stories, or morals, or philosophy, or anything more than a third level of vocabulary. They want people who eat earthworms, or "real" series that are too dramatized (nothing of the sort! You can't observe something without changing the nature of what you observe) or hormonal shows that involve groups of people who have meetings and then boast to them friends. <br /> <br /> Today's television is nothing more than a desolate land, and the few diamonds you can collect from the dust are just busted because no one even knows what a diamond is. Surface was one of those diamonds.
