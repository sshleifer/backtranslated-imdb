This film is almost as good as the first Jackass, but with a few more disgusting skits. I wouldn't say this was as good as the first, but it came very close. Jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you don't like the first movie, they will hate it. There are scenes that will be seen as classic Jackass (the old suits with "additions", the "taxi ride" and many others) and the ones you wish you had never seen (eating crap, drinking sperm, etc ... Overall This movie was a good watch and I'm glad I saw it, I'm sure this movie won't have the best rating because of the critics who rate it (I sat in the press section and most of the older viewers looked disgusted), but don't let this stop you from having fun.
