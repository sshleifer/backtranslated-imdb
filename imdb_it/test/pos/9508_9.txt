This review contains MILO SPOILERS, but not enough to ruin the story ... <br /> <br /> Watched Nihon Chinbotsu (Sinking of Japan or Japan sinks, depending on where you live) recently, a remake of the film of the years 70's of the same name, which was based on the best-selling novel by Sakyo Komatsu. This film is a jewel of Japanese cinema. It seems that Japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west. The Americans predict what will happen in the 40-year period, but according to Dr. Takokoro (an apparently "crazy" scientist), will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not convinced, but creates a disaster evacuation plan and forms a new D1 team to manage the crisis. During a trip to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese prime minister was killed and sent the government into a state of panic. The D1 team is left to handle most of the issues, and led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (ex-wife of Dr.Tadokoro). Instead, he turns to Dr.Tadokoro for advice, and intends to explode enormously under huge holes beneath Japan to ward off the sinking process. <br /> <br /> Japan will soon have to negotiate with various countries and persuade them to adopt Japanese refugees. Soon, it seems that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese into their country and the chaos that it follows (if it ever happens, touch-wood, I hope that Misaki is safe ... she can always be in my place ... hee hee). The evacuation scenes are really well done, demonstrating the chaos, suffering and despair that civilians must face in such disastrous times. And the multiple faces of human beings emerge, arrogance, selfishness, corruption, courage, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> This is a really well made film. storytelling is solid, with a captivating storyline and wonderful acting. Dr.Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) did very well, playing a divorced and often crazy scientist who kicks and wets things. His frustration and concern were very visible and this is really a good thing. Even Reiko (played by the beautiful Shibasaki Kou) has been played pretty well, and has the most memorable line in the whole movie (watch it to find out) and I imagine she has a beautiful acting voice. He interprets the love interest of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi from SMAP). Oh, I almost forgot ... she has really long hair indeed ~ And there is also a subtle but basic love story, which is well written and if there is something that the Japanese do really well, they are stories of 'love ... <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur and, if you are interested in geography, you will have a great time (I know I did ... . hehe). I see that they have done everything to make the theory of this film credible, and the first graphical visualizations and explanations have been done quite well (although you'll have to excuse the famous Japanese "Engrish". <br /> <br /> OK, now on the effects (it's all about the effects, isn't it?) After seeing the film with pure fear, I have to say that this film has special effects that are on par (or even better) with some Hollywood Volcanic eruptions ... massive earthquakes ... destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... all done beautifully. The opening scene is so beautiful, the 1st earthquake takes you by surprise, the mountains fall, the destruction due to the volcanic eruptions make you shiver ... seeing Mount Fuji warming up is a wonder ... then you see Shibuya falling to the ground ... it's so sad !!! However, what I felt was one of the best scenes were the gigantic scene tsunami, which sees the rescue operations fail people left without a place to run and without hope of resisting ... the final scene also deserves a mention ... wonderful stuff. If you like the effects, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh ya ... every good movie has a great song behind it. The "Keep Holding U" which really creates the super-cute and adorable SunMin is a duet with Kubota and is simply adorable. I feel that it fits the film very well and shows that no matter what disasters hit us, our love and strength would keep us up. The scenes of the disaster are managed with orchestral music and sometimes silence (a Japanese specialty) and really give a sense of chaos to the destruction on the screen. Oh, and did I say that a screen is really, really, really WIDE? Okla, I'm going on and on about this movie. Yes, I liked it, and hoping to look again ... It has holes in the plot, but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really well done. I'd give a 9 out of 10. I'm happy to say that the most expensive movie in Japanese history is also one of the best. If you haven't looked at it, you really should today ... it's a MUST WATCH!
