I saw this film a few years ago and promptly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent. Bacharach's music is captivating and should receive the recognition he fully deserves. Cinematography is fantastic. Critics hated him, but they also hated SOLO HOUSE. I didn't find it on video, but welcome anyone who can find a copy.
