This image is an interesting saga of the pioneer struggle led by Daniel Boone in the wild nature of the Cumberland Gap while being threatened by hostile Indians. A French traitor is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers just want to build houses and live in peace. The film has a certain charm because it is not a refined production, but there are good action scenes, even if a little violent for its time. The cast is made up of B actors, but they're all good, especially Lon Chaney as an Indian chief. Bruce Bennett is okay as Boone but he's a little too clean and talked to be credible as a frontier man. The dialogue is rather banal but the scenario lends itself to the realism of the Kentucky woods.
