This film is remarkable in the way it is insignificant. This is the true story of a woman and a man and their pursuit of happiness amidst the boring life of a housewife and a "housewife". It could be any couple, any family, in any city ... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it ... and what more could a movie ask for, really? Especially a documentary. This is an excellent film and one that I highly recommend to all those who love documentaries, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, soul searching, desire, wandering through life and finding the road, or not.
