I saw this movie as a child and I loved it. I loved how spunky Nikki is and full of energy, and how he mostly spoils Louden's perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him into his crazy ways. As a child, in the 1980s, I saw New York in exactly the way it was portrayed in this film, the domain of the character of Madonna, with wild animals running rampant and horrible bald men chasing people and causing chaos. Now as an adult I find that I love the movie for the same reasons, and even more for the intertwined romance of Madame Nikki Finn's madmen. Although I would very much like to go anywhere and find an internal atrium like in this film. Pure beauty and genius.
