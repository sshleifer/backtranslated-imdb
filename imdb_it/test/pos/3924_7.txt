OK, maybe it doesn't deserve an Oscar. Or a Golden Globe. Or any prize, for that matter. The acting is not exceptional, there is no reason to give direct credits, and in reality it is just another semi-cheery 21st century slash film that most people will simply consider decent. Or maybe even terrible. But in my opinion, this does not matter. And that's because I really enjoyed watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the first 40 minutes are quite slow, but as the movie progresses, you'll like something, if you're like me, and everyone else should be when you watch this movie. And that is: looking for 2 hours of fun, brainless violence. (And an end to the ass, which I won't ruin.) Yes, there are many flaws in this film, but don't let the cast list on the cover fool you. Hilton offers decent performance that no one has seen coming. Even his greatest enemies like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us enormously with her barely credible acting skills and a striptease that wasn't as bad as anything that an online pop-up he would have promised, but still not so unbearable to go fast or turn off the DVD. <br /> <br /> Violence in this surprised me; no one at school or on the horror board talked about it as if it were "these new films called 'Saw' and 'Hostel'" but I could easily say that "Wax" was more graphic than Saw, and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I am not surprised that House of Wax has not made a place in IMDb's Top 250, but it is certainly worth a look.
