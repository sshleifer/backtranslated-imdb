What impressed me most about "One True Thing" was the way it was the first time that her daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the film. As depressing as the topic was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blinded by the revelation of a 2/3 character's fatal illness in the film ("Love Story" "Terms of Tenderness", etc.). <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt give very strong performances that do not go beyond the limit. The characters they play look human; they are not perfect people. (Probably, you can't say that for the character of "Martha Stewart" Streep you act, but throughout the film, I found your noble character in a non-mushy way. It has to do with your drama in the best way you know . <br /> <br /> "One True Thing" is an attentive and insensitive family drama in which tears have eventually been well deserved.
