... means "take and read", which is exactly what I felt like doing after seeing this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this stunning and superbly executed adaptation of 1995 Tobias Wolff's New Yorker article of the same name. Tom Noonan's incredible performance is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and direction are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, intelligent and make the film cinematically more dynamic. The lyric rhythm is fascinating and begs you to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Watch out for this young director ... he's going to places.
