I observed Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin very witty and the repertoire between them very good. But lately it's starting to lose weight due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, which shows 5 video clips that are on a site like Youtube, which are generally fun, or people who are inadvertently injured (some intentionally). Umm, this one, when looked at 4 to 5 times a week always shows the same things, I haven't seen anything so beautiful and I can only laugh at people who probably break their necks and are paralyzed so many times. The show is like a Late Show you want to be / Colbert Report you want to be with his politics too, if you don't live in a blue state and you're not an automatic liberal, this humor gets old too, McCain is old, yes yes, whatever thing. Libs don't have the courage to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that they would let themselves have a sense of humor to be able to laugh at themselves, so it's almost in every show McCain or Palin, sheesh. So we get the same old videos of people getting hurt that we should keep laughing and then some leftist political humor that never laughs at himself from his own weakness. I will continue to watch from when I look at work and that's it, I hope to have fun, but it's getting a little old. However, I liked the hosts of Chris and Alison, they were actually a good change of pace; maybe this show could do a rotating guest thing. Olivia, who at the beginning I thought was really funny, resorted to this constant sullen response and is getting old, lol. 7 of 10; will keep you in a young mindset that is good if you are a younger Baby Boomer like me (mid 40s). Perhaps a cartoon of the day would be another segment that they should do, there is a lot of stuff available that they could use.
