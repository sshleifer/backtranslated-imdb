Being a middle-aged mother myself, I greatly appreciated seeing a relationship between adults that is intertwined in the many issues that influence us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane portrays Adrienne beautifully and the sacrifice and conflict a mother goes through, wishing to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he always does a good job with the guy who is a bit of a jerk, but learns something about himself. <br /> <br /> Criticism of their as unrealistic romance is hardly justified compared to most other romantic films. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love riding Australia, barely a conversation between them, her high romanticism considered. We get a lot more here with Rodanthe. She redeems him. He frees her. It's beautiful. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, the fans in a flame of passion. How long it takes is irrelevant. Perhaps the film was a bit too subtle in the sense that it was the letters that shared the following year that deepened their relationship, once again life lived honestly to get to know a person. <br /> <br /> As much as I liked the plot and themes, the dialogue was not consistent in terms of quality. Some lines sounded so real, and other lines were embarrassingly trivial and flat. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed relations with Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> This is not a carefree romantic comedy fun, plus a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a fabulous work of art. Look for the wood bench on the porch in the first overview over the house, very beautiful. I also liked the music and the landscape, which combined to create the effect of the place as the third main character. It was this place far from their normal life that allowed them to see themselves and the other in a different light. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry, take out the Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
