This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) He plays the twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you the slightest idea who did it! Peter Falk is fit as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote "Murder by the Book", my second favorite episode). The supporting cast is fantastic, especially Julie Newmar (very undervalued) and Jeanette Nolan as house keeper that Columbo continues to upset. The surname of Martin Landau's characters in this is "Paris". That was the last name of Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a joke by Steven Bochco?
