I provided location services on this film every Sunday we were shooting at Berkeley Square in London. David Niven always the gentleman really appreciated the role, unfortunately for being his last. we had a moment of panic when a load of fake Krugerrands (cast for the film ..) dropped some rainwater. <br /> <br /> Imagine a frantic crew that opens all the drains to recover every last one. If you know and love London, you will love this play - Richard Jordan also begins who died of a brain tumor. A good movie, great crew, superb cast. look for the current stars of the coronation road, then play crowd scenes or extras. Ivan's car lot and commercial businesses were shot west of London, Chiswick's entire shopping parade and the batch of American used cars were dressed overnight, the car lot is still there as they are shops. A restaurant was suddenly turned into a funeral home. If you see the film on the lists, make an effort to see it! By the way, Sally Harrison, the bank's receptionist, was married to production designer Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> April 2007 I thought of adding a few more comments about the locations: <br /> <br /> Pub: just outside Berkeley Square Elke Sommers Cottage: behind Road along Twickenham Film Studios Ivans Used Car Lot: along Chiswick High Street and all the shops near the roundabout. Workshop (conversion of armored vans) Factory on the rotunda in front of Fullers Brewery prison (see workshops above) Telephone booth see Elke Sommers cottage (it was the wooden box used in many films, look for the gound level lighting cable and wooden hinges on the door !!! Honeywells computer room near Olympia Graveyard - Chiswick - Grave just outside the common land Interior of banks, empty ceiling and strong room: Twickenham studios <br /> <br /> E just to add the gentleman to David Niven, joked and mixed with the crew, the extras and so on ...... Niven dined at the Connaught hotel and joined the crew for a coffee!
