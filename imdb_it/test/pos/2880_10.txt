The problem with other actors in the role of Dorian Gray is that they seemed too old for the part (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or that they were unable to pull off the aristocratic English manner without being rigged. Dorian is the perpetual nineteen (or so), all milky skin and locks of honey, as described by Wilde, so the challenge is to find an actor who has the maturity and range for the part (ie, who can portray ingenuity, insensitivity and manipulation), but at the same time it looks like someone in his late teens. And Peter Firth brings out everything in this excellent British television adaptation. Gielgud in the role of Henry Wotton, although considerably older than what Wilde had in mind, does miracles with his scenes - Wilde's aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was quite weak by comparison (and his costume wasn't right). <br /> <br /> Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basilio as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, yet a suitable interpretation. In general, the film includes enough gay subtexts without making the same Dorian gay - it's all for all people and presumably there is no drug or sexual perversion that he hasn't experienced in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes him more narcissistic homosexual. It seems equally devastating both sexes here, as it should, according to the novel. <br /> <br /> Obviously the budget of this production was not very big, so everything seems a little swampy. In particular, Dorian's meeting with Sibilla's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. Furthermore, Dorian's final blow (a puppet I suppose) in his white toad trick is more exhilarating than convincing and Basil's death scene is inadvertently funny. (Also, as far as I remember, Basil should have been killed sitting at the table.) <br /> <br /> But all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so much sex scenes, but Wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious fabrics and precious gems is not really explored here, that is, aestheticism is completely missing. But like "I, Claudius", the excellent acting makes it easy to forget these deficiencies in production values.
