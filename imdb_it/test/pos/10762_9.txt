A brilliant and sensitive film with intertwined lines. As a general warning, the film becomes rather dark halfway. However sudden, this is a change that I found suitable for the themes of the film, in particular the confrontation between Ishkanani and the rich crap, and (as Finn says in the end) how each person composes the tribe and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this film. It is probably better known as Chekov than Star Trek or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but it was in a myriad of movies that you probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, which is another brilliant performance by Yelchin, House of D, Hearts in Atlantis, to name a few ...) The point is that this guy really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other excellent performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what make this film first-rate, from great to excellent.
