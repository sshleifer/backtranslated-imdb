Hell to pay is a bit damn for my taste, even if it's not worse than many movies. However, I liked the show of expert stars and the western landscape and all; but the plot was very weak and I couldn't really understand its meaning. However, the music that accompanies the film more than compensates for the dull film. <br /> <br /> Where do the boys Nate & Noah Cryns come from, who wrote this music? They are fantastic!! From the moment the music starts, it's far better than anything I've heard in years. I think it might be the best I've ever heard! Although I was not enthusiastic about the action that was taking place in the film, the music evoked the exact emotion needed for each scene. I was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and it seemed to me to relive those old times through music. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves a purchase and a vision for beautiful music and a journey into memory to once again see the old western stars.
