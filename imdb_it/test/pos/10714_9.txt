What can I say about Kramer against Kramer? On the surface it is rather simple, but below it deals with emotions greater than life itself. It offers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and worry about them. Many films fail in this, Kramer against Kramer is a success. I think everyone would agree that acting is superb. Once you look at Kramer against Kramer, for some time the acting in most other films begins to feel plastic and emotionless. The actors seem to get along with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There is a beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best interpretation of the film is from the young Justin Henry. It's unlike any other child actor I've ever seen. It's incredibly natural. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there is a kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman offers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the associated feelings are the complicated part of it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're definitely missing out! Watch it now!
