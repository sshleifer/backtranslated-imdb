Ok, it's too long and he's too satisfied with himself. However, "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating film. Chaplin does a magnificent job satirizing Hitler and trying to portray Jewish oppression in Nazi Germany (this was before the concentration camps were in the public domain). Not a Chaplin masterpiece, but it's still worth seeing. <br /> <br />
