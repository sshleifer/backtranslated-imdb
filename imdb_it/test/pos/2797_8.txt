As a European, the film is a nice return to my time as a student in the 1980s and to the experiences I experienced abroad and to interaction with other nationalities, even if the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982 to 1985, so one might think he is tracing this experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film balances the message that "one should not generalize" with the notion that "for every stereotype there is an underlying truth". For example, the Italian character is based more on the appearance of the pothead than on any known Italian stereotype. The German character presents some of the most tried and tested stereotypes. But the most stereotyped aspect of the film is not a character but the central theme of infidelity. As noted by a critic, infidelity is crucial for French cinema, as is the class for the British film. <br /> <br /> Both the main character and his girlfriend are interpreted as not entirely likable, which I think is deliberate and grandiose. <br /> <br /> It may not be intentional, but some citizens have elements that could be interpreted as a metaphor for the perceived role of their countries in the EU. The English woman has a history with an American (who is an entertainer - like a president of the United States in the 80s) while the French shows himself as the natural leader (when the landlord arrives). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as different as New York, it is surprising that we see only two non-white characters. One is a Chilean woman with indigenous characteristics, who despite being the age of our main character is not represented as a potential object of interest. Another is a Gambian-Spanish or rather Gambian-Catalan male who seems a little invented. <br /> <br /> One might ask why Klapisch chose the protagonists who came from long-standing EU member countries in Western Europe. While these nationalities reflect what he and I would meet as students in the 1980s, I believe that the exchange programs in contemporary Europe are much more diverse. The Erasmus program includes around 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not members of the EU. I understand, however, that the choice of nationalities that are most familiar to the majority of viewers may have been deemed necessary in order not to distract from the contrast that Klapisch wants to create between a Europe of peoples and bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> Despite some complaints, a great movie made me think of going back to Europe to live. A French friend of mine, also an expatriate in the United States, has captured our shared feelings in this contradiction: "If Europe were more like the United States, I would leave in the blink of an eye".
