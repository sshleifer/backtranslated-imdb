We need this kind of entertainment in our modern world. You can watch "Ma and Pa" with adults, with your family (children of any age or just you like me.) They are kind, but kind is so refreshing in a society of children who kill children, a horrible war, a adequate television in prime time and poverty, we don't even have a clue where all those kids came from! give me a modern plumbing and I will be happy to become a kettle. Humor does NOT require offensive language. It is difficult to follow conversations in shows where every other word is biped, relax, take off your shoes and climb on the recliner good glass of old-fashioned lemonade, and breathe simply by watching Ma sweeps the chickens off the table at lunchtime!
