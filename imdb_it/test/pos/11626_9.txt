Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) is apparently born to play the role of Philadelphia Gordon of Cato, in this story that is often compared to the classic American Civil War by Margaret Mitchell Gone With the Wind. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is undoubtedly his best role for his love interest, and the two protagonists lead a wonderful Australian cast in this, probably the best known and most loved Australian miniseries. It is <br /> <br /> an exceptional all-round production, even if you don't try to look at it all at once, and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrait of life in the Australian pre-Federation. Rating: 8/10
