Haggard: The Movie is the real life story of Ryan Dunn, and his girlfriend who cheated on him, even with the help of his two friends, 1. A skateboarder who lives for nothing, and, 2. An attempt-to -being a fun scientist (which doesn't really work) played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. <br /> <br /> The movie Haggard The Movie also has many Jackass characters, etc., but to say that it was written by Bam Margera and Co. this is a very weak attempt, it seems to me that it was written when he was bored, or as a project with which they didn't pay much attention. <br /> <br /> The films also play Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend who basically betrayed him, still a bad performance by Jennifer, another actor who could interest Steve aka Hellboy, played by RakeYohn, that his character does not seem to be with the story, again bad acting, this character also does not have many lines in this film that basically makes it very boring. but worst of all is the character of Raab, the voice sounds like a smoker who basically has throat cancer, he too I think could have been improved! Overall I think the characters in this film are not with the story, like in a scene, it would be on a certain character, a minute later, a different scene, a different character. <br /> <br /> To say that this should be a film, a sort of documentary, is not interpreted by the characters as a documentary, the acting makes you think that it is a cheap attempt to make a film with your free time. <br /> <br /> About the middle of the film we begin to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn, although much attention is paid to Bam and Brandon. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is OK, if you laugh at things that are not very funny, stupid stunts, terrible acting and occasional nude scenes !, Also I think there are too many scenes of just not speaking and just music! 7/10
