In the end I saw LAURE and I must say that I liked it anyway and was dismayed by that. The fantastic thing is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent, but with these films it doesn't really matter. The rhythm is languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot to offer. Unfortunately, some things also go against. The first thing is that the beautiful Annie Belle and the beautiful Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Since the two are playing a pair and are on the screen for almost the entire duration of the film, the lack of chemistry between the two is a certain responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they shot this film. They have certainly kept their attraction to each other to show on the screen. <br /> <br /> The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are simply ineffective or even ridiculous. There's a sex scene that stands out as one of the most foolish I've ever seen in a soft porn movie: our young blonde couple is shot by a helicopter pilot who appears to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to take his girlfriend (!) And they have an orgy in the helicopter, in midair. And Al Cliver is shooting all this with his 16mm camera! I'm not kidding. Ridiculous. We will see later that the 16 mm film is mounted on a slow motion. As the movie runs, Al and Annie start to come out. This scene is actually good, but the screen shots behind them were sometimes too much. Watching the video of the cross-dresser that lit up with his baby while he was piloting the helicopter almost made me roll on the floor laughing out loud. Should this be erotic or credible in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman who pleases a man in a drag, certainly when the man in drag makes a woman so ugly, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie had fun as well as the music throughout the scene. I just hope the movie on the editing screen wasn't so silly. <br /> <br /> Speaking of dragging, another boring plot point in LAURE that really drags the film to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married trio is an interesting idea but it is difficult to record it as hot or even interesting. The two women are boring and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Bear keeps his clothes for almost the whole movie, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another small complaint about LAURE: there is nudity, but it is not as much as the other films of the same era. He just needed more skin to punch him. <br /> <br /> With the exception of those small complaints and enthralling moments, LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these softcore films of the 70s when the focus was on mood and atmosphere, not on the rude things we see today. <br /> <br /> ps: make sure you look at Emanuelle in Egypt, which reads Annie & Al but also another famous couple on screen, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. Even the music of that film is fantastic.
