I have fond memories of watching this visually dazzling film as a child in the late 70s / early 80s on wor-tv (now upn-9) in New York. Although it is a swinging 1960s product, this film has just been aged. The effects are just as wonderful as in 2001, and somewhat superior (the model's work is impeccable). With an attractive cast, great color photography and set design, and an evocative soundtrack, JTTFSOTS is a winner!
