A friend brought me this film and at first I was hesitating, the rhythm of the film was so slow that it was certainly boring at first. But the scenes of life were attractive, it's like watching and watching. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be simply amazing throughout the film, the way the director handled the scenes of life to reflect reality was confusing but somehow overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a lively person rather than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mr Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales played their roles so well that it is more like telling us their stories. In fact they used their real names in the film.
