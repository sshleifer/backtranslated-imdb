This is the last feature film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, with the help of Wim Wenders, and adapts to his collection of short stories "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds contains 4 stories with familiar themes that we have become accustomed to since his previous works and summarizes these themes in vignettes that are intertwined through Wenders' scenes involving John Malkovich's The Director character. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth to which we are accustomed from an Antonioni film, while Malkovich's narrative of supposed depth unfolded with an unclear diction that seemed somewhat pretentious and out of place. <br /> <However, all four stories seem to touch random encounters, and extremely fast novels that have played more at pleasure at first sight, perhaps due to the lack of time (since they are still stories) to allow an approach stratified to carefully define and create characters as we know from a typical Antonioni film. And the obsessive approach here is that the characters strip off to show a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. Perhaps this is the point you want to bring with the observation of the most modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story, the story of a love that never exists, tells the love story between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel, and later meet in a bar. It is as if destiny were playing to them when they meet, but they divide and meet again much later, but like the games that people play, it's almost like Adventure or Night with the lack of communication and the expectations of people. 'man. <br /> <br /> The character of the director of John Malkovich takes a central role in the next short film, which exhibits some really lascivious looks towards a girl who works in a shop, played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply upset and made to feel uncomfortable, but somehow she raised the courage to get close to him, and in what I thought to scare him, she tells him that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. But in a flash these two are around in chamber gymnastics. <br /> <br /> The next short, Do not Look for Me, is the longest of the lot, with Peter Weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his lover (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the most studded star of this lot, with Jean Reno approaching the end of a queue, which widens the small universe in which this short film exists. But unfortunately even Reno's involvement has been relegated to some choking of laughter as he enters the implausible domain with the fast and tangential laser. There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel, while the introductory story on the history of the souls was quite interesting. If there is a negative theme here to which this short film wants to play, it will be the duplicity of man. <br /> <br /> Between this short and the next there was a small scene that brought together our couple from La Notte, Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the first painted a landscape that resembled that of the Red Desert. Finally, we have the latest film This Body of Dirt, with Vincent Perez as a young man who goes after a girl (Irene Jacob) whom he has just met and who falls in love with her, only to realize that he is also a late love . It is a relatively talkie piece, just like the first story, with the characters engaged in conversation as they walk through the streets of the city they are in, reminiscent of the dawn of Richard Linklater Before Sunrise. <br /> <br /> overall the film could have succeeded as individual pieces, they never measured themselves as a combined effort since the "excuse" to link them was the exploration of possible director stories and an inspiration for his next film.
