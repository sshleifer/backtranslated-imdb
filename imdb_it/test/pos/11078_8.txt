This anime tells the story of the battle of Mamodo King. Every 1000 years, 100 Mamado children are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, which literally means magic / evil object). Each Mamado is paired with a human partner, and given a magical spell book. The Human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in Mamodo, and when a Mamodo is defeated, their spellbook is engulfed in flames (alternatively, a Mamdodo book can be captured and burned directly). After this the Mamodo returns to the world of Mamodo. <br /> <br /> The titular character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6-year-old mamodo with electrical powers. He is paired with Kiyomaru Takamini and a 14-year-old genius. Zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but learning that some Mamodos are evil and decides that the battle for the king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a "kind king". <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell made a comparison with Pokemon, but a better comparison is with Digimon. Like Digimon, Mamodo and Humans have a symbiotic relationship, one by one. Also, unlike Pokemon, both shows have a real storyline. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell presents an evolution of the character and evolving relationships, and some fairly adult narrative lines (such as love against racism, slavery, mind control, etc.). It also has some decent twists and turns.
