This was much better than I expected, the film exuded professionalism compared to other B-moives of this type of budget. The screenplay was good if a little formidable, but the acting was surprisingly good to everyone, including Lorenzo and one always expects good standards from Scheider and Busey. Even the good plot and acting are good, especially car chases and accidents are class A. Overall this is an increase over other B-movie thrillers and should not rely on constant nudity or a cheese games to offset the budget and the sufficiency of the scripts, which is certainly worth a rent.
