Wonderfully filmed exploration, expansion of the mind of Gypsy culture in the context of their music. Travel across a continent, experiencing the extraordinary musical styles of various groups of gypsies. It is a bit misleading to say that this film is not narrated. It is masterfully narrated by the music itself, the slender melodies and subtitled words tell a story much better than a narrator would have done. Watch this movie.
