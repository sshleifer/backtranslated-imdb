Recently released on British DVD, this is a good movie (as long as it has an attention span and IQ greater than a fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could have been, this is the dirtiest kitchen sink. Terrance Stamp is exceptional, the music is sweet, Carol White is very credible as the tart of the single mother who can't stop loving criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where Carol and her friend who works in the pub with her (the one with the huge beehive-shaped hairdo coming down from one eye) sits and chats about all the men passing by. <br /> <br /> The only thing that ruined this was the shakey acting of Carol's first husband, but if you can get over it, you're fine. And Donovan offers some of the most languid, sweet and bittersweet texts that come from the 1960s.
