Prue and Piper take Dr. Griffiths home to save him from the Shax sauce killer. While Phoebe looks at the Shadow Book as defeating the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax in the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and shown live on television news as witches. They become a national sensation with a crowd in front of their home. Phoebe trusts Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and restore time while a fanatical woman takes Piper, who dies. The source suggests Phoebe stay with him and in return would save her sister. Phoebe accepts the deal, and the time is back when Shax is attacking Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffits. <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good but inconsistent episode. With Piper dead and The Power of Three destroyed, why should the Source restore the time to save it? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the Third Season and allows viewers to look forward to the next episode. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Turning no Time" ("Back in Time")
