I believe that anyone who enjoyed Eisentein's Ivan the Terrible films would appreciate this well-made film. This film was played as "Lord of the Ring: The return of the king", but without the special effect but as a good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have the German, who dressed as KKK, conquered Novgorod of Russia. The Russian summoned the Nevsky to lead them to fight the German to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in the films of Ivan the Terrible, was as charismatic as Nevsky. The first 10 minutes in which he managed the passage of Mongol was captivating. <br /> <br /> Many scenes were beautiful even in black and white. The anticipation of War did not require dialogues such as "how many enemies we will kill", etc. Except for a few speeches, the film can basically be interpreted as a silent film. The scene of the fight can stand comparison with those of the civil war scene of The Birth of a Nation. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the great soundtrack by Sergei Prokofiev. The music gave an epic touch to the film in those scenes without dialogue.
