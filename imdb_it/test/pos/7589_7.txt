Every Sunday is a short eleven-minute topic with the talents of two of the young young actors in the contract, a couple who will turn into prominent players in the future. It's interesting and fun to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin as they perform in a Sunday concert for Deanna's uncle. <br /> <br /> Obviously no one knew how great both these young women were. I always wondered why Mayer kept Garland and left Durbin to go to Universal. LB. he always had cultural pretensions and this was the type Jeanette MacDonald had in his studio and later assumed some lovely soprano voices like Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow, etc. <br /> <br /> Judy certainly had her glorious career at MGM, but paid a heavy price for it. Deanna, along with Abbott & Costello and several gothic monsters of horror have preserved the images of Universal. She was smart enough to come out on top and keep her attached. <br /> <br /> Thus, in their salad days, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
