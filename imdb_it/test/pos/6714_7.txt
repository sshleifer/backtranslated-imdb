No, "Lifeforce" is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It is, however, a medium film with some positive effects and a compelling storyline (and, of course, Mathilda May). Actually it could be one of my favorite SF / horror movies for the simple reason that they try to reason through the science of space vampires. How many times do you see it? Not even in "Alien" (the SF / horror comic of all time) science enters history. In "Lifeforce" they are trying to account for an unreasonable world. <br /> <br /> Now, I think it's successful? No. I think the film has the problem of a massive cast that Hooper strives to keep on track and that viewers need to focus on more than one "villian" and there are too many road trips. > <br /> To be honest, the film is a pleasure for the eyes and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take into consideration what Hooper was trying to do and really create a scary, sci-fi / ghost movie. <br /> <br /> If the remake happens, however, I ask that Mathilda may have a cameo.
