I know that you should not comment on other users' comments, but I will say that many negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew a lot about the Manhattan Project and who were annoyed by things that had been left out. (From his book 'Smoking In Bed' it seems that the original writer Bruce Robinson is another of these.) I knew very little before watching the film, however, and found it riveting. Dwight Schultz is absolutely hypnotic as Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic and charismatic presence, an inspired casting piece that makes me wonder why he is not given better roles and more important parts. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. One could quibble with various choices of script or direction, but since the film is extremely intense and horrible at times and overall I give it four out of five stars.
