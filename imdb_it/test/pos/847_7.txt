Ok, everyone agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing Boone was a bad idea. Even killing others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for this. Bad guys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys, I can't do anything about it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Yet it is easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you are on Boone. He is really ... mysterious. The thing that shocked me the most was when Lilli was written outside of history and how. It was something he didn't deserve! And what do we get? A blonde girl named Renee, absolutely without character! But these Taelons remain mysterious, and you remain to wonder how real plans are until the end. True Suspence. Conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand that when you jump on an episode of the third, fourth or fifth season, you may not understand this show. But when you look at the beginning, you can't let loose! <br /> <br /> The acting is great, the special FX are wonderful, the music is beautiful and the plot is intriguing. I have to see this, guys!
