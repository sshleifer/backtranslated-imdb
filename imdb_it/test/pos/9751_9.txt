I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but it was just creating the atmosphere and building the action. I thought this film was very instructive, it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor and can say that it has a great influence on me. Time magazine named Louise Arbor one of the 100 most influential people in the world in April 2004. I recommend this film to people who love historical films (of course). This film was very dramatic, but it still told the truth of the events in the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave hero and I'm glad they made a movie to honor her. If you see the movie, I hope you like it.
