On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is a choral comedy that masquerades as a period piece (set in the early 1960s, complete with an impeccable Motown soundtrack). But there's a lot more to this film - it gets better every time I see it. The cast of unknowns (at the moment) is excellent, and is noteworthy as an all-black cast that does not fit into any Blaxpoitation clich√© - sometimes COOLEY HIGH looks like an updated neo-realist urban film, with lots of edgy humor added. Sometimes, the rather tight budget shows, but the constraints serve the film really well - there is a grit and honesty of emotion here that gives the film an immediacy that is missing in most similar-minded films (like Schultz later CAR WASH, which was more popular, but largely useless) Warm but also true, this could be one of the sleepers of the 70s - celebrated at that time, it seems that few film fanatics know this today Their loss - this is a fine and refined film. <br /> <br /> The pan-and-scan DVD (without widescreen!?!) is the testimony of how little is taken care of, because this excellent film is.
