This is a very strange film for Harold Lloyd - at least for the sweet character he played in the movies in the 20s and 30s. Instead of a good boy, he and Snib Pollard are scammers, to rob everyone blind. In a particularly successful scam, Chester pretends to have lost a "very precious ring" and a little later, Harold finds him as a puppet who is also looking for the ring. The ring, of course, is a cheap one launched and then found by Harold, but the greed of the sheriff is so great, that he "convinces" Harold not to say anything and sell him the "precious" ring and then run away to enjoy their luck (?). Again and again they find the patsies until they meet a woman who is a scam (working with a guy who makes false sessions). Organize a nice scam and get all the money he stole - and he has a cop waiting to make sure they give her the money. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the two scammers stumble into the shady business of the lady when no one is home. Soon, the lady returns and plays with their minds - releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their evil ways. <br /> <br /> All around, this is a completely strange and invented film, but it's also extremely fun, since the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard are an excellent team. Also, while creepy and strange, I liked to see Pollard dressed as a woman.
