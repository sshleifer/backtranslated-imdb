This film is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her quest to beat her team of Cornwell boys after hunting girls. So he goes to the Illaria rival school and joins the boys' team, doing so he falls in love with Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks he's a boy and loves Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Viola as his brother. <br /> <br /> I was in a version of the twelfth evening and the beginning was very modern. So I knew the game well. I was very excited to see this movie and when I saw it it exceeded my expectations. It retained many of my favorite lines and I could see great connections to the game. Although it was like the game, it wasn't that complicated. It was even more than a girl's movie than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It involves you in a lot of crazy love stories and lies. You saw how purple (Amanda Bynes) mistakenly thought about what boys thought and her complications in living in a world of boys. See also his roommate, Duke's (Channing Tatum), impression of this. I really enjoyed seeing the characters portrayed in a modern way. It also tells the modern theme "Follow your dreams" but this time it has a turning point. I think this film was a great movie about a girl who loved football and was committed to herself, her family and her dreams. I think this film will be the big chance for many stars in the industry.
