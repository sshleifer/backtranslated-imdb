I'm so happy not to live in a small American town. Because every time I am shown a small town in the United States is populated by all kinds of monsters including meat-hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are the most harmless. In this film a former doctor, who has just finished the time for an accidental murder of his wife in a car accident, directs his steps towards the nearest town - he must never have seen in his life a film about some small city ​​- which happens to be the apartments of Purgatory. And, of course, as soon as he gets there, all hell breaks loose. He meets a blonde girl who, like all the creatures, looks more like a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and immediately falls in love with her. But there is a small handicap, she is already married to a very small drug dealer who in one minute is mercifully shot dead. To know what came out of this, you should watch the movie for yourself. I'll just tell you that it reminds us of Oliver Stone's U Turn but it's a way in all artistic properties.
