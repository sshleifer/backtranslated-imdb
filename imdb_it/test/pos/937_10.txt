I feel at a loss, so brilliant is this film. Kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; and while he is an excellent director, his greatness lies in his writing; and "Red" is its paradigm. This film is a metaphysical study of the artist's judgment in the creation of his imaginary world; of how an artist can try to redo his life - even his - through his art, even if he cannot escape the awareness that, no matter how much he gets involved in his story, it is still fiction and he is still out of his rework the world, still oppressed by its unreality and the reality of life that it has tried to recreate artistically. And magically, all this is not the smallest at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and destiny and about the characters who live this story, this pre-judged destiny. If I had to choose, I could name this the greatest film ever made.
