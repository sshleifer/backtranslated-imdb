In 1980 patriotism and, in some cases, chauvinism, was quite high. "We have to win this time", a famous line from Rambo: First Blood part II, it could almost summarize how many people felt at that time. A desire for the style of the movies with which I grew up, with the balls on the wall "we are good, your bad guys ... now we blow up something, and we go home" While Rambo, Rocky, and mostly Gun seemed more oriented to attract an older audience. Iron Eagle went straight to the children. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie highlights everything you love and hate during that time. The kick in the pants unleashes the hymns of the 80s (never say die, Road of the Gypsy, etc.) Up to overtaking and, at times, to an incredible action adventure. Iron Eagle succeeded for a reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. It's the kind of movie you can turn on and sit down and enjoy every ridiculous moment totally eighty years old. You don't have to think about whether it could really happen, or if acting is really believable, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really ask for in this kind of movie ...
