I saw this film for the first time as a teenager when it was released in cinemas in the distant past. Seeing him again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised by how long he resisted. The gags are still fun, the interaction between characters works great, and cameos come off better than ever. (Steve Martin's must be the best.) <br /> <br /> My children (9, 11 and 14) loved it, and the music is good enough that they're still humming the melodies many days later. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that before seeing the film, you should see at least half a dozen episodes of the Muppet Show, to get an idea of ​​the background behind the characters, otherwise the film won "I make a lot of sense .
