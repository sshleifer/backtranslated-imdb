This is the kind of movie you rent when you are incredibly tired, or damaged in some other way ... The acting in this movie is so bad that it seems intentional and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there is a scene in where the puppets come alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet, moving it. The film looked like it was shot with a video camera. When I saw this film for the first time, a fight broke out when my friends and I were calling each other the names of this movie, it was terrible. If you like getting angry at movies, I recommend this, otherwise you will run away as if your life itself depended on it.
