The film is about Paul (Páll), a young man who sinks into the harsh world of madness and his stay in the "Kleppur" psychiatric hospital and his friends. Victor (Viktor) who during his training in England began to think he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Pétur) who took a lot of LSD and tried to fly on a roof in free fall without broken bones or physical damage only to madness, is obeyed by China. Oli Beatle (Óli Bítill) Oli spent most of his time at the hospital, although Viktor is a little older than him, he claims to have written every Beatles song and sent them by telepathy <br /> <br /> The novel is better then the film covers all of Paul's life from birth to his death, there is a long time since I saw the film, but if I remember correctly the film does not cover Paul's childhood. <br /> <br /> "Englar Alheimsins" is fun, sad and powerful if you haven't seen it looking at it NOW! and first read the novel makes the film better
