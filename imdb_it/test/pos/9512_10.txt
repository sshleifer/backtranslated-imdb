I don't know what Dick Steel was talking about, but I found this film as one of the most exciting epics in Japan to date. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact, or for that the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. As far as I know of the movies, most of the film catastrophes are basically run by the mill's asteroid movies or one of Global Warming's. This is how he ran a different course. A course of natural means where the earth's crust is starting to erode to such an extent, that it will take another piece of land with it for the journey. What the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going far and Sinking Japan altogether. In most cases this would simply be called tectonic shift on steroids. I found the characters rather attractive in every way, from the child who lost his mother only to face his death among unknown friends. Or the rescuer who does everything possible to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought he could change his mind for not being such a devil and go with him to safety, only to become the hero himself and save his homeland. And let's not forget, as the rest of the world has only sent them back only to be forgotten, making the world go round behind Japanese citizens who have cried for help. This was a great film in all aspects. What Dick is trying to say is that this film was not made by Hollywood, which was made in Japan, which has characters that rival other actors from around the world, that the effects are very beautiful as he said but it's all what he was waiting for, and nothing else. He lacks the vision of what is important for everyone and why this film has had every element of feeling, of greatness and of humanity. I thought this film was of the highest level, and I saw a lot of catastrophic films to know that Japan Sinks were probably one of the most original and well-thought out projects I've witnessed. I really hope that Shinji Higuchi will make another of these films. Oh, by the way, I'm not Japanese, though in many ways I'd like to be. I am Canadian, born and raised. And a film buff in all aspects. The prejudicial visions are bitter and do not deserve the effort to be recognized as an opinion. Dick, you should look at him with a more open heart and mind, not just look for the sweets that make a film content, look for what is most important and understand it. They may not be Americans, but the Japanese have conquered the market lately for some of the most breathtaking and just gritty films made to date. That's why spending 25,000,000 is just what the Doctor ordered. You heard right, 25,000,000 to make this film. Now tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because the American actors were not there?
