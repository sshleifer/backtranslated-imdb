WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT (2005) **** (Voices: Peter Salis, Ralph Fiennes Helena Bonham Carter) <br /> <br /> Fantastic wonders of clay: Wallace and Gromit Save the day ! Crackin 'Good Entertainment! <br /> <br /> Nick Park, the creator of the Wallace & Gromit animated team, is a genius. His painstaking art in the form of Plasitcine claymation is a unique process that involves literally thousands of hours (it takes about an 8-hour working day to contribute 3 minutes of action for a film, this raid in a feature film lasts 5 years!) his lovable master and faithful team of dogs take shape on the big screen in the first full-length film of the duo and it's really good (to coin a phrase from Wallace's usual answer to everything else!) <br /> <br / > Park, which he co-directed with Steve Box and co-wrote with Mark Burton and Bob Baker, sends the horror genre into this fun and fast action comedy with ingenious inventive Wallace (voiced by British veteran Salis) and his dumb but faithful (and more acute thought) Gromit (all the frowning eyebrows and the indolent lack of mouth) have devised a service to their community: the control of parasites ("Anti-Pesto" as they are known) for the upcoming Giant Ve getable Festival which has the whole city in the mo or for all vegetative things a giant and the largest pesk are annoying rabbits that eat crispy products. Wallace's inventive mind has created a container for the void that is fast, efficient and, above all, harmless for the friendly parasites that afflict the estate of Lady Campanula Tottington (voiced by Bonham Carter, pausing to be the first woman to stop -motion animation that with its previous turn in "Corpse Bride" a few weeks ago, which hosts the competition and is a love interest for the nerd Wallace. <br /> <br /> The only neo-pomade is vainglorious, stormy din and fool Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Fiennes, his first attempt in the animated arts which presents itself as a bold Patrick Stewart exhilarating with hilarious results), a damn macho idiot who is plotting to marry Lady Tottington to her riches while he is the main competitor of W & G's human attempts, using his trusty cannons and ugly bulldog. <br /> <br /> To add insult to injury, the duo are facing a terrible situation in the form of a huge rabbit (the monster gives a nod to the horror movie Universal and Hammer) that is terrorizing the village and devouring every vegetable in sight. The two come out to trap and dispose of the creature, but there is more to it than it seems as things progress. <br /> <br /> Intransigently fun and with an incredible elastic and kinetic energy for his wonderful clay counterparts, Park and Box has created a truly magical and very funny film with an incredibly detailed production design for their a small world that could require more than a screening to absorb how much effort in their blood, sweat and tears have helped make this classic instant for children of all ages. <br /> <br /> Wallace, the balding inventor who loves cheese, could easily be Homer Simpson's English cousin with his round body and constant ability to make mistakes while trying to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place but his head is in the clouds. Her sweet crush on Lady Tottington (which resembles a pre-plastic surgery by Carol Burnett) which is a taller head than our hero will perhaps remind those of their first unrequited love of a smile of embarrassing admission. His gift Rube Goldberg to make the complicated ease is inspired by the madness that fans will remember from the previous short films "The Wrong Trousers", "A Close Shave" and "A Grand Day Out". <br /> <br /> But in my opinion the wise, silent and long-lived Gromit, his poached egg eyes of slow burning and disbelief for what is transpiring, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an incredible arsenal of exasperated, mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill to accomplish in an attempt to convey dismay, worry, pain, real surprise and relief. His last pursuit ?? a signature of the immensely popular comic book ?? it is ingeniously set and quickly improvised, especially its literal fight with the equally silent bulldog with tenacity, wit and Chuck Jones fueled the intelligence that would Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger green with envy. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit combine the best of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and any other classic comedy that comes to mind; this is hoping that their longevity continues on the screen until their predecessors. The wait is more impatient.
