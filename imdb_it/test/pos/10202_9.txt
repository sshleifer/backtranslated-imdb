This is a kind of hidden gem. It has little or no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and deserves all of the above! One of the great film directors, Fritz Lang, has created a real jewel in this excellent western. A refined cast led by Randolph Scott (probably one of his greatest shows), the ever-robust Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly skillful dude plus many veteran actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in a exciting story about Zane Gray about laying Western Union cable throughout the country. It has a tense drama, splashes of humor and great effects. Remember DeMille in ways and Fritz Lang leaves his mark. At least that's a damn good western!
