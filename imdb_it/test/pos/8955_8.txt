As many reviews have noted, there is a strong dark vein in this film. The director that most reminds me of me is John Landis (yes, go ahead and shout about what a farmer I am). Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a gray and ugly way, then turning around and exploring the horrors of life with a light touch. <br /> <br /> The cast is, without exception, above average. Thomas Gibson, like David, is exceptional as the moody and self-deceiving center around which the rest of the characters rotate. He speaks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. Gibson was already a strong and thin actor in 1993. It was hard to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, not to mention agent Hotchner of Criminal Minds. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not the best scene, but the one I like most, my "rewind scene", is the section where Candy expects a visitor, and an uninvited person after that. another shows up at the door. As Candy's interpersonal environment fluctuates more and more out of control, David simply becomes a bouncer, a perkier and more enthusiastic, like a gaunt "X-Tiger".
