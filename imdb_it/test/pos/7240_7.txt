What is often overlooked in Agatha Christie's stories is her progressive and anti-conservative attitude on a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of tradition to the belief of people in the supernatural. In "Nemesis" you can find many of these subtexts, but you can also find a good intriguing old-style mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of its length. Also raise "Nemesis" over the other voices of the series ("They Do It With Mirrors", "4:50 From Paddington", etc.), It is the fact that at crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer one can actually hear the suspense And finally, Jane Booker is welcome to protect my body at any time.
