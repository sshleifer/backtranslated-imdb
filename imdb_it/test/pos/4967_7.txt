I met Jennifer for the first time years ago while I was out of town when she appeared on TV in the middle of the night; I fell asleep before it ended, but stayed with me until I had to track him down. Its charm is that, although there is not much to do, it weaves a charming atmosphere, and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (the real man-and-wife life at that time) show an enticing, low-key chemistry. Lupino plays a woman busy keeping a vast California estate at home whose former caretaker - Jennifer - has disappeared. (The shades of Jack Nicholson in the Shining, although in this case it is not Lupino who goes, or leaves, crazy). Duff is the guy in town who manages the finances of the estate and takes a shine for Lupino, who decides to play hard to get. She becomes more and more involved, not to say obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the dark old house full of descending stairways and locked cellars. The atmosphere and the romantic byplay are by far the best part of the film, as viewers are probably able to find the resolution a little disappointing - there isn't just much (except for a small frisson in the queue that anticipates Brian The filmic codes of De Palma). But it is well done and, still, it sticks to you. Extra attraction: it is the film that introduced the song "Angel Eyes", which will become part of the standard repertoire of Ol 'Blue Eyes.
