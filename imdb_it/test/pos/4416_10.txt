One of the most sublime American masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film sexualizing Dallesandro, with his mouth open snoring on a pillow. We wonder, is she coming out of a heroine at the top? We only see his face, then, the flash, his body, the flash, his naked back. I can't think of another film that has used this form of flash-blip editing so well to create a hypnotic, filter-like mood, a method of editing that works wonderfully both as a rhythm and as a style. After that introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent is shocking: we expect him to be a kind of androgynous with a gentle voice; instead, he has the voice of a street hooligan - Morrissey doesn't feel comfortable leaving our assumptions unchecked. The long opening is very sexy and playful - it's a combination of martial problems, fascinating kisses with Dallesandro's lips and morning sexual adventures; everything flows together, if not always smoothly, then emotionally realistically. <br /> <br /> What I got from this was the same as what I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it - this is like a 20-something continuation of that history. There is a sense of camaraderie between meat vendors and buyers; when Dallesandro walks down the street looking for men (to finance his wife's abortion) there is the feeling of a secret handshake while the boys do business with each other. I never found it boring, even if nothing happens: nothing happens brilliantly, the kids wander around, like they do, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds is fascinating to look at, using Greek descriptions and touching only his back, a form of aesthetic adoration of the body by man. It's also terribly funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, am I?"). It is one of the most revealing scenes of the film - I believe in every film; definitely any movie that deals with sex and sex for sale. When Dallesandro's eyes look red and swollen, we can't tell if it's because he's drunk, shameful, embarrassed or all. <br /> <br /> Conversations in the film are truncated - they don't count. (The film is silent in some scenes, some of the most moving and beautiful you can ever experience.) However, when Morrissey chooses to include one, the way he includes it (we kind of make it together), it's amazing, like a conversation between Dallesandro and a novice braggart - and neither of them ever mentions the word "gay" or "hustler". What follows is a scene in which we listen to a couple of transvestites as Dallesandro is assisted - this just after explaining to the beginner to "get used" to work. <br /> <br /> Dallesandro is a subject worthy of the attention paid to him, both by his clients and by Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor, in the sense of acting as an actor, but to the point of revealing something that is unbelievable - he is someone we immediately want to hear about, yet we go through his experiences, with all their complexity, and we " to try to get to know him. It is the kind of empty board we are attracted to but which he cannot hold in. And of course it is incredibly surprising - forgetting all the rest, this is partly a testimony of the beauty of the male body, of the splendid bust of Dallesandro and permanently erect nipples. <br /> <br /> The film has a devastating scene, but like everything else you can't really dominate it - a girl says she was raped, and her only self-defense is in saying that, if the rapist had only asked for sex, he had courted it, he would have gotten a better layman. It is shocking. The film has a feeling for everyone, but even better than that, it is not simply comp In other words, it tries to help us understand human beings - and never dictate what we want to be understood. He neither looks nor fascinates people in the film. It seems inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he speaks of not having passed the eighth grade at some point), it is absolutely fascinating, while he stops on a word ... then he says "woteva" and continues. <br /> <br /> You can learn something deeper from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of homosexual relations than in any case study. Here we have the smiling boy (his upper lip disappears as he does) when a Korean war veteran of thirty-five years of gymnastics runs his fingers through his hair; it is a scene that feels very deep, this adult man who shares something with a younger version of himself - they are not two gay men together, or a homosexual who pays a straight man, it is something else you can't bet on finger; questions about sexuality are beyond the point. (Never before did a pimple seem affectionate.) After having shared something emotionally with each other (even if with Dallesandro, since he is there for money, it is never clear why he is there, also if it is never less sincere, which can be its most disarming quality), "Then ... can you help me?" The man sure says. "I don't mean my pants!" 10/10
