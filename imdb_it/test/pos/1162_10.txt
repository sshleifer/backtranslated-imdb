This is one of my all-time favorites. All the actors do a great job. Comparing this film with "Lawrence of Arabia" does not do justice to both films. "The Wind and the Lion" provides a much smaller budget with fantastic actors portraying moving characters in a moving atmosphere. Beautiful images and actions are also provided, which together guarantee a favorite film for me.
