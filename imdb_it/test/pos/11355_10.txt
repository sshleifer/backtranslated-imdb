It's easy to see why many people consider Wong Kar-Wai's best film In the Mood for Love. The attenuated appeal of the film, centered on the studied vision of a relationship transmitted through an emotional ringtone, is a reconstructed in the territory of Happy Together but without the hyper-kinetic mix of strident film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a brand of Kar-Wai movies by Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different kind of curiosity for Kar-Wai; where the dialogue and the plot are abandoned by the mood and the composition to create a story of two delicate lives in an apparently confining emotional stasis. <br /> <br /> It is a testimony of the genius of Kar-Wai who is able to make such a resonant story so simple. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move into each other within the same condominium. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels and is a secretary of a shipping company. Their final pairing is obvious from the beginning, but the pleasure here is the way Kar-Wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his great masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The key to the film's success is the use of Kar-Wai's interior space, playing with the foreground and background in similar ways to Polanski's works. During the sensually sensual first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung inside shots so that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai takes care of the environment and space here, creating a close emotional dynamic between his characters. He is also saying that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of the spouses of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen. Their faceless associates are noticeably absent from the film, as they tend to love each other. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that In the Mood for Love is a neighboring experience because Kar-Wai manages to flood his film with wide splashes of motion and hypnotic sound from the camera. There is a shot in which Cheung's slow, sensual awakening on a metaphorical scale turns into Leung's descent along the same stairwell; their movements complement each other perfectly, they close the frame and create a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but have yet to unite physically. The erotic shifting of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two lovers with crossed stars reject physical fulfillment because of their humble loyalty. <br /> <br /> Other scenes from the film are punctuated by Cheung's slow-motion short shots moving erotically through his internal environment, set for Mike Galasso's haunting assessment. Cheung's clothes beautifully complete his outer space as he moves slowly through his surroundings. His movements slowly accumulate up to what appears to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and his dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be completely unconscious. <br /> <br /> If I make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds that trigger pheromones on each other, it's probably not so far-fetched as a sentence. The close connection these two characters have with their interior spaces is almost as intense as their relationship with the exterior. The film rarely moves in an outer space and when the camera moves it is usually through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. Kar-Wai continues to tease us even when lovers come close enough to touch them, destroying the closeness of the couple by shooting them through the mirrors or through the empty spaces inside the clothes placed inside a wardrobe. Even Mother Nature seems to respond to their passion for love, often triggering a soft fold of rain on the characters after their bodies have slipped close to each other. <br /> <br /> The disturbing atmospheric shots of a Kar-Wai waterfall have allowed Leung of Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic release in Happy Together, although Leslie Cheung's Po wing was not there to enjoy it with him. At the end of that film, love was so inextricably linked to the act of war that the declarations of love of a third man signaled the making of Yu-Fai that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if he would not return his lover to him. Mo-Wan's journey ends within the confines of a ruined temple. His emotional exhaustion is parallel to his country's political climate, and the absence of Li-szhen is made tolerable only by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a release of some sort. Mo-Wan turns to an ancient myth and his secret liberation in a crack in the temple leaves him able to live his days with the hope that all his loss and anguish has somehow served a higher purpose.
