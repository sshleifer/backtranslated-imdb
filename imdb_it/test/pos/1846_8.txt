This particular film was one I wanted to see in theaters, but I never understood it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I liked it so much that I went out and bought the DVD right after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a great job with the script and they are wonderful to hear on the audio commentary included on the DVD. They have done a great job creating characters that really interest you. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this movie including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job in showing the importance of the family (a rarity in today's film), which is a reflection of the director, Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments he made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond Fox Mulder who performs a wonderful performance with some rather touching scenes. I highly recommend giving this film a vision. I'm really grateful to the creators of this film. They gave me a wonderful movie show that I will recommend to all my friends. I've seen a lot of movies over the years and it's very rare for me to leave with such a sense of satisfaction after watching a movie. I will watch it over and over again for years to come. Return to Me reminds me that there are still filmmakers who genuinely appreciate their movie audience. Thank you!!
