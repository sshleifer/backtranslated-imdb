So Dark The Night represents a difficult challenge: it is very difficult to write it down in every detail without ruining it for those who haven't seen it yet. Since it remains quite obscure, this includes almost everyone. Will the film affect those familiar with the best-known titles of director Joseph H. Lewis in the noir cycle? Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, also My Name Is Julia Ross, which in its brevity you remember? as a strange choice. <br /> <br /> For beginners, the French bucolic countryside serves as a setting. Steven Geray, a middle-aged detective with the Surété in Paris, leaves for a vacation in the village of Ste. Margot (or perhaps Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he finds himself falling in love with the caretaker's daughter (Micheline Cheirel), even though she is engaged to a local farmer. But the siren song of life in Paris is hard to resist, so she agrees to marry him, despite the disparity of their age, which inevitably becomes the discourse of the city. <br /> <br /> But on the night of their engagement party, he can't return to the inn. Soon, a hunchback finds his body near the river. His jealous and loving lover is the logical suspicion, but he too is found dead. So anonymous notes threaten other deaths, which occur. For the first time in his career, Geras has let slip .... <br /> <br /> A particularly weak script does nothing but film; sounds like bad guy Cornell Woolrich crossed with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis makes this vehicle squeaky proud. He takes his time near the beginning, but then the story ?? and the narration ?? gain momentum (alas, just when the script breaks an axis). Burnett Guffey turned on and photographed the film, with an intriguing leitmotif of peeking out and peeking in the windows; there is also an effective soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer, which has provided a real threat to many noirs. A good deal of talent has been profuse in So Dark The Night, but in the end is it reduced to little more than a gimmick ?? and not an excellent expedient for that. It's a one-trick pony from a movie. <br /> <br />
