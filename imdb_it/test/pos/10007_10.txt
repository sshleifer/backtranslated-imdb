This film is surprising because the fact that real people paint themselves and their real life experience and do a great job is almost like reliving the past. Jia Hongsheng plays himself an actor who has left everything, except music and drugs that fight depression and look for the meaning of life while they are angry with everyone, especially the people who take better care of him. There are moments in the film that will make you cry because the family, especially the father, has done a great job. However, this film is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression will understand the problem of Hongsheng and why it does the things it does, for example it keeps itself closed in a dark room or takes walks or bike rides alone. Others might see the boring movie because it's so real that it's almost like a documentary. Overall this film is exceptional and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this film, so did his father.
