It's one of my favorite TV series. A wonderful cast, a great script and an external plot. <br /> <br /> Watching the Kyle family routine is a guarantee of great moments of humor and great comedies. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comment. He is one of the best today. If it has perfect timing and always gets the point of the bar. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: her paranoid and sentimental Jay is simply wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> - George O. Gore II: perfect for paper. It is impossible to imagine anyone else as the adorable (and stupid) Junior. <br /> <br /> - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: the egocentric Claire found the perfect actress. Beautiful and talented. <br /> <br /> - Parker McKeena Posey: impossible not to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> - Noah Gray-Cabey: this guy has a future, I'm sure it. <br /> <br /> I am very sad when it ends, but this show will be in my mind forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
