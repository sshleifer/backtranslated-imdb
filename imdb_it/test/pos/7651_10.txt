We ran into this show on a Sunday morning at 6:30 while we flipped through all the cable channels and it turned out to be the best show! It is absolutely adorable. We need shows like this for children (and adults, since they are definitely beyond the years of my childhood). As one of the other commentators pointed out, this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and the narrative lines. The puppets are extraordinarily cute, the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created with cardboard, foam, paint and pure imagination, they remind us of our childhood, when we could spend the day at grandma's house, exploring the world around us. For those who have never been lucky enough to have a beautiful grandmother like Nana, this show is for you, to make up for lost time! This show is a true inspiration and full of intelligence and humor and pure fun, for children and adults. In other words, don't neglect this show, just because you are more than three years old! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell, they will be friends you can't wait to see!
