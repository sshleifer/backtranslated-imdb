This morning for the press at the Rome film festival, "N - io e Napoleone" is easy to love. First of all it can count on great production values, as very few Italian films today can, with wonderful settings and costumes. The cast is also fantastic. The director Virzì constantly talks about the young protagonist Elio Germano as "a young De Niro". Now, of course, it's going too far, but surely the boy can act. I loved his performance and did a great job with the accent (Tuscan). Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte. It's really nice to see him play in Italian, I hope to see him work again in Italy very soon. The support cast also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely choices, but they gave excellent results. Even Massimo Ceccherini, better known for appearing in his moral films and in the sad television reality shows, has adapted well and was really fun. The low point of the cast was the "Diva" by Monica Bellucci. Of course, it was slightly better than usual, but he could seem (and play) absolutely unnatural even in the part of Baroness Emilia, in whom, with a good dose of self-irony, she used her own Umbrian accent. The screenplay, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and by Virzì himself, is intelligent, with many loud laughter and also some very exciting moments. Of course, the ending has left me perplexed. The message is quite ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can lead you to blind hatred, but if you approach it you will learn that the object of your hatred is after all a human being like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad , sometimes pathetic, so that suddenly it's hard to hate him; then, in the last few minutes, he says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. Personally, I don't really like this notion. "Me and Napoleon" is still a pleasant film, the best presented at the Festival so far (the other is Fur and the Hoax). My vote is 8/10
