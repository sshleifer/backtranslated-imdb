This extremely funny short film is considered one of the best short films of all time and I certainly won't discuss it. Even in a country where high-level animated shorts are created regularly, this film still manages to stand out. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie, please do it. It's only ten minutes, yet it contains a man obsessed with saws, a woman who sucks up a bathtub and a nuclear war. What more could you want in a movie?
