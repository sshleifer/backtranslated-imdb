I just saw this movie, in Australia on satellite. As I avoided the news more than usual in the last week coming from the United States of A regarding the assassins, well, to be absolutely honest, this film is a real gem. A great honor to all those involved. I had only a small idea of ​​what the film entailed, as often happens for the good effect and this certainly led to the creation of cinematographic assets. the setting of the scene is effective in the true sense of the word, with all the hairy subjects of today's world in relation to their own hesitant family, albeit a suburb. The first forty minutes create such a professional theater that I wasn't ready for loud laughter when they came. Although the cathartic moment was built through comedy and character, the family and neighbors united in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> All in all, predicting who and what we are. A very significant film and a must see. <br /> <br /> Please note the date of this review.
