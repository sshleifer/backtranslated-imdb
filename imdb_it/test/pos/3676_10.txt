I also joined the IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but so that I can sing its praises. I had never heard of this movie (it's packed so horribly that it's easy to see why it could be passed down) but a good friend suggested it to me and I'm so glad he did. It is a jewel of a film. The actors are fantastic (Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton in particular) and seem to really enjoy themselves. Of course, sometimes it was a bit exaggerated, but I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard or so many times over the course of two hours. If you like to laugh, then you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
