I really hate musicals because the music numbers just start suddenly and usually ruin the scenes, but this is completely different - it's just brilliant. Maybe it's not a challenge for viewers, but the simplicity of people's life stories makes this movie fantastic. I've seen it at least a dozen times and I'm still not tired of the plot, characters or music (I love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack I wanted to have and I'll probably be the only one I have to). <br /> <br /> For me it is a must - seen a kind of film, great characters compiled with funny songs and a lot of things to think about after the film ends.
