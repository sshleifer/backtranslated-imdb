This film is fantastic, especially if you like visual arts. The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph is beautiful. The story is both fun and moving. <br /> <br /> People who like European films and "art films" will love this film. This is truly an art film - it actually has a lot of art in it. Go get it. <br /> <br />
