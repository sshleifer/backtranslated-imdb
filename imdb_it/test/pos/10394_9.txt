I'm not sure what to do with this movie, especially after seeing a fantastic movie like La Notte. Unfortunately I saw it in German during an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum, so I couldn't hear Malkovich's great voice. It should tie together four stories about couples in Italy. However, as good as an actor, Malkovich cannot save the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here: a woman who comes to him in a bar near the shop near a shop that owns and bursts out about how he killed his father nearby . Then the two go home, have sex and he leaves. It seems as if Antonioni had lost the subtlety in previous films (like The Passenger) when it came to sex and replaced him with obvious nakedness. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the plot is, the film presents two things that make it watchable: candy for the eyes and ears. The actors and actresses are all beautiful, and the cinematography is wonderful - scenes in old Italian cities that contrast with a bit in a high-rise apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of La Notte). <br /> <br /> The earring, however, is what makes the film worth seeing. U2 and Brian Eno have collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", both of which set the atmosphere in the film perfectly. The songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
