Boogie Nights follows an extremely familiar theme for gangster movies (although it doesn't fit this genre) - the rise and fall. We see the rise of several people, some of them completely obscure, until they reach great heights ... and then fall from grace because of their excesses. <br /> <br /> I think this is the first feature of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it's a great start! I've seen elements of influences from other directors, like Robert Altman, but the film has its place in originality and in the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> Character development is the most beautiful feature of the film. I really identified with all the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All the performances were brilliant. (It was especially nice to see a small part played by a real porn veteran, Nina Hartley). <br /> <br /> Basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result of being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the Oscars (probably because of the "racy" - as they would say - of arguments, and of conservatism general of the Academy.
