Very touching film, a great surprise to come from Brazil, a country that usually exports characteristics on social themes, violence, sex ... Magical realism is a very difficult task, and I believe that João Falcão made it wonderfully. It seems that he didn't really intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think that the film was adapted from the game, in his interviews he said that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão was influenced by the series "Hoje é Dia De Maria". The TV series produced by Globo was made after the film, but aired before ... Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The negative point is photography, by Walter Carvalho. It seems that he did not capture or understand the concept that Falcão created. The story is captivating and universal, despite being held in a small small town in Brazil. This could happen anywhere in the world. A great movie, I highly recommend it.
