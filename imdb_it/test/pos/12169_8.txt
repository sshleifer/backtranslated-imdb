The trio is a pleasant, nostalgic journey towards that first hint of desire - when it was still a simple exploration of the unknown - before being "grown up" and added those complexities of HIV status, emotional baggage and I have to run - just went into the emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The anguish portrayed is pure adolescent anguish, but it sounds real in all three stories. Their sweetness and positivity make you feel good about yourself being gay. And those types of films are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Good news! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now readily available on DVD from September 1999.
