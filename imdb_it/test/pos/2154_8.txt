I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It's extremely engaging and very well done, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most neglected musical talents of the 60s and 70s. While I knew his most famous compositions ("One is the Loneliest Number", "Without You"), I learned about this man's brilliant writing and his beautiful singing. If you love music, you will find many things to lure you into his world, which unfortunately lost control when his success increased and his past haunted him. Sad though he was, he was completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so happy to have met this man. The profile is actually told through the same words of Nilsson and those of his friends and colleagues (a Who is Who of Virtual Rock) who loved and respected him. Don't miss this!
