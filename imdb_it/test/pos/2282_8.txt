An egotistical Major League baseball player is forced to continue his career in Japan, contending with a foreign culture, a seemingly lackluster manager, an attractive Japanese woman and her own professional and social insecurities. There is a certain subtle charm that flows through Tom Selleck's performances. There is humor, sometimes softly, as in this film, sometimes slapstick as in "Folks!", But it seems that there is always a higher purpose. Throw in an individual full of doubts about himself who struggles to solve his personal difficulties while he is quick to "do the right thing" and end up with a movie that is both fun and challenging. The cast fits like a league team, and even though neither the cast nor the film win prizes for their efforts, they will leave the audience at ease (and perhaps the best results after all). You'll want to watch this movie more than once, and every time, Mr. Baseball hits a home run.
