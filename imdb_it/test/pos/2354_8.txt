I remember seeing this film when I was very young and on TV many times since. I've always liked it. I noticed in the print shown on local TV that a scene has an inverted film. It's the one where they hide behind the rocky outcrop (it looks like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles) to watch the Indians riding. If you look closely, you will notice that all of the soldiers are left handed! It's just a short segment and I have to admit that it took me years to notice. <br /> <br /> As for the story, there were often expeditions to save white prisoners from the Indians. The direct connection to the final scene of the battle is the Battle of Beecher's Island. In that action, a group of volunteer explorers equipped with repeated carbines (Spencer not caroline Winchester) were surprised by the Indians and retreated to an island and withheld several charges. In the last charge, they killed Roman Nose, one of the most famous Indian chiefs. I have no idea if the scriptwriter of the script had this in mind, but it fits quite well. <br /> <br /> There are several Guy Madison movies that I hope to go out on DVD one day and this is one of them.
