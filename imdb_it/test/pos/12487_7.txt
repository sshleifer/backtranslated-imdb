The extraordinarily adorable Suzy Delair plays a statuary exhibition obsessed with success in the theater. Her husband and companion, played by Bernard Blier, is a composed but jealous man. When he discovers in a way less than preferable that his flamboyant wife planned a meeting with an old lascivious man with the intention of advancing his career, he loses control and threatens the businessman with the murder. Now, at that point, I have to stop describing the film because it is skating on an ice so thin with its twists, revelations, ambiguity and suspense that to imply one would endanger it. I'm not sure how good or bad this French police process emanating from the singing and dancing community is, though it's certainly interesting that what we know in all is who didn't. We simply don't know who did it. <br /> <br /> History depends on the procedure of following the clues, where the ideal alibis fail and where they cautiously create falsifications and deceptions. It is interesting to note that this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated despite the knowledge that is traditionally thought too much too soon. <br /> <br /> Quay of the Goldsmiths is the least obscure of Henri-Georges Clouzot's films. It's not even remotely sinister like the shocking Les Diaboliques, as tragic as the compelling Wage of Fear or as eerie as Le Corbeau. Perhaps it is due to the liveliness of the ballrooms and theatrical settings of the 1940s, which all work like the environment of this thriller. <br /> <br /> Clouzot understands and approves his characters, even the rudest ones, where he has more than one vengeful streak with his other films. Where he might have had understanding for the intriguing women of Les Diabolique or the truckers who sink to the level of horrible death risk to unseat themselves from the miserable life in The Wages of Fear, there is not necessarily support or agreement on the part of the director, because these are people who have clearly made the direct decisions that determine their destiny. All the characters in this more set movie have scenes and moments that fascinate us for them, even the hard and cold detective played by Louis Jouvet, who cares about his young adopted son amid all the troubles and despair that occur in the his life at any time with the drop of a hat. <br /> <br /> There is unbridled humor and sensuality, the latter especially from Delair, who neutralizes the pressure to a certain extent. Clouzot was quietly practicing his profession, patient until he made his next inexorable films, in which he would allow his audience not to forgive the tension.
