This is the promise of the trailer that I saw and rented with Hitch. Exactly, a serious film viewer will not expect much more from this title, but, surprisingly, Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta have managed to achieve a theatrical performance that could be metaphorically summarized in their rap dance routine at the end of the film: the their characters form an effective combo that can arouse more than a good laugh with this Sunday afternoon DVD, as long as your appointment is not an exquisite fan of French-Swedish cinema of the '60s. <br /> <br /> PS: the techniques for scoring are all REAL, especially the "cocktail girl" routine!
