This is one of nine short films on the anime album, "The Animatrix". It's my favorite. The work is amazing. The grainy black and white texture perfectly captures the mood the segment is trying to portray. The plot is tight, and the ending is true for film noir. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave The Animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10."
