Graphics: brilliant, of course. The most amazing things were absolutely not given in the trailers. The fighting sequences move very quickly, but after you look at a pair, your eyes should be used to it and it won't look so confused. Cloud has a wide range of swords, and I'd like things to move a little slower just so we could see them, because they were incredibly detailed. Oh, and finally we will see exactly how the Matter is fitted ... <br /> <br /> Music: brilliant too. I was a little nervous, since (from what I've seen) Nobuo isn't the best at writing music to get along (remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence?), But it's brilliant and fits perfectly. I'm glad I preordered the OST. They changed the text of One Winged Angel, so you won't be able to sing if you know the lyrics of Carmina Burana. <br /> <br /> Plot: the first half of the film stages and introduces everyone into a rather complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fighting sequences, once all the players are in place. I wouldn't call it a weak storyline, but it's not nearly as complicated as the game's plot was. I think this is in an attempt to avoid overshadowing the game, and I think it's a good thing ... the film is an entity of its own, and shouldn't try to overcome the original in terms of pure plot. <Br /> <br /> I must admit that I was hoping that this film would bring FF7 to a wider range of people, but this is NOT a mainstream film. I was going to give him only nine stars, just because he doesn't even try to explain anything to the newcomers ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... it looked like hers) gives a little background to the beginning, but it's more than an update compared to a crash course. But then I realized, for me this film is a 10/10, so why should I take points just because others probably won't like it ... if you played the game, or at least you're passively familiar with it, you should see this movie. But you don't need me to tell you. If you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then watch the movie ... even if, without any background, it's still extraordinarily beautiful. You will not get any of the internal references ... which make up 50% of the film (ie everything that is NOT a combat sequence).
