My two best actors are featured in this film: Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan is able to play anything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play beautifully. In this film when he starts his speech "... people with names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say" - it's chilling to see it. <br /> <br /> Robert Young plays the cop who is called to investigate the murder of Samuels (Sam Levine), a civilian, who is chatting with several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the wanted soldier in relation to it - his wallet was found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a kind soldier, missing only his wife. <br /> <br /> The story is told from different points of view. Mitchell and Samuels make a friendship and return to Samuels' apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell feels. "For years you focused on a peanut and now you leave you don't know what to try" he says about the war. <br /> <br /> Ryan is as superb as Monty, the psychotic racist. <Br /> <br /> Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was re-evoked by the film noir. "Crossfire", "They Will not Believe Me" and "The Other Woman" are great examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his usual relaxed self as the philosophical Keeley. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as "strange couple" are exceptional even in their short but profitable roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best racism film ever made.
