Reporter Kimberly Wells presents the smaller side of the news; puffy pieces that are not worth much news. During the shooting of alternative energy in a nuclear power plant, an accident occurs. Friend and cameraman from Kimberly, Richard Adams illegally films the men who control the accident in the control room. Jack Godell, head of the control room, prevents the reactor disaster. After an investigation into the incident shows that nothing is wrong, Jack cannot help but prove that something is not right. Finding that the welding seals on the generator pump are cracked, Jack with Kimberly and Richard try to tell the public and close the unsafe system. <br /> <br /> Almost thirty years ago, the Chinese syndrome is a compelling drama that still has so much relevance today. Nuclear energy has always been a hotly debated topic, whether it is the safest source of alternative energy, radioactive waste or nuclear power plants waiting to be the next Chernobyl. Not only with regards to nuclear energy, The China Syndrome explores freedom of expression, the right to print and big business. Regarding Jack's falsified information discoveries, his knowledge blocks a massive investment in building another nuclear power plant, from which many men try to profit. Kimberly, desperate to get out of the news, sees that the struggle for truth is more important than increasing her career; constantly pushed by Richard, he never wanted to be silenced asking that the public be informed of the incident. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon are simply impeccable. Fonda shows Kimberly as a fragile woman on her face, but emotionally hard and determined to reveal this cover-up. Douglas plays a strong performance like Richard, fighting for honesty and truth. Lemmon shines the most like Jack. His interpretation is a dramatic film. <br /> <br /> China Syndrome is a compelling vision, which still has a lot of importance today as it was the first time it was released.
