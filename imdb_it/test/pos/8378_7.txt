There is a look from "Third Man" to the dark black and white photography of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, ex-star of Universal's images in the 1940s. It is a tale of cleverly filmed jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes excessively possessive of his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and soon intends to make a scheme to kill a man with whom he has a relationship. /> <br /> A taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) seems to give a ride to the woman's lover for the hotel when a moment comes out to chat with a worker who is digging the road. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to muffle the sound of the bullet he puts into the passenger's head from outside the back of the car. When Buka returns to his taxi, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. En route to bringing the murder back to the police, he changes his mind and decides to change his identity with the dead man who has an American passport which means Buka could fulfill his ambition to return to the United States. The plot of the stolen identity becomes thicker when the man of the man (Lederer's wife) shows up at the hotel to accuse Buka of impersonating the dead man. <br /> <br /> It is the kind of plot that movie-goers have probably seen countless times, but here is a nice workout, with very tense scenes like Buka's wife and Lederer planning how to escape from the authorities until a final confrontation with the killer and the police. <br /> <br /> It is extremely engaging, well done and keeps the interest alive with some excellent atmospheric Vienna photographs that will resemble most of the "The Third Man" films. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
