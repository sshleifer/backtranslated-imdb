First love. Adolescent love We all lived it even though it was not as sweet as the protagonists share. "Friends" could be considered an adaptation of the classic "The Blue Lagoon", originally from 1949, and its remakes of 1980 (the most popular, with Brooke Shields) and of 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, without any contact with civilization, "Friends" goes in the opposite direction and it is sure to sound much more true and to be a more difficult film with the contemporary public. Paul and Michelle who, for different reasons, turn their backs on the family and the adult world to live together in a small cottage in southern France. Having only one another and their childlike innocence, their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to support themselves in this sweet story of maturity. This film is controversial so far as the actors are teenagers and are certainly the age indicated in the film (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains a hint of child molestation, nudity, depictions of adolescent sex and teenage pregnancy. But the real controversy is not the argument but the fact that Paul and Michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While this has worked well for non-recoverable lovers at another time and on a desert island, having them in a modern environment presents some very difficult moral issues. The laws that prohibit sexual consent among minors are in force in almost all countries and the lack of sexual education in adolescents is seen as one of the causes of the increase of unwanted pregnancies and abortions in adolescence. A film like this is just a child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy, about a modern society that does not satisfy teenage parents and the laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development, but that are necessary to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and many of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this film is truly a forgotten and raw jewel. The script proceeds with extreme simplicity, albeit with a little sloppiness, but without ever punching to affirm his message, although by today's standards, it is a bit slow. The photography is beautiful and has scenes of great beauty. The acting of the two protagonists varies from truly terrible in some scenes to wonderfully innocent and credible in others. Pop music, unlike most of today's productions, is used with taste and sometimes the lyrics talk about the thoughts of the protagonists. Overall, this is a delightful piece, even if moral values ​​are not in agreement with yours.
