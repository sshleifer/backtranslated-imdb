This is a film that must be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen if you haven't seen the first two films, but the kind of people who see this movie will probably own the box, or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn't be waiting for Blade Runner; the film budget doesn't go far enough, and it's a much crazier ride. <br /> <br /> Essentially the film is a science fiction set in the future of Yokohama (filmed in Hong Kong as is obvious) on a society where it is illegal to procreate. Sho Aikawa resumes a similar role from Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for contraceptive cops. Takashi Miike is not one who gives you all his reasons on a plate, but it can be assumed that the law on procreation (applied by giving people the pill) is there because of an excessive population, a longer life and so on . It is interesting to note that the dialogue in the film is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their parts, as always, brilliantly) speak Japanese, and some speak English. People have criticized English like wood, but I have not encountered any problems. Furthermore, another person felt that the themes of homosexuality throughout the film were offensive; he said that Takashi Miike was anti-homosexual. It could very well be (and not all artists have to be on the left), but I can't see this film as an insult to homosexuals. It merely refers to philosophies of ancient Greece when homo or bisexuality were more common. The film contains similar proportions of action-packed and moving moments for DoA 2, although in this film the action is based on multiple martial arts and is performed in an excellent Hong Kong style. Cinematography in the film is very eye-catching, with symmetrical shots, good color control to give the air a polluted look, and it's nice to see long, uncut shots that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, there is a lot to appreciate in this film: a good sense of humor, an exciting action and some very beautiful moments. It's a great ending for the series. Could you criticize it for being a little rough, but it's not part of the charm?
