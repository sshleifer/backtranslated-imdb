If people were really that stupid, I could be SRW - Supreme Ruler of the World. In this Knotts he plays a bean counter cluttered with a small city of wild water managed by a group of simple dishonest only slightly brighter than him. When things seem a little shaky to criminals, they go to get a picture of the pathetic Figg. A lot of laughter as Knotts does his usual stumbling and stumbling act. I particularly liked the extension cable scene; donkey status at its highest level.
