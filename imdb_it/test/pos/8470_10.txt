The first spoken image has returned from oblivion and now you can listen to it and see it! In the autumn of 1894, in the Edison lab complex in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Dickson's associate William Dickson tried to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to record sounds and images together. In the case, Dickson was unable to synchronize the reproduction of sounds and images, so this experimental film was never released to pay the public ... and consequently (unlike many silent films that Dickson made for Edison in this moment) has no official title. The silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for years, known to film historians as a mute curiosity. It was also known that the "soundtrack" had been recorded on one of the raw wax cylinders that languished in Edison's national historic site ... although no one knew which one. <br /> <br /> But now it's changed. Recently, the curators have located the wax cylinder, which had broken into several pieces. These were reassembled: a reproduction was obtained and the sound was digitized. The veteran Hollywood soundtrack editor, Walter Murch, cleaned up the background noise and optimized the digitization to make it synchronized with the film's image, which Murch had digitally compressed at 30 fps. The sound and the image are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The film begins with the voice of an off-screen man: "Is the rest of you friends ready? Go ahead!" (The invisible speaker remains unidentified, but probably Dickson's assistant, Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dickson plays a violin in a huge funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison's audio recording devices) next to him , in full view of the camera, two lab assistants hug each other for a quick ballroom dance to the rhythm of Dickson's music. <br /> <br /> The film takes just 17 seconds: enough time to allow us to admire this crude technology before being laughed at the sight of two men dancing in each other's arms: by the way, here's a WARNING: a well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ("The Celluloid Closet" by the late Vito Russo) includes an enlargement of the frame of this film and identifies it as "The Gay Brothers". This is wrong. "The Gay Brothers" is a completely different film, made by Dickson in the Edison laboratory during the same period. period. 'The Gay Brothers' has never had a soundtrack: it is a short fiction film about two brothers who are NOT "gay" in the sense that Russo meant it. The deceased Russian, for his own reasons, wanted us to perceive Dickson's experimental film (probably the first musical film!) As an artifact of 19th-century homoeroticism. (Hmm, what is there about gay and musicals?) Sorry, but this is just not the content here. <br /> <br /> This vitally important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. I have often argued that no "lost" film should ever be considered irretrievable unless it was deliberately destroyed: I am pleased to announce that this film is finally available to the public as its producer intended, more than a century after it was shot!
