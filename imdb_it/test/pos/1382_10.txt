I had the chance to see him today at a friend's house and I was impressed by what he achieved on such a small budget. Not that this has ever bothered me, since I love low budget science fiction like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was not a budget affair, so while money helps, it takes a lot more than throwing money to make it good. <br /> <br /> The story is simple at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner into space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They find that even the prisoner has made it, it is an avalanche of cold stone and this is only the beginning of their problems. <br /> <br /> The effects, with the exception of the firefights, are minimalist and add to the film without overwhelming it. Sometimes the effects of the computer seem a bit ambiguous, but they serve their purpose well and add to the story, giving a futuristic touch to the process. Movies like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style versus substance and replacing special effects for a plot, like all too many Hollywood offerings. <br /> <br /> Although none of the actors obtains Oscar-winning material, it is strictly planned and filmed and at an hour and ten minutes is not welcome at all. The characters do not get very rich, but then not even in Predator, which looks like touch. The great man Mike Mitchell is a good position for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and muscles. <br /> <br /> Some people may be annoyed by the lack of explanations towards the end, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things unexplained, it's not so obscure that you can't handle them at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. br /> <br /> A little crackling film about an enterprising, cheap team, but a fun way to spend an hour. If this is what they can do with a little bit of money I would like to see what they would do with a little more money, and I hope that the film industry and the talentless chairs will not tear up all the creativity. <Br /> <br /> Recommended.
