OK, I'm Italian but there aren't so many Italian films like this one. I think the plot is very good for the 3/4 of the film, but the final is too simple, too predictable. But it's the only small mistake. The Consequences of Love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack. I would love the lighting work on it. The best thing is a great, great actor. You know, if your name is Al Pacino now everyone would still have talked about this performance. But he is only a great Italian theatrical actor called Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tells me this movie and this kind of performance is too slow, it's so boring, so many silences, but I think this is awesome, it's the right way to describe the love story between a very talented young girl, the niece of the Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the old mysterious Toni. One of my favorite Italian films.
