I have seen this movie twice at the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is in competition and I really hope that Esteban Sapir will get one of the prizes (at least the best image prize). <br /> <br /> As a fan of silent films I am interested in contemporary films that cite or recreate the language of a year's cinema. The previous reviewer highlighted the quotations from Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it, the film refers directly to Lang's Metropolis and the allegorical-parabolic character of its plots. But I didn't see Murnau in it. However, there is an obvious tribute to Melies: the Moon with a human face (here smoky), the mountains painted with paper and the city landscapes. I really liked the film especially for its images and in the meantime I found the story about dumbness and the creative means of communication used by the deaf city inhabitants very interesting. From this perspective, this film is a unique reflection on the mute of silent cinema, because in the films of the silent period it is difficult to find stories with silent characters. In this case it can be questioned whether the plot of the stolen voices was the motivation for the shape of the silent film, or there is the intention to play on the muteness of silent films. Another example of this kind of reflection that I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, in which the inhabitants of a mountain village have restrictions in using their voices. I'm going to write an article about it, if you know films related to this topic, please let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's film to all film buffs (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival). <br /> <br /> PS: the winners were announced and the film won the award for best photography!
