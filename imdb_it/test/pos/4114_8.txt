Much better than is generally taken for granted, this version of "Lost Horizon" not only had great music and beautiful landscapes, but also some splendid mountain photographs. A special edition laser disc was released some years ago, which added over 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music and lots of bonus material. So why isn't this on DVD?! It is sometimes difficult to distinguish studies. Certainly the roles could have been assigned to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, in acting or in melodious pipes? The singer and dancer Bobby Van is very funny, Michael York is a pretty opportunistic villain, and seeing Sir John Gielgud dressed as Chang may seem silly but actually works very well on the screen. Trust me, you have to check this movie - if you can find it!
