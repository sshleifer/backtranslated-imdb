... instead, look at it as a great story about the growth of African American males in the mid-1960s in the Chicago ghettos. For all of you out there under the age of 50, "What's Happening" was a carefree, easy-going sitcom with very few important moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) concerning a group of young African American school children who lived in a working class neighborhood . I really liked it: it has no real connection with this movie. "Cooley High" was born as the basis for "What's Happening", but its serious nature did not register well with the test audience, so it was redone as a comedy, even if the "What's Happening" titles continue to read which was based on this film. <br /> <br /> This film starts in the light, but touches many aspects of life that are unique for the turbulent 60s and also other aspects of growth that are timeless. The boys deal with sex, betrayal, unemployment, despair and even premature death. The ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a fantastic Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not new enough to play on premium cable channels and is not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and even in the few venues for those movies.
