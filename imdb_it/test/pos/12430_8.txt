This was on Showtime the other night, and I thought it would be another shitty festival made for the video, like "Earth vs. the Spider" or any of HBO's other horror short films. Instead, I found a classic comedy / gore. It was legitimately fun, and surprisingly, the acting was pretty good. Even my wife, a person who hated horror in general, agreed and laughed in pieces. Furthermore, the FX was of high quality. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looked like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of the Shaun of the Dead pair. Definitely worth looking at, but don't take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The End.
