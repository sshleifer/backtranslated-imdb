Normally, I can't review online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch science fiction movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get the damned 'Joxer the Mighty' song) out of her mind, she's been there for ten years or so, she opens casually when someone (me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have any idea how idiotic you are? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than what he puts (in the most literal sense) of why in the holy name of G-d, you watch his films? No one watches a Bruce Campbell film when he wants to see something brilliant and intelligible, we watch them so we feel better about ourselves (like those people who watch Jerry Springer and eat the Chunky Monkey), and to be easily entertained by a senseless psycho . I personally love Bruce Campbell's films. I'm not a complete idiot, in fact, I consider myself an intellectual and a scholar (haha, shut up, Ally). His films reflect crazy, random, bizarre, and ridiculous ideals that can please anyone with a brain, screaming or not. That, and he was a little sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even with facial hair. I consider this film an excellent 10, just because I can. If you can't take simplistic plot patterns (if there are any), hot babes in science fiction (skin, spandex) and family, if not exhausted, insanity points of view, then shout loudly, don't watch the movie (or any that mentions the name Bruce Campbell). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was great in this movie! Way to go, Ted! You did the best with what you had. ; |
