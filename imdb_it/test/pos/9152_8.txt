The Beloved Rogue is a wonderful vintage piece. It represents the Paris of the 145th century in great Hollywood style, offering however a darker side of existence as it would be lived by the poor. And the snow. It moves continuously, adding to the severity of the setting - brilliant! The setting is enhanced by the strange cast of characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarves. <br /> <br /> A brilliant performance is shot by John Barrymore, surpassed only by the magnificent Conrad Veidt, who plays a degenerate, dissolute Louis XI to perfection. And yes, Veidt takes the nose on purpose, pushing his portrait to wonderfully ironic limits.
