I just watched this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival today and I loved it. The synopsis was listed in our program as "an old Shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicidal party". I wasn't sure if I would have seen it because when I read it I liked the idea of ​​a "suicide party", it seemed very interesting to me, but "the old Shakespearean actor" made me fear that the film would be kind to dry and boring. But I decided to try it. I'm glad I did it. It was not at all dry and boring, the dialogue was great, cleverly entertaining, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was exceptional in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by the performance of Laura San Giacomo, it usually annoys me, but I really enjoyed watching it in this film. I think that the part of Judge Reinhold could have been improved by another actor, sometimes it seemed like a kind of cheese and seemed to act, not like I was watching this character. But the film was so good that I could forgive an actor's embarrassment. I would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public. Who knew suicide could be so fun?
