After seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this movie. I mean, I'm not interested in the stupid "stoner comedies". I'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together, smoke a bowl and go and take a look at this movie with the Simpson boy and a guy named "Billy Bob". It should have been a good time, but the film is not really that funny - it's a pity somebody had to go and shout. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I discovered that the trailer was misleading after the theaters had already started, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Beautiful locations, quality production and excellent performances of the whole cast. Looking back, the twists and turns were not entirely unexpected, but I didn't find it cumbersome because the premise was so compelling. <br /> <br /> So why was this engaging drama marketed as a comedy? Did something happen to the manufacturer, leaving the associate producers to do the marketing themselves?
