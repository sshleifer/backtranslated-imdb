When the movie "The Cure" begins, we discover a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenager who lives with his paranoid mother, and living next to him is a boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and head to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik discovers that Dexter has AIDS, he looks for tea with leaves and water to improve it. But when the cover of The National Enquirer says that a New Orleans doctor has found a cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for treatment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship films ever made. Show unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend and the mother of his best friend. Everything is so well done, nothing has to be changed. Not only do I give this a 10/10 to be a fantastic friendship film, but it's also a sad, but fun and funny AIDS film. And the tragic ending with Dexter's AIDS contraction is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.
