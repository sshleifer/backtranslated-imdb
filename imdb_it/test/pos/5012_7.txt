The basis for this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players ever. STUEY is a tight and cohesive biopic of a true poker ace whose life is a one-way journey along the Highway to Hell with few deviations. <br /> <br /> This dramatic film stands out from other poker movies. It represents a rare and serious attempt to bring a true story of gambling compulsion to the big screen. The complete obsession that cancels any proximity to spirituality and cancels out any possibility of redemption. This is the least likely film that a Vegas Casino executive would recommend. And it's the only poker DVD that's likely to be found on the shelves of Gamblers Annonymous. <br /> <br /> There are scenes in this film that poker fans are sure to refer to some of the best game scenes ever. Stu reads his opponent's hand and, in particular, a Texas Hold'em bluff scene. <br /> <br /> Prophetically, at the beginning of the film we see a young Stu pulled out of his penny by a group of local thugs. Poker is for loners who seek revenge. It's a game of patience that bullies lack. "You can't bully!" it could very well be an underlying sentiment of punitive strength that a poker champion unleashes on his opponents. <br /> <br /> Conservatives will consider this film as a warning of a soul lost in sin. They could summon Mark Twain: "The best dice roll is to throw them away." The young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and comprehensive vision. They may not have heard of the Twain quote, but they will surely remember an observation made by Stu's dazed friend who learns from the young Stuey who won a car from a local character in a night game. "You can't go to hell and can't wait for the trip to come." <br /> <br /> The mosaic of Las Vegas cartoons that we see in STUEY will remain in the memory for a long time. Frank Sinatra, the most generous tipper? Forget about it! No one is satisfied with extravagance like a hot-shot player. And for Las Vegas visitors who may not know the impact of tips on the quality of their stay, look at the scene of Stu he controls in a Las Vegas hotel! <br /> <br /> 'This is what I had to do, this is where I needed to be. Hollywood movie stars, Washington politicians and Las Vegas gamblers. "
