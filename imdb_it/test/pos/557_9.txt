Wayne Wang's direction could be the ingredient that made this film much more impressive to me than "Slums of Beverly Hills", which covers a very similar terrain. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is compelling. The real chemistry there. This film managed to take me into the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character pounds at all the nerves that a narcissistic parent can touch in an insecure teenager. Incredibly, he manages to do it without encountering a florid or intentionally sadistic madness. And, Natalie Portman deflects any attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child, untainted by the cynical complacency of Natasha Lyonne's character in "Beverly Hills Slum". Portman's character is a teenager with dignity under stress, an unusual creature in modern movies. The film achieves a very satisfactory resolution without trying too much. I highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
