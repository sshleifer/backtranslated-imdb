This film made me suffer and I LOVED it! I LOVE! He haunted me for days. I think Erika is the kind of character you hate and cry simultaneously. The most terrifying sex scene ever taken on the film. This is the best of Haneke's work so far. He is the only living director to redefine the rhythm since Kubrick. The violence in this film is wonderful. In a word, the film is about self-hatred. In one sentence, the film is about trying to find love to stop hating yourself and discover that it is a hopeless hope.
