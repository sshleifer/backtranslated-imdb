TV movies generally don't receive as much recognition or credit as great movies - and it's usually for good reason, but the 1996 HBO movie The Late Shift is easily one of the best TV movies ever. Based on the revealing book by Bill Carter, The Late Shift talks about NBC's handling of late-night talk show hosts David Letterman and Jay Leno when it came to filling up the free seat of Tonight Show, once held by Johnny Carson. Let's see what happens in front of the camera - author Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately we can never know for sure what really happened when the time came when Johnny Carson would be replaced by Letterman or Leno - but The Late Shift offers us an interesting reality possible. Although it is simply a very well made film, The Late Shift also does a great job of portraying all sides fairly fairly - even if you wonder if the film makes Letterman and Leno too cute for boys; especially Leno, who seems a little too holy. <br /> <br /> The shows are also very good. In a Golden Globe winning performance, Kathy Bates plays Helen Kushnick, the extremely exuberant manager of Leno, who according to Carter and the film / film was very problematic for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick was actually suitable for Bill Carter for defamation on this portrait!). John Michael Higgins comes out of his usual concerts to get extravagant little comic parts and gives an excellent performance like David Letterman - giving Letterman an excellent impression but also creating a dimensional and recognizable character. Daniel Roebuck gives a good performance as Leno but he is not up to some of the other talents in the film - Roebuck probably did the best that someone could have done, it's just an amiable aspect when someone tries to make an impression or a portrait of Leno. Bob Balaban (a Warren Littlefield squirrel), Treat Williams (a magician like Michael Ovitz) and Ed Begley Jr. (a pompous Rod Perth) also give memorable support performances. <br /> <br /> Late Shift is certainly one of the best made-for-TV movies I've ever seen. I suppose if one has not watched David Letterman or Jay Leno, The Late Shift may not be for them, but it is an interesting film for those entering late-night politics - something that has recently increased its ugly head once again with 2009 -10 Debate of Conan / Leno / NBC.
