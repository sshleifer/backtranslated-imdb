I love everything about the family boy. <br /> <br /> My favorite family characters are Brian and Stewie and I like episodes when he presents them mainly as "Road to Rhode Island" (Season 2), because they interact great. The comments I make make me the points. Peter's behavior is also a lot of fun since some of the things he does "are so brilliant that they are delayed". The dubbing is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane who supplies the voices to half of the Griffin family and their pervert near Glenn Quagmire and how he runs this range (particularly with singing), I don't know. He deserves his two Emmys for providing the voice of the evil infant genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and completely insane character, the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) is that the things he says show that he takes care of his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I found annoying is that in UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflect the program itself, but rather marketing. <br /> <br /> If you like Family Guy, I highly recommend another Seth MacFarlane American project Dad who uses a different style of humor but is still extremely funny.
