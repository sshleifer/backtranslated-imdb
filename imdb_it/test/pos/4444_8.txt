I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his films from the 1980s had their moments, but they often turned out to be imitations of second-rate Dario Argento. With the exception of the funny "Zombi" (which was an imitation of George Romero), I didn't like them much. I know that Italian horror often overlooks the plot, but the plot and characters in his films were too bare even by standards. This is why "Do not Torture an Duckling" surprised me. It is actually a very well done film with a compelling mystery of murder. It is perhaps the best yellow ever made, only seriously rivaled by the voices of Dario Argento in the genre. And unlike the previous Fulci yellow "A Lizard in a Woman's Skin", this never drags on. <br /> <br /> Fulci's management here is quite good. It keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer's interest all the time. Furthermore, the conclusion of the mystery comes as a complete surprise for the public. It also adds some clever touches, such as the cheerful soul music during a particularly disturbing sequence of cemetery beats. Overall, the violence here is contained and used only when necessary for the story. The acting is also good for the most part, full of familiar faces of Italian exploitation cinema of the '70s. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are fantastic in everything. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is too exaggerated. It is the only laughable aspect of the film. "Do not Torture an Duckling" certainly comes with my recommendation and could be a good introduction to the yellow subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
