GRANDMA IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER Ganny is the best movie I've ever seen. the plot was as if nothing had ever been seen or done before these people were really blessed by a talent, no joke, I love this movie. I need to buy it but I can't find it anywhere. it's a dream for me to go and meet the actors and try to make a grandmother 2. i rented GRANNY to the Broadway video and kept it for a week longer than I should have and asked them if I could buy it from them they said not a big disappointment and an even bigger one the week after I returned it I wanted to go and rent it again, but came to find out that the Broadway video was out of business. if anyone has the movie or knows where I can buy it, please tell me to email me at iloverot@aol.com
