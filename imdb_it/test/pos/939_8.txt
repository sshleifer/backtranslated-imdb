Brilliant Australian film ... A little slow in the beginning, but once you go you can't stop laughing. When I saw the film I originally vaguely knew the plot, since I'm not sure that many people are aware of the fact that this film is based on a true story, and more specifically on the director and his mother (obviously the names have been changed ). I knew it only because the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, somehow my stepmother kept a secret that we would meet Matthew Newton after the screening ... A gentle gentleman (except for a particularly bad accident with his ex)! Brillian's casting also with Sam Neill and others! A great reason to continue to support the Australian film industry
