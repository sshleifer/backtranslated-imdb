This is a very noir type of episode. He starts with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girl, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - daughter-in-law of John Huston, who knew something about the film noir) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen enters the house while Jim takes her daughter from the back seat and takes her to her room. Then he discovers that Karen has disappeared without a trace. He clearly calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they don't see any sign of Karen, but they find the neighbor next door killed in the bushes. So this makes Jim an immediate suspect. <br /> <br /> This is a great little mystery and the first part of the story is shown by Rocky asking Jim to retrace the story once more. Rocky suggests that Jim, by telling him the story, could remember a small detail he didn't think was important at the time, but now it could lead to a clue as to what happened. It's a very well written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky character from a grifter to a worried parent. It is also a long way to show that Rocky is not just a trackless old man. As he says "You come to me because I'm your father and I'm smarter than you!" This is one of those times when we see where Jim had his intelligence. <br /> <br /> This episode also includes the appearance of Hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the series "Dark Shadows" and continued to play Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the "Incredible Hulk" series a few years after. Here it seems exceptional. <br /> <br /> This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that would continue to pop up in the Rockford Files almost every time they needed a family of criminals. This time, his Vincent Minette whom Rockford helps capture. <br /> <br /> Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance in the series and Dennis is quietly relegated by a police lieutenant who was in the first season episodes of a Sargent police. I imagine they thought it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, although I prefer the next Lieutenant Chapman to Lieutenant Diehl. <br /> <br /> There is no typical "Rockford" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.
