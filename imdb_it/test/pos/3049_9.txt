This movie enchanted me tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it without interruption. John Voight, this cast of little-known black actresses and especially children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How nice to see the early work of this experienced actor, as well as the excellent portrait of Paul Bilfield by Mad Billy. I can't understand why anyone could say that Hume Cronyn is a disbeliever in the role of superintendent. Who would they choose? Character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is commendable, an actor like Lane would have weakened the role. Cronyn was an excellent choice for the part. I will count this film as a real treasure to keep in memory.
