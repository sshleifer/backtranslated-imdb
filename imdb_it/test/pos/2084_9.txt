Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave this a terrifying and expressionist look. The scenes are shot with strange angles, in particular scenes involving Zachary Scott, the killer-figurative and literal. His sociopathic behavior portends another superb, medium-budget film "The Stepfather" of over two decades. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is excellent, although (although it's not his fault) it's hard to think of Joyce Compton as anyone other than the singer in "The Awful Truth.") Scott, Bennett, Emerson , DeCamp (in particular, and even though he plays an older woman who looks gorgeous) - couldn't have been covered. <br /> <br /> Putting a disturbing tenant-in-the-house in women's history against a background of psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off beautifully. Not at all trivial. Nothing trivial. <br /> <br /> The resolution is a little bit, unfortunately. Not Emerson is meeting with Bennett. This makes sense. But Scott is sent too fast. I look more like a Mr. Ripley character, who may have escaped everything - botulism, rap murder, jealous sisters - and disappeared into the big world beyond this story. This would not have prevented the substantially happy ending of the secretary and her boss eventually met.
