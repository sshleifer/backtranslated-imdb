pity they showed palms that could not be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... this was filmed in New Zealand ... This case of Martha Moxley was "cold" for 20-25 years ... her family has worked hard to keep him alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided he didn't want to be remembered just for his involvement in the Nicole Simpson case ... which could have been detrimental to his reputation (if he wasn't already) ... Anyway , he followed while the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships that Martha has formed .... Unattended boys who come of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always in the loop ... <br /> <br /> since they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star ... she was a pretty and pretty girl next door. Besides that, the other characters were really cool, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were good too, customers had to keep everything in the 70s and go back to the 90s .... <br /> <br /> He kept my interest even when I realized about Skakel's boyfriend. ..
