The case of the real life of an innocent leader of the First Nations (the Indian) by a Winnipeg city official (the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The real case caused his fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small thing about Martin Luther King. The misery of the First Nations people is becoming a staple in the diet of Canadian cinema. What makes this film worth seeing is the attention to family reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis asks for forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig asks for justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have minor appearances, almost cameos. The next generation star, Eric Schweig, leaves his mark on this film with a powerful performance. An honorable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk, who collected over 100 films to his credit. His portrait of the soul in difficulty Inspector Dowson was worthy of a Gemini Award (the Canadian Emmy) with Eric Schweig. Special effects (jumps, dream sequences) are occasional and not excessive. Pair this with some beautiful northern Canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and First Nations people like the Neil Stonechild case, and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience.
