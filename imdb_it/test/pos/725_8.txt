this film was probably the best "scary movie" I've seen in years. chilling could be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise. if it has any defect it would be the excessive use of the whole meaning of the concept of life. Since no one really knows this answer, you will definitely set sail in murky waters when incorporating this concept into a movie. put it aside and the movie is pretty funny. the caring pope should emerge as one of the next bright young women in the film industry. the rest of the cast was a little shaky, but since the focus was on Sarajakov (Pope dearly), his performance anchored the film. sometimes the bad acting abilities of his costar weren't a problem, since it wasn't their performances that fed this film. (Luckily). watch this movie you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> t
