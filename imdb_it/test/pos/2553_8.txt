This almost documentary look at an enterprising guy who lives in the body shop area outside New York is real to the core. True lighting Real sound. Less changes to the entire film than 1 minute in most films. And while there's little script, there's a story. Shot in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of a boy's life doing something from nothing. He has a place to live that he makes his own, he has a good job and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe. Even the people in the cutting shop area take a look at this culture that I didn't know. They seem mostly decent and pay Ale as it seems every day, apparently worried about his well-being. The actor (I think) who plays Ale says more with a facial expression than you can imagine. This reminded me of what a real little movie can do. It shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. I highly recommend.
