I don't know why critics consider it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. Dark - yes, bizarre - no. It is sad and with many emotions, especially with the story of Pinguin. They say it has elements of S & M but I don't really find anything like it, except for Catwoman's whip. <br /> <br /> This film is deeper than its genre and the villains are not just crazy fools like in a masquerade. They have strong motivations with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) She's not just a sexy girl who likes steel jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin ... well, at the end of the film you really regret it so much by Danny DeVito). Once again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and wears his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can see that this is a Tim Burton film, because it has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But music is also fantastic and adapts to emotions.
