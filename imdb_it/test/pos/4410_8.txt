I was happy to see this gem of a movie available on DVD. Despite being a "TV movie" and shot in 16mm, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a "London taxi driver", along with their wits and family commitments. Even the most unfortunate of the candidates, "Titanic" with his non-communicative wife, it was possible to see how Jack Rosenthal managed to create a fun, sometimes tragic fragment of London life in a fun 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Originally presented as a vehicle for Mick Ford (pun intended), the acting quality of an ensemble cast that included Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph and Maureen Lipman (Mrs Rosenthal ) meant that Mick could have higher billing, but had to work hard in front of competing talent. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after its release in 1991, it's still as fresh as ever!
