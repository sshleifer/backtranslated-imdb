One of my wishes is to be a director, and I just have to say that I will never be able to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is to watch it, I got so involved and I was extremely impressed. <br /> <br /> Estevez and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these 2. <br /> <br /> As well as the relationship between Sheen and her daughter, Estevez's sister in the film. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and definitely in my top 10. I want the DVD!
