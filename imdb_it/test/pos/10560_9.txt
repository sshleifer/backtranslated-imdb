I've never read Sarah Water's book. Even though I haven't read the book, the 3-hour movie is very interesting. Start with an interesting plot with a twisted ending. I must say that these 2 actresses are fantastic. Sally Hawkins is stunningly successful in interpreting the character in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love. Their romance flourishes slowly as they spend more and more time together. The love scene is very tender and emotional, well acted. The end is quite intriguing and these 2 ended up together after all they went through, which is good. Overall, it's a great movie to see, a very interesting plot with excellent performance.
