I have a completely partial point of view, mainly because I live and enjoy the lifestyle of the club's culture. As a DJ and frequent club goer, I see honesty in this film and I love it. If you don't know the club / rave culture then it will be a great foray into that culture for anyone who doesn't know it firsthand. The honest representation of emotions and human problems in the part of Jip I loved. The characters were well built and I really enjoyed this movie. I really don't like the fact that you have to write ten lines on this website. I will write at least 6 or 7, but I feel I can represent my point with less than ten. Here are some extra lines to make IMDb gods happy.
