"Two Hands" is a fun and entertaining story of the Australian lowlifes. The script contrasts the world of fast money and mortal acts with the inexplicability of destiny and circumstances. In a subtle way we are asked to reflect on the concept that the most important events in our lives are sometimes generated without us being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of destiny and circumstances bring Jimmy, the main character, into situations that lead to the realization of his superficial dreams and, ultimately, to the understanding of a more promising world. <br /> <br /> The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with Heath Ledger's wit, is a boy who grew up without opportunities. The high crime world that pays is the maximum attraction for its dull senses. His friends' love and help guide him to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed and well acted. The gang of criminals staggers between the sympathetic and the contemptible, keeping us interested in their crazy jokes throughout the film.
