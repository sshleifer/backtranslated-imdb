I love this movie, one of my favorite ever. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and hassle free. He believes that praying to Saint Anne will solve all the problems of her and her friends. The sub-plot of the evil villain to get his father's property is fun and clever. His brothers are the kind of brothers a girl would like to have. Also, look for "Aunt Bee" as her mother, a strong Irish woman who will not leave her home to raise her family. They don't make them that way anymore, that's for sure.
