This film reminds me of "Boys' Hood", "Menace to Society", "South Central" and others of its kind and also shares actors with some of them. The "us against the law" mentality of the film is emphasized by the all-black neighborhood against the almost completely white police force. Here the policemen are so bad that they look like caricatures and in a scene I even grab the boys while they drive in a car they have just "freed" from its owner. It's like an asshole from an old western, but the contemporary setting makes it all too realistic. <br /> <br /> The story centers on the young Jason Petty and his friends, to whom the school is just an inconvenience that takes time from their "real occupation" to upgrade cars. This happens to be Newark, N.J., a ruined city without work, but notoriously high on crime. In reality the problem is so serious that all the policemen wrote "Car Theft" on their back, to show that an entire unit must be dedicated to this particular crime. <br /> <br /> The boys use a "thin Jim" "cheerfully breaking the cars and going to joy, as if it were not a big problem. They run into real trouble only when the police grab them. The violent, lieutenant Nazi, he has a vengeance against the boys, seeing them not as human beings who could be worthy of redemption, but as human goals. In fact, he somewhat remembers that sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw ghetto, who brought down the Jews for pleasure in "Schindler's List" movie. When the boys steal a police car as a punishment for the ambush, things go down in a predictable way. They are severely beaten by the police and Jason ends up in prison. Clearly these are "bad boys", which They would steal your car in a minute, but the film wants us to see them as anti-heroes, showing Jason that he protects his sister and his friend who are caring for their grandmother, the film left us asking which way to go and who yes sen the saddest: the boys whose lives are falling, the honest citizens whose cars are stolen from the right and left and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shooting at any time or the city of Newark itself, the spirit of whose law she is betrayed by brutal and soulless policemen. <br /> <br /> Despite the exaggerated portrait of the latter, the film offers a realistic rendering of the ghetto, the protagonists and their families and the culture of car theft in a city where there seem to be only 2 routes career: law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the whole subject of drugs is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> Directors (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously prejudiced against the Newark police, who, we hope, are not so bad as to be portrayed here. Nevertheless, they gave us another strong and touching story about the city center and the black youth gone wrong and Sharron Corley is as good as Jason.
