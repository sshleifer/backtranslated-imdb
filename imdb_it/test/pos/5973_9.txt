I agree with another reviewer, this is such a shocking film, that it will be difficult to see him again soon, even if by quality alone, he deserves a repeated view. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and the superb direction make this film worthy of the exciting price of the vision. <br /> <br /> There is a scene, of the two partisans who drag themselves through the snow to escape a patrol, which is perhaps, for sheer physicality, the most incredible performance I have ever seen. Indeed, although not episodic - the story flows - this is a film of memorable scenes. There is the passage of rations between the partisans, the snow scenes, the ruined farm scene, the meetings in the houses, the interrogation, the "basement" scene, the "ascent". Everyone stands out like jewels in a necklace. <br /> <br /> For me, religiosity is not obvious. Frankly, I don't think he would have been allowed into a Soviet film. I see it as an existential parable about the value of life. Here is a story in which the hero - and he is a true hero - becomes the villain and the weakest becomes the strongest. Is it a mystical process or dictated by circumstances? Is there a transfiguration, but does it come from within or from without? You have to see the movie to understand the problems, because they can't be discussed without revealing too much of the story. I can't say enough about acting. It is difficult for me to choose which of the leads is more interesting. I'm not familiar with the Soviet movie of the 70s and I'm not familiar with any of the actors, but they're all superb. I also noticed how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto's childish angels. <br /> <br /> In the end there is some confusion. Apparently there is a previous relationship between Private Sotnikov and the interrogator Portnov, but this is left hanging. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But compared to the overall experience these are quibbles. This is a film that will mark you for life.
