Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too "soft" and too verbal - it's probably how he really lives. This time, it fits the character. Although I exaggerate when the verdict is issued. <br /> <br /> The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the New York State response are remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica uprising / revolt. Attica has had a strong impact on this country. Perhaps the film will stimulate someone to do research on history. <br /> <br /> I don't remember a feature film taken from the perspective of the prisoners - although there is a nice piece of PBS with the real Attica survivors / participants. The perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in "Against the Wall" with Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III and Frederic Forrest. <br /> <br /> During the day, we shouted, "Attica! Attica!" It was good to hear it in the film. Reported to the memory. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is the natural wigs that Morris Chestnut and other African Americans have to wear. It would have been easy for these people to grow up a little.
