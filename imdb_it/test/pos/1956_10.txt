I have no complaints about this movie, except for the disturbing body scenes. I stumbled across the TV one night. The acting was really incredible, I didn't expect it to be better than it looked! I thought Keanu's (who plays the SAME since 1986, which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really cool *, and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! It is a new awakening of reality in the 1980s, compared to other teen movies made by the brat (although I really like those wives). All in all, I like it!
