it's not a bad movie but the acting and the script can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is mostly like the movie. it is difficult for a lost generation to have a life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and that something else includes caring for people with "bad habits" if you understand me but this comes with the territory. this film represents me and I like it. I have a rage in me that I talk about barley with people, I live in a messy society and I can't enter and I don't want to, and this is also the story of the film, if you like me you can understand the real movie, if you don't find it it easy and cheap.
