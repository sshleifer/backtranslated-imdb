When I rented this movie, I almost expected it to be a low budget, less film than Indy, but I thought I'd give it a try. I started looking at Part 1 and couldn't back down until it ended 3 hours later. It was by far one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. From writing to directing to performances, I was laughing, crying and singing throughout the course of Nan Astley's rite of passage from innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this movie. I had never heard of her before, but now I will always remember the vulnerability and strength I felt during her performance. She, Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoil they feel most when they face an alternative form of sexuality. The fact that the film is set in the 1890s not only educates the public about homosexuality at that time, but makes a statement about our society today. You have to see this movie and, probably like me, you'll take a trip to the store to add it to your collection.
