I loved it. I had just passed half of "The Glass House" (turned off ... god, what a sweat of predictable plot and bad acting) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was great. I love both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster. I liked the escape of the whole scenario, the travels around Europe in the 60s - yet they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. He held my attention completely, even though I thought the parts were incredible.
