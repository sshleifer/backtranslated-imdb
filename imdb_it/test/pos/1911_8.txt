A classic blaxploitation, this film was terribly influential in rap music for Rudy Ray Moore's "toasts". Toasts are long stories of remembrance that are fun and provide a point, and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap. For more information on toasts, Rudy Ray Moore and why this movie is important, go to Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> Which just lets us talk about the movie itself. This film contains a large amount of "laughter-with-funny clothes-and-hair", because almost every shot has a sort of outrageous element or dialogue. He begins when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who set him up and brought him to justice. I was not aware of the fact that prisons release people so that they can prove their innocence, but that is me, I am a neophyte in the prison scene. He is helped in this by Queen Bee, who is Dolemite's main prostitute and directed her brothel while she was away. He also put all his prostitutes through the karate school, so he now has an army of female karate fighters. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case provided an interesting contrast. The first part I saw during the lunch break while I was exercising, and I didn't like it at all. It struck me as a particularly badly done blaxploitation, with a ridiculous story, a shoddy craft ... well, I guess this sounds like he had SOME craftsmanship and tons of outrageous places, clothes and dialogues. But I wasn't having fun, on the contrary, it made me feel dirty. Let's face it, a white guy watching something like that to laugh at clothes and the things the characters say is essentially having fun with what's racist: how ridiculous those black people are, the nonsense they say. I wasn't really having fun, I wasn't laughing, and I couldn't wait to watch the rest. <br /> <br /> Later that night, when I was in a "much more relaxed state", I looked at the rest ?? and he legitimately loved it. Like Disco Padrino, which I had seen a few days before, this one has a warmth and a sweetness in the center that make it nice even when it's silly or violent. The character of Dolemite has an element of self-parody of him that makes the whole thing fun, and the appearance of different actors who were also in Disco Padrino implies that we are observing the group effort of a group of friends who just want to do something fun together. Even the poor dubbing, karate fights and everything else make it even more fascinating. <br /> <br /> What I find interesting in Dolemite's films is that they have some moral ambiguity that I don't see in the other blaxploitation film, and certainly in very few traditional films. In this, there is an African American woman who makes a speech about the Mayor (white), saying "she has done more for the black community than anyone else". Later we find out that the mayor is, surprise, corrupt, but I like that the film can present this woman as essentially wrong and not try to "redeem it" in some other way. There is also the figure of Hamburger Pimp, who is presented as a useless drug addict, and no one strives to find a corner of redemption, socially positive, for what it is, simply. In Disco Godfather, the religious character of Lady Reed is presented as a madman for praying for her child, hopelessly lost in angel dust. I like the fact that films present such cruel representations of people in their community without covering them with sugar or trying to redeem them to make them more appealing. <br /> <br /> There are many unresolved elements, such as when Dolemite says "Move and let me pass, or I'll get these Hush Puppies out of your muthatf ** to **." There is Queen Bee approaching and answering the phone: "Dolemite's Total Experience." And you won't be able to lose (even though you might want to cover your eyes) the scene of the Mayor REPULSIVE's extended nude. I'm all for the older perverts, but I also have limits ... and my limits are usually just a few miles from most people, so be careful. The DVD I had is clearly modified, which is evident in some of the dialogue scenes, and finally, when the murder of Dolemite of a main character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> If you take the DVD, however, make sure you watch all three of Dolemite's movie trailers, since they are a blast. I wouldn't have seen The Human Tornado, but after seeing that trailer, you'd better BELIEVE I am. Also, in the Dolemite trailer there is a scene that I don't remember from the movie when Dolemite swings against a thug of Mexican origin, obviously missing, and the boy turns on a nearby trunk. <br /> <br /> After watching the first semester, I was going to say to skip this and watch Disco Godfather, since the movie and the story improved marginally, but after having a lot of fun in the second part, I would recommend watching this on Disco Padrino, like this one is even more exuberant, funny, outrageous and of good character and has those toasts that, even if you don't understand the roots and nuances of the shape, are still something to see. <br /> <br /> --- Check out other reviews on my website about bad and trendy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
