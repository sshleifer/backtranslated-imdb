This is probably the biggest war movie and certainly one of the biggest movies. There is no sentimentalism, no patriotic program, not even a message of hope of universal brotherhood in this squalid vision of what we can only call hell. It is this silent rigor and the lack of manipulation that give the film its incredible power. There are not even attempts to make a hero with Tamura, the protagonist of Ichikawa. It is only a poor sap condemned to try to survive in a world of horror that it hopes, but it is not sure, it can cling to its humanity in the process. Ichikawa's intense lack of cant and illusion causes the fires on the plain to be isolated. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
