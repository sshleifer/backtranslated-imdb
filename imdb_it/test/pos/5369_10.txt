I was 10 or eleven years old when this movie came out, and I've been with me for 35 years since. When the film came out, all the theaters in the St. Louis area distributed, like a "bait", a bouquet of flower seeds with the name of the film, etc. On the front. On the back of the package he read, with so many words ... he plants these seeds at midnight. If a white flower grows, you are saved ..... but if a red flower grows, you are doomed !!! Suffice it to say that for an eleven-year-old I didn't plant seeds for fear of what might appear. Here's the spoiler: when the movie starts, you see a small toy tank moving in the dust. On a small road a family is leaving the city, and suddenly the camera turns back to the tank, and it's life-size. It spills over the car, and you see the bloody limbs that protrude from the wreck, then, just as suddenly, the tank is small again. <br /> <br /> The reason this film stopped me for so long, was because I had an exact toy tank like the one in the movie !!!! Unfortunately I don't know what happened to him, but since then I've been watching this thing !!! <br /> <br /> Turn off the lights, put the DVD, make a sandwich and watch this movie. Is very good!!!
