Better than the original, "the Gamers: Dorkness Rising" manages to create a fun comedy with good acting, special effects and comedies that transcend the "gamer's" knowledge base and do it at low cost. I have seen many low budget movies that have been terrible and almost none that have lived up to their high budget counterparts. This film blows away most of the traditional films! The parts are a bit weak (the part with pirates and ninja - fun though - lasts a little longer without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a while) but, overall, this is a very strong film. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to say that I bought this film as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Any chance to look forward to another gamers movie from these guys? :)
