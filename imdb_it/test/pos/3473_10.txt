I knew nothing about this film until I saw it ... my brother suggested I take a look. Normally, his suggestions are still not very cop, but I was stuck for something to look at, so I looked at it. <br /> <br /> Well, long story short, I'll add it to 10/10. <Br /> <br /> The film focuses on two people who meet while they are in the same place. One is initially very dependent on the institution that surrounds it, the other is a rebel. One does what he likes, the other as he is told. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings, and see how they rub each other. It is an extraordinary work, which manages to tell a beautiful story without upsetting the head, the people who jump out of the bathtubs or the superheroes who come to save the day. <br /> <br /> There is a good dose of grit and reality in there, not everything can ever go well - not all gulfs can ever be broken down - and this movie nicely shows the lot. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, and you're not impressed ..... I would suggest you never look at anything again.
