Few people realize this, but there was world literature in the ancient world before the Greeks arrived on the scene. In addition to the literary remains found in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were remarkable works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The top of the former were religious poetry and "The Epic of Gilgamesh". The Egyptians have produced many poems, but the main addition was the story of the adventure of a traveler and doctor called "The Story of Sinuhe". It is from this work (actually a fragment, that we do not know the end of) that the novel "The Egyptian" was born. <br /> <br /> The story is unique (like the movie). "The Egyptian" was a best seller in the early 1950s, and Darryl Zanuck decided to take the chance to do it: yes, he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer, as well as the rest of the cast (Victor Mature , Edmund Purdom, Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he was aware that these films rarely made a big box office. This can be explained as an example of Zanuck experiencing something different. <br /> <br /> The number of films dealing with ancient Egypt is very small. "Land Of The Pharoahs", "The Egyptian", "The Ten Commandments" (both versions De Mille), "Moses", "Holy Moses!", "Cleopatra", "The Mummy" (all versions), " The Scorpion "King". If there are 20 films about ancient Egypt it is tremendous. But "The Egyptian" is unique. While the second "Ten Commandments" discusses Ramses the Great (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke), and the films on Cleopatra deal with her, few other names from ancient Egypt were taken up in the film.The largest Pharaoh of Egypt was Thutmose III, who conquered most of the well-known Middle East of the era of 1470 BC or so. No film appeared about him, nor of his usurper predecessor, the first great ruler of history, Hatschepsut, but the only known pharaoh who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the Jews ( and later the Christians tried - a type of monotheism - is the subject of "The Egyptian". This is Pharoah Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> Actually Akhnaton was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not intended for public consumption. But he angered the priestly class he adored Amon rather than Aton. Because of our uncertain historical accounts (although the official documents of Akhnaton - the letters of "Tel-el-Amana" - are quite complete as far as they survive), we do not know if the pharaoh was killed in a coup or not. However he died, he was succeeded by a young brother or son of him whose name is better remembered than any other Pharoah except Ramses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually pretty good. Wilding is a good Akhnaton, who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer should be. Mature is as good as the ambitious (and - outside the film - ultimately the success of the future Pharoah) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom do well in their main parts and Ustinov is good as a friend of Purdom. Ms. Darvi is also good, in a large part of support. In a wonderful cameo is John Carridine, like a philosophical thief. The film is certainly worth seeing, as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of Ancient Egypt.
