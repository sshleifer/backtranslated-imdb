This film does a great job of getting us through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the beginning to the showdown. The impact of the film is made even more profound by the awareness that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton provides us with a quality and sober performance and Sean Penn demonstrates why he is one of America's most vibrant actors. As for "Midnight Express", this film should make us all think twice about doing something we shouldn't do in a foreign country.
