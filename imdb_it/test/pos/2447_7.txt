This film was well made. It covers the difficulties that a veteran veteran of Vietnam has in dealing with the horrors of war. Unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a veterinarian who had been involved in an act of atrocities. I was in Vietnam and only once did I hear of such an act by one who assisted him. The offender was tried and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. <br /> <br /> The idea that only veterinarians involved in atrocities have emotional problems is a disservice to all those who have served. All the soldiers I knew personally or whom I knew by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who even respected the enemy and believed they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was going home to know that many Americans were against the war. This is what has led many veterans to feel that they took part in something less than honorable. Not the way they are served. <br /> <br /> The finale depicted the father who behaved more like a belligerent bully than a loving and caring father. For that I gave a 7 out of 10. If the final had allowed a certain degree of acceptance I could have classified it to 9. <br /> <br /> The most decent men will return home from the war with guilt and emotional scars . They need acceptance and understanding to overcome this. I pray that the public better understand our veterans today than in the Vietnam era.
