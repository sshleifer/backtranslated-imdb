FORTUNA FORTUNA follows a homeless tramp as he entangles himself in the world of the underground crime of deception and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) was released from prison and has nothing to lose. He is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named Ike (Armand Assante) hires him for work. Soon Ike reveals a strong desire for Archie to kill his spiteful wife, Divana (Dagmara Dominczyk), an erotic dancer for Carnival. Things get complicated soon when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her of the pattern. They become involved in a very wet deal that leaves little to the viewer's imagination, after which they soon make a plan. Together they plan to kill Ike, but things don't go as planned. <br /> <br /> I'd be lying if I said this film didn't surprise me. I was personally shocked at how beautiful this film was. After renting it several years ago, I was expecting another clich√© thriller with many of the typical elements and themes that are shown in many such movies these days. Within minutes I was conquered and found myself quite involved in the world of this film. It's the kind of film, very similar to BUFFALO '66, which sucks you and transports you into style and the feeling of paranoia. It is a film that distorts him in a surprising way. One thing that I particularly appreciated is the way the film represented its characters. The film is not as simple and clear as it might appear in the plot summary. These are characters that actually interest you and that I'm fascinated with, including the characters that should be the villains. In truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this movie. All characters are imperfect in realistic and incredibly realistic ways. There are not many films that manage to complete this task flawlessly as this film does, but it is certainly a cinematographic style that I like and I want to see more from today's films. There were some detective movies that were like this in the early 1950s, but there hasn't been one as compelling and unique as this since! <br /> <br /> In terms of flaws, I mostly have very minor flaws. The film itself is not exactly original. However, I doubt that most people would expect it to be original. The film mounting style can also be irritating to some people as it tends to have a wobbly cam type of camcorder throughout. Although I wasn't worried and actually felt that it added to the atmosphere, I'm sure most viewers won't be fascinated by it and may find it generally discouraging. Despite the small flaws, however, this is one of the most undervalued films of the 2000s. It is so refreshing to be lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good. It seems like this film was a direct-to-video version, even though this film is far better. If he had been put in the room, he would not have won any awards, nor would have been seen much, but he would have had much more recognition than he has today. Recognition that this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is an amazing, funny and twisted neo-noir thriller with a real sense of class and juxtaposed style and with enough substance to make the average spectator more than simply satisfied.
