Guilt and redemption are two of the main emotions and the elements of the plot of the heavy and powerful dramas that the Oscars love so much (which is quite funny since "The Kite Runner" was named only for the best original score - the lack of nomination was perhaps unfair). While most of the film adaptations of books (or other media) are usually inferior to their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is NOT an exception), the film adaptation of Marc Forster is good. <br /> <br /> Most people are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions, so I won't go into the plot except to say that the book stays true to its source. That said, if you don't know the plot, watch the movie, or better yet, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best thing is that "The Kite Runner" got away (in addition to its history) is director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with an epic purpose and a unique vision perfectly used to bring the book by Khaled Hosseini to the screen. A small part of me feared that he would use the same dreamlike images that were included in one of Forster's first films, "In Search of Neverland". Don't get me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a wonderful movie, one of my favorites actually, but the visual makeup that he used there has no place here. Fortunately, Forster understands it, and the splendor of his direction shows its versatility. Although the lack of a nomination for the best director for his work here is not exactly a parody, I see a number of figurines in store for him. <br /> <br /> Also of note is the adaptation of the script. It remains faithful to the source, but leaves room for Forster's vision of interpreting the material. Dialogue is not minimized, and so on. together with Forster's direction, it moves at a solid pace. Like Forster, the lack of recognition at the time of the screenplay awards was not an outrage, but I wouldn't have complained if he was at least nominated. <br /> <br /> The dividing line between this film is exceptional and the exceptional lies with acting. Most shows are solid, but there are some that don't cut, and it hurts the movie. The most noticeable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It's not that it's bad, it's just not as effective as it could be. He cannot translate the sense of guilt that Amir consumes to the public. In fact, I think at this point I might have been a bit lost in the movie at this point if I hadn't read the book because of this. He looks gloomy and sometimes resentful, but we can't feel his emotions. This is a difficult part to portray, and for the most part the young Ebrahimi holds his, which is particularly surprising since this is his first film role. <br /> <br /> The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla, who plays the adult Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays the essay Rahim Kahn. Abdalla may not be a known name (although he was in "United 93" by Paul Greengrass), but his work here is surprising. He is a quiet and modest man, and emulates perfectly when necessary. A less capable actor could have turned the character of Rahim Khan into a cliché, but Shaun Toub uses enough subtlety and attention in his performance to create what the clichés are trying to portray. <br /> <br /> Forgive me if I'm in fashion here, but this is something I have to face, and this is the PG-13 rating of the film. The fact that this film received such a low score is outrageous. There is no justification for this. Some may argue that the rating has been bent due to the need for everyone to see it, like the blood in "Save Private Ryan", which some say would have given the film an NC-17 rating. But this exception cannot be applied here. The only purpose of the scene is to tell the story. Forster (probably at the behest of the producers) has tried as much as possible to tame the most painful and disturbing scene in the film to allow the film to sneak in with a PG-13 rating, but the material is too disturbing to be depicted in any way and get less of an R rating, regardless of whether it can be pictured as "tasteful". Worse still, this montage robs the scene of much of its power and, by trying it, makes it less disturbing to get the lowest score. Furthermore, some scenes of violence are also incredibly disturbing. In terms of how long these scenes take of the film, it doesn't add much, but what there is deserves an R rating at the very least. The MPAA, whose film classification system has always been corrupted, has sunk into a new low by giving this film such a low score. <br /> <br /> But don't criticize the film for this. The film is a solid film that is worth seeing, especially if I'm a fan of the book.
