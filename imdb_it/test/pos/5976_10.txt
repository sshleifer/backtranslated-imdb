I saw this film many years ago (along with another Shepitko film, Wings) as part of a series of Soviet films in a local film archive. But none of Shepitko's films, as far as I can tell, was ever filmed on video or DVD in the United States. Ascent is a great film of any level, with a splendid black and white photograph, a hypnotic direction and actors so profound in their roles that you don't have the feeling that they just give a performance. Although the details of the period of Russian resistance (and collaboration with) to the German occupation are very eloquent, the story is timeless. Two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans and the interrogation tests their integrity and their courage. I suspect that the reason why the Russians did not publish it on DVD (here comes the spoiler) is that the Jewish intellectual (and not the hard Russian peasant) is the partisan who resists both threats and temptations, he serenely goes to his death, and constitutes a heroic example for the villagers.
