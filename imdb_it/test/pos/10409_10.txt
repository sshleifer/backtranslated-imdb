Anyone familiar with horror movies knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people enjoy gorefest with narrative lines and character development. Personally, I like horror films that focus on the atmosphere and interesting concepts (for example, A tale of two sisters, Kairo, etc.). Whatever kind of horror film I like personally, there are only a select few that really scare you. Noroi is one of these. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary-style film, which means that the entire film is a collection of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist filmed his video interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, then compiled footage from other sources that link to his research. What results is an inexorably chilling experience that seems very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story is false. <br /> <br /> Some have compared Noroi with The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. An obvious difference between the films is that Noroi scares the viewer by linking events to each other using different sources. For example, the journalist records the exterior of a house he is studying and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the movie, a clip of another character's home video introduces that same strange occurrence. The memory of the spectator connects the two incidents and the chills begin to flow along the spine. Another example is a TV show with a psychic child who correctly answers every single question except for one. In fact, his answer is so wrong that the viewer might wonder what the directors were thinking. Later, however, this incorrect answer turns out to be connected to an extremely disturbing event. This is an intelligent film creation. Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi does not offer one, but two very long endings, the second of which is positioned one minute after the credits start rolling and is the only big scene of fear in the history of cinema horror. I don't say these things lightly. It totally destroyed me in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> The other aspects of film production are well done. Kagutaba's legend and ritualistic background are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. The only exaggerated performance comes from a guy who should be crazy anyway, so it's predictable. Cinematography is intentionally gritty because the entire movie should represent videos shot on video cameras. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were fantastic. In some cases they create an otherworldly atmosphere (for example, static interference or the first ending) but in other cases they are alarming (for example, the second ending). <br /> <br /> When all is said and done, Noroi goes down like the scariest movie I've ever seen. I would go so far as to say that there is no film that offers such pure terror from beginning to end as Noroi does. Watch it now.
