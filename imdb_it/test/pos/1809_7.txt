This typical movie for teenagers is one of the best, apart from the story is good, the music goes well with the film. <br /> <br /> Even if I don't like the classic movie unless it's a classic script and better written, this is exceptional. Perhaps the style and language of the hair should change a little, in the 1980s I believe that offensive language is still rarely heard. <br /> <br />
