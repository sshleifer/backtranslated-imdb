Humphrey Bogart in his first starring role looks very young, plays well, but has a pronounced pronunciation only at some point in his career. Yet he is very good and very attractive as the young idealist inventor of a new airplane engine. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Mackaill is the real star here, playing a rich woman of the past who is torn between her true love for Bogart (he too is broke) and the comfort and security of marrying a man older (Hale Hamilton). <br /> <br /> Along with the ride are Astrid Allwyn in Bogart's sister, Bradley Page as her aspiring producer, Barbara Leonard as the cosmetologist, Jack Kennedy in the role of Gilligan and Halliwell Hobbes in the role of faithful (and wise) butler. <br /> <br /> Both Mackaill (who had been a star in silent films) and Bogart were trying to get hold of talkies in 1932. Bogart was a rising actor from the Broadway stage; Mackaill was slipping and soon he would appear in a skid-row production like PICTURE BRIDES. Yet they are both very good here. Mackaill wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this movie!
