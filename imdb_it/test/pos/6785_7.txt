A teenage girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an ex-jockey to attend the Grand National Steepclechase in London. A refined adaptation of the classic children's book, with an excellent interpretation of Taylor as the energetic but polite young man. Rooney is OK as his coach, even if he has too melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are quite as good as Taylor's loving parents. Shot in Technicolor, it looks beautiful. The problems are that there are trivial elements, nothing very interesting happens, and it drags on a little too long. The race is exciting, but it could have been a lot more.
