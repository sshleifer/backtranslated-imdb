Drive was a funny episode with a dark ending. Basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by an acute sound wave emitted by some military equipment. Some of my favorite parts of this episode are Mulder's dialogs in the car, and the scene where Scully joins Hazmat's team and finds the deaf little old woman completely insensitive to what they thought was a virus. The end of the course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that he will be able to carry out this elaborate plan to save the victim but when Mulder arrives the man is already dead. 8/10
