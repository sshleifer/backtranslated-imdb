He was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where the shootings in Italy had been shot. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo, however, would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. The photography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit that area. I would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is. He travels widely in Europe and Africa and I would be interested in visiting the areas the book and the film spoke about. Please email with any information about sites that anyone could have. We would be very grateful. And if anyone knows if the villa in Tuscany is still habitable, it would be fantastic. I await any information and thank you in advance for your time.
