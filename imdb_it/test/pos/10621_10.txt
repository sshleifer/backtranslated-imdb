Yes, I felt like I had been gutted after seeing it for the first time. But not until the next day did I begin to see the true splendor of this creation. I won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is a new area that I want to touch ... ** SPOILERS ** Why exactly did the teacher put broken glass in the pocket student? Most reviewers have noticed that it only reflects its cruelty and its reaction to an unsatisfactory performance. I do not agree. Look at the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as he watches his student play on stage. The student is a pretty expressive girl (crying and vocalizing her fears) - exactly the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the film, after the girl was injured, when Huppert discusses the incident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, says "We gave up everything to study the piano" and Huppert immediately snaps "You mean SHE has given up on everything, hasn't he?" <br /> <br /> So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from his own destiny. She didn't want the girl to end up like her, repressed and hardened, condemned to a life of recital ... little by little killing the soul in the search for perfection. Maybe it was seen on the stage years ago, before things got worse. Maybe he wanted her to run away when he was that age. Is it ruining the student's life, or simply freeing it? <br /> <br /> For me, that realization made the difference in what I experienced through this film. Brilliant.
