I just saw this movie the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was happy for his honesty and humor. It was the most inspiring film I've seen in a long time - I can't get it out of my mind for some reason. It may not be for everyone, because it makes you think. I don't know if people like to think in movies so much, which is a shame. The actors who play the Franklins are rather a discovery. I couldn't imagine playing these complicated people so frankly. Although I thought a couple of secondary characters weren't as good as the Franklins, I can totally forgive him - because this is an important film in my opinion. I didn't expect me to like it so much, but since I've been thinking about it for a few days, it's turning out to be a very relevant piece of entertainment.
