Having been a loyal fan of Asterix all my life, I must say that "Asterix and the Vikings" is probably the most well-made of all Asterix films. It has some very funny jokes and the animation is superb. As many people have pointed out, it does not follow the comic's plot very closely ("Asterix and the Normans"), but in many ways it is just as good, because that book stands out in my mind as one that has struck a lot of culture fun from the 1960s, and to a large extent it is very dated today. <br /> <br /> What really pushed me the wrong way, though, is how they incorporated a Disney-style storyline into the movie that took a lot of attention away from Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood guy who doesn't fit, Justforkix. We have a little girl who doesn't fit because she wants to be treated like men, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because the boy is ashamed to be totally honest with the girl, but in the end their love wins. This was the plot of so many Disney movies (and, well, right, others too) that it wasn't fun and the plot was old twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix a fantastic pet companion. <br /> <br /> Not only did I find this derivative and a clich√©, but it actually belittled the story and left me unsatisfied. <br /> <br /> I think you talk about how superb the rest of the film was, I keep thinking about it very well, despite the way the plot was hijacked.
