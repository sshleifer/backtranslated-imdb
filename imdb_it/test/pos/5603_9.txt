While the camcorder was certainly "funky" - perhaps a dutch-roll short of "stoned" - the premise of the film was fantastic. It really took a satirical way (in the true Hal Hartley tradition) to look at God, Jesus and the Devil. The interaction of Jesus and Satan provides some hilarious scenes ... Even the monologues of Jesus were great - this was by far the best Jesus I ever saw. So relaxed, zen, son of God, but still such a nice guy. At one level this is a very general look at the paradoxes of Christianity, but yet there is still a personal level, where you can relate to Jesus Christ without having a Complex of God (thanks to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
