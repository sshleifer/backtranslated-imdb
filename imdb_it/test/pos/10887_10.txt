In my personal opinion, this is the best video game ever created! I played this game for the first time at my friends' house years ago, the next day I went out and got mine. Since that day about seven years ago I have not stopped playing it. I can't help it, I can't get bored. I have been dependent on other games on other much newer systems, but I keep coming back for more Goldeneye. Each mission is incredibly fun and challenging, the multiplayer mode looks like no other. I hope you can be as lucky as I was for playing in four-player multiplayer mode because I had brothers and friends that got together and played this game all the time.
