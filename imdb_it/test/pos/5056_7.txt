Very typical of Almod√≥var of the time and, in its own way, no less fun than many of his later works. And why? There is nothing that can be provoked or shocked, and I suppose that such an effect is more casual than intentional. No, the great humor derives from an underdeveloped, almost surreal, absurdity that is intertwined in the scenario: the almost total lack of character taboos. It's the same kind of "comic suspense" that you find in his later works, although you'll find it in a more approximate version here. He's building new masterpieces, but he's not there yet. <br /> <br /> The only reviewer who commented on this film before me said that it was supposed to be a group of "very select" people, I find this film hilarious. I want it.
