Hey, all of you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean the guys. Be careful because Slaughter is back in town! If you're looking for a tacky, funky movie to watch at night, that's right. "Slaughter" is back and is trying to take it easy and relax after his adventures in Mexico. But if you're a narrow-minded gangster like "Duncan", you're bound to take revenge. Because I do not know. Was he "Hoffo" in his first brother or what? Anyone. The film begins with the old routine of "plane killing". We all know that this is the most effective way to take a guy out on a picnic, full of people. Needless to say, Slaughter survives the trial, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, I'm sorry, George Gaynes, he's not lucky. SMACK !! Slaughters' best friend, Pratt, is also killed. This is the beginning of a great adventure, full of the most hippy and funky music that James Brown has to offer. That's right, "The godfather of the soul" has put his mark on this bad boy. In addition to Jim Brown in the main part, this film is full of some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene has to offer. What about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. Elsewhere we see none other than Judith M. Brown and, last but certainly not least, the fantastic Don Stroud as the evil henchman.
