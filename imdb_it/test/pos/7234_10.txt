This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. I'm not even a fan of Troma. I've never heard of Troma before watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I had already lost hope of seeing a great film until I saw "Tromeo and Juliet". This film is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. It breaks many taboos. <br /> <br /> This film is neither disgusting nor stupid. It is difficult to describe in words how smart, funny, exciting and witty this film is. The music is exceptional and fits every scene perfectly. The characters are very credible and the acting is great. I'm really interested in the characters. <br /> <br /> Not just for Troma fans. It's for all the people who have a sense of humor and like intelligent and credible entertainment compared to absolutely stupid and unbelievable mainstream films that don't dare to do what this movie does. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews that this film is fantastic and something exceptional. Either you love it or you hate it. Like all true works of art, it is not understood and appreciated by all people.
