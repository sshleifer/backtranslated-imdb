Wonderful family film that should be a milestone in the Christmas period. It is a mystery to me because it is not. A real lost movie that I met for the first time, flickering on my old black and white 19 "RCA, when the movie Million Dollar was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York City. This fantasy director Rudolph Mate should be nested under everyone's Christmas tree But it was never released on home video. Too bad, I think I saw part of it on AMC a few years ago, before they cut many of their old movies from rotation. TCM should take the game and play it on Easter or Christmas Eve Any movie with Santa Claus, Aunt Bee, the Cupcake Lady hostess and an actor with the first name King, can't be bad Ann Blyth as "Sally" is a bundle of energy. chapel to pray for St. Ann to help and guide his confused and financially fatigued family, it works, so after graduating, he places a statue of Saint Anne in his bedroom. O'Moyn residence and being transferred to another address, I think this was done to put an end to a close dispute between the O'Moynes and the vile companion next door. Blyth is as cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play solitary grandfather in his sleep. Overall, this is a satisfying cinema experience.
