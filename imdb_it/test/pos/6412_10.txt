This film, one of the best I've ever seen, is about incommunicability. He plunges into a livid Taipei, stained with cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; a DAMP world. He shows us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. a coincidence, or destiny, connects their existences, but they are not able to open each other with words. The characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society regarding interpersonal relationships. An incommunicability that is here taken to the extreme limits. all the characters exchange only a few words during the film, the dialogues are almost absent and when some words are spoken they are often weak and empty, far from describing the true feelings of the people. So, the progression of the story, the revelation of the character's feelings is developed (brilliant idea!) From the musical seemingly nonsensical digressions that speckle the film. The progress of the sentimental event and the drama of the female protagonist lead us to a splendid, highly symbolic ending. A film totally different from the usual, an intelligent creation by a very talented director. PS. Forgive me for my bad grammar !!
