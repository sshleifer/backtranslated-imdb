This is an absolutely masterly stroke of genius by Paul Thomas Anderson, the writer / director of this film. It really examines the advantages and disadvantages of the world of porn and the consequences for your actions that live in a world literally fueled by sex, drugs and rock n 'roll. Only the most refined casts have reunited with Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Philip Baker Hall and others.
