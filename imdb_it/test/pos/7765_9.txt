This is my favorite movie that portrays African Americans in a completely different light. because it shows a different side of African Americans that is not shown in the movies. it's not the gang bang, the setting of the urban ghetto or having to face deep racial issues, it fascinates the essence of being young and tries to succeed and have problems letting your guard down and letting someone in your life, and the whole bohemian atmosphere gives that touch of class that makes everything so beautiful, it's a great script of great dialogue that fascinates you and you only get involved with the character. perfect casting with a lot of chemistry and very good acting and I have not yet seen any other movie with black characters represented in this format the only one that comes close is "Sprung" but since it is a comedy it loses it very quickly Do this films 9 out of 10 and I would like them to continue making films with this kind of attitude about African Americans
