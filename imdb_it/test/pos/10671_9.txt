I'm a big fan of space and, at almost 44, I just discovered this film for the first time. I arrived at a roundabout from Space 1999, then UFO. I hunted for other Anderson creations and discovered that this was their first live job. What a ride home! I heard about this movie many years ago, but I never knew what it was called, so I'm glad I found it by accident. <br /> <br /> These Andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing, the execution of completely credible and realistic models, the quality of the acting, etc. <br /> <br /> I don't think it looks dated at all. Let me tell you ... I'll take good old models on today's fake CGI shit EVERY TIME! Seriously, most of the rocket scenes seemed really real. They had a science! If you choose to think about what you are seeing as real, it is not difficult to really believe it. <br /> <br /> Also, the amount of detail in sets, the beautiful photograph, the whole appearance. .. man, I wish I could go back to that time! They knew how to make great films in the 60s. Personally, I lost all interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate it! Bring back the models! Think of all the people that style has used! Anyway, I'm shouting. :-) If you like good science fiction that is very well done, you will do yourself a service by looking at this.
