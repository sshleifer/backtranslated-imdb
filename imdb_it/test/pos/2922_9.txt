It often happens that, as he grows up, a Hollywood movie impresses a young man. Not only does it last a lifetime, but it inspires him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case with the 1954 film entitled "The Egyptian". The audience marveled at the sets, costumes and acting of this film, so much so that other films were soon followed in an equally vain way. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left a parent shortly after his birth. With such a dubious beginning, it is not difficult to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions. The boy Sinuhe, (Sin-oh-way) which means, "He who is alone" (Edmund Purdom) grows into adulthood and continues to wonder why, even when he graduates from the School of Life to become a doctor. During his formative years he acquired a long-time friend named Kaptah brilliantly interpreted by (Peter Ustinov), and Horemheb (Victor Mature) who was born from a simple officer of the guard to the Commander of the armies. His life offers everything from a rapid increase in social status to a convicted criminal, an outcast, a miraculous healer, and finally to a station in life that he never expected. The fine acting goes to Jean Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as the temptress, Nefer and John Carradine as a memorable tomb thief. Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, the Egyptian's son. In his last years, "He who is alone", he finally discovers the answer he has been looking for all his life, which he bequeaths to his son, now entrusted to his friend for his whole life. Excellent movie! ****
