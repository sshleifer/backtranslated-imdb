Not very known as English, American, German and French cinema, although the Swedish cinema of the 1920s was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a film that is made great by its history. The story is told in the way "A Christmas Carol", in which death confronts the deceased with his past, present and what could have been. It is obviously a story that focuses on morality and does it very well. The message appears very powerful and effective. This is certainly due also to the effective direction of the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novel by the Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. The plot was adapted by Victor Sjöström himself, who perhaps should have taken some other elements to get the story and the film better scrolled. Maybe it takes a little too long before the film starts to take shape and the story becomes clear but when the film takes shape and rhythm it becomes really wonderful. <br /> <br /> The film has not only a good story, it is also beautiful. The film uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right atmosphere and to indicate what is past, present and 'future'. <br /> <br /> Sjöström has not only written and directed this film, he also plays the main character. Obviously the acting in the film is exaggerated, at times, according to today's standards but not as bad as in the case of the first German films. After all, this film speaks more of its history and its morals than of acting, so it doesn't matter much or distract. <br /> <br /> A truly great and effective silent cinema classic underrated by Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
