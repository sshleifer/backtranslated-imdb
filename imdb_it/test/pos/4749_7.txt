How did they get that cinematic hit of the machine that clashed with the back of the seed? And then Roy sits down - fantastic! It looks like the DVD is scheduled for May 2006 - about now !! Watch this on a big screen or a movie shoot in a theater, if possible, to fully appreciate the entire format. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian Job with Michael Caine; Bullit with Steve McQueen; Living and dying in LA with the CSI boy when he was young; French Connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Vanishing point with Barry Newman; State enemy with Hackman again - What are your favorites?
