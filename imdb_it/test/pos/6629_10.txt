Being a big Bergman fan, I had to literally search for years to find this movie (at a price below $ 60 I mean) and eventually bought it a few weeks ago. The basic premise of Bergmans' films are the relationships between the characters and how they deal with difficult situations. So this film is the same, but it's different because the setting is very different from most of the Bergman films I've seen. <br /> <br /> It is set in time of war and the heroes are caught in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's exciting from beginning to end and proves once again that Liv Ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century. A must see
