My father had this film as an 8 mm coil. I loved it when he pulled out the projector, fixed a sheet to the wall and played Gerald McBoing Boing. The thought of a child communicating through sounds fascinated me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as autistic. The doctors would ask me questions about my son like "How do you communicate with you?" I would answer: "Have you ever seen the cartoon, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I'd like to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators, that's how my son sees the world. <br /> <br /> Recently, I spoke to a digital transfer specialist who indicated most of the 8mm personal films did not contain sounds until the mid-1970s. I imagine I was lucky enough to have experimented with the images and sounds of Gerald McBoing Boing in 1972.
