I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very similar to what my school was like. The school plays where the main actors kiss, what happened in my school. A crazy band of boys, my school again only when we went on a cross-country ski run we would have had a smoke! 'Got the shot', someone from my school broke through a light from the sky and broke the reeds! after they were kept in a safe !!! And for certain nighttime activities! what can I say .... The film was released in 1982, I remember it like when I bought my house and the film was showing at the same time. If you like English films and films about school, growth and vintage pieces, then this is for you. Another very similar film, 'SWALK', came out a few years earlier and I would like to see it again first, even 'Kes' is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But believe me, 1982 is when it came out)
