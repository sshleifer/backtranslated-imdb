I saw this film many years ago, I tried to identify it but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found. He was so esoteric, yet one of a handful of films that stays with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the film is, and perhaps, like the Principle of uncertainty, darkness is the definitive thing. Acting is superb, the atmosphere is always full of a sense of foreboding, a general melancholy remains, yet it is difficult not to be absorbed in history. I rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the science fiction section with some totally misleading misleading), but clearly it's not. Or horror or even suspense. In fact, we feel grateful that the director has taken the courage to make a film like this, for which there is obviously no solid audience. I know some people have complained about the short role of Klaus Kinski, but I think it's very appropriate: his limited exposure is fundamental to the formation of the mystery of this film.
