"Murder Over New York" is fun, but not as good as most other Fox Chan. This film would have had a better name, "Charlie Chan in New York", the film's working title. This is Toler's ability to play Chan in the Big Apple. There is a lot to love here, though, including the three-marble guest star Shemp Howard. <br /> <br /> This has one of my favorite Chan sayings, "Coincidence like an ancient egg - it leaves an unpleasant smell". Toler and Yung are good at this and also the supporting cast. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere I look for in these films. Anyway, it's nice to see.
