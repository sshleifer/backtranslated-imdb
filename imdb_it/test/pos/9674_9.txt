This is a great show, which I wonder why the air has been removed so many times. But I think it's here now to stay! This show cannot be compared to anyone else, before Simpson was rather "on the edge" and then came Family Guy, and they are stretching him out of the "margin". The things this show goes with are incredible. The clock works completely! If you like the Simpsons you will like the family boy!
