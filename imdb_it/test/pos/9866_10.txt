This review is based on Producer's Cut: <br /> <br /> "Halloween 5" was a huge box office disappointment dating back to 1989. Personally, I've always loved it and I'm proud to have it in my collection. But due to his failure and also due to rights issues, it would have been 6 years before we would have seen another installment. The film had the makings of being one of the best, if not the best of the series. A huge fan who wrote the script, the return not only of Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of the character of Tommy Doyle from the first film, an important study in support of the project, and a fall release all made the movie look like a success in the making. So what went wrong? I'll give you two good reasons: re-shoot and poor editing. Due to a bad screening test and also the unfortunate disappearance of Donald Pleasence, the film has been changed, and not for the better. The film, like parts III and 5, was snapped up at the box office and got negative reviews from both critics and most fans of the series. But then, thanks to the bootleg magic, the original cut was leaked and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I will finish this part of my review by saying this: This film is, at least so far, my favorite "Halloween" movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. <br /> <br /> Pros: The score is simply enchant. It has some of the best writings and dialogues in the series. 'Halloween 4' emulated the original as it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts, and 6 is the same way. Great shows, especially from the late Donald Pleasence. It moves at a breathtaking pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's illness and why he won't die. Some brutal killings. Some rather chilling moments, my favorite is the one involving the character of Kim Darby. A lot of really interesting hints about previous films. Some good surprises. Like the previous two sequels, this one has an impressive cliffhanger ending. <br /> <br /> Cons: Although the explanation of Michael's evil is fascinating, it makes it a little less scary. Since when can Michael move from one place to another so fast? <br /> <br /> Final considerations: this was the first "Halloween" I saw at the theater. I was so excited because I really thought that 5 would be the last and then I felt it was happening. I liked it at the time, but over time I saw it for what it really was: a great film trapped in an OK with a terrible ending. Why did filmmakers have to listen to people on test screenings? If they released this higher version it might have worked a lot better and the series might not be stuck in the casino where it is now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
