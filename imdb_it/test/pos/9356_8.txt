A man by the name of Joseph Samuels is found brutally murdered in his apartment. It would appear that Samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the night before, and with one of them apparently missing, the evidence certainly implies the missing soldier. But while Detective Finlay digs deeper into the case he finds out that they might be barking on the wrong tree, and that this crime has to do with something desperately sad and cowardly, anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> Crossfire was born of the novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton and directed by the excellent Edward Dmtryk, Crossfire {Originaly entitled Cradle Of Fear} is a tense and compelling picture that bravely faces anti-Semitism . The producers have been forced to dampen the story from the original source, the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism, what remains, largely due to the supreme RKO Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, is a kind of discomfort creeping that drips with Noirish style. <br /> <br /> In the cast there are three Bob, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, with Noir who loves Gloria Grahame adding the emotional female heart. The third is only the third, is the photo of Robert Ryan to the end, his portrait as bullying, conniving of Montgomery is the best and shows perfectly the talent he has had in abundance. Ryan had good reason to give Montgomery some of his best work because he had served in the Navy with Richard Brooks himself, both had discussed the possibility that if the novel were turned into a movie, then Ryan wanted and played Montgomery, thus was born the genesis of Ryan's career as weasel types! Gloria Grahame also has a wonderful and heartfelt turn, which is all the more remarkable since she was tormented by her violent husband at the time. Stanley Clements was known to be violent towards him and his constant presence on the set bothered others in the cast, but Grahame, probably channeling the emotions of real life, became the character of Ginny and shone very bright indeed. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young come out with flying colors, to really sign the agreement on what a Crossfire scene really is. <br /> <br /> Tho Crossfire was published before the other anti-Semitic image of 1947, Gentleman's Agreement and rounding up over one million and a quarter dollars at the box office, some of its lightning was stolen from the Oscar-winning film of Fox Studio. Nominated for Best Film, Best Supporting Actor (Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay, he won nothing, but critics of the time hailed him as a brilliant change in American cinema, and today he is tall, proud and obscure as a bold and excellent work. 8.5 / 10
