When you think of the brilliant Australian comedies you don't think about Skit shows (even if they are rather partial to a bit of Full Frontal from the 80s and 90s) or even to Sitcoms - think of SATIRE! Something that we Australians really know how to do well. (For example: Front Line, The Micallef Program) We know how to take the pi $$, and The Chaser's War on Everything, is a classic example of how to do it, and how to do it really well. <br /> <br /> I've been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for a long time. I remember listening to them in Triple J.'s afternoon show. They were, and remain, two of the funniest comedians around. <br /> <br /> Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to find out what they were investing so much time to force them to leave. (They were doing CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I thought it was something much bigger) And what an incredibly show HILARIOUS is Chaser. Biting political and social satire to the fullest. <br /> <br /> I am also pleased to say that it has recently received a VERY better time interval than on Friday night and that it was moved on Wednesday nights immediately after Spicks and Specks. THANK YOU ABC !! Finally I don't have to register it! :)
