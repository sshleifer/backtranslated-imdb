Not for those adrenaline addicts, etc. It is a beautiful film, which looks after the war, a psychic problem, from the other point of view. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is as big as a young man, haunted by the demons of the Vietnam war, which causes problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to the problem of how to deal with the past, with whom <br /> <br /> The Emilion Estevez character doesn't seem to have anything to do, and Martin Sheen's character doesn't want to deal with it . <br /> <br /> The protective mother looks at this problem with a warm and open heart but with the mind closed for obvious reasons.
