I went to see this movie in a book signed in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful night consisting of a few short words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say everything, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends while the books were being signed, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer lights have subsided. <br /> <br /> Not to spoil anything, I won't go into details ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a great job maintaining the classic b-movie feel. The characters were classic "b" characters, the place was refreshing (which movies do * you know * that are based in Bulgaria?) And the setting was both almost original and fun! Besides all this the humor distributed throughout the film that prevented the audience from laughing for much of the film. <br /> <br /> Although this film has no general appeal to people like some, it is a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of (as Bruce Campbell said) "b-movies" that are listed as " a-movies "(bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie and the chocolate factory?!).
