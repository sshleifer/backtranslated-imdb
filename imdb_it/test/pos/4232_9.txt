I'm German, so excuse my writing style. Since for the first time I saw Chucky 4 I was a little surprised, I knew Chucky as a usual scarymovie of the 80s, but Bride of Chucky was very different from the old ones. First there is the artwork of the excellent director Ronny Yu, which we still have in mind from A story of Chinese ghosts. His visual style is similar to that of Francis Ford Coppola. Even the voices of Chucky and Tiff are really impressive. I also really liked the script, especially the scene where Tiff launches the Champaignbottle in the ceilingmirror. <br /> <br /> I give him a rating of 9.0 for fun, bloody and progressive entertainment. If you have comments on my opinion, just send me an e-mail. MFG Schawez
