Reading the comments, there seem to be many nonsense about La Pianiste's emotional banality. I find it difficult to understand given the extraordinary performance of Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is compelling - she manages to perfectly convey the woman to the limit, full of hatred towards herself and disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderfully traveled and judged. It would be so easy to portray the protagonist as a ridiculous figure: for example, consider the scene in the porn store. Somehow, Huppert is able to carry it forward, partly because of his brilliant performance, but also because the director makes his life surreal and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Don't ignore this movie. It is one of the most surprising and engaging films (and shows) I've seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
