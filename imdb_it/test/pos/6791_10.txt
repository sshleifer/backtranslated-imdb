National Velvet (1944) The film that put Taylor on the map. Costarring the then number one box office champion, Mickey Rooney. Taylor plays a girl in love with her horse and when jockey Mickey Rooney is unable to ride in the big national race, Liz cuts her hair, pretends to be a boy and runs on horseback ... well I don't want to ruin the end for you. It is a quality melodrama that MGM was famous for. And it's another color image at the beginning!
