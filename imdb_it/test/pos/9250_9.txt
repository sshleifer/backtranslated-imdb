I've always been a fan of the show, so I admit I'm biased. When the show ran out, I felt like too many questions remained unanswered. This film seemed like a closure to me. Seeing all the people I had followed in the last few years together was very rewarding. I heard that this is probably the only homicide film we can expect. If so, this is the appropriate way to get out. This film is sometimes moving, sometimes upsetting, but always satisfying. If you are or have ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
