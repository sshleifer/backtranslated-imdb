This is the single biggest movie I've ever seen. Davey / Mr. Slaussen is at the same time: <br /> <br /> 1) Tortured for his talents (for example, "I can control him, I can do it! I shouldn't have to hiiiide him! It's a dear good!"); <br /> <br /> 2) Desire to make friends, for example, <br /> <br /> "How's the soup? <br /> <br />" The soup is very good. "<br /> <br />" Would you like some crackers with your soup? "<br /> <br />" I would like more crackers, please. "<br /> <br />" How are you? " <br /> <br /> "Yes, the soup is very good." <br /> <br /> 3) Proud of his accomplishments (eg "Pretty neat trick, eh?") <br /> < br /> 4) A gentleman (for example, "You are so cute.) Why don't you like me?"); and <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes, very, very angry (eg "You can't leave ! ") <br /> <br /> Connors should have received an academic award for best actor for this film, I mean, who could have been better?! Tanya Roberts jumped into the limelight after her performance in TT. wonder not all the stars of this masterpiece have had no brilliant careers, I highly recommend it s movie! It is available on amazon.com. Everyone should own it. Make a night and have a bowl of soup while you watch.
