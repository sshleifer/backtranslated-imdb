It takes a while to adapt to the sound of Sons of The Pioneerers, but then you enjoy it a lot. If the soundtrack were played by an orchestra like Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin, it would lose its folkloristic character. The music leads the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young people who lead the caravan. Ward Bond is the Mormon leader and Joanne Dru is a flirting actress. Ford managed to make of what would have been a normal western, something completely different and original that shows us the music, the dances and, above all, the people.
