RENDITION is a film not to be missed with a solid writing by Kelley Sane and directed by Gavin Hood that takes us into a story that is a journey into a man's journey through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep has a convincing role in the CIA today and great performances by a cast of superlative actors in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, along with actors of Middle Eastern origins that add to the reality of the story. /> <br /> In RENDITION see how "terrorism can generate terrorism" and as the film progresses linking the story to what is happening in the Middle East, reality is brought to the screen. The external shots increase the intensity of the story and Peter Sarsgaard does a brilliant job in the role of Assistant in the way of "kissing the ass" on how American policies are conducted. It is a pity that there is not a wider audience for this film, because together with THE VALLEY OF ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS, RENDITION plays an important role in showing the public how the struggle for democracy and protection can go seriously astray.
