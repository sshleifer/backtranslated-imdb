This is a great movie, all three were. The last one was not as good as the first 2, but was made longer and was pulling straws. But you want to see it because it tells the end of the story. Just not how we might think it should end. <br /> <br /> These films have made me want to be there to be in all the difficulties, love, tears and laughter that people in this movie have thrown. It is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it, no matter how many times it is. <br /> <br /> There are some parts in the film that the children will not understand and that the older ones may not be old enough to watch but it's a great movie, which has lasted for over 20 years.
