This was a great movie. Something not only for the month of black history, but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the claim that it really takes a village to raise a child. S Eptath's performances were exceptional. Mos Def and his singing were out of trouble. I had to do a double lap when I saw that there was Rosie Perez. But the cast of supporting actors and actresses meant that it was worthy of attention. All the different stories they had were incredible. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally all the others who were in his presence. I can really understand that she is the matriarch of that period of time and even more than she was tired of helping everyone. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It would be a welcome addition to any film library.
