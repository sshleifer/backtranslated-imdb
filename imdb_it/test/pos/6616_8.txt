I saw this movie twice on cable. The first time I saw it, it took me by surprise. The skaters I was seeing were the guys we followed in the pages of Skateboarder magazine in the late 1970s. These were the guys we copied and tried to become skating. I am pleased that a film has finally been made that provides an accurate account of how this all became. I'm almost 40 years old and I imagine that a guy rather tense with all the problems of life, however; this film did a great job recovering. Back to the empty pools, the halfpipes on the back and the road trips to Cherry Hill NJ. I suspect that to really understand this film and appreciate it, you had to live it. Otherwise, he probably won't have the impact on you like me. But for those of you (and you know who you are), who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! In any case, I don't care who you are, if you have the chance to see this movie ... do it! I thank the Dogtown Z-Boys for the memories of my youth and thanks to Stacy for making this movie! WORK WELL DONE!
