Some said it was a glorification blow to nose candy, but apart from Dr. Hyde's original mix, a drug that could provide this effect has not yet been developed. If Viagra was the stage of slime mold, that sparkling white powder is the evolutionary branch of Stephen Hawking (or at least the branch of the idiot savant pharmacist). This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as the emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question the health field; both because most of us would not have lived until our present age if we were born before "modern medicine" and because our subconscious hopes we will continue to live if we have faith in helping professions. So the genes that produced this film made jokes about those of Calcutta Bessy, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. The timing was right, and many were able to see the economic side of the health companies behind the curtain of Oz. A decade earlier, when George C. Scott was singing for the movie The Hospital, my wife and I were sitting at the Oklahoma City premiere. Just like in the remake of Jekyll & Hyde, we were almost unable to avoid falling out of our place and laughing and howling uncontrollably for the duration. The hundreds of other members of the public were deadly silent. They were shocked that doctors, nurses and the hospital were mocked. It was as if the Pope, Billy Graham and Gandhi were sitting in the House of Animals, t-shirts stained with beer and all competing to see who could tell the funniest jokes of God among the bells. If the hospital had been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire, they could have seen what was shown to them. Unfortunately they were like the Republicans at the September 11th screening of Michael Moore. Perhaps the smallest gold parachutes would be given to the executives of the corrupt medical society, health insurance companies would have had a harder time denying medical care, and health workers would have been demystified earlier if George C. Scott had danced the tip tap in a tutu while delivering its terrible truths. But - forget everything I just said. Watch the film, be consciously happy, joyful and full of laughter as Saturday Night Live's best skit, and let the subconscious get immersed in the documentary of the underlying reality. Just don't blame me when "Got to got to got to" becomes one of your sayings or when "Hyde has nothing to hide" occupies that part of your brain now paralyzed by "Its a Small World After All". Or when you start calling the local hospital Our Lady of Pain and Suffering instead of the Madonna of eternal construction. Even the Oklahoma were changing their favorite terrible promise of the boss with the sword sticking out of "Pisciaccio above him and leaving him dead", to "Body in a pit, you in it ....." The smell of death .. . disappeared! Chicken sushi! Maria. MARIA. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
