I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you, when I saw the movie I had a great time. If you think that when you watch the movie you will be sick from porn. I mean yes, if you're not a porn person who doesn't care about it, then this isn't the movie to watch. But the fact is that the whole movie isn't really about porn. Well, in the middle of the film he talks about the porn industry, but the other half concerns the development of the character and the bad situations in which these characters pass. The actors played perfect roles, in particular Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. The sex scenes, of course, are terrific, but focus mainly on the character's hype in porn movies until there are struggles. Excellent movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Hedeen Outlook: 10/10 **** A +
