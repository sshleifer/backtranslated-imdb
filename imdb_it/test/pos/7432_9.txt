I am an avid fan of ff7, for example I have the game and then I sell it (serious error) but then I buy it again (good mistake ... erm) <br /> <br /> however, yes this film is very good , the fights are very beautiful, the music very good, and the cgi you cannot hesitate. <br /> <br /> The only disappointing thing about the movie I heard was the lack of another character involvement, it was almost all the cloud that although it's a great character, you can't beat cid and barret. <br /> <br /> but nevertheless the film was fantastic in my opinion, and absolutely to watch. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft, you'll make more movies like this and you'll be loved more than you already are !!!!
