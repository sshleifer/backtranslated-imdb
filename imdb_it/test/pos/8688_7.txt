For the most part, I only like the kind of film that lets you escape the present time in the future or in the past. This film is pure escape. The dance starts almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her "purple harem" bikini dress has no equal in the film in my opinion. Her dance, while sultry, is surpassed by her dance in Tiger of Eschnapur by Fritz Lang, available on DVD, where she plays the temple dancer Seetha. <br /> <br /> A problem with the film is the closed setting. There are a few outdoor scenes shot, and they, as well as other scenes, are a bit claustrophobic. The same positions are used over and over again, but with some interesting secret passages and streams. His double secret identity is absolutely incredible with the beauty of that reach. Debra also wields a saber and keeps two enemy soldiers at bay on a ladder, she could do everything. <br /> <br /> What is work is Debra Paget like a princess. With its beauty, it would certainly be the center of attention anywhere and at any time in history. This film, when it is hoped to be available on DVD, will be a forced purchase. Overall, taken with a little humor, I loved it. <br /> <br />
