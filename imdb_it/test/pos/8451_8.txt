One of the best and most exciting conspiracy thrillers (there was a series of films in the 70s). This is an accident in a nuclear reactor and attempts to cover it. Jack Lemmon is the clerk who realizes how dangerous the plant is and Jane Fonda is the crusader television journalist who brings the story on board and both players are at their best. <br /> <br /> The events portrayed in the film are, of course, terrifying and not exaggerated (much of what happens here happened in real life at Three Mile Island), and although it now seems something of a period, however , highlights how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. Expect a series of similar films on the effects of global warming any time soon (and not junk like "The Day After Tomorrow")).
