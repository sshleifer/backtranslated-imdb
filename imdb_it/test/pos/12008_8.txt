What can I say about this film except that fiction is one of the most exciting in the history of cinema ... and based on a true story! Being old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when it was still used to contain a country, this film offers an obscure view of the sad imprisonment of East Berliners, and their desperate attempts to escape, regardless of the cost. The film follows the lives of two families, who decide to escape using a hot-air balloon made by themselves. Forever fearing arrest by the authorities, under close scrutiny by neighbors, they must calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. A tense and exciting story of courage and determination that truly pays homage to all those who have succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
