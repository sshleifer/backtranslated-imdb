Oooooh, I was glad I didn't lose this. I wanted to post this review because this particular episode does what a certain recent movie didn't do. It is a true tribute to the DOOM game. The plot is different, and the characters are obviously set in a completely different universe (obviously the doctor who is a universe), but the feeling, the rhythm, the references and the position are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans to hear the door open and close the sound effect, it was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Please all the doctors who, like Doom fans, check this. it's a gem!
