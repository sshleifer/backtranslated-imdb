I just saw this movie last night, and I have to say that I loved every minute. If taken in the spirit of a parody of the James Bond films, it's really superior. The film's true comedy is in its brazen disregard for political correctness. Misogyny, cultural insensitivity and the almost ridiculous machoism of films of this genre are used for a great comic effect. It also calls the illogical and formal elements to work with, with Agent OSS 117 that constantly learns difficult things insanely fast (like Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetically obvious clues. Some of the lines in the film left me laughing for hours after the film was finished ... and I must say that I learned a little ... interesting ... French vocabulary that probably would have exasperated my professors with using me. All in all, I thought this film was excellent. Intensely fun and the first movie I've ever seen that really parodies all aspects of the spy movie.
