This, which has been nicknamed in Italian in a cinema in Rome (not bad as it seems) after being presented at the Rome Film Festival, is an art film and a festival, guaranteed to enchant and delight this audience for its style, crazy humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; cheerful and cheerful music; punctual shows; the predominant sweetness and humanity - but doomed, because of its strangeness and lack of a compelling storyline, to leave the average public wondering what they are looking at and why someone admires it, how it was done. <br /> <br /> Andersson offers us almost a series of skits. Going through it are various themes. Money: a guy at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) knots the wallet of a boring lady talking on a cell phone in a restaurant in front of a glass of brandy, then goes to order a set of elegant clothes made to order; a dead son calls his famous father away from an elaborate meeting to implore him for another loan. A shrink worries loudly about his spent investments, while his wife girds him in bed wearing only a shiny Viking helmet. <br /> <br /> Depression: an elementary teacher (Jessica Nilsson) bursts into the classroom because her husband called her "harpy;" the peddler of carpets (Pär Fredriksson) collapses before the customers because he called her that. Many men have depressing dreams. But hey - this is Sweden. Aren't everyone depressed? Problems of love: a fat bohemian couple is perpetually breaking up; a groupie girl has fantasies about a lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Wives slam their doors when their husbands start practicing their instruments. (Music too is obviously a unifying theme, in addition to the guitarist with bright tones there is a tuba and a drum that play in a Dixierland band and also play in marches and funerals. Each scene has an extra touch from the music, which connects clearly a sequence with another.) A furious storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people outside, thunder so strong that it seems like a battle raging all over the country. This also unifies the tone and gives the impression that various scenes are happening on the same day discouraging. <br /> <br /> Andersson is a master of visual composition and medium distance static shooting and the film has a misty gray. green look designed by DP Gustav Danielsson which is perfect because it evokes the darkness of a Swedish winter, but also sparkles with the soft colors of the director's intelligence, which concludes every scene with a smile. One almost never knew that the dullness could be so beautiful. (Or maybe one did: Alexcanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts). Within the scenes and in the film as a whole there is a kind of quiet that comes out of the visual style, the rhythm of the scenes and the human detachment of the general perspective. There is something in a completely master style that is calming, reassuring. <br /> <br /> Not everything works equally well. You can feel impatient with the succession of barely connected scenes, which sometimes read too much like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer who needs Prozac. Since some scenes clearly move you or make you laugh, it's obvious that others fall a little flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real zingers, and an obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream - described and then the dreams displayed are another common thread) in which the groupie girl imagines herself in a dress he marries just married to his ideal guitarist, who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers outside a large window. The point of view passes outside and the window slides away slowly, as if the construction of the dream from which the newlyweds looked was a train moving from a station to take them on their honeymoon. It is a fresh, subtle and rather sublime effect. <br /> <br /> In the end you can hear everything in You the Living (Du Levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene in which the barman always hits a bronze bell and announcing the time of the last order, after which all the sluggish customers get up from their tables and go to get another drink. <br /> <br /> An Italian reviewer called this "a great little movie", and it's true. It is limited in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a small master (like a medieval miniaturist) of the Scandinavian dark comedies, and this is a different film from the others. Presented this year as a "Un Certain Regard" selection in Cannes, it is also the Swedish voice of the Best Foreign Oscar 2007. Hard to say what Bergman thought, but Andersson worked with him; he is famous for his elaborate TV commercials, some of which can be seen on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best commercials in the world". It will be interesting to see if this director, whose trade is as subtle as his point of view, will start working in longer segments for some time. Meanwhile, every good movie fan really needs to take a look at it. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not exactly the right word. This means to delight the misery of others. Andersson is teaching us to delight the misery of all of us.
