Despite the previous reviewer, this is an interesting documentary full of clips taken from science fiction films from the 1950s that influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their most recent efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not even in the same league as the films discussed here, such as William Cameron Menzies's brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS, to name just one of the many titles examined, but this is still a good one overview of the 50s paranoid science fiction. Yes, it turns into a spot for the lukewarm WAR OF THE WORLDS remake in the last fifteen minutes; you can deactivate it. The rest is surprisingly good, and it's nice to see contemporary directors remembering the films that inspired them, even if they can't begin to match the originals.
