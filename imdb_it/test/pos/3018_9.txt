When I first saw this film I was both surprised and a little shocked by the obvious vitality of the story. It's a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention an excellent job in the make-up department. Jennifer Lopez pulled herself out of past roles that dug into her career with this film, playing a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to get into the minds of coma patients to treat them. Vincent D'Onofrio played incredibly well. His portrait of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for a T. The pure emotion conveyed by his performance is staggering. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but he nevertheless performed exceptionally well. Symbolism and artistic skill were intriguing and titillating, sometimes surprising and sometimes shocking. Overall, I say this is a wonderful film, with excellent acting and beautiful artwork.
