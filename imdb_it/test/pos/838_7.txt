There is a hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpion and a dangerous group of thugs (including their sadistic boss and his equally repellent lady), who run an prostitution ring with an iron fist, does just that. Hell has no fury like Scorpion, and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), in search of revenge to decapitate his arm after handcuffing her, will do everything necessary (... and this includes intimidating anyone who knows where he is find) to capture Nami. Nami finds an ally in the Yuki prostitute (Yayoi Watanabe), who provides her with temporary shelter. Yuki has a delayed brother who suffered a brain injury during a job, and must take care of him (.. in a disturbing revelation, about incest, she also provides her sexual needs!) .. she, actually, keeps him locked up in a room while working on the streets! Meanwhile, Nami is being targeted by a coward near when she finds a place of her own (.. she works like a sewer), and threatens to turn her into the authorities (.. Nami was a convict on the run, who fled the police from an underpass ) if you do not give him sexual favors. His wife throws a kettle of boiling water on his face and body, causing death, and the prostitution clan comes to look for Nami to pay the debt to lose a very important member of their organization. That's when Katsu (Reisen Lee), the pimp's lover and confidant, realizes that the only person responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former prisoner of hers, Scorpion. Submitting her with an injected liquid drug, putting her in a bird cage (!), Katsu embellishes in her captivity. What ultimately fuels Nami's anger is to watch a prostitute die outside her cell, victim of a short-term forced abortion, left to bleed to death. Finding a scalpel tight in his hand (from the operating room), Nami will free himself from the cage and fall prey to every member of the clan responsible for the death of the prostitute. The series of scalpel murders provides Gondo with the opportunity to capture Nami, and he will trap her in the underground sewers under the city, but can he catch her or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to his aid? <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say that there are no ties with director Shunya Ito or his film team because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is yet another perverse, unbalanced, and ultra-violent entry into the very entertaining series . Endowed with excellent production values ​​and a visually stylistic talent to capture all the madness in imaginative ways, Ito pushes you (or made me) into the twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on screen. When you have a sequence of extended opening credits in which your anti-heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a severed man-shackled arm to her, the viewer must know what they are for! The incestuous sub-plot is simply bizarre (.. and is filmed in a soft-core fashion with the retarded brother who cradles his insensitive sister, cold with dead eyes staring in front!), And the entire sequence of abortions is rather difficult to seduce. But the corner of the abortion, however uncanny, provides the motivation for Nami's revenge. Despite the imperfect ways of Nami and his criminal nature, you'd rather see her take these jerks rather than vice versa. The corner with Detective Gondo is also interesting. Gondo is willing to break the rules, and becomes a force-of-nature towards anyone who is in his way of capturing his mortal enemy. His destiny eventually, visiting another enemy of Nami, in an isolated cell while she watches, perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous and at the same time so funny. The scalpel murder is a montage of floggings that move at various points, the blades protruding from the flesh, with Nami leaving the crime scenes pushed to sweep away the entire clan in memory of a fallen victim in unfortunate circumstances . While the film is essentially a comic book adventure, there is a sadness that permeates and few characters come away without flaws. I imagine that many will move away from this mockery as far as unrealistic FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION is: BEAST STABLE is (in particular, how Nami is able to escape from time to time, realizing her goals of revenge, paying off those who have offended her ), but I looked at it as a violent cartoon, very similar to the films of the later 80s, and I liked it for what it was. As always, this film features some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful heavyies. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / quiet, yet cold staring at her enemies with violent intent, is in great shape (.. in more ways than one) and Reisen Lee, like his extravagant and cross-eyed opponent, runs away with the image like a perfectly realized enemy and shamelessly worthy of psychological torment (.. when both are in prison, the ways of torturing her of Nami are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but it's so wonderfully wrong, it features a dog that discovers Gondo's severed arm, walking down a street looking for a place to chew it!
