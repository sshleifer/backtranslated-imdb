As a fan of science fiction movies, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. Works well in the Alien series. But it's not alien, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. This film, but I think: because people are afraid of the dark. You can't escape from the darkness. It's impossible. You must be in front of the darkness and with that, what is in the dark. In this film I also liked the fact that the character of Vin Diesel, Richard B. Riddick, was not a typical good boy. He had secrets and did bad things in the past. For other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. First of all, he wants to get out of that planet himself. There are also other metaphors in this story. Any great science fiction fan should see this image.
