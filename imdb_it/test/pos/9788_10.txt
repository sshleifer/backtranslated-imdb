This film is not at all ugly as some people here say. I think it has a decent horror plot and the acting seems normal. People are exaggerating with the excess of what was wrong with this. It is simply the classic horror, the type without a plot to which we must think forever and forever. We can simply sit back, relax and be afraid.
