I wanted to see this film because I'm a huge fan of Abbott and Costello, and when I saw it I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, not hysterical, but fun. I mean, I laughed a lot of funny parts and just enjoyed myself. <br /> <br /> Although not the best of Perfect Straight Man and Perfect Buffoon, you should see it if you really love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Of all the Abbott and Costello movies I've seen, I can't say I saw one I hated. This is decent, fun and fun. Abbott and Costello have made at least quite decent films in their later years. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked this movie, it's not one of the best, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
