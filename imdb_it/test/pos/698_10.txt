This was an excellent return when it came out. He had some of the best talents available and a funny story. Between Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali, it was hard to choose who is nicer, and to add Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names and get a hit. Ok, a product for television success, but no less. If you can find this move, don't lose it. <br /> <br />
