When in 1982, "The Thing" was released in theaters around the world, it had a cold reception and very poor box-office results, becoming almost a failure in the career of John Carpenter as a director of horror films; however, time has shown that "The Thing" was definitely not a failed project and that disappointing commercial results were not the fault of the film. Nowadays, "The Thing" by John Carpenter has gained the appreciation it deserves deservedly and is considered by many horror as a classic horror, and not without a reason, like this new version of John W. Campbell, the story by Jr. "Who We Go (previously adapted as" The Thing From Another World ") is closer to the original story and retains a pessimistic sense of terror and high doses of suspense in a masterful study of paranoia. <br /> < br /> The plot of "The Thing" begins in the winter of 1982 in a US research station located in the remote territories of Antarctica, when crew members notice a Norwegian helicopter coming in. The two seemingly crazy pilots The helicopters are trying to kill a Husky dog ​​that makes its way to the American base.After the Norwegians were accidentally killed, the Americans try to figure out what made them crazy.They will soon find out that the Husky dog and the Norwegians were hunting it was not a normal dog, but a creature able to imitate every living creature, and not only that, it has a tremendous hunger. <br /> <br /> Director John Carpenter gained a place in history when he directed the seminal "Halloween" in 1978, where suspense and atmosphere were above the gusset and shock. "The Thing" could be seen as an evolution of that style, as even when Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottin's special effects (which were labeled by critics as "repugnant" in his day), the film is concentrated even more about the atmosphere and the suspense than in the violent (and very well done) cold-blooded performances. The feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" among the crew members increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the Thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), which ends in a situation where no one can be trusted. <br /> <br /> This element of the plot was more faithful to the concept of the original novel, and was obviously ignored by the previous version (not completely a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version less like a remake and more as a new conception of the original novel. Bill Lancaster's screenplay treats the characters with a brilliant dominance, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to trust them completely, making them an essential factor in the disturbing sensation of the terror of the film that continues to flow in the film. Mystery and suspense are at their best, how come one can tell who is the thing and who is normal, improving the paranoia and the unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. <br /> <br /> The cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective as to make the bad feelings between their characters almost real. Carpenter's regular contributor, Kurt Russell, while MacReady carries the film, and through his eyes we see the madness and horror that the research station becomes when situations get worse. Surely one of his best interpretations. Wilford Brimley is also exceptional as Dr. Blair, a scientist who goes mad after discovering the aims of the Thing. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" is a film so wonderfully realized that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, although they exist. The best known is the very low and sometimes not appreciated score of Ennio Morricone. It's not exactly ugly, but it feels out of place in some scenes and is not one of the best works of the legendary composer. Also, due to some misshapes with special effects, some scenes have been left out that actually fill some small holes in the plot, though not of great importance or even annoying. <br /> <br /> When talking about John Carpenter's movies, most people will call "Halloween" almost immediately as his favorite movie, but personally, I'd like to go with "The Thing", since I consider it the most great success of Carpenter so far, and one of the most interesting and really scary horror films ever made. I'd go so far as to call it one of the best films ever made. 10/10
