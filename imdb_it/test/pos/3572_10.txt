Bluff, I really think this movie is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is a different type of Colombian film. It's hilarious and the actors use local expressions that are so many funds to listen to. <br /> <br /> Show a different face or Bogot√° and I think it's very important because Colombia is a different country and we have to prove it the world This is the first film by director Felipe Martinez and I really, except that this film will be the beginning of a great career as a director. <br /> <br /> We must continue to support the filming sector in Colombia, because this film and other good films are the start of something big.
