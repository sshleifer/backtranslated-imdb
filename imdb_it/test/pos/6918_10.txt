This film is completely underestimated. <br /> <br /> It is a film similar to Will Keenan and Patrick Hasson, Waiting, as well as Adrien Brody's Restaurant and the classic film Breaking Away, which concerns young adults who are stuck and know they are stuck, with little or no chance to break free. <br /> <br /> Death By Pizza (Delivered) is about an intelligent, free, thinking young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is stuck and waiting, embittered by the hypocrisy of the world and embittered by his lack of direction and desire. Will will meet his nemesis, Reed (Ron Eldard), another intelligent young adult who is so bitter, who chose the path of crime. Both end up helping each other to get rid of their bitterness, which allows them to break away. <br /> <br /> For these young adults, ungluing, or breaking free, can mean either advancing forward in life, or plunging downward into death. <br /> <br /> Will's life is full of the marks of a "stuck" young adult: a job to suck, sweat, underpaid, crude clients, a former girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial university education without a degree, a house full of self-made art and, of course, the new friend whose impious choices help him save himself.
