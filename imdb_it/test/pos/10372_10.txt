After The Funeral was absolutely outstanding, and by far the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with Cards On the Table, which started so well, but I dropped considerably in the last half hour, and I didn't know what to think of Taken After the Flood, although I remember being confused at the end. After the funeral, as I said, it's one of my favorite episodes of Poirot, up there with Five Little Pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. I was afraid that they would ruin the story, but instead it is very faithful to the book. Now I will say that I do not mind changing books, and trying not to compare films and television adaptations with their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and adaptation does not do it justice. That's why I didn't like some of the Marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far from Poirot The Murder by Roger Ackroyd, Taken At the Flood and Cards on the Table are the only ones that really disappointed. Everything else goes from good to excellent, even the recent Appointment with Death, despite the numerous deviations from the book, which I admit is not the favorite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the wonderful production values, stellar performances and musical score awesome . Back to After the Funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It has a truly cinematic look, and the splendid photography and the splendid landscapes and costumes have made it a real spectacle for the eyes. The music was very moving and even obsessive, and the whole cast offered wonderful performances. David Suchet is impeccable as always Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are equally fantastic. But for me, the actress was Monica Dolan in the role of Mrs. Gilchrist, is there with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actress / actress in an episode of Poirot, was her performance. All in all, a must see, one of the best Poirot episodes by far, and one of the most faithful. 10/10 Bethany Cox
