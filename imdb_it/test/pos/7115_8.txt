This moody and disquieting horror film begins on a cliff-top castle overlooking the sea, a magnificent setting, while a vampire bat flies and insinuates itself towards a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). The bat turns into a man known as Baron Latos, actually Count Dracula (John Carradine). Seeks the help of Dr. Edelmann to cure him of his vampirism. In the end, the good doctor also wants to help his hump nurse assistant (Jane Adams), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's deception contaminates the doctor's blood and becomes a Jekyll / Hyde vampire himself. This is a little better than the previous year's "House of Frankenstein", being less episodic and more visually exciting. There is a disturbing scene in which Dracula tries to attract the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into his world, where he is initially playing "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressionistic shadows and disturbing music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful editing sequence that the studio often uses in their horror features. Two interpreters point out: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, is initially sympathetic, therefore convincingly threatening. Adams, his beautiful face in an alarming contrast with his twisted body, shows great pathos and sympathy. Everything ends in a slam climax, typical of the universal Horror of the 1940s, a bit brusque, with footage borrowed from "The Phantom of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope that Universal will soon release it on DVD (it was left out of their Double Feature versions).
