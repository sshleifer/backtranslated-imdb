I was stunned by this movie. I rented Antonioni's films / I rediscovered them and this film showed me the climax and the fruits of his 50 years of direction. What an eye for setting, color and detail! I have never seen such beauty and visual poetry before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. Yes, beauty moves me, as it has led Keats to write Ode on a Greek urn. This film is made for the mature audience, emotionally and intellectually. Anyone hoping to see physical action and the soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to watch this movie several times before I can really appreciate and judge it. This film should be requested for the vision of all filmmakers and directors. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a truly exceptional film, ordered by Kurosawa's Dreams.
