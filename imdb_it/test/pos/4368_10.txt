This British film version of the theater film I AM A CAMERA is based on "Berlin Stories" by Christopher Isherwood. This is the starting material for the famous musical CABARET. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, the main actress of her day, takes up the role of 1951 as Tony Sally Bowles. It is very far from the character of Liza Minnelli, but the basic "Sally" is all here despite the various film codes that would have blocked the story of being shot in Hollywood. Harris is perhaps an intern, but he is also quite as good as the mad and maddening Sally. His singing number is obviously nicknamed (by Marlene Dietrich no less) even though Harris apparently sings for herself at other times. <br /> <br /> Laurence Harvey (with very ugly hair) plays Isherwood with a zero charm and can't even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters does little with the role of Natalia (Marian Winters won a Tony support for the comedy) and Anton Diffring is OK as Fritz. Ron Randell plays the Clive caddish but looks a bit noisy. Lee Seidl is fun as a hostess. <br /> <br /> However, despite the general tone and the economic aspect, Harris is the center of attention and she is extraordinary. This film was released the same year as EAST OF EDEN in which Harris gives a brilliant performance as Abra. The comparison between the two performances gives a good look at the talent that Miss Harris possesses. These two characters could not be more unalike. Harris's Sally struts and struts and growls a very lascivious laugh. He also plays in circles around the boring Harvey. <br /> <br /> Without music and a familiar storyline, many viewers might find little to recommend this film, but it's a great chance to see the great Julie Harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951.
