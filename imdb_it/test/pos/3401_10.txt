I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best vintage pieces of the Civil War that I saw that tells a story of friendship divided by war. The costumes are fantastic, the narrative lines are fantastic, I like how the story jumps from one character to another to make you guess what will happen in their lives. There is a great balance between good and evil. Some of the characters that are bad in my opinion are too good not to be looked at. Whenever something more despicable than the last happens, I curse the TV as if it could hear me. I love how this miniseries makes me feel involved in his drama. I would, however, advise you NOT to watch the third film in the DVD series. It's a disappointment compared to the first two films and most of the original characters don't come back. I don't want to remember how the third film ended, I prefer to live with the thoughts of the end of the second film. Makes me happy.
