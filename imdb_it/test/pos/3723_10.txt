A poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogues. The anti-hero, The Man builds a contraption to escape from a band of marauders, out of the desolation of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to survive its survival. There he crosses paths with The Brute, brilliantly played by Jean Reno, of "The Professional" and "Mission: Impossible". The man is saved by an old mad genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. Using their wits, Man and the old genius are able to hold off the Brutus and his fellow man, but they realize that it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised, so they pause for this. This is a highly underestimated story of the desperate struggle for life, with excellent action scenes and intelligent humor. Of all the films of its genre, such as "Road Warrior", "Omega Man" and even "Ultimate Warrior" (with Yul Brenner as a boxer), "Le Dernier Combat" is the most skillfully crafted. Copies of the video are hard to find, I would like to give my left eye ball for one. If your local art house has ever had a revival of this film, I highly recommend that you break any efforts to see it big.
