The duchess and her three kittens enjoy the high life with their devoted human mistress until the evil butler Edgar, with his eyes on a great inheritance, decides to drug them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures face the unknown countryside and the meanest streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible cat alley O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After savoring the vast dangerous world, drive them home and Edgar takes his right desserts on the wrong side of a horse. As always, it's really the voices rather than the animations that are the heart of Disney magic: Phil Harris is as brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is ... well ... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who transform the old Napoleon and Lafayette bloodhounds into a pair of bizarre fried rednecks in the south. Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. The most surprising thing about seeing The Aristocats is now how deeply the Disney animation style has changed since it was at the forefront in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic and dated sensations are only the result of being locked up in the Belle Epoque Paris, but illustrations are more fusion (a pity) and the animation and the general rhythm far less frantic (sometimes a relief) than the more recent efforts like Aladdin.
