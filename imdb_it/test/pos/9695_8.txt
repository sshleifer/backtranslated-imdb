It does exactly what you expect, and then some. The first film was a step forward compared to the TV show with more serious acrobatics that were transmitted without censorship and a knotty factor that had increased. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more convoluted. <br /> <br /> The stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some painful extravagance, sprinkled with amusing little scenes to make that smile turn into a disgust of disgust. br /> <br /> Knoxville, as always, dominates the proceedings, but this time he is right to be at the center of the stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts, with Bam Magera also proving himself wild as always, despite having resized his image in "Viva La Bam". Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to take part in fewer skits, despite being focal in previous releases. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez, then surely enjoy this movie and you will laugh out loud for the 100 minutes of its duration, if you see it as a childlike, disgusting or sad snapshot of today's youth culture , you'll find it more offensive than ever. Then f ** k off.
