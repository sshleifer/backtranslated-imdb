I'm so impressed, really. I was expecting poor player humor and nothing else. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a lot of pretty geeky humor. But the film is so well done. The acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue, while the cheesy gamer, at times, I believe to satisfy the crowd of players, is not bad at all. Sometimes it's even, I dare say, fantastic. <br /> <br /> When the player, who built this non-traditional character, rather than the usual (min / max), gets all these extra attacks (it seems right, I didn't check the rules,) it was nice. <br /> <br /> The sets are incredible for what must be a fairly low production film. <br /> <br /> The story moves along. Transitions from the game world to the real world are well done. A male who plays a female character would sometimes be played by a female, and sometimes alone. Smart enough, I thought. <br /> <br /> The guy who decided to play a female, but kept forgetting that she was a female, was good for lots of laughs. He also said tags at one point, and the female continued to play the role (sorry, I didn't see his name, but it went really well.) The boy was always trying to "take some", it became a little boring, but I guess it was more humorous for the players. <br /> <br /> There was so much pleasure in the film. Carefree. Fun! Very well done and I say this as a movie fan, not as a player (and I'm not a D & D player.) As I said, I expected a lot less. <br /> <br /> Movies often don't hold my attention, I end up listening to them while I work on my computer. This caught my attention. I can't praise a much higher movie.
