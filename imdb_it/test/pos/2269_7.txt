"Everything is Illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. This version speaks more of the changes in Eastern Europe from World War II to the post-cold war and how the younger generation relates to that story as a family memory. <br /> <br /> The director / debtor Liev Schreiber preserves some of the novel's humorous and linguistic clashes, especially through the wonderful Eugene Hutz as a deceptive Ukrainian tourist guide. It is so captivating that the film becomes more of its odyssey in its country and in its family as it goes from its comfortable environment in the sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical and isolated land that has been devastated by the conquerors through the communists and now the capitalists with both Jews and non-Jews as debris. Although his opening scenes are fun when he establishes his brazen skill, we will later hear his fishing out of the water in his own country when he tries to ask local yokel for directions. <br /> <br /> Shreiber uses Elijah Wood, as an American tourist, as a tight cog in a visual panoply, since his character is less verbal than one of the book's narrators. He and Hutz play each other well until they conclude that it becomes more sentimental in this aerodynamic plot. Once the grandfather's story takes over in the last quarter of the film, wonderfully and unpredictably decreed by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis, given that they merely order the closure. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a great job visualizing the human impulse to document the story. One of her consultants in the credits is Professor Yaffa Eliach and her style of remembering pre-Holocaust life through artifacts has clearly inspired the look and is very powerful and effective. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic is the Ukraine and the production design staff have managed to find memorable symbols of change in cities, towns and countryside, as it is now primarily a road movie, and the long driving scenes drag a little. Schreiber preserves part of the symbolism of the book, in particular of the moon and the river, but having cut out the parts of the book that explain those, they seem simply beautiful or disturbing to the atmosphere and no longer represent time and destiny. <br /> <br /> Like W.C. Fields would have foreseen, the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughter. In general, Schreiber has more intensity than the book. It is irresistibly moving, especially for those who have not read the book, but less morally and emotionally disordered. <br /> <br /> The film is greatly relieved by its wonderful soundtrack, which ranges from songs and instrumental to the gypsy of Hutz from the band to traditional melodies to contemporary tracks to the klezmer fusion score by Paul Cantelon. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about the Holocaust as such, it is a kind of mirror image of "The train of life" (Train de vie) as the memory of a time charged with meaning now, but resonate more with those who have an emotional connection with that story.
