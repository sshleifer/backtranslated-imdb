Highlighting the acting of Sidney Poitier and the screen presence of John Cassevetes, The Edge of the City is a highly watchable film of the fifties, directed by Martin Ritt. There is a fantastic acting and an extraordinary black and white photography. <br /> <br /> Poitier is a pleasure at this point in his career and Tommy Tyler, the character he plays is happy and outgoing. He befriends Axel Noordman, played by Cassevetes, who is a young man suffering from low self-esteem and a past he wants to keep hidden. Tyler, a black man, takes his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and a new girl. <br /> <br /> Tyler and Noordman are employed in the New York docks at a time when workers were expected to tow the line, if they knew what was good for them. The boss Charles Malik, played by Jack Warden, in one of his many hard-bitten roles becomes the center of discontent, which leads to a resounding showdown with Noordman. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we are left with mixed emotions. However, the two main characters have left the public with a story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world.
