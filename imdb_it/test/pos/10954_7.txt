12/17/01 All I can do with this film is improvise about my impressions. They didn't give me "changes", I don't know the "score" and I'm not polite in the genre. I've always had problems following chord changes (trumpeter, you know), so I was pretty limited at doing the simple "keep the melody in mind" and hanging it up. What set me up on this incredibly moody black and white piece of blues was the knot he gave me in my head and heart in trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or choose a path along the melody (story). he went with the melody as usual; I kept losing myself on the changes - too deep, extended, over my head, probably. Still, it was a gas to try to keep up. I admired the actors who played the theme and the plot. I have not seen some things or things that others seem: I did not feel the light that the skin was "trying to pass" as much as she was or unaware of the color problem or was trying to ignore it - at the beginning: after she returned to fight. The pale-skinned young man (his nudism trumpet was ridiculous) was ambiguous, ambivalent, and - perhaps his best feature - was remote. What, I thought after the shadow curtain closed on this provocative piece - is it the foundation of something like this? Is it a way of finding "reality" by setting up a stage, populating it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and a theme? Is it more real or truthful than a well-made script - without the benefit of editing and revision? Improvisation is heroic, "artificial"? - More than a craft work? Where is the biggest or clearest truth: in retrospective art / craftsmanship or in manufacturing and reform? Well, I'm still lost in this question. I loved the movie; it made me lose on a cold foggy evening, where I just had to go home and take out the horn. Guess what? I burst into a twelve-bar blues riff, tried and true - I couldn't get away from the melody. The reality is too scary. jaime says to give them a 7 and more. I'm on break
