A little boy from a small town who works in a big city becomes a huge star and therefore the spirals escape control. It shows you the ascent to fame and then falls from fame and returns to a small increase. Big cast of actors and a great director = a great, great movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T Anderson. An extraordinary director who made Boogie Nights surprising. From the moment the film starts to the moment it ends, you can hear how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. A great story, a great film. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was as wonderful as he was in everything. Even Thomas Jane was magnificent and, although he only had a small part, he played to perfection. There's a scene in this movie that I can't get over, "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene" was fantastic, the acting and cinematography combined to make it amazing. I hadn't seen Boogie Nights and thank god I did, it's so well rounded and I'm now a HUGE PTA fan (Paul Thomas Anderson). Do everything you need to do and watch this movie.
