I'm glad I'm not the only one to find this series very good. This is the best series for young women! I have such a strange taste in comedies and find it so difficult to satisfy my intelligence, and I am so happy that their humor is exactly what I need. I love the band of actors! If anyone knows a series or just a movie like this, I say cute please reply because I miss the series. <br /> <br /> And kindly ask writers and producers to CONTINUE IT, even if the actors are all grown up now, I think! <br /> <br /> Good morning / day / evening / night! (because I don't know the exact time when you will read this post)
