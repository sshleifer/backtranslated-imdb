Now, after seeing The Advent Children twice, the plot is not as superficial as the majority has criticized it for me. If you didn't play FFVII or didn't like it for any reason, this movie is probably not for you. Being familiar with the original story is a prerequisite for fully understanding the CA, otherwise you will only see the biggest CG animation of your life so far. <br /> <br /> Without ruining the plot, I must admit that after seeing AC we put the pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing it for the second time actually allowed us to pay more attention to the story and most of the questions we had were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and does not honestly try to be anything else. There is little or no realism outside the world of FFVII that serves the purpose. The music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team according to the end credits) and works well with eye candies without exception. I found the music that enhances the experience added to visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that it is not possible to insert an FFVII in 1.5 hours and bearing in mind that the plot offered me more I expected There are two problems at hand in FFVII: AC and both stories have been wrapped very smoothly between the action sequences. And believe me when I say there is a lot. Action that is. <br /> <br /> I am changing my vote from 9 to 10 after looking at it the second time because I had lost some explanatory sequences that I could not put together the first time it gave some answers. As a warning, it will be easy to ignore the story and focus on the graphic, but try not to judge the wise children because of it. If you don't let history in, it's no wonder you look sloppy. <br /> <br /> I will not praise the graphics because I assume that we all know they are fantastic, which could be a euphemism. Above all the characters talk a lot more with their facial expressions than ever. I hope you pay attention to the plot because it really makes sense and works well with everything. Get ready for the journey of your life, there are no breaks.
