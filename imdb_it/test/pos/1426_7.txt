A middle-aged man, Robert Jordan, in his own way, hires a group of boy scouts after his predecessor was forced to leave the resistance. Jordan takes the package mainly to learn what kids like so they can revive his radio show that is losing its appeal for the younger set. At first he has a bad time with boys, especially with Mike, an 8-year-old boy who forms an attachment to the older man who is anything but reciprocated. Are things good for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this fun and old time movie.
