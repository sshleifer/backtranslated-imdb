Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of young and old audiences around the world, and his most recent cinematographic work is "Ponyo", a fairy tale for children that borrows elements of the story from La Sirenetta. Of course, like other Miyazaki classics like "Spirited Away" and his latest film, "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" is full of creativity that can be truly appreciated by adults, but this is definitely more a children's story than those recent efforts. It is a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, which aims at fascination instead of conflict. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is the story of a child with a childish eye of the same name, the daughter of a submarine sorcerer who wants to escape from the sea and become a child. When he does, he quickly makes friends with a boy named Sosuke. In the process he gets strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the city atop the cliff where Sosuke lives with his mother, and threatens to end the world. /> <br /> Like "Howl's Moving Castle", Walt Disney chose "Ponyo" for an American version and nicknamed it with an impressive selection of Western voices, even choosing home-made products from the younger brothers of the Disney band of the Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (the younger sister Noah) have the voice of Sosuke and Ponyo respectively. Voices of characters are also Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (mother of the Ponyo sea goddess) and a trio of hilarious women elders are played by Betty White, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is certainly there to make this film attractive to the American public and Disney is approaching. <br /> <br /> But the voices are not significant in a Miyazaki film, which concerns visual creativity. A fan of fluid and fluid transformations and movement, creating a fairy tale that takes place partly underwater, must have been a joy for Miyazaki to work with and maybe even all his motivation for choosing this story. Among the highlights are the drops of water that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo moves like living waves, as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make "Ponyo" the most beautiful of any other Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> As a children's story, however, "Ponyo" focuses its efforts on being adorable. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is a touching one, although Noah Cyrus who screams childishly when Ponyo embraces human life can be a bit annoying. As delicious as imaginative elements and love relationships are, there is little antagonism or danger. Miyazaki's previous films have clear villains, but the "Ponyo" conflict actually shrinks as the story progresses. Sosuke believes he has lost his mother at some point and in the background is the idea that the world is about to come out and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea, but "Ponyo" is mostly devoid of tension. The most glaring thing is that his climax is quiet, despite the general appreciation of all the characters. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" will surely please Miyazaki fans in every way with his imagination, and newcomers will still be impressed by his simple but visually ambitious storytelling, but this is definitely more of a movie for children, the best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of their form or target audience. Not exactly what you would expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work, but he will surely be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
