I have made many international trips, both for work and tourism. For both types I assure you that the best advice is also the oldest: always drink the wine of the country. In this film the archangel Michael arrives on Earth for work, quickly wraps it up and decides to stop for a small tour. Boy! "Drinks the wine of the country". <br /> <br /> Could the man be drunk forever with liquor, love and struggles? <br /> <br /> It would have the pleasure to get up in the morning and the lief to lie down for nights. <br /> <br /> These are things you can't do in Paradise so they like it when it's here! Obviously it turns out he has had a couple of other jobs to deal with and, if he is less direct about them than he was for the first, he is equally successful. The final scene is a bit schmaltzy but it's also wonderful. Jean Stapleton gets to dance with John Travolta.
