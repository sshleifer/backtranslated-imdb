Many of us who attended high school probably did it without having to take a physics course - I know I didn't. But after seeing this program, I would definitely like to have it. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe in a "main equation" that escaped Einstein in the last years of his life . Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, introduces us to this amazing theory in an extraordinarily simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe in which we live. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the tempting possibility of a "main equation" that could unite and explain everything ... * everything! * in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and gravity. Green takes us on a tour on how our understanding of the universe was seen with the work of Newton, then of Einstein and then later with the quantum-level physics revolution. <br /> <br /> But it is at this point that we encounter a problem that has plagued physicists for years, and that no one has been able to solve yet. How can we unify all these forces that we know together? We find, as Green constantly points out in the course of the problem, that the answer to this puzzling problem could be in the string theory. However, if we want to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very high price to pay. <br /> <br /> It turns out that out of the mind numbing the mathematical equations of string theory, which, as a consequence, we discover that we could live in a universe full of, not just 3 dimensions that you and I see every day plus 1 (for the time), but rather we could actually live in a universe of * 11 * dimensions. But the mathematics that emerges from that theory does not stop there - there is the possibility that parallel universes may exist; some of them right next to you and me! Could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? As Green points out; we have yet to discover it completely, but we know that the mathematics that emerged from these equations is already showing us that the universe still has a lot to show us. <br /> <br /> For those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts of this program - fear not. Professor Green does a wonderful job of abolishing the mathematical and more difficult concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the * concept * - which, when you remove all the calculations from it, turns from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple beast constantly emphasizes Green, an 'elegant' concept. Viewers of this program do not need precedents in science; the concepts are so simple that even a child could understand them. <br /> <br /> When you finish this program, you will truly come to understand in what a wonderful and mysterious universe we live.
