This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without doubt the best that the festival has to offer. I went to this film with little or no expectation after learning that the director was responsible for the horrible vampire movie The Forsaken. and I left pleasantly surprised. The film sees the fame of Lori in the fame of In Crowd as a young mother whose husband has just passed. He moved to an old family home in the mountains with his two daughters next to a mine that is a grave for overworked children during the day. Unfortunately for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone on their way. The film works on many levels. It is well done, full of suspense, has points of good cinematography and performance capable of Compton in particular. The atmosphere is spooky but a bit overwhelming, the score is decent and the effects of the make-up are macabre and simplistic. The film maintains a disturbing and disturbing tone and the same children with pale skin, torn lips and empty eyes are rather frightening and inexorable. The film is original and inventive without being too artistic or complicated. I can't see this movie turning it into a large version without some finishing touches and a slight tweak. But surely they have a good product in hand and should pursue a certain type of theatrical distribution. However the theater in which I saw it was horrible. The sound was terribly messed up which seemed more removed from the film and stopped in the middle because they could not center it on the screen that killed the atmosphere a bit. All in all it was the most satisfying of horrorfests' voices, perhaps because it had the least expectations, but nevertheless it was a welcome addition to genre films.
