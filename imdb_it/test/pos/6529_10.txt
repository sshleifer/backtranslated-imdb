I just realized and it's a great movie !! I loved it! Although Jane Brightons speaks at the beginning she is so annoying because of her parentheses, she doesn't open her mouth like crazy ... but you have to see it because it's a great movie !! the things he says here are so funny and extremely nice !! and I'm sure Aaron would probably say some of the things in real life because I don't know, it just looks like that !! ha ha there is a part in the movie that is really funny ... Jane's little sister meets him ... but I can't tell you what happens because I don't have to see you for you !! I went to see Aaron in concert and it was a lot of fun !! n smells so good ah ah ... I still can't believe that I met him !!! I have pictures if someone wants to see them !! Steph
