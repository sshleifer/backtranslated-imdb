The film was very good. I'm a passionate fan of mysteries and I usually understand who's going to be killed and who's killed. While I found out who was going to be killed, I didn't understand who did it. I was not happy with the portrait of the Gerda character, but given the year in which the film was to take place it is possible that the woman would have been "sickly". Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they simply don't have the same dynamic for them in the series because they don't have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I saw every actor who played it. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
