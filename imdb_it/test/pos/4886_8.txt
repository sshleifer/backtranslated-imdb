Having seen only five episodes of the show before this, (I watched the reps on BBC Two), I didn't have much League experience, but as a novice fan and a big fan of British comedy, I can say that this movie is fun . Seeing Herr Lipp, (which I had not seen on screen before the film), Briss and Geoff on the big screen were a great comedy. Being on screen is something that the League takes full advantage of, with heads exploding, (it will be a surprise who it is) and gruesome murders with random battles of medieval style all the time. <br /> <br /> Geoff is easily the most entertaining character of the three protagonists of this film, because he has the best interior and general behavior, just like in the series. One of my only disappointments with the film was not listening to Geoff screaming "Well, now I have this gun" even once, (even if there is an accumulation in part of the film.) The film itself as a whole is, for use the phrase that all the others make, Pythonesque and very reminiscent of films like "Life of Brian". The appearances of Tubbs and Edward have been welcome, but the line of Daddy Lazarou "Hello Daves" has split me more than anything he said (Lazarou is probably my favorite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward). He has a rather touching ending with one of the main characters being killed and I can only hope that this is not the last Vasey adventure on the League screen. With Gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or film, I am now very excited. This is a film that I will see again, partly because the projector died towards the end, leaving about 10 minutes of the film out, but mostly because it is inventive and fun. I'm not very annoyed if it's not as good as the TV series, because I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> One thing though, if you've never seen the League, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what you'll think of the people doing these things. As Tubbs or Edward would say, it's a local film, for the locals, and a precious thing in this. <br /> <br /> **** out of ***** (4/5)
