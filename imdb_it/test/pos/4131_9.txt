Gary Busey is superb in this musical biography. Excellent singing and excellent soundtrack. The Buddy Holly Story is a much better film than La Bamba. From reading other comments, there may be historical inaccuracies. Regardless, this is a fun movie on the toes and a good introduction to Buddy Holly's music.
