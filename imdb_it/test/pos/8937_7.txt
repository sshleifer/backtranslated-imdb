"Plots With A View" from 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the English could make it. The film's sense of humor is both moderately morbid and black, yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick. It's the only film by director Nick Hurran I've seen so far, and while I don't intend to watch any of his other films at the moment (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this is very funny and a lot of fun. The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to the city's drunken and adulterous major (Robert Pugh). Local mortologist Boris (Alfred Molina) has been desperately in love with Betty since childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love with her. In addition to being desperately in love, Boris has some other problems, since the eccentric American mortarist Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) has opened a thriving business in the same city ... a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre. Furthermore, "Plots With A View" benefits from a wonderful cast. Brenda Bethlyn, who has already shown herself to be a fun woman in the 2000 film "Saving Grace", is the protagonist, and once again she is very funny and very amiable in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays his shy admirer, offers a great performance as always, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly into the role of Betty's bad husband. The beautiful Naomi Watts is also as big as her husband's "secretary", I'm becoming a bigger fan with every movie I see her in. The most important role, however, is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant as always is in the role of the eccentric Mortician who organizes funerals that are quite unorthodox. Overall, "Plots With A View" is a very funny little British comedy that I highly recommend!
