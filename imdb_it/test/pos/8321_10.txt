and frankly that sums it all up. <br /> <br /> It is a small animated computer series that is filmed just like an animal documentary .... <br /> <br /> The animation is almost flawless (I thought the eyes of dinosaurs they swam for a long time on the neck were fake). <br /> <br /> However some of the model's shots did not seem so realistic ... <br /> <br /> and I thought that Jurrassic's park made a better T Rex .. <br /> <br /> If this is the kind of thing we see on a normal British TV series, then I can't wait to see what they can do in the movies .. <br /> <br /> I gave this 10/10 stars .. . <br /> (and the "making of" video was also great ... the skateboard dinosaur was pretty) <br /> <br /> <..>
