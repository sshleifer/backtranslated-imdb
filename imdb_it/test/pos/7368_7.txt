I recently bought this movie for three dollars in a garage sale, and while I'm glad I didn't have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> It is set up as a horror anthology, divided into 5 stories, including the story of the "connector" that involves four teenagers, whose car breaks down in a dark and lonely street in the middle of the night. Apparently, these kiddos love horror stories, because that's what they decide to do until morning - telling ghostly stories around a bonfire. Each character takes his turn telling a story, after which their story is wrapped in a beautiful turn. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Hook" is a bit of a waste of time, a little insipid and boring. Fortunately, this is not one of the main stories and only takes about 5 minutes. It is intended simply to introduce the film and it is easy to overlook the originality of this piece. <br /> <br /> The second story, "The Honeymooners" is, eh, okay. This is - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon! They are traveling in a camper van going to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for the night, but are quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the place, or risk being attacked by some dangerous and unknown creatures. This story has a pretty good configuration, but only an "ok" delivery. Basically, it's pretty fun and mysterious until the monsters are shown, so it's just a little uncertain. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People Can Lick Too" is my favorite. It involves a girl whose parents go out for the night and who is the older sister is leaving her for a party. So, she will be all alone - a fact that she makes known to her friend on the Internet. The problem is, that internet mate? She's not exactly a thirteen-year-old girl. The conclusion of this story is slightly less climatic than I wanted to see, but still quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> The final plot, "The Locket" is certainly the one full of atmosphere. Set in a terrifying villa on a dark and rainy night, it is the story of a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!) Who travels around on a motorcycle that stumbles into this house just when he has a problem with his bike conveniently . Meet the dumb girl who lives at home and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, not everything is beautiful and dandy - and it may have something to do with that locket hanging from its beautiful neck ... <br /> <br /> After the stories have been completed, we are presented with a turning point involving the four teenagers in the car, a turning point that, in retrospect, should have been obvious, but which in reality he didn't see coming, and is a pleasant enough conclusion for the cinema. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, a good movie. Rent it if you can, because unfortunately, I don't really think it has much value to review. But the next time you're in the mood for a vaguely disturbing litte movie like "Tales of the Darkside" or something like that, take this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights and treat yourself to this surprisingly stylish little flick.
