Magnificent, original, beautiful film. The acting is great, the settings in decor are superb (Paris at its best - but then the real Paris, not the famous settings) and even the music will do it. A brilliant story, very detailed, which I really like. <br /> <br /> The best French film I've seen (and French cinema is very good)!
