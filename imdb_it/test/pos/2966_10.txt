I liked this movie. I wasn't really sure what it was before I started watching it, but I liked it anyway. It was a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother didn't want her to be like her. Meet and fall in love with a boy (Riley Smith) who is the city for a charity football game. It is a good movie. I just hope it will be available again or will be released on video.
