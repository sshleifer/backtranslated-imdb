I saw this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> There are more than a dozen French films that are breathtakingly modern from en couer de hiver to the three colors trilogy and all of them are special. This film is one of them. A real treat with so many great things ranging from Hitchcock's homage to two beautiful women in Roman and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy woman and steals many of the scenes in which she lives. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this film is twisted because the scenes are a perfect blend of the past and the present acts as a counterpoint to the extraordinary journey of the characters that the film simply flows and you barely realize that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the audience spellbound and bewitched. <br /> <br /> Like most French and European films, this story would never have been translated across the Atlantic because no studio could capture the magic without throttling life with Hollywood whitening common to most films that are lost in translation. Americans make brilliant films, but not of this kind ... maybe if they let someone like a young Polanski work on them, they might not totally slaughter an English version ... <br /> <br /> For those who do not watch subtitled movies that you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss. For those who know how to read, then you would be spying to lose films like this ... I would describe it as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only with the cheese outside the reviewer who called this elitist movie. I think I saw him make a four and twenty cake add. He thinks that Romane Bohringer is a type of French mayonnaise ... He is arty in the way that Pulp Fiction is arty ... but with more savoyard faire ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 with every vision. .. and someone has Romane's phone number ... she's the perfect dressing for French salads ...
