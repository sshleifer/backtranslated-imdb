If you are a long-time fan of the Doctor and you hurt yourself when you heard that they were doing another series, rest easily - more than satisfying the high expectations of the original. The rhythm is much faster than the original shows, adapting more often to episodes of 50 minutes instead of the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting superb. The most difficult thing, and the best thing, to get used to are the production values ​​of the new series. Compared to the original, it has now. (Although I will always have fond memories of award-winning monsters and puppet monsters.) If you're not a fan, or if you try the original and can't make it, jump right in with both feet! All you need to know about the Doctor, they'll tell you as they go along. This series was written with minimal references to the Doctor's enormous background, in particular to encourage new viewers. Of course, I'm just seeing the first new series now as it is shown on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words, probably cut into tapes for time limits), but I'm looking forward to future episodes on either TV broadcast or DVD. (July 4th can't come soon enough!)
