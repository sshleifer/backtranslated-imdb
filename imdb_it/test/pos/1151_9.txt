I returned from Morocco, then, where my father was tied to the German embassy, ​​when the film was released in Europe; I took all my friends to see it, to show them the beauty of the country, where Jimi had played - and remained -; where the hippies stopped after leaving Ibiza and before joining Goa. Sean Combs has just been celebrated in a restaurant of friends in Marrakech recently, the Djema el Fna was much wilder in those days than it is now; the Stones went first, Brian recorded in Tangier; so it is the memories and the entertainment for the family and I am happy that my son can get to know North Africa by watching this film. Candice Bergen looks beautiful and oo7 / Connery is really fun; and Teddy Roosevelt as played by Brian Keith quite impressive.
