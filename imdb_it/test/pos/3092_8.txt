Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the strangest and most perplexing art films I've ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, although it has documentary elements of its images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder if it's really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film is basically the story of the earth and the creation of the earth taken from the perspective of a stranger, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, which takes place in the Sahara desert. The title of the image refers to the illusion or reflection of images, both real and hallucinated, that people in the desert often testify. These are also known as mirages. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an airplane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again. With each landing of a plane, the actual architecture of the place where it is landing and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve into each other and become less and less real and increasingly reflective. The images of this film become more and more intense and more unusual as the image continues. The narrative of the film tells the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape that move in front of the camera. The shots go further and further into the desert and Herzog films what he sees and finds. The strangest reflections in the world are exposed in the distance while Herzog encounters some of the purest and most photogenic collections of strangers that you are likely to see. When the soundtrack of Leonard Cohen starts playing, you can be sure that you are in the world of a madman in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can't say much more about this film without ruining anything, but I'll say it's a sobering experience and there's really nothing like it. I love watching movies that are only in classes. This film is certainly a good example of how Herzog loves to weave narrative narrative and documentary production into an interchangeable form. Fata Morgana unfortunately does not stop any longer, but it is a bit welcome, but when it comes to the end the images will probably be burned in your mind forever. Definitely worth seeing for those who are obsessed with nature and the origin of the universe.
