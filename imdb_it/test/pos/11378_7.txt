An interesting piece to accompany the real documentaries of John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with what eventually killed Holmes, and certainly could have benefited. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg were the most praised for this, but I felt that the real stars were Julianne Moore as the aspiring cocaine addict mother, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with the identity of a pornstar / stereo seller in wild clothes and William H. Macy, who is the wife is the last bitch. Not to mention Alfred Molina, almost unrecognizable. Macy's New Year's Eve and Cheadle's chance to live a better life after a robbery at a donut shop are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best scenes. What this film does best is to show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. However, none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all bounce back to their normal lives.
