I'm a big fan of the legendary director Elia Kazan. His films often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. Both obsessive love in "Splendor In the Grass, poverty in" A tree grows in Brooklyn "or racism in" Gentlemen's Agreement ". While looking for other films made by Kazan, I came across a film based on an Arthur Miller novel. movie entitled "Focus" sees the participation of William H. Macy (who appears to be one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. It is anti-Semitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> The character of Macy seems to go agree with the fanatics of his neighborhood and his work, until he personally hits it. That is the key here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew it was wrong and wanted to take a position, he acted because he was now considered a stranger, and he began to experience the same looks, the same remarks, and the same brutal that Mr. Finklestein (David Pamyers) experienced. <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well Meat Loaf does a great job cando to dirt bag! The performances of Macy and Dern are exceptional! It is easier in life to move forward instead of going against it. Sometimes, for people to be able to take a stand, things must have an impact on their lives or on the lives of their loved ones ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
