For once a story of hope highlighted on the tragic reality of our youthful face. Favela Rising attracts a scary, dangerous and unjust world and shows through the beautiful color and the music in movement like a man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and to change it through action and art. A funny, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. I showed this film to many high school students who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and armed violence and were in love with Anderson, the protagonist. I recommend this film to all ages over the age of 13 (due to subtitles and some death images) from all backgrounds.
