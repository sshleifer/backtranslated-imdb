This is a film about loneliness and how far away is it? physical and emotional - among people it tends to foolish relationships. <br /> <br /> The narration is simple to the point of banality: a young Yusuf (Emin Toprak), from a rural village, arrives in Istanbul to be with his oldest and most successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir ); Yusuf wants to work in the big city. After trying for a few weeks to find work without success, the tension of having Yusuf living with him is too much for Mahmut. Are they fighting? nothing physical, only verbal. Eventually, Yusuf leaves, leaving Mahmut alone again. End of story ... <br /> <br /> Except that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best in cinema. Much is said visually; dialogue is used to bring out disagreement, distrust, hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual gems in this film. For example, while looking for work, the young Yusuf, who needs a relationship, tries in vain to attract the attention of various young women around the city. The expression on his face, as he gets frustrated every time, says it all. <br /> <br /> Or, wanting a cigarette, Yusuf opens the door to the balcony of Mahmut's apartment and lights up in the icy December air, leaving the door open; Mahmut eventually gets up from the desk, goes to the door (all glass) and the cousins ​​look at each other for what seems like too much time. Then Mahmut closes the door, leaving Yusuf out in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or, Mahmut cleans up after Yusuf, reluctantly and with growing anger; And all the while, does Yusuf waste his time chasing skirts instead of seriously looking for work, and spending Mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew? Yusuf is emotional, messy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational, logical, self-confident and a maniac of demanding control: the right-brain dichotomy, left hemisphere, beautifully interpreted by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, a frown that no word can convey. /> <br /> But, Mahmut is not completely emotionless: he still loves his ex-wife who tells him he is in Canada with her future husband. Mahmut influences a distant and secure friendship with his ex, and makes sure she's okay to go. He loves her well. He says goodbye. Leave the coffee shop where they were talking. Later, when he calls to say a last goodbye, on the way to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly watches as he leaves. The intensity of the emotion on his face, while disappearing through a door, is worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a highlight of the work of the two main actors and the director, Nuri ceylan. Some may argue that the pace is too slow; but life proceeds slowly for most of the time, especially for those who are alone. Working with the camera is also relatively simple: choose the scene, set the camera and lighting, and let the actors move through the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene, keeping the camera still. Were there some panoramic shots, some shots from above, some rural scenes ?? but much of the film is shown as on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide-angle lens. Except for TV and radio music in history, there is no audio track. And there are those long silences as the two men sit and watch TV together and / or engage in a very limited conversation. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV, so it amused me to see that, on a few occasions, I was watching TV while watching TV too. The silence in the film corresponded to the silence in my house (I was awake, all the others in bed); my chair and my position coincided with Mahmut's while he was watching TV. Pretty scary, giving me the feeling of almost 'being there' with him ?? And, I think I am, in a sense. <br /> <br /> I won't say anything else, because I want you to savor the other scenes I haven't described. It's not a movie for everyone, for sure. More than any film I've seen, it only shows how much we die when we're alone? just as we are all alone when we die. Mahmut's face, which fades to black in the final scene, will remain with me for a long, long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for serious movie lovers.
