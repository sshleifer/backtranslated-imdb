This brings back so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's fantastic. The trains, the old house, the fallen runner, the really frightening landslide (well, that's when you're 6), the drama if the kids can stop the train, or crash? This is a film for children without a doubt, but offers great harmless without blood / guts / guns etc. For children. And there's Bernard Cribbins, it's fantastic. 8/10
