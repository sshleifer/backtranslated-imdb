A couple of days ago I saw the fantastic "House of sand and fog" and I was impressed by the extraordinary performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to see "Ray", trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley didn't win the Best Actor Oscar. After seeing Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: it really deserved to be rewarded. I like Ray Charles, I wasn't his fan, but it's unbelievable the similarity of Jamie Foxx with him. The film is fully supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates in most of the shootings, and his movements on stage seem as if he were a reincarnation of Ray Charles. As for the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very pleasant, with many beautiful songs and scenes that mainly show a Ray Charles addict. My biggest surprise was to find out that Ray Charles was an addicted hero and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
