Some martial arts purists think the comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the old-school kung-fu movie; and it is true that the introduction of comedy in the genre marked the end of the "chop-socky" period in the Hong Kong film. But the fact is that you can carry on an exhibition of mainly physical skills for so long, so everyone gets bored. And it is precisely for this reason that the chop-socky is dead and how the action film "New Wave" of Hong Kong was born: the producers, the actors, the directors have all been bored of having hit people for ninety minutes of row. <br /> Having said that, and given that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his curriculum, this film must be seen as something other than a simple kung-fu comedy. Rather, it is a comic film in the martial arts genre, and indeed one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> What Liu did with this film is really a pleasant surprise: he took a martial-art plot and rebuilt it along the lines of a Hollywood-style musical! Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! It was around the time of the making of this film that some filmmakers and movie fans began to recognize that the martial arts film performance (actually derived from the acrobatics of Chinese opera) has more in common with dance than with combat. (I will continue to emphasize this connection until most Americans realize what they should look for when they watch a martial arts film - well choreographed body movements, using an action film plot as an excuse for their performance .) To some extent, clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided that he would explore it near his limits. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredibly fascinating entertainment, full of wonderfully human characters attempting the miraculous kung-fu (and tripping on their shoelaces whenever they don't). and the film, set between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, allows Liu to explore the nature of the Westernization and modernization of China that has contributed so much to the realization of China that we know today. The film also has considerable historical importance. <br /> <br /> Also, fans of Stephen Chow's recent Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this movie carefully, as Chow clearly learned from it before his film was made. <br /> <br /> A very funny and well done film. Oh yes, and kung fu in it is really, really good. <br /> <br /> Purists will not admit it, but this is probably the best film by director Liu.
