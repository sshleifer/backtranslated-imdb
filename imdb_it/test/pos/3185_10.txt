My family and I normally don't watch local movies for the simple reason that they are badly made, lack depth and just not worth our time. <br /> <br /> The trailer for "Nasaan ka man" caught my attention, my daughter-in-law and my daughter, so we took time to see it this afternoon. The film exceeded our expectations. The photography was very beautiful, the story was beautiful and the acting was fantastic. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so is Claudine Barretto. The fact of having despised Diether Ocampo shows that he was effective in his role. I have never been so touched, touched and affected by a local film. Imagine a cynic like me wiping my eyes at the end of the film? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! Way to go, Jericho and Claudine !!
