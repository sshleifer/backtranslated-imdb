The Beguiled is a rather satisfying film for those looking for the things above. For diehard fans of Clint Eastwood, it will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role (apart from the fact that his character is a charming womanizer, of which he is not so casual), the ambiguous nature of his character, which goes from being a sort of hero fallen to a manipulative and insatiable female eater (to put it in one way or another) in the end it will be too much to handle for anyone used to seeing him play heroes in the best western tradition, morally a bit dirty but still without that side dark. I think he manages to pull this unlikely part, but the ones who really steal the show are the two rivalant women, the teacher Geraldine Page and the student leader, played by Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> We see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman's Edwina is the sweetest and most innocent girl in the world until she becomes infatuated with John McBurney and becomes possessive of him. This is what causes the tragedy, as well as the secret lust of the director, the forbidden fruit. Bring an ugly and ugly secret about his incestuous relationship with his brother, whom she clearly still idolizes. The fourth factor in this "unreasonable" love spiral is the evil Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who lures John away from his crush on Edwina and his bed. <br /> <br /> The whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of gothic atmosphere, which makes it a rather rare thing in the western genre, but a popular thing in the films of the 70s. A unique result of the Siegel / Eastwood team and a film not for the faint of heart.
