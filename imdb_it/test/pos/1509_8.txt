I couldn't help but savor the entire premise of CAT IN THE BRAIN because it dutifully explains that a director is going crazy, seeing the people killed by the films of the past he has made. Even trivial activities like cooking a meal in the microwave or using a water tap produce some horrible carnage in a movie in the past. The director Fulci who plays himself, is directing THE FANTASMI DI SODOM (?) And he cannot deprive his mental well-being of a constant murder. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who, instead, uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people, hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps he is responsible. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a film that playfully jokes while enjoying the image of Fulci, while exploring the themes of how such a profession, which produces so much death and destruction, rarely wild, can shape and shape a legacy . The film presents an enveloping story that surrounds non-stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in a macabre way. This one has a shower murder that Hitchcock has never been able to direct, or probably wants. The ferocity of the film compliments Fulci di Fulci's mental state (I know) during the race. Reality and cinematic fiction have merged and Fulci cannot find escape. The ending (.. that explains the old cliché: "It's just a movie") couldn't work better than it does here. Fulci's boat says Perversion (.. an excellent touch) and moves away. I can only wish this was his last film, because it is perfect if there is one. David L Thompson is the deranged psychiatrist who plans to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a policeman. Fulci's fears had a family killed by the devil. <br /> <br /> The ultraviolence in the film offers many unique ways to take a head like a box door, a sickle, a chainsaw and an hatchet. The most brutal violence comes from the bad activity of the chainsaw while a corpse is torn to pieces (like a gardener's chainsaw working on a log it fits beautifully in a sequence of nightmarish hallucinations) .. the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a kid is beheaded! The opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away, feasting on Fulci's brain, is a scream. The scenes that are spliced ​​in the film, with a shining Fulci watching, are obvious, but I couldn't help but enjoy it anyway.
