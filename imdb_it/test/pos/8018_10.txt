While "The Jackal" [remake of the excellent "Day of the Jackal"] has better aesthetics [and a load budget on the boat], this film nails the real "Carlos" personality ... <br /> <br /> Quinn excels when the naval officer enlisted to impersonate Wiley's jackal to lure him out of hiding and, at the hands of Kingsley and Sutherland, turned to do so. Risking his family, his career and everything he believes in, he takes on the task, even if reluctantly. <br /> <br /> To say the least would spoil it ... this is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [of 4]
