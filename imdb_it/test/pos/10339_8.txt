This is the type of film that you initially choose to compose the numbers from the video rental ..... only to discover a fun and underrated movie !! The police opening sequence arrives in a dark and rainy house where the "wife" committed a murder ....... or is it ?? .... and the rest of the film tries to unravel what really happened. ... OK ... the film is a bit "campy" ... but it has good editing and dialogue ..... professional acting ... often funny ... and the last scene with l 'facial expression is one of the best of its kind ...... definitely worth watching ..... deserving at least a 7 or an 8!
