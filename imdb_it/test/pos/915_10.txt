Most of Kieslowski's films look to me like puzzles, designed to expand the mind and soul. The characters are not very credible, they are idealized, they are schematic. However, the way Kieslowski presents their tortuous ways through life, their complicated interaction with others, with the universe, with possibility or destiny, makes me understand faith, makes me (want) to believe in God. What at some point everything has a meaning, if not for me, then surely for someone. <br /> <br /> Trois couleurs and above all "Rouge" comes close to making me touch, feel, experience the "truth", the "meaning" of perhaps any other of his films. The only problem is that the paths of the "puzzles" explored are a little too similar to his other films and at some point become quite predictable. There is still a lot of joy to be had here. It's like a family brand of wine - you know what to expect and it offers you, sometimes with a freshly found bouquet that could come from aging - or wine or yourself.
