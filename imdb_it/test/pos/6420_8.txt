In a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is abandoned on the moon when Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a troubled translator who lives in Italy, wakes up from a nightmare on a lunar mission mixed with an old film that scared her as a child. He doesn't even remember the last three days, except for a torn photo of the Garma hotel he found in his apartment. Fired from her job, Alice goes to that island of the resort to try to reconstruct the mystery ... <br /> <br /> Often advertised as a crime because of her director (IL QUINTO CAVO by Luigi Bazzoni) and the presence of Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS is actually a psycho-thriller with a deliberate rhythm and sci-fi nuances. Blurring the distinction between dream, reality, memory and film, the disturbing story is magnificently photographed by the winner of the Oscar Vittorio Storaro with a carefree soundtrack by Nicola Piovani. It also combines elements of films as diverse as MACCHE SOLARI by Armando Crispino and DEATH IN VENICE by Lucino Visconti in his depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination and perhaps madness. The Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, still on the screen, laughs at her Carol Hammond in A WOMAN'S LEATHER LIZARD by Lucio Fulci as Alice, a young woman thrust into a mystery that makes her question her sanity. The positions reflect Alice's unstable mental state; the island of Garma, out of season, with its Arab influence and its ancient ruins, is a solitary, almost mystical place that does not want to renounce its secrets. Evelyn Stewart started out as an interested friend, Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests, Peter McEnery plays a handsome biologist who tries to help Bolkan, and the always intense Klaus Kinski is "Blackmann" in the film -with-a-film, "Footprints On The Moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is a class "100% euro-weird guaranteed" class but not for everyone. There is only one murder towards the end, but you will not see it coming while the film starts coming together.
