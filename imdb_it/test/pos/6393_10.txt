If you take Huxtable's parents and mix them with Kyle's parents, you get a perfect blend of parents up and down that you can wish for your family child education skills. The best part of any show is that parents do not realize that all the pompous and hypocrites of the upper class know everything but at the same time they are not stereotyped and poorly educated parents who are constantly cheated and not respected by their children. My children are 20, 16 and 6; about the same age as Kyle's children and I see so many of their situations that reflect my experiences with my family. The stupidity they indulge only shows that when you have a love in your family you don't have to take yourself too seriously to keep your family together and have fun with your children.
