When it was opened in London during the Christmas period of 1969, this musical version of the famous James Hilton story was criticized by critics. The same reception welcomed her when she was opened in the United States, inducing MGM to withdraw its "Roadshow" status and to cut almost all of its songs. What a mistake !!! <br /> <br /> Viewed years later, when the trendy world of the 60s and 70s turned in on itself, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS is a total joy. First of all, like "Chipping", Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances. Watching him walk away from the hated, cold, impassive Latin teacher of a boy's college, to a man who finally manages to see the colors of the world (after falling in love and marrying the musical star Catherine Briskit) is seeing a genius at work . (If you can, look at LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIP back to back for a number of days or weeks, then you'll see what a great actor O'Toole is and how great he is in CHIPS. ) <br /> <br /> Catherine, interpreted by the luminous Petula Clark, at the height of her popularity, is man's dream; handsome, loving, understanding, with a great voice to start. Most of the songs are beautiful and fit perfectly into the story, while Herbert Ross's direction gives life to the script. <br /> <br /> Ok, this movie might be a little too romantic for some people, but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted, sung and directed love story, look no further. (If you can get your hands on a wide screen version of the laser disk, even better. I'm looking forward to the debut of CHIPS on DVD.)
