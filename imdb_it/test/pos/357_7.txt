I should disagree with the previous lame comment. I saw this did not expect too much from it. The fact is that the cast was superb, especially the protagonist Teen Female. The dark sides of all of them have come through, all of them have been messed up in a non-obvious way. There was a current that ran through the film of adolescent anxiety and sexuality. The role of the serial killer was well interpreted also because you could feel that he had lived what they had as a child. What this film is, is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I agree they don't make the obvious, but you could relate to the messy teenage heads who did what they did and it's believable. Even a decent dark end, instead of what could easily have been a happy opt-out. The attention to detail in the film was also fantastic. I am very good 7 out of 10. A little slow at times, but it allows a thinking person to see where the characters come from.
