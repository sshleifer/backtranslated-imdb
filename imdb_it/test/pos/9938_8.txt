A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a theatrical performance like Lady Macbeth, thanks to the production diva's accident that falls in front of a moving car. A success that has won her awards, Betty (Christina Marsillach) finds instead the horror as the only one responsible for making her arrive at this point terrifies her in a cruel way. <br /> <br /> First his stage manager boyfriend, Stefano (William McNamara) is brutally stabbed with a knife while she has to watch, tied with a rope to a pillar in his uncle's vast villa, keeping his eyes closed thanks to the needles fixed with adhesive tape under the eyes, with a puncture result if it blinks. By allowing her to escape, Betty finds herself once again in this unfortunate position, when a specific gold chain is found on her Lady Macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows fleeing their cage in the hall machines, by the designer of clothes that is first thrown to the ground by an iron and subsequently stabbed atrociously by a pair of scissors (.. to mask this ugly scene, the chain falls into her throat with the murderer who must open his throat to find it, while he is not specifically elaborating this act, Dario uses the torn sound of scissors for an optimal effect with the camera that often withdraws towards the dead face of the victim). Having no place to turn, Inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, playing it cold and insipid at Dario's request) promises to capture the psychopath while Betty relies on his few remaining friends for comfort, director Marco (Ian Charleson, by GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF FUOCO, who later died of AIDS: a sad footnote, Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson informed him at the end of the shootings that he was HIV positive, trying the stage after a successful horror career despite having been rejected by critics, and friend Mira (Daria Nicolodi, the former bully of Dario), his agent and confident. But the serial killer is quite motivated and a clash between them will obviously have happened in the theater, as Marco added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think this is Dario to his wildest and most nihilistic. Although he certainly made more gruesome films (such as those in his Master of Horror and SLEEPLESS would suggest), this film is really a stir in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to look was a real Dario joke about the kind of audience that likes to look away from the most horrible parts of horror movies. I found myself massaging my eyes every time he had to blink (.. brilliantly, Dario shoots the puncture from the point of view, obtaining a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the taped needles holding their eyes open). I like how Dario will show Betty's wide eyes, horrified by what she was forced to look at, while blood tears needles when she has no choice but to blink. Ronnie Taylor's photographic work is impeccable, like the crow's point of view shot in the theater at the end while looking for the killer. Or when the camera "travels" through the theater rooms following the killer who wants to see his muse from a box seat. Or, the sequence of dreams in which we are immersed in Betty's memory of an event concerning the death of her mother by a certain murderer, who wears the same mask and gloves as the one that is causing her trauma at the moment. The highlight, in my opinion, is the sequence of shots fired from bullets, masterfully staged by everyone involved while the camera follows a bullet that shoots through the eye of a victim, exploding from his head, passing through a phone that Betty has planned to use for help. We even get a crow that pecks the eyeball from the murderer (.. to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling in its beak). Only the aspect of which I didn't care, often emphasized by the opponents of the film, is the "final" ending that I personally felt to be a bit useless, but I imagine that Dario wanted to emphasize that Betty was not really like his mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies that, in a twist, refer to the reason why the killer torments our heroine. The rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me, because I felt that those moments of evil graphic attacks needed a jarring thud that heavy metal can often provide.
