So what is "Batman Returns"? <br /> <br /> It was marketed as an action movie, and many people who saw it seem to think they saw an action movie - but in reality, it's not so much there, and Tim Burton barely seems interested. <br /> <br /> People often align it with the "gray" superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read "The Dark Knight Returns", it seems a bit absurd; Burton have more in common with the day-glo television series of the 1960s (the penguin driving in a giant plastic duck, for heaven's sake). <br /> <br /> Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and this is a little closer to what we see on the screen: the penguin - deformed, malign, with an intricate history and an underground den - is a Gothic threat dressed in the most respectable Dickensian clothes - Udolfo disguised as Uriah Heep. > <br /> What about Catwoman? She could have been resurrected from the dead, but that PVC catsuit is definitely the twentieth century, and her world of alter ego Selina Kyle is all meeting rooms and apartments - she remembers a romantic comedy of the years '30. <br /> <br /> And then click the secretary i smart but oppressed, educated by a lonely millionaire? The resulting complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through the sensibility of Burton's S & M Dungeon. It has more in common with "The Hudsucker Proxy" (including expressionist sets) than with other superhero films. <br /> <br /> Like many romantic comedies, it focuses on the transformation of heroin; not from the ugly duckling to the swan, but from the doormat to the dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she is iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to behave with her whole body. In retrospect, however, his scenes are like Selina to impress; almost every one of them is a little comic jewel, in particular the glimpse of his solitary domestic life. It is a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it is in these scenes that the film really triggers life. Nothing moves me enough as Selina and Bruce Wayne dance under the mistletoe in Siouxsie and the Banshee, a pistol held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their conflicting egos. Forget the easy sentimentality of "Big Fish" or the true emotions of "Edward Scissorhands": this is the most heartfelt scene in all of Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, madness, self-aversion and not a bit of wit, all in a few lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - in particular Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried under those truly repellent long-johns. The villain of the top crust of the comics turns out to be nothing more than a fiction; Burton's Penguin is a wild creature subject to his, Eliza Doolittle-make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It's Burton's most radical and funniest reinvention. Max Schreck of Christopher Walken completes a perfect triptych of villains, slipping between casual charm and empty-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just for me, or does his company logo remember Mickey Mouse? Maybe we should ask the former animator Disney Burton). <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's movie "Batman Begins" - a real action movie - was highly praised as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a pity if this idiosyncratic gem was allowed to be overshadowed.
