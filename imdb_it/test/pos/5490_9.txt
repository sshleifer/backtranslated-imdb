I was looking at the perfect storm and thought of another Wolfgang Peterson movie that is much better - this. Although certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is how a movie should be made. He has a fantastic story with an exceptional cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of a gruesome killer with a grudge against the government that served too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured and Russian secret service is easy on the eye. If you haven't seen it, surely rent it or buy it like I did. Definitely one of the best yellows of the last decade. 9/10
