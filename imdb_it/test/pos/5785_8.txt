A really scary movie. James Kunstler's chatter led me to recently formed Web pages such as Life After the Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum and the data behind the Hubbert's Peak theory. Like this film, LATOC and Kunstler paint a grim picture of dying or dying. I hope they are premature, but in mid-2005 gasoline prices, rising oil prices, the Will You Join Us campaign by Chevron, BP becoming Beyond Petroleum and even T Boone Pickens give credit to the idea that we are at a peak or near oil production. <br /> <br /> After a copious search for limited data, the oil investment banker, Matt Simmons, suggested that the Saudis may no longer be able to increase production in their immense, but old fields. Faced with increased demand (mainly from the United States and China), the Saudis have not responded with higher production, despite previous assurances. The world production declared between 2000 and 2004 indicates that light and sweet crude actually peaked. which means that refining will become more expensive. <br /> <br /> The film seems aimed at baby boomers, but the younger ones, our children, also need to understand the implications of a future impoverished by energy.
