This sad novel is not acceptable because the director decides to interrupt the narration and offer the points of view of each character. So, there are many flashbacks, of re-shooting of the same scene. But it would be an extraordinary moment of the cinema to put all the fragments to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it would be worth it, because it's for me, just one of the best French films ever made! <br /> <br /> He has it all: <br /> <br /> Cast: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such presence and such voices, even for those who do not listen! It is symbolic that they fell in love with this movie! <br /> <br /> Directed: his camera is brilliant, alive, playing with sets or can be mysterious with a long foreground "Ã  la David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Cinematography: light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love! <br /> <br /> A never seen before Paris: it is a timeless Paris more precisely, a mixture of many districts! Huge search here! Looks like Gotham City, modern and ancient at the same time! <br /> <br /> Music: not the big orchestra but in perfect harmony with the frames. And the song by Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Ah, ?? history! As I said, it is a love story, but rather tragic: to say that love can be for nothing, that does not make all people happy or is not guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message is not often said! Love is passion, which is derived from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when you're in love! Because of why ... the incessant wait, the lack of courage, the indecision. <br /> <br /> And when you can calm yourself, destiny, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back, just because you arrive too early or too late, and above all because love means 2 in a world of billions! Many things can happen and so many stories can be written! So what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I experienced some moments like this: in a car with a loved one. His cell phone rings and you know it's his "special friend" that she kisses you goodbye (and not you, even though we're always together). So, you want to get out of this car to leave them together, not to hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't, because an incredible rain has just begun! <br /> <br /> I discovered that this film describes those moments of tragedy like no other!
