The rise of punk music has not been documented on the film and most people tend to focus on events in other cities like London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to preserve a snapshot of Los Angeles in '79 -'81 demonstrating how a lively and diverse music / art community was born that rivaled any other. For some, the bands read like a who's who of the legendary American punk; Black Flag, X, Circle Jerks, Germs, Fear. Purists claim that vital bands were lost (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the film was the cause of an assault by suburban poseur and macho violence. However, the issues touched on in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence continues to be seen and heard in today's cliques / fashions.
