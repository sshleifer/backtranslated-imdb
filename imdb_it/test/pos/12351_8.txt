"Multiply named" and "strangely casted", "One Dark Night" aka "Mausoleum", is one of the first horror video-hires. Original and rather crude, we briefly meet Adam West in this film about telekinesis and headgames for teenagers. Meg Tilly has the courage to spend the night in a crypt in "The Sisters", a hairdressing band with blue satin jackets. The initiation is interrupted by the recently buried body of a psychic slayer called "Raymar". The amazing effects of makeup and fear paint this cool film with style and offer a heart-warming climax.
