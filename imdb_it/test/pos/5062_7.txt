I came out of "Rendition" with a list of flaws along a mile, so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie? It is certainly a film whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> Those parts include a cast of big names, not one of them that offers a memorable performance (Omar Metwally, an unknown relative, is what I will remember); useful if in an indistinct direction; and a script that is both too complicated and too simplistic. Metwally is an American citizen of Egyptian origin who is kidnapped by the United States government's rendition program, otherwise known as the process by which America tortures suspected terrorists to confess information regardless of whether or not it is distant. Reese Witherspoon plays the pregnant wife, who asks the favor of an old college friend (Peter Saarsgard), who works for a senator (Alan Arkin) and helps track down her husband. Meryl Streep is the head of the delivery program; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose consciousness hinders. Meanwhile, an entire parallel affair follows the daughter of a senior Egyptian official allied to the American rendition program and her boyfriend, who is training to become a suicide bomber. <br /> <br /> Ay-yi-yi is a lot of plot to put together in a two-hour movie, and I was going to wash my hands of everything, especially the subplot of Romeo and Juliet Egyptian that didn't seem like anything else that a distraction. But then, near the end of the film, a chronology turn brings together all the threads of the plot in a way that makes you want to re-evaluate everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters, and makes "Rendition" a much more interesting <br /> <br /> Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard all look like high school students who play adults 20 years older than they really are - Gyllenhaal in particular, usually a good actor, seems so bored that you wonder if he is going to gather the energy to free his lines. And the writer should be arrested for having a good actress like Meryl Streep at her disposal and not giving her anything to work with this one-dimensional dragon lady. The film obviously strives for relevance, but instead of dealing with the intricate web of issues surrounding the national security problem, it is predictably charged in the middle of the debate. Are there moments when you think that maybe the film will turn in an interesting direction - and if Witherspoon actually started to doubt his husband's past, for example? And if Metwally had actually been in contact with the terrorists, how do they accuse his interrogators? But no, the film takes the path of least resistance. <br /> <br /> But, as I said in advance, I recommend this movie. I know I've done nothing but list some of his flaws, but he has his head in the right place, and it's fun, or at least as funny as a torture movie and interrogation can be. <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
