I have 2 complete sets from the temporal life, this is my favorite movie of all time. I love all the actors and the actresses .. A beautiful image..Love Patrick Swazy ... This is the film that showed its true talent. But still, he doesn't get credit for the display he preformed! Much credit has been lacking in these films. The way they have interpreted the dry and dusty monologues of the civil war. Building it into one of the greatest love stories of all time, and showing through all the obstacles of life, what true freindship means .. How are the two countries divided. But yet all and all freindships have remained solid, even if war has divided relationships and liberties. But through all this, until the end, the spectator remained and taught us, how the real freind ships can still remain up to the present day! Simply the best..With the wind does not compare to this film.Patrick Swazy at its best. After seeing this movie a hundred thousand times. I became a big Swazy fan ... and I have been following his career since ... he made all his films after making the North and the South!
