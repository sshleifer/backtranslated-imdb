Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three inactive, constantly lamented single geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful piece of character. They were friends in the old days, but now their relationship is tense because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the usurer is the only one who has succeeded in this reconstruction economy, she is the only one of the three who has no children. The other two have a child on whom they depend for income, because none of them works. The complications arise when the children decide to get married (even if not with each other) and leave home. This leads the bitter and grumpy old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and complaining about their rotten children and a reckless friend, the usurer. Meanwhile the usurer is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes. He has no one besides his deaf young woman to keep his company and casual encounters with two ex-lovers of his geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. The three characters are all around their necks in the quicksands of their own bored lives and are too tired to struggle a lot, usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of everything or, at most, throw complaints back and forth for each Other. <br /> <br /> "Late Chrysanthemums" is very slow and in reality it doesn't happen much but Naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do a lot with very little. I haven't seen much of his work but I suspect it's not the best, even if it's very good. The problem, I think, is that it doesn't look like much. But the film is full of good points. Even if he is cynical, he is not so excessive. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem a bit noble in the squalor of their self-made suffering. Although the film is not to be seen at all, it is important as a fragment of the work of a little-known great director (outside his own country), of which a small part is available on video here in the United States.
