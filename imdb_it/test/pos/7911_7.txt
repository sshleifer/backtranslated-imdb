Considered by many as a strangely neglected Chabrol, it seems to me that the reason he was hired for cold shoulder is his sloppy factor. Not as overtly sexy, violent or gory as many films of this period, however, it starts rather surprisingly and although it is becoming more measured it continues to exude a rather unpleasant smell. Mrs. Audran, not the ice maiden here, but a drunken mother, Donald Pleasence makes a cameo as a child molester, David Hemmings has eyes on child sex and the central theme is the relationship between a brother, sister and niece . No, it's not nice at all and Chabrol treats everything as if it were very normal (as it might be in some small French village!) Instead of Ed McBain in New York. If it had been treated in a more sensational way, it would have been a more acceptable but less important film. Here we really have to choose between the probability of various unpleasant options before the final episode. Very watchable
