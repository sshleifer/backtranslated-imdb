Well, I don't know much about anything, but I definitely liked this movie. In short, he was creative, humorous, simple and moving. In other words, it was all that was intended. <br /> <br /> The plot is set around a girl's first love, (as the title suggests) and I should certainly warn you: don't expect anything provocative or provocative terms from the topic here. I mean, it's a cartoon for children. It's really just a simple story, but it's told well, and it holds your attention well. <br /> <br /> In the end: it's short, it's fun, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
