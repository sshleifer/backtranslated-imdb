This version of Gulliver's stories is decidedly bizarre. The production adds a plot (for which he became famous) of Gulliver who returns to his wife and son. In a vision, incredibly long and sometimes unable to keep the attention for everything, but the odd images and the different cast will keep you away. Mary Steenburgen does the best cast job. Danson seems a little out of place with his American accent. The whole affair of the kindergarten often disturbs, but it is still interesting and holds Gulliver's journeys well together. The character of Danson seems really crazy, however ... in my opinion it should have been a little more believable for everyone. Even the confusion is moving from the present to the past. Does anyone else think that the Yahoos are the ugliest things that have ever graced a television screen (or online for it)? Confused, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by good acting, wonderful visual effects and some fun parts. NBC is the first of many Robert Halmi event films, Sr. Watch it for yourself to decide how it goes, but I give it to you * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
