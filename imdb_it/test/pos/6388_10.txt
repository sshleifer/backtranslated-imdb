Super original. Really a great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller really go so well together on the screen. I really hope it comes out soon. I saw this film for the first time in a screening. Because of my age and sex, I was asked to stay for a "speech". We've all got to comment on the film and many people don't seem to like it. I really loved it and I don't know why so many people didn't think it was so beautiful. Go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself! One thing you might want to do if you're going to see this movie is to get in without knowing anything about it. I hadn't heard of it when I went to the screening except that it was called "Camile". It is really worth seeing.
