Barney talks about "IMAGINATION" what you guys don't have if my preschooler never wanted to act like they do on that show, so I'd be worried. What is 2 or 3 years old is actually all about colors and singing. For those of you who say that all they do about Barney is eating junk food and recommending Sesame Street better and what about "cookie monster" that's all he eats but I haven't seen anyone comment on it. I agree that sesame is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun don't be too serious if you don't like your child watching TV and worried about including things you don't believe, so you shouldn't First, I'm supporting them in front of the TV because all this is false, everything is false, the actors are fake, so why don't you take your fake brain and put it into practice and think if you have a problem with a fake TV show for kids, then turn it off and play with them and teach them what you want them to learn not BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or barney, someone who watched all those shows and that was fine.
