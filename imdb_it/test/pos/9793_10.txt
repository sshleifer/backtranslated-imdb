This is a really sad and touching film! Treats of the theme of child abuse. It's really sad, but above all a true story, because it happens every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who tries only to create a home for them. While living with his parents, a man who likes to be called "The King" enters their lives. It affects the younger boy, Bobby, but the two brothers swear not to tell their mother. But in the end she finds out, after Bobby was seriously injured. The end has ruined everything for me, because it's absolutely incredible. But apart from that, I love the movie.
