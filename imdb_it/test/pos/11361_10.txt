I have been trying to track down The Age of Kings for many, many years. My theatrical life was full of actors in this series. At the time, in 1960, I wasn't able to follow him, since I was working at the theater myself, a lot of night work. Now, in retirement, I have plenty of time to have this and keep it for myself. Please, please can't be published on DVD, I wouldn't mind how much it costs. I see that there are others out there who feel the same. What can we do to achieve this? Something so exceptional should not be forgotten. I have to write two more lines. OK, I can do it by saying that I want this series more than anything in the world. Just to be able to watch some of the best actors of our time pronounce the best words of our wonderful Shakespeare. Is not enough! An Uzmen
