I suppose it's a good result to be able to present the public with a real queue on a fragile man; a queue in which the protagonist will spend most of the film on his back, in a bed and totally unable to move. Yet success is in the effectiveness of the film as a dramatic piece; as a reminder of a true story and I imagine it as a discussion of why people should have the right to die if they wish. But the film is not a political declaration and perhaps fortunately it moves away from too many scenes of debate, even if it does include one for the subject. Moreover, this is one of those films in a foreign language that presents its main character as a cripple who can do nothing but talk to the people around him, yet he is nevertheless able to come across something engaging and irresistible. <br /> <br /> So rather than being a topic out and about, the film is more of a sweet but timely dramatic piece about another person wanting something or looking for something; the only difference is that reaching this "goal" would mean the end of someone's life and would be achieved by not going anywhere physically. Javier Bardem interprets real life the Galician Ramón Sampedro, an individual who at a very early age plunged into a clearing of water that was too superficial for such activity. This brought him to bed for the rest of his life and his desire to die is the centerpiece of Chilean film director Alejandro Amenábar's film. We have seen so many movies in our lives where the characters have certain "goals" or goals to reach before the film finishes providing a satisfying audience experience, but the change of pace in The Sea Inside is delicate; it does not involve young, energetic and attractive heroes who go to fight in distant places but a real person after something that means so much to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a strong policy, pro or anti-euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping that Ramón will get what he wants at the end of it all. The film sets its tone very early on with Ramón giving a speech on why he wants to die by looking at family members, immediately introducing the situation and subject to the public watching that he might not know what the film is about. Interestingly, some family members are "opposed" to what they want, which could put every member of the audience who feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes. But the purpose of this set is to tell the public: "No, he is not a man after something that, incidentally, has all his family supporting him to the end". Very easily, the film could have followed a path in which the Sampedro family is against everyone, but some are the idea of ​​anti-Ramón; some are too young to recognize what is happening and others are apparently too upset to have a different opinion than they simply want Ramón to stay a little longer, they love him after all. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a sequel to a story that revolves around a victim of all sorts. Ramón is a quadriplegic and it is from his perspective that we see things. This is something that can detach viewers or make the movie look strange enough as we are presented with a movie from the perspective of a victim rather than an instigator or star of a film that is always causing the cause in the cause unit -effect. But this is not a criticism and it is a credit to the director for the realization of such an approach in the effective way in which it is. The film asks questions; offers a scenario to its audience. If you were in Ramón's position: what would you do, or would you think, will you dream or will you talk? Consequently, the dreams of the lawyer Juila (Rueda) are not as well chosen for the pleasure of the public as they are a minimal window on the fantasies of escape of a man from his situation. <br /> <br /> Julia's study intensifies a little later, when she begins to share certain similarities with Ramón and that is when she starts having strokes that are the result of her illness. This feature seems to be punctual in the progression of their relationship and adds an additional connection ingredient on top of an already engaging friendship. This is because Julia feels physical pain and restriction, not in the sense that she is unable to get up and walk, but I think she understands the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt in advance. While the film is based on a true story and covers the theme of euthanasia, it seems more like a drama on Earth for a man in a situation where he is ready to fight for what he wants, but he must do it verbally. It's nice to see films like The Sea Inside as it not only refers to the story and gives us an idea of ​​it, but as an independent film, it offers an emotional and engaging level.
