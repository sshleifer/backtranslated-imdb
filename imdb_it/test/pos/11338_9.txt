as with many Wong films, many people find them boring and confused. Well, I like them and I like this movie too. I went out and rented it on DVD and watched it 3 times. It is a very subtle film that provides an intoxicating experience. for those who didn't like it ... you just wasted 2 hours of your life .... sin ... muhahahahaha.
