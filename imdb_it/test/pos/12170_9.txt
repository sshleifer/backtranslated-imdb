These three directors started from Good Beginnings. The three stories are extraordinarily well made for independent productions and capture those traumatic "coming out" feelings when you're not really sure it's a good idea. I laughed at those veiled glances around the dressing room in "Pool Days"; I smiled that Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand fans are considered to be gay in "A Friend of Dorothy" (ie browsing the music racks on the CD); and I collapsed on the "jock" in "The Disco Years" whose memory of the sweet sex was now "clouded" by the liqueur. It all seemed so real. I look forward to more offers from this trio of directors.
