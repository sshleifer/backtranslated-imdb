The famous HK CATIII actor, Anthony Wong, is for once (well ... not really once - he was a cop in the movies DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS and a few others ...) not a weird psychopath in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually recognized for his role as a complete wackadoo in these "nasties" of CATIII as THE UNTOLD STORY and THE EBOLA SYNDROME - this time, Wong is on the other side of evil ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays a boy that goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams, at a price. True to his word, the dreams that Wong implied having a crazy ass sex with smoky 'hot schoolgirls', but dreams come with a price that is more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmail his money and business, kill his family and eventually kill Wong himself ... Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on, and in the end he discovers that the murder of his family is the work of the evil sorcerer - but apparently - Wong's brother is a handsome sorcerer magician and, with the help of the witch's abused wife - he overturns the sorcerer's and his schemes. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the most entertaining CATIII movies I've seen in a while. Absent is the gritty and obscure feeling of some of the other CATIII voices like RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, although still shabby in terms of sex and subjects, is more "funny", so some of most serious films of the genre. More similar to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more "carefree" CATIII voice that offers a lot in terms of nudity and a lot of cold blood, without being overly comic. Definitely worth a look, especially for genre enthusiasts. 8/10
