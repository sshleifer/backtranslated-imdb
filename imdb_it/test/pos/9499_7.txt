Gloria Swanson (like Leila Porter) is an understandably bored wife. The workaholic husband Elliott Dexter (like James Denby Porter) "lost his love story" along with his life; also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions and Russian. He can barely remember his own anniversary - in which the caddish Lew Cody (like Schuyler Van Sutphen) participates; the younger man looks at Mrs. Swanson's voluptuous figure, and flirts carelessly. Soon, Swanson is attracted to Mr. Cody. So, Mr. Dexter decides to take it back. Who will win? <br /> <br /> The three principles are fine, with Swanson the most impressive in the key role of the torn woman. Julia Faye wins the support honors as Cody's other interest, "Toodles"; off screen, the director Cecil B. DeMille tried. DeMille's touch is obvious; especially in an imaginary sequence in which Cody promises Swanson ... "Pleasure ?? Wealth ?? Love ??" <br /> <br /> ******* Don't change your husband (1/26/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
