This film is the perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It is a film for children and parents, and is "timeless". I saw this movie before Ocean's Eleven and I have to admit that the OE actors have a lesson in advance, but Klatretøsen's game is much more concrete and moving. Because I say Ocean's Eleven, it is the fact that these two films have many things in common and Klatretøsen is so beautiful! who can stand comparison with the OE. The 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to in Denmark. The different cases of impossible acts are managed in a way that you would not like to believe many young actors (and sometimes not even the "old men"). History ? again he has things in common with Ocean's Eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in Klatretøsen they need to go up to the vault. The part where young people have to take care of Ida's younger brother gives a nice element in the film. Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year old boy with a diaper on his arm :-). <br /> <br /> This film can stand up to comparison with most "grown" movies like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I think it's so good. It is better to see him in a theater, since all the children in the room comment on the film and these comments will remain in your hearts forever :-). <br /> <br /> Greetings Klavs.
