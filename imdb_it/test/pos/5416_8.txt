It is a pity that by collecting a limited rating, perhaps the public that will find the most useful film will probably not see it. <br /> <br /> Imaginary Heroes follows the life of a teenager after the suicide of his brothers. It is obviously not the most original story in the world, but it takes a long time to humanize their parents, the "imaginary heroes" who have failed in the eyes of their children. <br /> <br /> For teenagers, who tend to put responsibility for their failures on their parents but refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own, the film sends a powerful message, which ultimately brings us all our problems that we must take care of, and that we all do our own ways. <br /> <br /> But, unlike other films that tend to solicit the independence of young people, this solves the problems between parents and children, and they become a stronger unit for this. That the firstborn committed suicide is regrettable, but not overlooked later in the film, and the responsibility of all parties for the tragedy is fully explained. <br /> <br /> Although the subject has been treated before, it has not been covered in this way - the film pulls very few punches. Now, because this earned him an R score it is confusing - it is unlikely that you will be able to communicate with a teenager at this time without being realistic, but nevertheless providing realism limits that same audience. <br /> <br /> My junior high school class has been shown this film, two suicides may have been biased. In this case, it appears that the censors have exercised an extremely negative judgment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
