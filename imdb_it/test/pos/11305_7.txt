My 5 year old daughter is very much part of the Barbie movie series. I had mixed feelings about it - not wanting her to buy the entire image of Barbie dolls and recognizing that movies are a marketing ploy to get girls to buy more dolls and earn more money for Mattel. But this morning he asked me to watch this movie with her, and - being a lazy Saturday morning and with not much else to do - I accepted. I don't know if the films were made to help market the dolls, which seem to lose their appeal a little from what I heard or if the dolls are there to market the films (or, more likely, a bit of both ), but whatever the case may be, I have to admit - a little to my surprise, this was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> It's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters (Essentially, Annika ("played" by Barbie) must find a way to build a "light baton" to reverse the wicked spells of the magician Wenlock, who among other things turned his sister into a riding horse and his parents in stone. The animation here was pretty good - not Disney caliber (if you think of Disney as the standard to aspire to) but generally pretty good, and while the film is obviously tailored for girls rather than middle-aged men, I still found there were enough twists to make me wonder how it would turn out. There have been some holes in history, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but once again we must remember the relevant public, who would not really think about these things. This is a decent family film.
