This jingoist trip concerns the usual battle between Holmes and Moriaty, but this time in an attempt to save the British war against the Nazis. Sherlock Holmes (Rathbone) and Watson (Bruce), the detective couple who live in 223 Baker Street, are again standing against their old enemy Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill). The film begins in Switzerland where Holmes saves from the Nazis to an inventor of a bombing, called Dr. Tobel (Post). Back in London, Tobel delivers four parts of the device to several scientists. But Dr. Tobel is kidnapped by Moriarty. Sherlock has to solve his disappearance and some of vital importance. Holmes holds only a clue left by his girlfriend (Kareen Verne), the detective with an extraordinary mechanism decodes it. But dead the scientific body is accumulating but appeared murdered and Moriarty knows the keys. Holmes disguised as a sailor going to investigate, finding Moriarty's refuge. The image is based on the dancing men of Arthur Conan Doyle. This is a Rathbone - Second World War effort with "The Voice of Terror" in which we are asked to believe that the magnificent detective may have lived in this century. Both stories are completely patriotic and flagging films. In fact, in the end there is an advertising purchase of war titles with obvious propaganda. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent Holmes thriller with war scenes and unanswered mysteries Holmes series regulars appear in the film. His nemesis Moriarty, Mistress Hudson, Inspector Lestrade (a funny Dennis Hoey) and, of course, the clumsy Dr. Watson. The performance of Rathbone is splendid, it is the best Holmes of the cinema similar to that of Peter Cushing and Jeremy Brett.Rathbone, the eccentric caprice is of the first order, it is in disarray form, intelligent, unreal and impetuous. He is precisely matched in a battle of wits with Moriarty, his archenemy, a first-level criminal: Lionel Atwill. Nigel Bruce plays Watson with humor, jinx, goofy and mirth. It is the perfect counterpoint to Holmes. Also appear secondaries for a short time as Paul Fix and Whit Bissell. This classic has a black and white nematography atmosphere but available colorized in a horrible version. Adequate musical score suited to the suspense of Frank Skinner. The film is professionally R. William O'Neal, the usual director of the saga and usual in the monsters movies Universal.
