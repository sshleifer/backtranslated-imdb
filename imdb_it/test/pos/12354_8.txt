Sheba Baby is always underestimated most likely because she has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating obtained from a Grier film. all the pg means is that Pam doesn't take off her shirt, she takes off her shirt in every other movie she's been to. it's more exciting than Coffy, more action. it takes off slowly but when it's on the screen the chills start. as the Dolemite of Urville Martin is the hard attempt to take Sheba's father, but she is not doing it. she makes war on a woman against Martin and his band of cronies. the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car I'm still laughing at. I thought it would be stupid due to the evaluation of pg, but I made a mistake replacing sex with violence and in a blaxplotation movie that can only be good!
