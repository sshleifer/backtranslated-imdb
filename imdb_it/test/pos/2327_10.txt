The script of the subtle comedy has no equal in any film in recent years. The characters are interesting, even if a little predictable. The comic timing written in the script is more than enough to compensate for a faded plot. When you are sure you know the ending ... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate a galley scene in particular! Great movie!
