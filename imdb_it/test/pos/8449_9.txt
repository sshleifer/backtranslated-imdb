Great movie of the late 70s. It says a lot about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person, so that the powerful can earn huge profits and ignore the environment and the safety of others. <br /> <br /> Almost 30 years after this film is convincing for the power of some corporate entities that have earned tenfold control over their film release since the release of the films; It shows the need to regulate the public against powerful commercial interests whose main objective is profit. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon is brilliant, while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are equally convincing in their roles. The frivolous 70s in which he is damned for a long time, this film redeems the decade. <br /> <br /> A film that gets better after each viewing.
