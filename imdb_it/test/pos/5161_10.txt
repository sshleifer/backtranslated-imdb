There is no plot. There are no central characters. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In reality, this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film. However, Du Levande by Roy Andersson is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling. It is a touching look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Consisting of a series of cartoons, Roy Andersson offers us an intimate view of what makes us all human. In perfectly framed static shots, added with perfectly tuned but eccentric music, Roy introduces us into a multitude of characters as they embark on their daily existence. Some on the edge of the tragic, others hilarious, we are taken on a Nordic journey like no other. <br /> <br /> It is a journey into the little things that make us human. Instead of an exaggerated storytelling or visual technique, everything is kept to a minimum, so our only focus is on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us what we are; our dreams, our despair. It is through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The faded colors and deadly pale make-up of the characters only seem to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them we are all alive In this film there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel, but leave the cinema with a sense of life. Much more accessible than his previous film, Songs from the Second Floor, Du Levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.
