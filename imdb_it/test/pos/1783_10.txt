After watching the Kieslowski feature film made by this episode of "The Decalogue" years ago, he came back to this viewer while we were watching the ten complete vignettes. As with other films, this is freely based on the fifth commandment, or "Don't kill". <br /> <br /> Kryzsztof Kieslowski, writing with Kryzsztof Piesewicz, took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime in the murder of an innocent to vent his frustrations. This episode has a character of Dostoevsky who kept reminding us of "Crime and Punishment", or at least some of the qualities of the novel have passed to the aimless young man who apparently has no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The story shows the young man wandering the streets of the city without a clear idea of ​​what to do, or where to go. The only tender moment he shows is when he visits the photographer's place to ask for the restoration of an old photo of his sister. Kieslowski leaves to fate the task of framing the driver in a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver, but it is his anger and frustration that get the best from this young man to kill a man who does not deserve to die . The last moments of this criminal are one of the most compelling sequences of any film, past or present. <br /> <br /> The other element of the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal. Nothing can prevent the court from condemning the young to death. The lawyer eventually feels his client has failed and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong. All he is asked by the young man is to recover the image and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> Kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes a surprising film that will remain in the mind of the viewer long after this episode is forgotten.
