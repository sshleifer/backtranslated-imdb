As a recreational golf player with some knowledge of sports history, I was pleased with Disney's sensibility for golf class issues in the early 20th century. The film well described the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from the childhood trauma of being evicted to his inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as a peer in the English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a simple caddy in the eyes of the American crust that makes a mockery of his attempts to rise above his position. <br /> <br /> What I liked most, however, is how this class theme manifests itself in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a drone of the working class who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think they are inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film was not the real site of the historic tournament, the small freedoms taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There is a small Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think Disney. The ending, as in "Miracle", is not a Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.
