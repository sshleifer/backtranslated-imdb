I rented this film because it was a documentary and much appreciated. It is more a study of a bastard son who tries to find out who his biological father was, rather than architecture. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the underlying theme of the film is that we have an eccentric, highly praised, perhaps brilliant architect who has had little consideration for something or anyone outside is the profession. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the film is the destroyed families it has left. His mothers have met more scorned fans than irresponsible women, who can only have negative results on children. <br /> <br /> Having said that, Nathaniel, the film's producer and son of Louis Khan, came across as fairly stable and curious, if not bitter. The people he interviewed were obviously more interested in talking about Louis Khan's buildings than his personal problems, but I find that the mix of themes made the film interesting. <br /> <br /> As for his buildings, I found them as abstract art - strange, impractical, and usually appreciated only by so-called critics.
