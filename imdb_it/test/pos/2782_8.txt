A rather fascinating representation of the European union begins to operate among the younger generations, as the representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where all the international scholarships are studied. At the center of the plot is Xavier (Romain Duris), who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader of the group, helping them manage the owners and other problems. Learn life and love quickly. Duris looks healthy and offers excellent performance. The rest of the cast also plays well. Occasionally they all pass in English when they want to make sure they are communicating, uncertain about all the abilities of their roommates to understand French or Danish or any other language they may be. Cinematography worthy of note including beautiful views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
