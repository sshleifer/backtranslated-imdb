Tomorrow is another day NOT the sequel to Gone with the Wind, but a love story, and a surprisingly attentive and moving one. For an alleged trick relegated to B-minus features like The Devil Thumbs A Ride, Felix Feist proves adept at filling his work with unexpected and inventive details. Steve Cochran leaves the prison after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13, and is now still a hesitant and clumsy pubis acting inside a man's massive structure. Lonesome, visit a building of 10 cents and falls for the taste of Ruth Roman. But the sudden shooting of his bigwig cop boyfriend makes the mismatched couple reach the road, ending up, like the Joads, in a California migrant labor camp. <br /> <br /> Roman's the revelation; in her best known role as Farley Granger's girlfriend in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, she was sick and underutilized. Here he convincingly modulates from the bottle-blond taxi dancer to sacrifice his wife and future mother (and a brunette for the start). Cochran is almost as good, puzzling between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of an underdeveloped male. And the end, though not convincing, is still welcome. Along with They Live By Night and Gun Crazy, Tomorrow Is Another Day shows a redeeming sweetness and warmth that belies his film-noir pedigree.
