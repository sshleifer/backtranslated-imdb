I was "turned on" in this movie by my flight instructor and now I wonder how the hell he was out there for almost five years before I finally found out. If you have a little love for flying, especially an attachment to the plans of World War II, this is a must see, definitely superior to the pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and up there in rivalry with the famous "Battle of Britain" filmed more more than thirty years ago. There are times when you feel like you're a man of the wings, literally dodging the casings of your head as you climb Me 109 or He 111. <br /> <br /> As a historian, this film has deeply impressed me as well , this is the situation borne by tens of thousands of valiant Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who fled their lands in 1939-1940, reached England, fought with the utmost courage for the survival of Western civilization, and were so ruthlessly abandoned by "us" after the war when they were arrested by the communists on their return to their homelands. I was on top of Monte Cassino in Italy and I was moved to tears by the cemetery for the Polish troops who stormed that mountain that the British and the Americans could not take. I also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful of the cities) and studied their history. Their story of abandonment, I believe, should be a lesson for us today, too, regarding our obligations towards gallant allies. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie. If you like flying, look at this. If you are interested in the WWII plane, you will certainly see it. Undoubtedly the most brutal, direct and frighteningly never replicated air combat scenes for the cinema. And yes, even if you are looking for a moving love story, there is also that in a harrowing detail. <br /> <br /> Bill Forstchen Professor of History Co-owner of a replica of the Second World War "warbird" P-51 Mustang "Gloria Ann"
