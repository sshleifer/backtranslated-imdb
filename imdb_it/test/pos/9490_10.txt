just another showcase of zeppelins led at their best and their absolute best rocking. every band member is on their best jimmy page and his JPJ bow and guitar with its thunderous bozo of bass hammering away and Robert singing like nothing's tomorrow. I must say that when we go into the first song where we will play, it is the beginning of something very special. this DVD follows the zeppelin through their Carree from 11 years starting from the 69 in the royal Albert hall then to the Madison Square Garden 73 followed by a much older and mature band in 75 to the earls court and finally a different looking band to their last British show in Knebworth in 79 this DVD is a fantastic zeppelin showcase and if you are not a fan you will be after.
