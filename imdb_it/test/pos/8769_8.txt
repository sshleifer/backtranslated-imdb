The "Saboteur" by Alfred Hitchcock (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock film, "Sabotage" made in 1936 and which has a completely different plot) is not the greatest film of Master of Suspense. It does not have the depth of "Vertigo" (1958) nor the dark atmosphere of "Rebbeca" (1940) and certainly does not have the emotional impact and the acting talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946), but what the dose has is chills, adventure and a climax of biting nails. The two clues, it is true, are rather weak. It's easy to see why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the role of Robert Cummings and Barbara Stanwyck for the role played by Priscilla Lane. Furthermore, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (which were written by Dorothy Parker) are dated badly, and the encounter with the circus company is badly done (the beard on the woman with the beard is clearly false). However, the last half hour is the on-board vision, the culmination at the top of the Stature of Freedom is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "North By Northwest" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the first shot at the Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence. This is not the best film made by Hitch, but it is certainly one of his most amusing.
