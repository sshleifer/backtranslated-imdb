Having grown up in Phenix City as a child, I recognize many locals in the film, so for me it's like a journey into oblivion to review "The Phenix City Story". In fact, my nephew is present in one of the earliest scenes. Uncle Drew is the one with the Hawaiian shirt who pulls out the chair to give the singer / stripper a better look. <br /> <br /> Unless you were there, like Mr. Page and I have both, you might not understand the story it tells. The New York critic defines racist John Patterson, most likely without ever having had a meeting with Mr. Patterson or his father. And what's your point in raising Mr. Patterson's occupation now? It has nothing to do with the movie it is supposed to be reviewing. How the hell can you sit and judge them or this movie when you probably haven't gone beyond the Southern Bronx? It has been my experience that the people who do it simply try to feel morally superior to the people portrayed in the film. According to most of the reports of the time, both Pattersons were basically good and respectable men. Their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in Phenix City. <br /> <br /> By the way, why is it so difficult for those who live outside the south to believe that there are good and good people even in the small towns of Alabama? And why do they think that everyone living in a small southern town is racist? My parents lived there and yet they did not tolerate it in our home. The others do not tolerate it, but the myth that everyone in the South is a racist life through the stubborn ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The film itself is simple and straightforward. It's not the whole story --- Hollywood added some sensationalism when the film was made. Parts of it were absolutely on target. Other parts of it bordered with fairy tales. And if it's the source that someone uses to decide how people are in small southern cities, they need to grasp and understand what many of us do - it's just a movie.
