For those of you still in the dark, I don't want to ruin this Christie, as it's definitely one of his best works, and I stress that you should see it every time you have free time! If any of the adaptations must be seen before (or instead of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the Funeral" for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I wanted to commend the performance of Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer Cora is brutally murdered at the beginning of the film. His portrait of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman is actually on the move, especially when he has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person who travels alone in the "journey of life". And when the killer is revealed in Poirot's typical elimination style, Dolan's reactions to revelation are doing their best: you feel angry about the killer, how you sympathize with Miss Gilchrist ... something uncommon in the tradition by Christie. > <br /> Although there are a couple of discrepancies between the novel and the film adaptation, as usual (the business of the will perhaps makes less sense in the film), the incredibly sumptuous recreation of post-war England, very high acting and directing level, and the preservation (if not intensification) of the mystery of Christie and the intrigue make these discrepancies insignificant. Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for the realization of this masterpiece of the theater of the crime and of the producers that given the green light to Encore!
