This film is simply fantastic ... It starts very slow and boring, but as the film progresses ..... well, the fun keeps coming. The power of the film is perhaps in its subtle reference to a lot (and I mean a lot) of other films. For me the best part was perhaps the scene of Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. As the two actors switch from French to Chinese or whatever the Asian language, it was fantastic. So jokes with names are hilarious but maybe you won't understand them all when you're American (no offense). Overall a great movie
