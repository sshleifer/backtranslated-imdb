I really enjoyed this film for what it is: a little funny movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Chart summaries are available everywhere, so I won't go into details. However, Michael is not dealing with a complex plot. It is based on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> The exhibition of John Travolta as an angel who smokes a cigarette, who loves women, struggles with boats and eats cake is simply perfect. And who doesn't love Sparky? <br /> <br /> See this if you want to have some good laughs and an overall good time. Highly recommended.
