Stepford Children, besides being a great TV movie, shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination. It is rather a statement on how being forced to act within the confines of what is considered "good" behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual. I think this is a film that parents want to keep some semblance of the thought that the packs inside the hearts and minds of young people should watch with their children and discuss what the film is saying. I don't know if this was in any way the intent of this film, but I have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best cinema devices against the desire to have children conforming to an unrealistic and overbearing fiction of what is in the best interest than anyone else from that of the children themselves. I hope to see this movie on DVD one day. I'm at the starting gate ... waiting.
