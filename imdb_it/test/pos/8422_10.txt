This is a very touching film. This is the story of a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) takes his nephew, Parashuram, to the city for eye care. But he learns that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has some rare eye cancer and must undergo an operation and will lose both eyes. The film focuses on the emotions and the tumult that both go through and how they accept the whole thing. The film avoids any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Although the film is in Marathi, language is not a barrier at all. Show that to make a good movie you don't need songs, superstars and the usual masala. Excellent performance. This is the voice of India for the Oscars 2004. I hope you get at least the nomination. Would rate 10/10.
