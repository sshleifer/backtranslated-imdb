The film that gave us John Waters is one of the most entertaining films of all time. Yes, it can be serious but it is full of hysterical moments that no one has done since. The infamous canine scene must be one of the highlights of the cinema. not a film for the simple offense is one of those films where you always see something new. The performance of Divine is worth the reputation. Mink Stole is hysterical. This is the film responsible for the Farrely brothers and the entire Gross-out comic genre. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but think about it. Before these comedies they were very run of the mill and almost identical. After this film, the comedies have become strange and strange, but in a positive sense. I'd give 15 out of 10 if I could.
