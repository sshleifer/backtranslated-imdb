My favorite story comes from "tales from the crypt". Brion Jones was born to play the part of the lumberjack maniac, the madman swinging the Steve Dixon ax. Having seen it before in Tango & Cash I can say that this actor never had the merit he deserved. A jealous husband is offended in his wife by showing an interest in a huge young worker he has just hired. And you know when Dixon discovers there will be hell to pay! The young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) receives an omnipotent heartbeat from Dixon leaving him blind. Now how should a blind woodcutter work? A tribute to black humor if there ever was one! The co-stars do a great job also claiming Ted when Dixon, when he has his first suspicions about his wife wanting another man. Dillo's behavior makes the connection closer between colleagues. Another stated that he became a changed man when he got married. Even if Ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could!
