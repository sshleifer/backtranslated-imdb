Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie - who would he think? I sat through two previous films directed by Estevez - "Wisdom" (with his girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Men at Work" (with his brother Charlie Sheen). They are bad films --- badly played, direct, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but crappy as a director. I turned it on in pure curiosity: it has an exceptional cast and I didn't have anything else to do. Damned if he didn't let me in. <br /> <br /> It's about Estevez returning home from Vietnam permanently marked by what happened there. His parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and his sister (Kimberly Williams) try to reach him but they can't. Something in Vietnam has struck me deeply ... and is about to explode ... <br /> <br /> A little exaggerated but still very good. Much of the material is familiar but the cast is so beautiful that it looks new. Estevez is good, Sheen is terrifying (and Estevezs's real father), Williams is moving and Bates is simply extraordinary - trying to keep the family together. All this leads to a powerful ending that REALLY surprised me. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching. <br /> <br />
