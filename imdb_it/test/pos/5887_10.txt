As "cusp-pre-baby-boom" ... born in 1944, in Los Angeles; thus having the questionable distinction of having been alive while Hitler was still actively involved in his "Last Great Offensive", but even with our President Roosevelt still actively fighting the offensive ... this was one of the most important "first movies" life of my youth. Having had the opportunity to see it in "re-release", several years after the opening in 1946 (a common custom in those years), I replied (even to my very young mind) oh-so many questions I had ... be surrounded by our returning veterinary heroes. Enclosed in all of William Wyler's many fairnesses of subtle "multiple plots" ... intentionally NOT "surrounding", "mini" or "sub" plots ... in all their "colors and shades of intensity" ... I more than anything else I remember, to give me an appearance of "reason" and "rational explanation" of what was happening around me ... in the REAL life. personal experience could be "new" and "different" when watching this classic movie.)
