I remember the events of this film, the ill-fated Donald Crowhurst cruise in 1968, in the Golden Globe with one hand all over the world. I was 13, I lived in England. The previous year, Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis, was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. I remember him above all because we were given free time from school to see his return (on a grainy black and white TV!) And then his knight from the Queen. It has caused an enormous outpouring of patriotic fervor in the United Kingdom. It all seems so strange now. Chichester became a national hero, but had stopped halfway, in Australia, to reassemble his yacht, so the next logical step for boaters was to attempt the journey without stopping. <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that this was a worldwide pre-GPS, when communications on earth were still quite irregular, it didn't matter in the middle of the ocean. Now with GPS receivers that fit on a key ring and calculate a location within a meter of the earth, it's hard to remember a time when you could go to the beach and literally vanish. Like Donald Crowhurst did. <br /> <br /> A number of yachtsmen signed (all men then), including the mysterious man, Crowhurst. Essentially a weekend sailor, Crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous venture, including careers in the British army, the Air Force, and an electronics entrepreneur selling navigational aids. He wanted to do something big with his life, and he saw the first prize of five thousand pounds (well over $ 100,000 in today's money) and the resulting publicity as a means of starting his business. He signed an agreement with a sponsor that turned out to be more waterproof than his boat, and that meant bankruptcy would have him bankrupt, and soon he found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race. Now the British always love the idea of ​​the brave amateur who takes on the "professionals". (Think of Eddie the Eagle losing countless Olympic ski jumping competitions and amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race.) The audience queued to watch him leave, but his boat wasn't ready yet, and even when he started (the last competitor to leave the UK) Crowhurst must have known he didn't seriously have a chance. But too much was riding on him to stop. <br /> <br /> In the wonderful archive footage we see the doubt written on the whole face of his poor wife. Left behind with their 4 children, she is touchingly interviewed throughout the film, along with one of Crowhurst's sons. He was in a no-win situation. If he had tried to stop him, he would have been considered a spoiler, but later on she was broken by the doubt that he could have saved his life by stopping him. Faced with the certain truth that his boat was losing and could never pass through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. Withdrawn from the offshore of Argentina and Brazil, out of the radio contacts, he waited for the leaders to turn around Cape Horn and begin to climb the Atlantic, thinking they could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend to have sailed for everything the world. . He elaborately falsified his records and made 16mm films and audio recordings to support his plan. But while one by one the other competitors gave up, he realized that in fact he would be in 2nd place and his records would be examined. Unable to deal with certain discoveries, his diary suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. Your yacht has been found. It never was. <br /> <br /> This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor, who was in second place and certain of the prize for the fastest journey, when he abruptly left the race, incapable of deal with the clamor and publicity that he knew he would face, and sailed into the vast blue over there, eventually pulling himself up about 10 months later in Tahiti. Having spent seven years working alone at sea, (although on very different ships), I understand the attraction of the ocean well. Stand on the bridge, see the water in every direction towards the horizon, knowing that there are a couple of miles of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull, without easy access to the TV or on the radio (even nowadays on most working ships, you feel quite isolated), you can really escape the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. There are some weighted analyzes on what drives people to try this kind of very long and solitary journey and the effect it has on the human mind. Most people would think that trying to raise 4 children is quite adventurous, but much is made of the need for self-discovery in the difficulties at sea, in the search for oneself. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, the former navy who won the race (and many others) probably knew well who he was before he left, and that's why he was able not only to win the race, but also keeping its health on course. Those who have gone in search of something deep within themselves may not have completely appreciated what they have found. <br /> <br /> The wonderful archival footage of Britain in the late 1960s is almost a sufficient reason to look at it, (did it really sound so ugly? I don't remember it looking so sloppy, but maybe we spotted it out the worst aspects of the past? but overall, it's a beautifully made and compelling film. Highly recommended.
