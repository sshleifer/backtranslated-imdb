MPAA Rating PG-13 <br /> <br /> My Rating: 10 upwards <br /> <br /> My * Rating 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy offers an extraordinary performance like the role of Mr. Neuman. It makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him simultaneously. The story begins as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost a horror movie with twists and turns that Macy struggles with. I could not look away from this film even after it had ended, and I could not believe it ended when he did. A MUST TO SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE CONSIDERED BY A SPOILER <br /> <br /> After watching the film, look at the plot this way: The Neumans are the United States as a whole, and the Meat Loaf Aday's character plays is the people in the United States that is anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> This was a very nice film and I would recommend it to everyone I've seen on the street.
