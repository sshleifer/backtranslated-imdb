Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a terrorist terrorist who literally believes he is not caught. At the opening is the modern serial killer preferred by all, "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell) of the Saw series. Through intelligent planning and influence, Frank is able to arrest Mendoza (Bell). From then on, it is a series of cat and mouse pursuits. Malkovich is an extraordinary and incredibly versatile actor. Showing once again a different role in this film, it amazes me with his ability to exchange his characters for the next film. <br /> <br /> I saw Malkovich playing in Con Air as an insanely intelligent and threatening Cyrus, in mice and men as the lover of the tragically challenged bunny Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very clever terrorist who is very sane but disappointed thinking he can evade his catch. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is not a special me. He's too old to really do a lot of action in movies, so the only thing that can really amaze you is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo interprets Eastwood's love interest in the film and fascinates me with his support, which in reality is more important to me than Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> While this may seem like an action blockbuster, it is relatively slow and plays on anticipation. You have to wait for the accumulation and the ending and in the end will pay. Along the way, you'll be hypnotized by the chemistry of Malkovich and Eastwood and their cat and mouse scenes.
