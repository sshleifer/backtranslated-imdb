Accepted is a 2006 teen movie that plays the character of the Mac and PC ads. The film is about Bartelby .B. Become a boy who refused from all the universities for which he applied, then decides to create his own college and invites all other people who didn't make it, the problem is that hundreds of people sign up for his school. The film is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $ 5.00 in a sale and I've always seen it since. Overall this film is a must for fans of all comedies as it is fun, witty and just a good movie. I consider this film a very honest 78%. GO ACCEPTED MAKE A SEQUEL CHILDREN BUT MAKE SURE IT IS NOT CRAPPED.
