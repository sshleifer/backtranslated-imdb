This is the best role of Kellie Martin underestimated. Based on a true story, it tells the story of Fusia's attempt to save the members of the Diamant family and other Jews he meets over time. One of my favorite movie scenes of all time involves a heroic act of Fusia's little sister. All children should see this scene-role model as these are very few and far between. The film is well written and performed. I am a movie lover and this film values ​​a 10 on Imbd's rating system. It's on my 25 best films of all time and should be released on video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
