Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny film. The first time my mother told me about it, I was 7 and Sant'Anna had just been the saint I had for my Communion. My mother knew it, so she told me to watch it with her. I did it and I've seen it many times since it's really fun. There was Aunt Bea on the Andy Griffith show and Sally's grandfather was the guy who played Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street. So there were a lot of actors we saw on TV. There's a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house, and Sally keeps trying things with Sant'Anna to help raise money so she can keep the house. This includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian who plays his older brother. This is a good and fun movie that I still love.
