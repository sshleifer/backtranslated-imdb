I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and I didn't see the original teleplay until a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel. Okay it's not a million miles away from the SEVEN plot but it's still compelling. Much of my praise has to do with the performance of Ken Stott as DCI Red Metcalfe, a policeman who seems to have led a very unfortunate life and someone who has a terrible secret. It would be easy for Stott to go further, but he has a fairly subtle role. Similarly, the murders are very shocking but - unlike the sequel in which the murders are conducted on the screen in a rather OTT way - there is actually little violence shown. <br /> <br /> My only criticisms are that the red herring was obviously a red herring which meant that I was not absorbed by the shock (and you would probably see the shock of the coming crash, so don't I worry about a spoiler alarm) and that when the real killer was revealed it seemed to be a little far recovered and caused some plot holes to appear in the story. If I remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the killer was revealed, so maybe it would be a good idea not to make MESSIA 3
