My teacher made this film. It's a new beginning. Watch it and you won't notice it's a Romanian movie. The old boring style is over. Now it's something else. A post-revolutionary film. It is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique. You won't even know you're watching, you'll simply be moved over the screen and you'll hear every frame. Don't miss out on the plot but don't ignore the details. They make the difference between this film and the other Romanian films. You will hear music at some point. It is representative for a part of us, but it does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and leave your body free.
