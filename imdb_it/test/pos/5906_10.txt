In a genre by itself, this film has a limited audience and a limited appeal, accompanied by a subtle undertone that permeates the entire production. However, it is a remarkable piece of cinema that is as timeless as a rare work of art. Capturing a moment in Québec rarely seen in movies, the strength of Mon Oncle Antoine lies in the depth of his characters and the richness of the settings. The Québec of Duplessis, parochial and feudal, is brilliantly thrown as a backdrop that could not be realized by anyone except by a layman of the Quebec. <br /> <br /> It would be all too easy to resort to stereotypes, clichés and short-sighted single-minded statements in this story. Yet the director has chosen to skip the forced images and instead, focused on the essence of life in rural Québec at the time. This makes this film exceptional in its authenticity even though it is not pretentious in its presentation. If only the most contemporary filmmaking efforts would do the same, the viewing audience may not have to choose between the over-hyped Hollywood Pablum that passes for the 'Must See' vision. <br /> <br /> Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. It will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived - or visited - Québec. A classic. ********************************************** <br /> <br /> Follow-up: May 10th, 2008 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After reviewing some of the comments, it is worth noting that Mon Oncle Antoine is NOT - and probably was not MEANT to serve as standard Hollywood / American cinema for mass market sales. A history of aging, yes, but much more than the simple memories of adolescence in Quebec in 1940. Spectators looking for pure entertainment at the expense of the complex development of the characters will be very disappointed. Go see fun action / adventure / romance / comedies. Watch Mon Oncle Antoine be attracted to a society rarely seen, but absolutely remarkable, which has been neglected and ignored for too long. <br /> <br /> The Grapes of Wrath is certainly not a cutting-edge thriller, however the story and the characters are what make this American classic a lasting film. Mon oncle Antoine is of the same kind.
